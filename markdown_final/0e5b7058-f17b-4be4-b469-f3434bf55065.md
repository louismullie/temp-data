## Question

What is the mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline LDL receptor biology and PCSK9's role. Then, I should verify how monoclonal antibody inhibitors alter that biology. Next, I will examine inclisiran's intracellular siRNA mechanism. After that, I need to check pharmacodynamic timelines, feedback loops, and the free versus total PCSK9 paradox. Finally, I will review the clinical effect sizes, outcomes data, and how guidelines position these therapies, before summarizing the key takeaways with an eye on emerging modalities like oral PCSK9 binders.

> Let me first confirm the baseline physiology. PCSK9 is synthesized by hepatocytes, secreted into plasma, and binds the epidermal growth factor–like repeat A domain of the LDL receptor on hepatocytes, escorting LDLR to lysosomal degradation rather than allowing its normal recycling to the cell surface; in contrast, when PCSK9 is absent from the complex, LDLR disassociates from LDL in endosomes and can recycle many times to clear circulating LDL-C, making PCSK9 a negative regulator of LDLR availability and function [^116sv8nf] [^112SL6BT] [^115zWko6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should link this physiology to pathology. When PCSK9 activity is unopposed, more LDLR is degraded, fewer receptors are available on hepatocytes, and plasma LDL-C levels rise, increasing atherosclerotic risk; this relationship is genetically validated by gain-of-function PCSK9 variants raising LDL-C and loss-of-function variants lowering LDL-C and risk, which grounds PCSK9 as a causal therapeutic target [^116sv8nf] [^116WFeNV].

> I will now examine monoclonal antibody PCSK9 inhibitors. Wait, let me verify mechanism details: alirocumab and evolocumab are human monoclonal antibodies that circulate and bind extracellular PCSK9 with high affinity, sterically preventing its interaction with LDLR; this preserves LDLR recycling to the hepatocyte surface, increases receptor density, and accelerates LDL-C clearance, typically lowering LDL-C by about 50–65% with additional reductions in ApoB, non-HDL-C, and modest average decreases in Lp(a) across trials [^116sv8nf] [^113AjaNz] [^115bfrfE].

> Next, I should review inclisiran's siRNA mechanism. Inclisiran uses GalNAc-mediated hepatic uptake to engage RNA interference, silencing PCSK9 mRNA translation, thereby reducing intracellular and secreted PCSK9 and secondarily increasing functional LDLR on the hepatocyte surface; the downstream effect mirrors monoclonal antibodies, but with a longer dosing interval of every 6 months after the loading phase, reflecting its intracellular, gene-silencing pharmacology [^113AjaNz] [^113m69R6].

> Hmm, wait a minute — pharmacodynamics can be counterintuitive here, so I should double-check free versus total PCSK9 behavior and timing. Monoclonal antibodies rapidly suppress free (unbound) PCSK9 within 4–8 hours after injection, but total circulating PCSK9 paradoxically increases roughly 10-fold due to delayed clearance of antibody–PCSK9 complexes and a hepatic sensing loop that boosts PCSK9 secretion; I initially assumed delayed clearance was the only driver, but data demonstrate a post-translational increase in secretion as well, which corrects that oversimplification; steady-state LDL-C lowering generally occurs after 2–3 doses and is maintained with dosing every 2–4 weeks [^116sv8nf] [^1166csyh] [^117WGnKb].

> Let me consider the clinical and biomarker consequences next. Across large randomized data, PCSK9 inhibition produces robust LDL-C lowering of about 50–65%, and meta-analyses suggest reductions in myocardial infarction and stroke of approximately 19% and 25%, respectively, without a clear mortality effect over trial durations studied; beyond LDL-C, average decreases in ApoB, non-HDL-C, and Lp(a) are observed, although Lp(a) responses are heterogeneous and likely reflect biology beyond LDLR alone; exploratory data also show improvements in ceramide risk scores, which I should note are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for clinical decisions [^113AjaNz] [^115zthww] [^114NaUqQ] [^1128eua7].

> I should confirm how guidelines interpret and apply this evidence clinically. Current European and Canadian guidelines recommend adding a PCSK9 inhibitor for secondary prevention in very high-risk patients whose LDL-C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statin therapy with ezetimibe, and they extend consideration to select primary prevention groups at very high risk who remain above targets, which operationalizes the mechanistic and outcomes data into practice thresholds and targets [^111tYf2M] [^114sTAgR] [^117MtwZS].

> But wait, what about emerging modalities that might alter delivery paradigms? An oral macrocyclic peptide (MK-0616) has shown high-affinity binding to PCSK9 and substantial suppression of free PCSK9 in early-phase studies, suggesting a potential future oral pathway for extracellular PCSK9 blockade, though this remains investigational and not yet linked to hard outcomes in phase 3 trials [^115Eh6Wb].

> Let me reconsider key caveats to ensure balance. While PCSK9 inhibitors consistently and substantially lower LDL-C with favorable effects on non-HDL metrics, outcome benefits accrue over time similarly to other LDL-lowering modalities and depend on baseline risk and absolute LDL-C reduction; heterogeneity in Lp(a) lowering implies non-LDLR pathways for some isoforms, and the free–total PCSK9 paradox under mAb therapy reflects biology rather than loss of efficacy, so clinicians should focus on LDL-C/ApoB response rather than total PCSK9 levels when monitoring [^114NaUqQ] [^116sv8nf] [^1166csyh].

> In summary, I need to ensure the mechanistic distinctions are crystal clear. Monoclonal antibodies act extracellularly to neutralize circulating PCSK9 and preserve LDLR recycling, whereas inclisiran acts intracellularly to reduce PCSK9 synthesis; both increase functional LDLR density on hepatocytes, accelerate LDL-C clearance, and reduce atherogenic lipoproteins, translating into meaningful reductions in major vascular events in appropriate high-risk populations as reflected in guideline recommendations [^116sv8nf] [^113AjaNz] [^111tYf2M].

PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that **block PCSK9 from binding LDL receptors** [^116sv8nf], preventing their lysosomal degradation and **increasing LDL receptor recycling** to the hepatocyte surface. This enhances hepatic clearance of LDL cholesterol, **lowering plasma LDL-C by 50–70%** [^116WFeNV] and reducing cardiovascular events [^113AjaNz] [^115zthww]. They are indicated for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113JgBdM] who do not reach LDL-C targets on maximally tolerated statins and ezetimibe [^111tYf2M], or who are statin-intolerant [^113TKBKu].

---

## Physiological role of PCSK9

PCSK9 is a serine protease produced predominantly by hepatocytes [^112SL6BT]. By binding LDL receptors on hepatocytes, it targets them for lysosomal degradation, reduces receptor recycling [^115zWko6], lowers hepatic LDL clearance, and raises plasma LDL-C [^112SL6BT]. PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation is a **key driver of higher LDL-C** [^111UGSZU].

---

## Mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors

PCSK9 inhibitors are human monoclonal antibodies (e.g. alirocumab, evolocumab) that bind circulating PCSK9 and prevent its interaction with LDL receptors [^116sv8nf]. This preserves LDL receptors, promotes their recycling to the hepatocyte surface [^116sv8nf], and enhances LDL clearance from plasma, producing substantial LDL-C reductions [^116eha35]. The central pharmacologic effect is **increased LDLR recycling** [^113m69R6].

---

## Molecular interactions involved

The key interaction is PCSK9 binding to the epidermal growth factor–like repeat A (EGF-A) domain of the LDL receptor, which targets the receptor for lysosomal degradation [^113m69R6] [^112oUrua]. PCSK9 inhibitors block this binding, preserving LDL receptors and increasing their availability on the hepatocyte surface [^112oUrua]. Blocking **PCSK9–LDLR binding** prevents receptor loss.

---

## Clinical efficacy and lipid-lowering effects

PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL-C by approximately 50–70% in clinical trials, even on background statin therapy [^116eha35] [^113AjaNz]. They also lower apolipoprotein B (apoB), non-HDL cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], further improving the lipid profile [^114NaUqQ]. LDL-C reduction of **50–70%** is consistently observed [^115bfrfE].

---

## Clinical indications and patient populations

PCSK9 inhibitors are indicated for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) [^113Ybso6] who fail to achieve LDL-C targets on maximally tolerated statins and ezetimibe [^111tYf2M] or are statin-intolerant [^114mdBNZ]. They are also recommended for very high-risk patients [^111tYf2M] with persistently elevated LDL-C despite optimal therapy [^113Ybso6]. Patients who are **statin-intolerant or high-risk** are prime candidates.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

PCSK9 inhibitors have a favorable safety profile, with few adverse effects in clinical trials; common events include injection-site reactions, nasopharyngitis, and influenza-like symptoms [^116eha35]. No significant increase in diabetes, neurocognitive events, or cancer has been observed [^116RvGXp] [^113AjaNz]. The **favorable safety profile** supports broad use in appropriate patients.

---

## Comparison with other lipid-lowering therapies

Compared with statins and ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors achieve greater LDL-C reductions and additional cardiovascular risk reduction, particularly in high-risk patients [^116eha35] [^115zthww] [^113AjaNz]. They are especially useful for patients who cannot tolerate statins or who require further LDL-C lowering beyond what statins and ezetimibe can achieve [^111tYf2M] [^113AjaNz]. Greater **LDL-C reduction** than statins/ezetimibe is a key advantage.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^111tYf2M] and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) [^114mdBNZ] recommend PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in very high-risk patients who do not achieve LDL-C targets on maximally tolerated statins and ezetimibe. They also endorse use for primary prevention in very high-risk patients with persistently elevated LDL-C despite optimal therapy [^114sTAgR]. Use is **guideline-supported** in high-risk patients not at goal.

---

PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that prevent PCSK9 from binding LDL receptors [^116sv8nf], increasing receptor recycling and hepatic LDL clearance. This **lowers LDL-C by 50–70%** [^116eha35] and reduces cardiovascular events [^115zthww], with a favorable safety profile [^116eha35] and strong guideline support for high-risk or statin-intolerant patients [^111tYf2M] [^113Ybso6].

Regarding medical management for familial hypercholesterolemia, particularly concerning PCSK9 inhibitors, the CCS 2021 guidelines recommend initiating a PCSK9 inhibitor (alirocumab or evolocumab) to lower LDL-C levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia without clinical ASCVD. This is advised if LDL-C remains above the target (LDL-C ≥ 2.5 mmol/L or < 50% reduction from baseline, or ApoB ≥ 0.85 mg/dL, or non-HDL-C ≥ 3.2 mmol/L) despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without ezetimibe therapy.

### Praluent [^116sv8nf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Alirocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors (LDLR) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Alirocumab reduced free PCSK9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Following a single subcutaneous administration of alirocumab 75 or 150 mg, maximal suppression of free PCSK9 occurred within 4 to 8 hours. Free PCSK9 concentrations returned to baseline when alirocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation.

- **Absorption**: After subcutaneous administration of 75 mg to 300 mg alirocumab, median times to maximum serum concentrations (tmax) were 3–7 days. The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab after single subcutaneous administration of 75 mg into the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh were similar. The absolute bioavailability of alirocumab after subcutaneous administration was about 85% as determined by population pharmacokinetics analysis. A slightly greater than dose-proportional increase was observed, with a 2.1-fold to 2.7-fold increase in total alirocumab concentrations for a 2-fold increase in dose from 75 mg every 2 weeks to 150 mg every 2 weeks. Monthly dose-normalized exposure with 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment was similar to that of 150 mg every 2 weeks. Steady state was reached after 2 to 3 doses with an accumulation ratio.

### PCSK9 inhibitors for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular diseases: A Bayesian network meta-analysis [^113AjaNz]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Low credibility.

PCSK9 binds to LDL receptors on the hepatocyte surface and induces degradation after internalization, resulting in reduced uptake of LDL-C by the liver and increased levels of circulating LDL-C. PCSK9 inhibitors exert lipid-lowering effects by decreasing plasma PCSK9, ultimately leading to a reduction in major cardiovascular events. These agents not only effectively decrease levels of LDL-C but also reduce apolipoprotein B (apoB), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and non-HDL-C levels. The lipid-lowering potential beyond LDL-C was observed in both PCSK9 monoclonal antibody and inclisiran. Furthermore, more individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with and without atherogenic dyslipidemia, achieve the recommended LDL-C targets compared to those without T2DM.

- **Mechanism and clinical implications**: Although both PCSK9 monoclonal antibody and inclisiran upregulate LDL receptors and thereby reduce LDL-C concentrations by diminishing active PCSK9, their mechanisms of action are different. Monoclonal antibodies function extracellularly to bind and block circulating PCSK9 protein, still allowing PCSK9 to be produced intracellularly. Inclisiran works intracellularly by preventing the translation of PCSK9 mRNA, thereby decreasing both intracellular and plasma PCSK9 levels. A potential advantage of treatment with inclisiran is the longer duration of its lipid-lowering effect. As a result, the frequency of administration is less compared to PCSK9 mAbs. Specifically, inclisiran requires subcutaneous injections once every six months.

### Orally bioavailable macrocyclic peptide that inhibits binding of PCSK9 to the low density lipoprotein receptor [^115Eh6Wb]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Inhibition of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9)-low density lipoprotein receptor interaction with injectable monoclonal antibodies or small interfering RNA lowers plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, but despite nearly two decades of effort, an oral inhibitor of PCSK9 is not available. Macrocyclic peptides represent a novel approach to target proteins traditionally considered intractable to small-molecule drug design.

- **Methods**: Novel mRNA display screening technology was used to identify lead chemical matter. This was then optimized by applying structure-based drug design enabled by novel synthetic chemistry to identify a macrocyclic peptide (MK-0616) with exquisite potency and selectivity for PCSK9. Following the completion of nonclinical safety studies, MK-0616 was administered to healthy adult participants in a single rising-dose Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. In a multiple-dose trial in participants taking statins, MK-0616 was administered once daily for 14 days to characterize the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol).

- **Results**: MK-0616 displayed high affinity (Kᵢ = 5pM) for PCSK9 in vitro and demonstrated sufficient safety and oral bioavailability preclinically to enable advancement into the clinic. In Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy adults, single oral doses of MK-0616 were associated with > 93% geometric mean reduction (95% CI, 84–103) of free, unbound plasma PCSK9; in participants on statin therapy, multiple oral doses resulted in significant reductions.

### Hyperlipidemia: Management with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors [^116Z5FYt]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Hyperlipidemia is an independent and potentially reversible risk factor for coronary artery disease. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, collectively known as statins, have been the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy. Their availability, ease of administration, low cost, and strong evidence behind safety and efficacy make them one of the most widely prescribed lipid-lowering agents. However, some patients may be intolerant to statins, and a few others suffer from very high serum levels of cholesterol, where statin therapy alone or in combination with other cholesterol-lowering agents is insufficient in reducing serum lipid levels to achieve desired levels.

In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new family of lipid-lowering agents, collectively known as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. PCSK9 inhibitors are biologically active molecules that decrease serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with statin therapy alone. They serve as an alternative to statins for patients who are intolerant to statins or as supplemental therapy in those patients for whom lower levels in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are not achieved by statins alone. This article discusses PCSK9 inhibitors, their mechanism of action, indications, efficacy, safety, costs, and limitations.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors serve as a valuable addition to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering agents and have promising potential. By inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 enzyme, this novel molecule leads to increased low-density lipoprotein receptor density and decreased circulation of low-density lipoprotein. The fact that the agent is a monoclonal antibody has led to limited drug interactions and minimized adverse drug events. It is critical for all providers to have a basic understanding of these novel therapies with their introduction and use for treatment.

### PCSK9 inhibitor access barriers-issues and recommendations: Improving the access process for patients, clinicians and payers [^112SL6BT]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

PCSK9 is produced as a zymogen (proPCSK9) by hepatocytes and undergoes autocatalytic cleavage to facilitate its secretion and proper folding. In the extracellular milieu, mature PCSK9 has no proteolytic activity; its active site is blocked by its previously cleaved prosegment. Therefore, it serves simply as a binding protein. On hepatocytes, PCSK9 binds to a complex comprising the LDLR and an LDL particle. This binding occurs between PCSK9 and the epidermal growth factor–like repeat A domain of the LDLR. This polymolecular assembly is incorporated into clathrin-coated endosomal vesicles that are brought into the cytosol. Within the cytosol, PCSK9 chaperones the LDLR complex into the lysosome for hydrolytic destruction, thereby reducing the recycling of LDLR to the hepatocyte cell surface and reducing LDL particle clearance capacity. When PCSK9 is not bound to the LDLR-LDL complex, lysosomal enzymes catabolize the LDL particle, but the LDLR is recycled back to the hepatocyte cell surface to initiate further LDL particle binding, uptake, and degradation. LDLR recycling can occur up to 150 times. This model neatly explains why gain-of-function and loss-of-function PCSK9 mutations would be etiologic for elevations and reductions in serum levels of LDL-C, respectively. PCSK9 also regulates the expression of other lipoprotein cell surface receptors, including the LDL receptor-related protein-1, the very low-density lipoprotein receptor, and the apolipoprotein E receptor 2. The clinical significance of these latter interactions is yet to be established.

### Relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) lowering in response to PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab [^114NaUqQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Large gaps remain in our understanding of PCSK9's physiologic function and, specifically, how antagonism of PCSK9 relates to LDL-C and Lp(a) reduction. We found some degree of discordant responses between these two parameters when the cutoffs for response to therapy were LDL-C reduction > 35% and Lp(a) reduction > 10%; this may provide clues to the fundamental biology of Lp(a) catabolism, an issue that has been unresolved since the discovery of this unique lipoprotein in 1963. These findings may also suggest that PCSK9 inhibition activates alternative mechanisms and/or additional factors beyond the simple LDLR that ultimately determine the degree to which Lp(a) levels are reduced.

Indeed, our study shows that although Lp(a) does act like an LDL subtype in many patients, it acts very differently in a substantial proportion of participants, suggesting that the LDLR route is not used by all Lp(a) isoforms. Future work will need to uncover the pathways by which PCSK9 inhibition enhances Lp(a) clearance and/or decreases its production. Our results have potential translational value in that they suggest apo(a) isoforms may determine whether Lp(a) uses the LDLR pathway for its plasma clearance, an easily testable hypothesis that will serve as a pretest to identify patients likely to respond to PCSK9 inhibitor therapy with significant Lp(a) lowering.

### Increasing the adoption and diffusion of a novel pharmacological therapy that is both mortality reducing and cost-effective [^1174TDBq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Although angiotensin‐receptor/neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) are similar to PCSK9 inhibitors in that they are novel and expensive, they differ in cost-effectiveness. Sacubitril/valsartan, unlike PCSK9 inhibitors, was deemed cost-effective (though it narrowly failed a test of net budget impact) by the California Technology Assessment Forum, based on an Institute for Clinical and Economic Review report. For patients with systolic dysfunction and class II to IV heart failure, sacubitril/valsartan reduces the risk of death and is cost-effective. In that context, heart failure guidelines list the replacement of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin‐receptor blockers with ARNIs as a class 1 indication.

Yet, despite all this, adoption and diffusion of ARNI for patients with systolic dysfunction and heart failure have been slow. Improving the use of ARNI for these patients is a critical public health goal, and it can save lives. Furthermore, as a cost-effective medication, ARNI does not pose as many of the problematic societal and budgetary considerations as PCSK9 inhibitors. As such, understanding how to broaden access to ARNI is critical.

Into that important space, we now have new, innovative work by Luo et al. that appears in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA). The methods in this analysis are clever for several reasons. First, it utilizes a clinical quality registry (Get With The Guidelines–Heart Failure) to address an important public health issue related to drug policy and access.

### Prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke with PCSK9 inhibitors treatment: a metanalysis of recent randomized clinical trials [^115zthww]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors induce significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and major cardiovascular events. Clinical trials may have been underpowered to specifically test the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on myocardial infarction and stroke, as they primarily analyzed a combined endpoint.

We performed a meta-analysis using available studies involving PCSK9 inhibitors and event rate adjudication to assess treatment effects on myocardial infarction and stroke.

We included 81,700 patients, of whom 41,979 were treated with PCSK9 inhibitors: 17,244 with evolocumab, 13,720 with bococizumab, and 11,015 with alirocumab. A total of 1,319 myocardial infarction cases were registered in the treatment group versus 1,608 in controls, resulting in a 19.0% reduction associated with PCSK9 treatment (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.76–0.87). Similarly, PCSK9 inhibitors resulted in a 25% reduction in stroke (RR: 0.75, 95% CI 0.65–0.85) when all studies were analyzed together, and no statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in the analysis restricted to endpoint-based clinical trials. However, PCSK9 inhibitors had no effect on mortality (RR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.86–1.04).

In conclusion, PCSK9 inhibitors reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 19% and stroke by 25%.

### Hepatic sensing loop regulates PCSK9 secretion in response to inhibitory antibodies [^1166csyh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9i) lower LDL-C by up to 60% and increase plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels by 10-fold.

- **Objectives**: The authors studied the reasons behind the robust increase in plasma PCSK9 levels by testing the hypothesis that mechanisms beyond clearance via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) contribute to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.

- **Methods**: In clinical cohorts, animal models, and cell-based studies, we measured kinetic changes in PCSK9 production and clearance in response to PCSK9i.

- **Results**: In a patient cohort receiving PCSK9i therapy, plasma PCSK9 levels rose 11-fold during the first 3 months and then plateaued for 15 months. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, a single injection of PCSK9i increased plasma PCSK9 levels within 12 hours; the rise continued for 9 days until it plateaued at 10-fold above baseline. We recapitulated the rapid rise in PCSK9 levels in a mouse model, but only in the presence of LDLR. In vivo turnover and in vitro pulse-chase studies identified two mechanisms contributing to the rapid increase in plasma PCSK9 levels in response to PCSK9i: 1) the expected delayed clearance of the antibody-bound PCSK9; and 2) the unexpected post-translational increase in PCSK9 secretion.

- **Conclusions**: PCSK9 re-entry to the liver via LDLR triggers a sensing loop regulating PCSK9 secretion. PCSK9i therapy enhances the secretion of PCSK9, an effect that contributes to the increased plasma PCSK9 levels in treated subjects.

### Cyclase-associated protein 1 is a binding partner of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 and is required for the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 [^115x2P2H]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The study explores the role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) in the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR), identifying it as a key target in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Despite its importance, the specific mechanism by which PCSK9 induces the lysosomal degradation of LDLR remains unclear. Adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) was recently identified as structurally similar to the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of PCSK9. This research investigates CAP1's involvement in PCSK9-mediated lysosomal LDLR degradation and its impact on plasma LDL cholesterol levels.

- **Methods and results**: The direct interaction between PCSK9 and CAP1 was demonstrated using immunoprecipitation assay, far-western blot, biomolecular fluorescence complementation, and surface plasmon resonance assay. Detailed mapping showed that PCSK9's CRD binds to the Src homology 3 binding domain (SH3BD) of CAP1. Two human PCSK9 polymorphisms (S668R and G670E in CRD) resulted in defective CAP1 interaction. Silencing CAP1 using siRNA reduced PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation in vitro. CAP1 knock-out mice exhibited higher LDLR and lower LDL-C protein levels in the liver and plasma respectively compared to control mice. Further analysis revealed that PCSK9-induced LDLR endocytosis and degradation were caveolin-dependent, not clathrin-dependent.

### Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies for acute coronary syndrome: A narrative review [^115VbTmK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) are an emerging therapy for dyslipidemia. Acute coronary events induce a dynamic increase of PCSK9 levels that may play a role in plaque vulnerability of both culprit and nonculprit coronary vessels. Growing evidence highlights a potential key role of PCSK9 antibodies in managing acute coronary syndrome.

This review describes the influence of PCSK9 antibodies on plaque composition and instability, as well as the pharmacokinetic profile and the potential anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic mechanisms associated with PCSK9 inhibition that may confer benefits during the early phase of acute coronary syndrome. The authors posit a rationale for the use of PCSK9 antibodies in patients with acute coronary syndrome and highlight the need for further investigation in this area.

### Just price for PCSK9 inhibitors: No less, no more [^112mARaV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In summary, if we truly aspire to create a sustainable health system, there must be room for those who raise uncomfortable questions about what we will get for what we pay? For this, Ko et al. deserve our deepest appreciation for providing insights on existing gaps between the price and value derived from PCSK9 inhibitors. If these studies can successfully facilitate conversations among stakeholders to agree on the just price for a 1‐2% absolute CVD risk reduction — no less, no more — I am confident that the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors will no longer be the top story in 2019.

### Just price for PCSK9 inhibitors: No less, no more [^116eh8tn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor scientific translation from bench to bedside over the past decade has been highlighted as one of the top success stories in cardiovascular disease (CVD) management in recent years. Despite this newer therapeutic class resulting in proven improvement in CVD outcomes, its widespread adoption has faced an uphill battle. For example, leveraging large national insurance data sets, recent studies have shown that approximately half of those prescribed eventually get preapproved. For both patients and physicians, these barriers are disheartening. What is the rationale behind the existing rigid preauthorization process and such high rejection rates? According to many, the reason is clear: these drugs are relatively expensive for a drug with such a potentially large market.

In the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial, although the 2% absolute and 15% relative CVD risk reduction over a 2.2-year period is widely celebrated, these benefits are not miraculous. The gains on top of the standard of care depend on the perspective, appearing substantial to some and modest to others. For those in the business of allocating healthcare resources, based on crude estimates, even assuming half of the suggested prices, a $700,000 price tag to prevent one cardiovascular event remains controversial.

### Molecular basis of PCSK9 function [^115zWko6]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

The LDL receptor (LDLr) inhibitor, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin type 9 (PCSK9), has emerged as a genetically validated target for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels. In 2007, PCSK9 was found to act as a chaperone that binds the LDLr, thereby targeting it for lysosomal degradation. The enzymatic activity of PCSK9 is not involved in this process but rather permits proper intramolecular processing of PCSK9. This was demonstrated by both site-directed mutagenesis and independent reports of the PCSK9 crystal structure. These reports also elucidated the mode of action of several naturally occurring mutants of PCSK9 associated with hypercholesterolemia or hypocholesterolemia. The present review summarizes studies published or in print before May 2008, investigating the functional significance of PCSK9 and its promising aspects as a prognostic tool and a drug target.

### Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition and the future of lipid lowering therapy [^115bfrfE]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction with statins is the cornerstone of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. The LDL-C lowering non-statin therapy, ezetimibe, also modestly reduces CVD risk when added to statin therapy. There remains a clinical need for additional LDL-C lowering agents to reduce CVD risk in patients with genetic hypercholesterolemia, statin intolerance, or those who are at high risk due to clinical CVD or diabetes.

In clinical trials, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition using monoclonal antibodies has demonstrated robust LDL-C lowering efficacy of 50–65% and a favorable safety profile. These agents represent a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing the unmet needs for additional CVD risk reduction. Regulatory approval for PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies may occur in the near future, and additional agents for PCSK9 inhibition are under development.

This review focuses on the mechanism of LDL-C reduction using PCSK9 inhibition and the phase I to III clinical trials of PCSK9 inhibitors. Results of the ongoing phase III CVD outcome trials are eagerly awaited.

### Pcsk9 induces CD36 degradation and affects long-chain fatty acid uptake and triglyceride metabolism in adipocytes and in mouse liver [^114YCrNC]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) promotes the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor, thereby elevating plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary heart disease. Thus, the use of PCSK9 inhibitors holds great promise to prevent heart disease. Previous work found that PCSK9 is involved in triglyceride metabolism, independently of its action on the low-density lipoprotein receptor, and that other yet unidentified receptors could mediate this effect. Therefore, we assessed whether PCSK9 enhances the degradation of CD36, a major receptor involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids and triglyceride storage.

- **Approach and results**: Overexpressed or recombinant PCSK9 induced CD36 degradation in cell lines and primary adipocytes and reduced the uptake of the palmitate analog Bodipy FL C16 and oxidized low-density lipoprotein in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and hepatic HepG2 cells, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance, coimmunoprecipitation, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, and protein degradation pathway inhibitors revealed that PCSK9 directly interacts with CD36 and targets the receptor to lysosomes through a mechanism involving the proteasome. Importantly, the level of CD36 protein increased by more than threefold upon small interfering RNA knockdown of endogenous PCSK9 in hepatic cells and similarly increased in the liver and visceral adipose tissue of Pcsk9(-/-) mice. In Pcsk9(-/-) mice, increased hepatic CD36 correlated with an amplified uptake of fatty acid and accumulation of triglycerides and lipid droplets.

Regarding medical management for familial hypercholesterolemia, more specifically with respect to PCSK9 inhibitors, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend initiating or adding a PCSK9 inhibitor in very high-risk patients with familial hypercholesterolemia if the goal is not achieved with a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe.

### Are PCSK9 inhibitors the next breakthrough in the cardiovascular field [^116WFeNV]? Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, escorting it to its destruction in the lysosome and thereby preventing the recirculation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor to the hepatocyte cell surface. Both gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9, which cause marked increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration and premature atherosclerosis, and loss-of-function mutations, which cause modest LDL-C reductions with low rates of coronary heart disease, have been described. Several monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have achieved LDL-C reductions of 50% to 70% across various patient populations and background lipid therapies. Phase 2/3 trials have demonstrated good tolerability without clear drug-related toxicity, although the number and duration of patients treated at the time of writing are modest. Currently, four phase 3 trials involving over 70,000 patients are testing whether these drugs reduce cardiovascular events. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing the existing data to determine whether these agents could be made available prior to the completion of these cardiovascular endpoint trials, expected in 2018.

### Cyclase-associated protein 1 is a binding partner of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 and is required for the degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 [^116SjVwX]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) determines plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by regulating internalization and lysosomal degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. Inhibitors of PCSK9 have reduced plasma LDL-C levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. However, the precise mechanism by which PCSK9 determines the fate of LDLR has not been elucidated.

The LDLR enters cells while bound to LDL-C, dissociates from LDL-C in endosomes, and is recycled to the cell surface, whereas LDL-C is directed to lysosomes for degradation. In contrast, if bound to PCSK9, LDLR is internalized and escorted to lysosomes for degradation through an unknown mechanism. Although PCSK9 is a proteinase K-like serine protease, after autocatalytic cleavage, the terminal portion of the pro-domain (amino acids 32–152) covers the catalytic triad, preventing further proteolytic activity.

The catalytic domain of PCSK9 binds LDLR, and another part of PCSK9, i.e. the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD), is suspected to interact with a putative membrane-bound protein that escorts the protein complex towards lysosomal degradation. Recently, PCSK9-CRD has been reported to have structural homology with the human resistin C-terminal domain homotrimer, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine inducing atherosclerosis.

In our previous paper, we firstly reported that adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), which is a conserved protein known as a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase complex…

### Application of PCSK9 inhibitors in practice [^112tufT8]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

PCSK9i (protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors) are set to revolutionize the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the management of atherosclerotic risk, but numerous reports have detailed unprecedented barriers to access for these drugs. To overcome these challenges, our group created a model to facilitate the provision of this new therapy for patients who qualify according to Food and Drug Administration criteria.

This report details the real-world follow-up experience of PCSK9i use in a large patient cohort structured to ensure rigor in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The 271 patients approved and actively followed in our PCSK9i clinic between July 2015 and August 2018 represent a 97% approval rate from insurance, with 28% of prescriptions requiring at least one appeal. Over 50% of patients were statin intolerant. On average, there was a median lapse of 15 days between the initial visit and insurance approval.

PCSK9i therapy was affordable for most patients, with an average monthly out-of-pocket expense of $58.05 (median $0). Only 2.3% of patients were unable to initiate or continue therapy because of cost. Reductions from baseline in LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and Lp(a) (lipoprotein [a]) were comparable to published reports, with median reductions of 60% and 23% at 1 year, respectively.

PCSK9i therapy was well-tolerated overall, though 9% of patients reported adverse events, and 5% of patients discontinued due mostly to musculoskeletal and flu-like symptoms. Our practice model demonstrates that PCSK9i therapy can be accessed easily and effectively.

### 2021 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults [^114mdBNZ]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, particularly in relation to PCSK9 inhibitors, the 2021 CCS guidelines recommend intensifying lipid-lowering therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor (evolocumab or alirocumab), with or without the additional use of ezetimibe, for secondary prevention in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) who show the largest benefit from PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. This recommendation is applicable if LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L) while the patient is receiving the maximally tolerated statin dose.

### Plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 levels and the risk of first cardiovascular events [^112vXHAX]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted protein that enhances the degradation of the LDL receptor. Although agents that inhibit PCSK9 significantly reduce atherogenic lipoproteins and show great promise for event reduction, it is unknown if plasma PCSK9 levels predict incident cardiovascular events.

In a nested case-control evaluation conducted in a prospective cohort of over 28,000 initially healthy American women, researchers measured plasma concentrations of PCSK9 at baseline among 358 participants who subsequently developed major cardiovascular events (cases) and among 358 age, smoking, and hormone replacement therapy matched participants who remained free of disease during 17 years of follow-up (controls).

PCSK9 level was not significantly related to smoking status, hypertension, obesity, or a family history of premature cardiovascular disease, but it was positively associated with apolipoprotein B-100 (r = 0.20, P < 0.001) and triglycerides (r = 0.13, P = 0.004). No associations were observed between PCSK9 and apo A1, HDLC, lipoprotein(a), or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Despite a modest positive association with atherogenic lipids, baseline levels of PCSK9 did not predict the first cardiovascular events. The odds ratios (ORs) for future vascular events for the lowest (referent) to highest baseline quartiles of PCSK9 were 1.0, 0.94, 0.98, and 1.15 (P-trend = 0.53). In contrast, the corresponding ORs for baseline apo B levels were 1.0, 1.14, 1.34, and 1.94 (P-trend = 0.002).

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^111uxg9M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In a sample of 126,419 privately insured patients with a history of ASCVD and on statin therapy, less than 1% of patients were started on a PCSK9 inhibitor in the four years after the introduction of the first US Food and Drug Administration–approved agents in this therapeutic class. Over this time period, the proportion of potentially eligible patients with ASCVD on statin therapy who were initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor modestly increased. Before 2018, the proportion of these patients started on a PCSK9 inhibitor was approximately 1%, and from 2018 through mid-2019, the proportion of patients started on PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was approximately 2%. This was despite clinical trials showing improvement in cardiovascular outcomes, guidelines recommending PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with ASCVD at high cardiovascular risk, and price reductions in these drugs over this time period. The low use of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with ASCVD was not substantially different among the different patient groups with ASCVD identified over the study period. The most inclusive group, patients with ASCVD on a statin, and the most stringent group, patients with ASCVD who were highly adherent to a high-intensity statin for a year with suboptimal LDL-C levels, both had less than 1% PCSK9 inhibitor initiation. Additionally, we found that after factoring in demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics, patients with MACEs in the past year were less likely to be initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor, suggesting the highest-risk patients may not be receiving PCSK9 inhibitor therapy.

### Pcsk9: From basic science discoveries to clinical trials [^114VHmfA]. Circulation Research (2018). Low credibility.

Unknown 15 years ago, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is now common parlance among scientists and clinicians interested in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. What makes this story so special is not its recent discovery, nor the fact that it uncovered previously unknown biology, but rather that these important scientific insights have been translated into an effective medical therapy in record time. Indeed, the translation of this discovery to novel therapeutics serves as one of the best examples of how genetic insights can be leveraged into intelligent target drug discovery. The PCSK9 saga is unfolding quickly but is far from complete. Here, we review major scientific understandings as they relate to the role of PCSK9 in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and the impact that therapies designed to inhibit its action are having in the clinical setting.

### The multifaceted biology of PCSK9 [^113y9PDf]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The level of plasma cholesterol is influenced not only by its de novo biosynthesis, but also by the absorption of dietary cholesterol and the removal of cholesterol from the blood. Blocking the absorption of dietary cholesterol by the gut through inhibition of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 protein on small intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes is the basis of the mechanism of action of ezetimibe, a drug first described by Schering–Plough. When combined with a statin, ezetimibe further reduces LDLc by 15% to 20% and improves cardiovascular outcomes.

This review introduces the family of proprotein convertases (PCs) and discusses the implication of some members in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. It concentrates on PCSK9, which is implicated in the enhanced degradation of the LDLR and, hence, the clearance of LDLc from circulation. The review presents some of the multifaceted functions of this fascinating protein and highlights knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed. Although it does not aim to exhaustively cover all information regarding the various tissue-specific functions of PCSK9 in health and disease, it focuses on specific novel avenues that deserve more extensive investigation.

### Effect of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors on plasma ceramide levels [^1128eua7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are novel drugs that provide a striking reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) when added to maximum tolerated therapy in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Ceramides, which are novel cardiac risk markers, have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The Ceramide Risk Score (CRS) predicts the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events within 1 to 3 years in patients with coronary artery disease. The effect of PCSK9 inhibition on plasma ceramides is not well known. This study examines the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on plasma ceramides and the CRS in patients with a clinical indication for this therapy.

A retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with hypercholesterolemia on PCSK9 inhibitors was conducted (n = 24; Mayo Clinic 2015 to 2018). Plasma ceramides were measured before the initiation of PCSK9 inhibitors and 2 to 12 months after treatment. CRS was calculated before and after therapy based on individual plasma concentrations of four ceramides. Treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in mean CRS and individual ceramide levels (p < 0.0001). CRS improved significantly with PCSK9 therapy. PCSK9 inhibitors significantly decreased LDL-C levels by 63% (p < 0.0001). The absolute reduction in CRS did not correlate with the absolute reduction in LDL-C (r = 0.31; confidence interval -0.10 to 0.64), indicating that CRS may evaluate a different pathway for risk reduction beyond LDL-C lowering.

### Chasing LDL cholesterol to the bottom - PCSK9 in perspective [^115DGEhW]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2022). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) indubitably contributes causally to atherosclerosis, a leading challenge to health worldwide. Interventions that lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) have made remarkable inroads against this global scourge. Recent therapeutic advances have achieved ever lower levels of LDL-C, and improved cardiovascular outcomes continue to accrue from these interventions. In particular, the discovery of the role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) as the causal gene in autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia has led, with remarkable speed, to the development of novel agents to lower LDL-C concentrations beyond prior measures and to alleviate further cardiovascular risk.

This review explores how this story, and its position in the broader landscape of therapy to prevent atherosclerotic events, represents a notable victory of contemporary cardiovascular medicine and reflects successful partnerships between basic scientists, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, and clinical investigators. Continued cooperation in this manner promises to yield further progress in combating cardiovascular diseases beyond interventions on LDL-C.

### PcsK9 inhibitor use in the real world: Data from the national patient-centered research network [^111fktyw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for approximately 1 in every 3 deaths. An established risk factor for the development of CVD is elevated LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C), which is a common chronic condition in adults. The use of lipid-lowering therapies, including statins and nonstatin therapies such as ezetimibe and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors, reduces LDL-C and lowers the risk of CVD outcomes. For every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C from statins, there is a corresponding relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events of 12% and 22% after 1 and 4 years of treatment, respectively. Furthermore, aggressive lowering of LDL-C beyond treatment guideline thresholds has been shown to provide even greater benefit in reduction of CVD outcomes. Despite these known benefits, a substantial proportion of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, including those with established CVD, receive suboptimal or no lipid-lowering therapy.

### What do US physicians and patients think about lipid-lowering therapy and goals of treatment? Results from the GOULD registry [^113i2TPG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

In this large cohort of US patients with ASCVD and suboptimal LDL‐C control or on a PCSK9 inhibitor, we found large deficiencies in patients' understanding of their disease and treatment. Despite their high cardiovascular risk, most patients underestimated the risk of ASCVD in the general population, did not understand their personal risk of reASCVD events, were unaware of their LDL‐C levels or goals, and either were unaware of or overestimated the benefit of cholesterol medications. Patients taking PCSK9 inhibitor medications, in general, had higher socioeconomic status and self‐reported a healthier lifestyle than those in the LDL‐C cohort. The PCSK9 inhibitor cohort had slightly better knowledge about ASCVD and its risks but were also more likely to overestimate the risk reduction with their lipid‐lowering treatments. Men and younger patients also were more informed about their cardiovascular condition and its management, although overall knowledge was still low in these groups. Physicians continue to focus on low LDL‐C goals with statins as the cornerstone of lipid‐lowering therapy and believe a lack of education is a major barrier to optimal lipid‐lowering treatment. These findings illustrate large education gaps that, if properly addressed, could improve the quality of shared decision‐making, increase treatment adherence, and, ultimately, reduce the residual risk of reASCVD events.

An underestimation of the risks of ASCVD — particularly in women — was not unexpected, given prior work in the general US population. The American Heart Association conducted a…

### Research progress on alternative non-classical mechanisms of PCSK9 in atherosclerosis in patients with and without diabetes [^114DthDQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Low credibility.

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) acts via a canonical pathway to regulate circulating low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) via degradation of the LDL receptor (LDLR) on the liver cell surface. Published research has shown that PCSK9 is involved in atherosclerosis via a variety of non-classical mechanisms that involve lysosomal, inflammatory, apoptotic, mitochondrial, and immune pathways. In this review paper, we summarized these additional mechanisms and described how anti-PCSK9 therapy exerts effects through these mechanisms. These additional pathways further illustrate the regulatory role of PCSK9 in atherosclerosis and offer an in-depth interpretation of how the PCSK9 inhibitor exerts effects on the treatment of atherosclerosis.

### Pcsk9 inhibitor valuation: A science-based review of the two recent models [^1157qypY]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Another input into the cost-effectiveness models is the baseline LDL-C. Kazi et al. used 104 mg/dL, the mean LDL-C, whereas Fonarow et al. used this scenario but also one with a higher value, as more often seen in clinical practice (mean = 130 mg/dL). Neither model employed scenarios in which LDL-C was very high, as is typically the case in those with FH. The age of modeled patients also varied between the two studies. Kazi et al. used an age range of 40 to 84 years, whereas Fonarow et al. included patients aged ≥ 18 years. By omitting younger patients, Kazi et al. failed to consider those with FH, many of whom have events between 18 and 40 years old. Omitting those over 84 years also fails to recognize another subset at extremely high risk for ASCVD events, the very elderly.

Finally, the choice of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold varied between the two studies. In their base cases, Kazi et al. selected $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), whereas Fonarow et al. chose $150,000 per QALY. Though the merits of one number versus another are debatable, Kazi et al. has acknowledged that in first-world countries, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of $150,000 per QALY can be appropriate. The higher the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, the easier it is for a drug to have value. Thus, the choice of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is not inconsequential. Fonarow and colleagues ran several scenario analyses utilizing different incremental cost-effectiveness ratio thresholds. They also did this with other variables. By doing so, their analysis helps better inform decision-making.

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^113gfo8m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors represent a promising class of lipid-lowering therapy, although their use has been limited by cost concerns.

- **Methods and results**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a nationwide commercial claims database comprising patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), aged 18 to 64 years. We identified the number of patients with ASCVD who started on a PCSK9 inhibitor from the dates of US Food and Drug Administration approval in quarter 3 of 2015 through quarter 2 of 2019. Secondary objectives identified the proportions of patients started on a PCSK9 inhibitor in various ASCVD risk groups based on statin use and baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We identified 126,419 patients with ASCVD on either PCSK9 inhibitor or statin therapy. Among these patients, 1,168 (0.9%) filled a prescription for a PCSK9 inhibitor. The number of patients initiating a PCSK9 inhibitor increased from 2 patients in quarter 3 of 2015 to 119 patients in quarter 2 of 2019, corresponding to an increase from 0.05% to 2.5% of patients with ASCVD already on statins who started PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Of patients with ASCVD with high adherence to a high-intensity statin, 13,643 had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 70 mg/dL, and in this subgroup, 119 (0.9%) patients initiated a PCSK9 inhibitor.

- **Conclusions**: Few patients started PCSK9 inhibitors from 2015 through mid-2019, despite increasing trial evidence of efficacy, guidelines recommending PCSK9 inhibitors in high-risk patients with ASCVD, and price reductions.

### Efficiency and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 monoclonal antibody on hypercholesterolemia: A meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials [^116eha35]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

The causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are multifactorial, and one of its main risk factors is dyslipidemia. Guidelines consequently identify total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels as the primary targets for lipid-modifying therapy. Statins are by far the most effective lipid-lowering drugs, significantly decreasing CVD risk by lowering LDL-C levels. The LDL-C goal is < 70 mg/dL and/or a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high CVD risk when target levels cannot be reached. To achieve this goal, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended.

High-intensity statins have been confirmed to be safe and tolerable for most patients; however, at least 10% of patients experience side effects such as myalgia, muscle aches, weakness, or other symptoms. As a result, some individuals are unwilling to continue their statin therapy. For these patients, alternative lipid-lowering therapies must be employed to achieve their target LDL-C level.

### PCSK9 inhibitor valuation: A science-based review of the two recent models [^113pKieg]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past 30 years, great strides have been made in managing ASCVD. Perhaps most consequential has been the confirmation that LDL-C causes ASCVD. We now have four classes of drugs that reduce LDL-C, with large randomized trials demonstrating a reduction in ASCVD risk, reaffirming the central importance of lowering LDL-C. Two years ago, the PCSK9 mabs alirocumab and evolocumab were FDA approved for specific indications with their very potent LDL-C lowering, and most recently, one agent has been approved for the reduction of CV events. Unfortunately, their uptake has been slow, and a key reason for this has been the unprecedented pushback from payers and the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).

A recent pushback on PBMs has been made by the proposed Berkshire Hathaway/Amazon/J.P. Morgan consortium, but it is much too early to understand what generalizable impact this may have. The ICER group has played a significant role in fostering this challenge, asserting that these medications are not valuable enough at their price. Modeling the valuation of medications is an imperfect science, one based on assumptions that can vary widely, as seen in the large differences between the two recent publications from Kazi et al. and Fonarow et al.

In the end, we must return to clinical medicine, wherein we need to examine a drug's clinical benefit for an individual patient. The newer, more costly therapies should be targeted to those who will benefit most, and only after other less expensive therapies have failed to meet risk-reduction goals.

### Hepatic sensing loop regulates PCSK9 secretion in response to inhibitory antibodies [^117WGnKb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9i) lower LDL-C by up to 60% and increase plasma proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels by 10-fold.

- **Objectives**: The authors studied the reasons behind the robust increase in plasma PCSK9 levels by testing the hypothesis that mechanisms beyond clearance via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) contribute to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.

- **Methods**: In clinical cohorts, animal models, and cell-based studies, we measured kinetic changes in PCSK9 production and clearance in response to PCSK9i.

- **Results**: In a patient cohort receiving PCSK9i therapy, plasma PCSK9 levels rose 11-fold during the first 3 months and then plateaued for 15 months. In a cohort of healthy volunteers, a single injection of PCSK9i increased plasma PCSK9 levels within 12 hours; the rise continued for 9 days until it plateaued at 10-fold above baseline. We recapitulated the rapid rise in PCSK9 levels in a mouse model, but only in the presence of LDLR. In vivo turnover and in vitro pulse-chase studies identified two mechanisms contributing to the rapid increase in plasma PCSK9 levels in response to PCSK9i: 1) the expected delayed clearance of the antibody-bound PCSK9; and 2) the unexpected post-translational increase in PCSK9 secretion.

- **Conclusions**: PCSK9 re-entry to the liver via LDLR triggers a sensing loop regulating PCSK9 secretion. PCSK9i therapy enhances the secretion of PCSK9, an effect that contributes to the increased plasma PCSK9 levels in treated subjects.

### PCSK9 inhibitors: Are we on the verge of a breakthrough [^114YYX2E]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are first-line therapy for lowering cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events. A significant need for new lipid-modifying therapies remains for patients unable to tolerate statins or achieve guideline-based cholesterol targets. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of LDL receptor recycling. Gain-of-function PCSK9 mutations are associated with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and increased risk of coronary artery disease, while loss-of-function variants result in low LDL-C and decreased risk of cardiovascular events. PCSK9 monoclonal antibody inhibitors have been developed and lower LDL-C levels up to 70% in clinical trials. These inhibitors are well tolerated, with low serious adverse event rates. Phase III clinical outcome trials with these agents are ongoing and will determine their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events and address long-term safety concerns.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning PCSK9 inhibitors, the CCS 2021 guidelines recommend intensifying lipid-lowering therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor and/or ezetimibe for secondary prevention in all patients with cardiovascular disease. This is advised if LDL-C remains ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (or non-HDL-C ≥ 2.4 mmol/L or ApoB ≥ 0.7 g/L) while receiving the maximally tolerated statin dose.

### Use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies before and after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation [^113JgBdM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) therapies in 2015 for additional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering among adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of two PCSK9i therapies, evolocumab and alirocumab, in lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing rates of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic disease. Given their Food and Drug Administration-approved indications, patients initiating PCSK9i may have high LDL and a high risk for CVD events.

Treatment interruptions are common among users of statins and other long-term therapies and may be even more frequent among patients initiating a PCSK9i because of the potential burden of prior authorization paperwork to obtain refills and the high cost of treatment. Indeed, poor persistence and adherence to statin therapy have been previously documented in various patient populations. As PCSK9i are potent LDL-lowering agents, patients initiating PCSK9i may discontinue or down titrate other LDL-lowering therapies. These patients may not be taking any LDL-lowering therapy if they experience an interruption in PCSK9i. The goals of the research were to 1) examine the prevalence of and factors associated with PCSK9i interruption after treatment initiation; and 2) describe patterns of other LDL-lowering therapy use during PCSK9i treatment.

Regarding the medical management of familial hypercholesterolemia, specifically in the context of PCSK9 inhibitors, the CCS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of monoclonal antibody inhibitors of PCSK9 in adult patients who do not have ASCVD. This is advised if the patients have not achieved a 50% reduction in LDL-C from baseline and have reached an LDL-C level of at least < 3.5 mmol/L or lower. This determination should be made through a shared decision process between the physician and the patient, following maximally tolerated statin therapy, with or without the use of ezetimibe.

### Comparing the relationships of genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition with mood disorders, cognition, and dementia between men and women: A drug-target Mendelian randomization study [^116RvGXp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The present study found that the neuropsychiatric impact of genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 was both generally neutral and similar between men and women, adding to the growing body of literature suggesting a safe neuropsychiatric profile for PCSK9 inhibitors and other lipid-lowering therapies. Our results provide an important sex-specific comparison of potential neuropsychiatric adverse side effects related to genetically proxied PCSK9i, which has not been heretofore evaluated despite the call for more studies stratifying analyses by sex and reported differences in the prevalence of these disorders between men and women. Overall, these results may help mitigate ongoing fears of adverse neuropsychiatric side effects related to PCSK9i that have contributed, in part, to their underutilization.

We did observe some associations between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and depression, which adds to the growing body of MR literature suggesting a causal relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease. Notably, our corresponding null estimates on depression risk from polygenic LDL-C instruments using variants across the genome suggest that the relationship is not mediated by the primary physiological response to PCSK9 inhibition. Further, while some instruments suggested a nominal statistical increase in the risk of depression, other instruments suggested potential beneficial effects of PCSK9 inhibition (e.g. the biologically conservative PCSK9 instrument). Further, causal inference requires triangulating study designs, and an impact by PCSK9i on dep…

### Safety and effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors and inclisiran in patients with neuromuscular disorders and statin intolerance [^1167w4NL]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the efficacy and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and inclisiran among patients with neuromuscular disorders and statin-induced myotoxicity and/or hepatotoxicity. We assessed the safety and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors and inclisiran in this specific patient subgroup.

- **Methods**: We conducted an observational cohort study evaluating patients with available clinical and laboratory data prior to and at prespecified time points following treatment initiation with PCSK9 inhibitors or inclisiran.

- **Results**: Eleven patients with neuromuscular disorders and statin intolerance were included in this study. Median follow-up time after PCSK9 inhibitor or inclisiran initiation was 14 (9–17) months. PCSK9 inhibitors or inclisiran use led to a significant decrease in mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Moreover, all patients tolerated these lipid-lowering agents without exacerbation of their underlying myositis, myopathy, neuromuscular junction disorder, and without presenting any adverse event or relapse of myotoxicity and/or hepatotoxicity.

- **Discussion**: The present real-world study highlights the potential therapeutic value of PCSK9 inhibitors and inclisiran among patients with neuromuscular disorders and statin intolerance. The findings of this study are in accordance with previous reports, showing that PCSK9 inhibitors are safe as a lipid-lowering treatment for long-term use among patients with statin-associated immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM).

### Use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies before and after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation [^115BR8L6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

With high rates of PCSK9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) interruption and discontinuation of statins or ezetimibe after PCSK9i initiation, 27% of patients were on no LDL-lowering therapy by one year after PCSK9i initiation. Additionally, 44% of patients experienced interruptions of all LDL-lowering therapies for at least 30 days. These results caution clinicians against complacency after successfully initiating a patient on a PCSK9i. Most new PCSK9i users had prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and it is critical that these patients do not go completely untreated when the PCSK9i is interrupted or discontinued.

The 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guidelines on the Management of Blood Cholesterol recommend that patients taking PCSK9i therapy should also be on concomitant statin and ezetimibe therapy, where possible. The association of statin nonadherence with worse clinical outcomes, including death and recurrent cardiovascular events, has been demonstrated. Clinicians need to closely monitor and educate patients about the importance of continuing LDL-lowering medications.

This discussion should include the rationale for reducing blood cholesterol, the independent benefits of statin therapy beyond LDL lowering, and the need to maintain long-term secondary prevention, which may require combination therapy of multiple LDL-lowering medications.

### The PCSK9 revolution: Current status, controversies, and future directions [^111HdgoB]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has revolutionized our understanding of cholesterol homeostasis and enhanced our arsenal against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Over approximately 15 years, PCSK9 has transformed from an obscure and rare cause of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) into the most effective cholesterol-lowering target known. This transformation is supported by the completion of two large-scale cardiovascular outcome trials showing positive results. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved modalities to inhibit PCSK9 exist in the form of monoclonal antibodies, which display an unparalleled degree of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. These findings expand upon the notion that lower LDL-C is better for ASCVD risk reduction. However, the rapid pace of discovery and therapeutic development has left significant gaps in our knowledge regarding the physiology and function of PCSK9. The aim of this review is to provide context to the discovery, history, treatment, and status of PCSK9 and its therapeutic inhibitors, while highlighting areas of controversy and future directions.

### The cholesterol uptake regulator PCSK9 promotes and is a therapeutic target in APC/KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer [^117Mvspw]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

GGPP is an isoprenoid involved in the prenylation of small GTPases, such as KRAS, thereby enhancing their membrane localization and activation. Consistent with this notion, disruption of the PCSK9-GGPP axis by knockout of PCSK9 in APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cells has been found to reduce active KRAS and repress its membrane localization. This results in the inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling and decreased expression of downstream genes (Cyclin D1/D3 and CDK4) involved in cell proliferation, an effect reversed by GGPP. Conversely, overexpression of PCSK9 activates KRAS/MEK/ERK, which is abolished by the knockdown of GGPS1. These data indicate that the PCSK9-GGPP axis is directly involved in the activation of KRAS/MEK/ERK oncogenic signaling in APC/KRAS-mutant CRC.

PCSK9 is a therapeutic target in hypercholesterolemia and is also emerging as a potential target in cancer. PCSK9 inhibitors have been approved by the FDA, and more are under development. Evolocumab, R-IMPP, and PF-0644846 inhibited the growth of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cells and CRC organoids. Xenograft models confirmed the efficacy of R-IMPP and PF-0644846 in vivo without overt adverse effects. Based on the premise that HMGCR inhibitors suppress GGPP levels, we devised the combination of PCSK9 inhibitors and simvastatin. si PCSK9 or PCSK9 inhibitors synergized with simvastatin to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in vitro, and demonstrated a synergistic effect in SW1116 xenografts. Our work, together with that of others, highlights the mevalonate pathway as an emerging cancer drug target.

### Circulating mature PCSK9 level predicts diminished response to statin therapy [^1136zBdK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Achieving a lower level of low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL‐C) with a lipid‐lowering drug has become a cornerstone for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins are a major therapeutic agent used to lower LDL‐C levels by inhibiting 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which induces reduced secretion of apolipoprotein B–containing lipoproteins from the liver and the upregulation of LDL receptor (LDLR) activity. This agent has been shown to lower LDL‐C levels by approximately 30% to 50%. However, the extent of statin‐mediated LDL‐C lowering is not consistent among each individual. Recent studies reported that 11% to 20% of patients receiving a statin exhibited its diminished response and an elevated cardiovascular risk. In addition, hyporesponse to a statin, defined as a percent reduction of LDL‐C < 15%, was associated with substantial atheroma progression. These observations suggest the importance of elucidating factors causing this poor response to a statin, which may enable us to identify hyporesponders to statin therapy and then allocate adequate lipid‐lowering therapy.

LDL metabolism is regulated by PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). PCSK9 is a protease that regulates LDL metabolism by degrading LDLR, suggesting that the increased level of PCSK9 may attenuate the response to a statin. However, recent studies did not show any association of PCSK9 level with a change in on‐treatment LDL‐C following statin therapy. Pathophysiologically, PCSK9 exists as mature and furin‐cleaved forms in circulation. Several basic stu…

### Harnessing RNA interference for cholesterol lowering: The bench-to-bedside story of inclisiran [^113m69R6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Following the discovery of the PCSK9 gene and its role in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), the PCSK9 protein was identified as a predominantly hepatically synthesized ≈75‐kDa precursor protein (proPCSK9) inhibited by a prodomain. The prodomain is autocatalytically cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum but remains associated with the protein, forming a PCSK9/inhibitory prosegment complex that is secreted from the cell via the cis‐Golgi.

Hepatic uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles via the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has a vital role in maintaining physiological cholesterol homeostasis. At the time of PCSK9 discovery, most regulation of the LDLR was thought to occur intracellularly. However, in animal and in vitro models, PCSK9 protein was found to exert its effects predominantly extracellularly via interaction with the LDLR epidermal growth‐factor‐like domain A. Binding of PCSK9 to the LDLR leads to a conformational change that prevents its recycling to the hepatocyte surface and results in PCSK9‐LDLR lysosomal degradation. PCSK9‐driven degradation of the LDLR and decreased intracellular LDLR recycling result in fewer LDLR available on the hepatocyte membrane and, thus, reduced LDL clearance from the blood. This discovery presented a potential target for a pharmacological intervention designed to disrupt cholesterol homeostasis.

### Prescribing patterns of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors in eligible patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^113iuhiE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Two proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are approved for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who require additional low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. This retrospective study sought to determine differences between eligible patients who were prescribed and those who were not prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor. Patients from an electronic medical record database were included in the analysis, and their demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics were evaluated.

Of 368,624 PCSK9 inhibitor-eligible patients, 1,752 (< 0.5%) received a PCSK9 inhibitor prescription. Patients who received a PCSK9 inhibitor were more frequently associated with a higher cardiovascular disease risk category and a higher baseline LDL-C level (139.4 vs 103.5 mg/dL; p < 0.0001) compared with those who did not. Patients with a PCSK9 inhibitor prescription were significantly more likely to be on ezetimibe, alone or in combination with a statin, at baseline compared with those without (29% vs 5%; p < 0.0001).

Use of a PCSK9 inhibitor was very low in the two groups of patients identified as PCSK9 inhibitor-eligible based on the American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that most PCSK9 inhibitor-eligible patients do not receive a PCSK9 inhibitor prescription, highlighting that many high-risk patients could benefit from additional LDL-C lowering with a PCSK9 inhibitor.

### PCSK9 inhibition: The way forward in the treatment of dyslipidemia [^114YWYCU]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Barely a decade after the discovery of the gene encoding proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its recognition as a key player in cholesterol metabolism, PCSK9 inhibition is now considered an exciting approach in the reduction of residual risk of cardiovascular disease. The progress from PCSK9 discovery to the development of targeted treatment has been unprecedented in terms of scale and speed. The first suggestion of a link between PCSK9 and hypercholesterolemia was published in 2003; a decade later, two meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing anti-PCSK9 treatment to placebo or ezetimibe, including over 10,000 hypercholesterolemic individuals, were published.

Currently, three PCSK9 inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical outcome trials. The results will determine the future of these lipid-lowering therapies by establishing their clinical efficacy in terms of cardiovascular event reduction, safety, and the consequences of prolonged exposure to very low levels of LDL cholesterol. Irrespective of their outcomes, the exceptionally rapid development of these drugs exemplifies how novel technologies, genetic validation, and rapid clinical progression provide the tools to expedite the development of new drugs.

### Prediction of cardiovascular events with levels of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1112yTNd]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) reduces atherogenic lipoproteins and could lead to reduction of cardiovascular (CV) events. However, it is unclear whether blood PCSK9 levels predict future CV events. We performed a meta-analysis of all longitudinal studies to determine the ability of PCSK9 levels to predict risk of future CV events.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted up to February 2016. Longitudinal studies that reported events or relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were included.

- **Results**: All 9 studies included (12,081 participants, mean follow-up 6.62 years) reported results on total CV events. The pooled RR of total CV events for an increase in baseline PCSK9 by 1 standard deviation (SD) was 1.098 (95% CI, 1.02–1.18), corresponding to a risk increase of 10% (Z = 2.43, p = 0.015). The pooled RR of total CV events for subjects categorized in the highest tertile of baseline PCSK9 was 1.228 (95% CI, 1.035–1.457), corresponding to a risk increase of 23% (Z = 2.35, p = 0.019). When pooled estimates were derived independently for low- and high-CV risk populations, baseline PCSK9 levels predicted total CV events only in apparently healthy subjects (RR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.050–1.222, Z = 3.21, p = 0.001) and not in populations with established CV or renal disease (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.961–1.23, Z = 1.33, p = 0.182).

- **Conclusions**: PCSK9 levels are modestly but significantly associated with increased risk of total CV events. These results suggest a predictive role.

### Use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapies before and after PCSK9 inhibitor initiation [^1167e1wF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In the study, more than half of patients initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) experienced an interruption in therapy within the first year after initiation. Additionally, after PCSK9i initiation, many patients discontinue or down titrate other LDL‐lowering therapies, such as statins or ezetimibe. These findings raise concern that many new PCSK9i users may remain at high risk of cardiovascular events because of interruptions or discontinuations in LDL‐lowering therapy.

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^112G2w4H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We observed small numbers of potentially eligible patients starting PCSK9 inhibitors from US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2015 through mid-2019, a period during which increasing clinical evidence demonstrated PCSK9 inhibitors improved cardiovascular outcomes. Guidelines recommended PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with ASCVD with high cardiovascular risk, and manufacturers reduced prices of the drugs. Among various patient subgroups identified as potentially greatly benefiting from PCSK9 inhibitors, we still found less than 1% were started on PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Thus, the magnitude of price reductions may not yet be sufficient to influence use management strategies aimed to limit PCSK9 inhibitor use, despite increased guideline recommendations for their use. The potential clinical benefits of novel therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, may not be realized if barriers to access remain.

### On the function and homeostasis of PCSK9: Reciprocal interaction with LDLR and additional lipid effects [^111UGSZU]. Atherosclerosis (2015). Low credibility.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a circulatory ligand that terminates the lifecycle of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), thus affecting plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Recent evidence shows that, in addition to the straightforward mechanism of action, there are more complex interactions between PCSK9, LDLR, and plasma lipoprotein levels, including:

- **Parallel and reciprocal regulation**: There is both parallel and reciprocal regulation of surface LDLR and plasma PCSK9.
- **Correlation with LDL-C levels**: A correlation between PCSK9 and LDL-C levels exists, dependent not only on the fact that PCSK9 removes hepatic LDLR, but also because up to 40% of plasma PCSK9 is physically associated with LDL.
- **Association with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins**: There is an association between plasma PCSK9 production and the assembly and secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

The effect of PCSK9 on LDLR is being successfully utilized for the development of anti-PCSK9 therapies to reduce plasma LDL-C levels. Biochemical research has uncovered additional mechanisms of action and interacting partners for PCSK9, paving the way for a more thorough understanding of the regulation, metabolism, and effects of this interesting protein.

### PCSK9 promotes LDLR degradation by preventing SNX17-mediated LDLR recycling [^112oUrua]. Circulation (2025). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is internalized into cells mainly through LDLR (LDL receptor)-mediated endocytosis. In an acidic endosome, LDLR is released from LDL and recycles back to the cell surface, whereas LDL is left in the endosome and degraded in the lysosome. Circulating PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9) binds with LDLR and is internalized into the endosome, similar to LDL. In an acidic endosome, LDLR fails to disassociate from PCSK9, and both proteins are degraded in the lysosome. PCSK9 inhibitors are widely used for treating hypercholesterolemia; however, how PCSK9 diverts LDLR to the lysosome for degradation remains elusive. Some patients are resistant to PCSK9 inhibitors for unknown reasons.

- **Methods**: Both in vitro and in vivo approaches were used to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. LDLR containing FH sequence variations was expressed in Ldlr knockout mice and knockout HuH7 cells to evaluate their response to PCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibitors.

- **Results**: Acidic pH induces a conformational change in LDLR extracellular domain and promotes its interaction with SNX17 (sorting nexin 17) through the intracellular domain. Knocking down SNX17 abolishes LDLR recycling and causes accelerated degradation in the lysosome. PCSK9 prevents the acidic pH-induced conformational change in LDLR and blocks its interaction with SNX17. Knocking down SNX17 abolishes PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation. Any FH sequence variations that disrupt LDLR recycling are unresponsive to PCSK9 or PCSK9 inhibitors.
