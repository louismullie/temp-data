## Question

Does thalassemia cause hemolysis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thalassemia causes hemolysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of thalassemia and whether it intrinsically damages red blood cells. Then, I should verify the distinction between ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis and whether both are operative. Next, I will examine mechanistic evidence for hemolysis in β- and α-thalassemia, including oxidative stress and membrane injury. After that, I should review clinical and laboratory evidence of hemolysis across phenotypes. Finally, I will consider modifiers of hemolytic severity and synthesize a clear conclusion anchored to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental defect. Thalassemia arises from mutations that reduce or abolish synthesis of α- or β-globin chains, creating a globin chain imbalance with accumulation of unpaired chains that precipitate and damage erythroid cells, producing ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolytic anemia. This mechanistic framework is consistently described in authoritative reviews and is the foundation for concluding that hemolysis is intrinsic to the disease biology [^114JCwib] [^114P2CTQ].

> Wait, let me verify the distinction between ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis because I need to ensure I'm not conflating them. Ineffective erythropoiesis refers to apoptosis of late erythroid precursors in the marrow, whereas peripheral hemolysis refers to premature destruction of mature red cells in the circulation; multiple sources explicitly state that thalassemia features both ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis, confirming that hemolysis is indeed a direct pathobiologic component rather than a mere downstream effect of marrow failure [^112NWBhX] [^112mQgA9] [^114Xdu4m].

> I will now examine the mechanism in β-thalassemia. Excess α-globin chains aggregate in erythroid precursors and mature RBCs, causing oxidative stress, membrane instability, and loss of deformability. These biophysical and biochemical injuries lead to premature clearance, both extravascularly and to a lesser extent intravascularly, establishing hemolysis as a core mechanism rather than an epiphenomenon [^1116NMTe] [^114dWmAt] [^111g67dW].

> Next, I should review α-thalassemia. In HbH disease, β4 tetramers form and precipitate within RBCs, damaging membranes and promoting premature destruction. Non-deletional genotypes in particular drive more ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis, reinforcing that hemolysis is a direct consequence of unstable tetramer accumulation and membrane injury in α-thalassemia as well [^114KYFjE] [^1162tSNo].

> Hold on, I should verify that these mechanistic claims translate into clinically detectable hemolysis. Laboratory and clinical evidence across phenotypes includes elevated indirect bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase, reticulocytosis, low or absent haptoglobin, and hemoglobinuria in more severe cases, all consistent with hemolysis; moreover, thalassemia is repeatedly categorized among congenital hemolytic anemias in clinical references, and hemolysis-related complications such as cholelithiasis and hypercoagulability are well described in thalassemia cohorts [^115DmKz2] [^114JCwib] [^114YSHww].

> Let me consider modifiers of hemolytic severity to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. The degree of globin chain imbalance modulates hemolysis; co-inheritance of α-thalassemia with β-thalassemia reduces excess α-chains and ameliorates hemolysis, whereas triplicated α-globin genes worsen it, and non-deletional HbH genotypes exhibit more hemolysis than deletional forms; splenectomy can increase circulating damaged RBCs and microparticles, altering hemolytic dynamics and thrombotic risk, which underscores that while hemolysis is intrinsic, its intensity is phenotype- and treatment-modified [^1116NMTe] [^114KYFjE] [^112yWHpw].

> But wait, what if the anemia is "primarily" due to ineffective erythropoiesis rather than hemolysis; does that negate hemolysis as a cause? I should double-check that both can coexist and independently contribute. Authoritative reviews and pathophysiology summaries consistently describe thalassemia as characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolytic anemia, confirming that hemolysis is a direct and necessary component of the disease process even if the relative contribution varies by genotype and phenotype [^114JCwib] [^114P2CTQ] [^112NWBhX].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise and reference-aligned. Yes, thalassemia causes hemolysis: unpaired globin chain precipitation induces oxidative and membrane injury that leads to premature RBC destruction, with both extravascular and intravascular components documented across α- and β-thalassemia phenotypes. This hemolysis is mechanistically intrinsic, clinically detectable, and contributes to complications such as jaundice, gallstones, and a hypercoagulable state, while its severity is shaped by genetic modifiers and splenic function [^114JCwib] [^111g67dW] [^114YSHww].

Thalassemia causes hemolysis due to **globin chain imbalance** [^114JCwib], which leads to unstable hemoglobin tetramers, membrane damage, and premature red blood cell destruction [^113XLmPd]. Hemolysis is **primarily extravascular** (in the spleen/liver) [^111g67dW] but can include an intravascular component in severe forms [^113HrvNL]. The severity of hemolysis correlates with the degree of globin imbalance [^1116NMTe] and is more pronounced in non-deletional α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia major/intermedia, while thalassemia trait usually has minimal hemolysis [^114KYFjE] [^111RccRb]. Hemolysis drives complications such as anemia, jaundice, gallstones, and iron overload [^114GkMRw], and management includes transfusions, iron chelation, and therapies that reduce hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis [^11746xaS] [^114Xdu4m].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of hemolysis in thalassemia

Hemolysis in thalassemia is **primarily extravascular**, mediated by macrophages in the spleen and liver that recognize and clear damaged RBCs [^111g67dW]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Globin chain imbalance**: Reduced synthesis of α- or β-globin chains causes excess unpaired chains that precipitate, forming inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) [^notfound]. These inclusions damage RBC membranes, reduce deformability, and trigger macrophage-mediated clearance [^114dWmAt].

- **Membrane instability and oxidative stress**: Precipitated globin chains destabilize the RBC membrane [^114dWmAt], increasing oxidative stress and further accelerating hemolysis [^115sFfv6].

- **Intravascular hemolysis**: In severe forms (e.g. β-thalassemia major, HbH disease), membrane damage can cause intravascular hemolysis, releasing free hemoglobin and contributing to complications such as nitric oxide depletion and vascular dysfunction [^113HrvNL] [^111g67dW].

## Clinical evidence of hemolysis in thalassemia

Hemolysis is a hallmark of thalassemia, with severity varying by **genotype and phenotype**:

| **Thalassemia type** | **Severity of hemolysis** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| α-thalassemia trait (silent carrier, trait) | Minimal | Usually asymptomatic; mild microcytosis [^1154Zw2C] |
| β-thalassemia trait | Mild | Asymptomatic; mild microcytic anemia [^1154Zw2C] |
| Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease (α-thalassemia intermedia) | Moderate to severe | - Chronic hemolytic anemia <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Splenomegaly <br/> - Gallstones [^117MJWbS] |
| β-thalassemia intermedia | Moderate to severe | - Chronic hemolytic anemia <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Splenomegaly <br/> - Extramedullary hematopoiesis [^1174Kuu1] |
| β-thalassemia major | Severe | - Profound chronic hemolytic anemia <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Splenomegaly <br/> - Growth failure <br/> - Bone deformities [^114JCwib] |

---

Laboratory evidence of hemolysis includes elevated **lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**, **unconjugated bilirubin**, and **reticulocyte count**, with reduced haptoglobin levels [^115DmKz2].

---

## Factors influencing the severity of hemolysis

Several factors modulate **hemolysis severity** in thalassemia:

- **Genetic mutations**: The specific α- or β-globin mutations determine the degree of globin chain imbalance and, consequently, hemolysis severity [^114KYFjE].

- **Coinheritance of α-thalassemia**: Co-inheritance of α-thalassemia with β-thalassemia reduces α-globin excess, lessening hemolysis and disease severity [^1116NMTe].

- **Splenectomy**: Splenectomy can increase circulating damaged RBCs and microparticles, potentially exacerbating hemolysis-related complications such as hypercoagulability [^114uALGb].

---

## Clinical consequences of hemolysis in thalassemia

Hemolysis in thalassemia leads to **chronic anemia** with fatigue, pallor, and growth retardation [^114JCwib]. Elevated bilirubin from hemolysis causes jaundice and increases the risk of gallstone formation (cholelithiasis) [^1148KQxz]. Repeated transfusions and hemolysis-related iron release cause iron overload, leading to organ damage (heart, liver, endocrine glands) [^114FXciC]. Hemolysis also contributes to a hypercoagulable state, increasing thromboembolic risk [^114YSHww].

---

## Management strategies targeting hemolysis

Management of thalassemia-related hemolysis includes:

- **Blood transfusions**: Regular transfusions reduce hemolysis by replacing damaged RBCs and suppressing ineffective erythropoiesis [^112JSkTa].

- **Iron chelation therapy**: Essential to prevent iron overload from transfusions and hemolysis [^1154Zw2C].

- **Splenectomy**: Considered in severe hemolysis with hypersplenism, though it increases thrombotic risk [^114uALGb].

- **Novel therapies**: Agents such as luspatercept and mitapivat target ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis, improving anemia and reducing transfusion needs [^114Xdu4m] [^115sFfv6].

---

Thalassemia causes hemolysis through **globin chain imbalance** [^114P2CTQ], leading to RBC membrane damage and premature destruction. Hemolysis is primarily extravascular but can include intravascular components in severe forms, driving complications such as anemia, jaundice, gallstones, and iron overload. Management focuses on transfusions, iron chelation, and therapies that reduce hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis [^11746xaS].

### Haptoglobin levels are associated with haptoglobin genotype and alpha +-thalassemia in a malaria-endemic area [^111PRt3r]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Haptoglobin (Hp) is an acute phase protein that removes free hemoglobin (Hb) released during hemolysis. Hp has also been shown to be toxic for malaria parasites. alpha(+)-Thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy that results in subclinical hemolytic anemia. alpha(+)-Thassemia homozygosity confers protection against severe malarial disease by an as yet unidentified mechanism. Hp levels were measured in a serial cross-sectional survey of children in Madang Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Hp levels were related to age, Hp genotype, Hb levels, parasitemia, splenomegaly, and alpha(+)-thalassemia genotype. Surprisingly, children who were homozygous for alpha(+) -thalassemia had significantly higher levels of Hp than did heterozygotes, after controlling for relevant confounders. We suggest that this is the result of either reduced mean cell Hb associated with alpha(+) -thalassemia homozygosity or an elevated IL-6-dependent acute phase response.

### Cellular and biochemical heterogeneity contributes to the phenotypic diversity of transfusion-dependent î ²-thalassemia [^1127MhP9]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity in blood phenotypes is a function of patient and transfusion factors

Apart from the plasma metabolome profiles, significant diversity was observed among patients with TDT in terms of iron overload, hemolysis, redox balance, proteasome activity, and RBC clearance signaling. Sex-based differences reflect sexual dimorphism in pathways affected by the disease such as oxidative stress, immune system, and lipid metabolism. Gene expression profiling has confirmed sex-based disparities in disease impact, with better survival in females. Higher RBC PPA in female patients with TDT may contribute to these sex-related clinical differences, aligning with findings of better proteostasis in this group.

As mentioned earlier, splenectomy-related variables reflect susceptibility to thrombosisand oxidative stress, whereas higher pretransfusion Hb levels and shorter transfusion intervals were associated with milder physiological distortions, including RBC membrane PPA, that is indicative of lower oxidative burden and proteostasis stress. Those beneficial effects are consistent with landmark works showing that transfusing to Hb levels > 10 g/dL eliminates or greatly reduces morbidities and improves survival in thalassemia. Finally, it is well established that genotype classification can predict cardiovascular complications in TDT. In our study, more severe β-globin chain deficiencies were linked to reduced erythropoiesis, hemolysis, antioxidant capacity, and osmotic resistance, but increased coagulability and inflammation.

In summary, this study (1) identified novel disease features related to RBC proteostasis, ultrastructure, plasma EVs, and catecholamine metabolism among others; (2) measured variability among patients; and (3) defined associations with disease- and transfusion-related variables, such as pretransfusion Hb, extramedullary hematopoiesis, transfusion interval, and hemolysis (supplemental Table 3). The heterogeneity in genetic defects and modifiers, as well as in cellular and metabolome phenotypes, likely contributes to the broad clinical variability of TDT. These insights provide potential new therapeutic targets and underscore the need for longitudinal studies to track changes with disease progression or treatment.

### The hypercoagulable state in thalassemia [^114YSHww]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Thalassemia is a congenital hemolytic disorder caused by a partial or complete deficiency of alpha- or beta-globin chain synthesis. Homozygous carriers of beta-globin gene defects suffer from severe anemia and other serious complications from early childhood. The disease is treated by chronic blood transfusion. However, this can cause severe iron overload resulting in progressive organ failure. Some forms of alpha thalassemia are also associated with a similar clinical picture. Despite the difficulties associated with treatment, standards of care for thalassemic patients have improved in recent years, resulting in almost doubling of the average life expectancy. As a consequence, additional previously undescribed, complications are now being recognized. In particular, profound hemostatic changes have been observed in patients with beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) and beta-thalassemia intermedia (beta-TI) and also in patients with alpha thalassemia (hemoglobin H disease). The presence of a higher than normal incidence of thromboembolic events, mainly in beta-TI, and the existence of prothrombotic hemostatic anomalies in the majority of the patients, even from a very young age, have led to the recognition of the existence of a chronic hypercoagulable state in thalassemic patients. Despite the appearance of numerous publications on the frequent occurrence of thromboembolic complications in thalassemia, this complication has not been emphasized or comprehensively reviewed. This review summarizes the current literature and discusses possible mechanisms of the lifelong hypercoagulable state that exists in thalassemia.

### Editing an α-globin enhancer in primary human hematopoietic stem cells as a treatment for β-thalassemia [^1116NMTe]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thalassemia is a disorder of hemoglobin synthesis characterized by severe anemia, which requires intensive supportive treatment from early childhood. The most common and severe form of this disease (β-thalassemia) results from an absent or reduced production of normal β-globin chains. Most aspects of the pathophysiology of β-thalassemia can be explained by the presence of excess α-globin chains, which can no longer pair with the reduced numbers of β-globin chains, found in patients with β-thalassemia, to produce normal hemoglobin tetramers (α 2 β 2). Excess α-globin chains precipitate both in red cell precursors (causing ineffective erythropoiesis) and mature red cells (causing hemolysis). Clinical and genetic data have clearly shown that when α-thalassemia is co-inherited with β-thalassemia, there is reduced expression of the α-globin genes, less globin chain imbalance, and reduced numbers of free α-globin chains, significantly ameliorating the clinical severity of β-thalassemia. By contrast, inheritance of a higher than normal number of α-globin genes (5 or 6 rather than 4) substantially worsens the disease phenotype, emphasizing that excess α-globin chains are the major determinant of the clinical severity of β-thalassemia.

### Pulmonary hypertension in sickle cell disease: relevance to children [^113CW76B]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), once considered a rare complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassemia, appears to be more common in adults with hemoglobinopathy than previously appreciated. On prospective screening of adults with SCD, approximately one-third of adults are found on echocardiography to have a tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) of 2.5 m/s or higher, many of whom are asymptomatic. Dyspnea on exertion is the most common presenting symptom. This TRV abnormality is a marker for approximately 40% 3-year mortality in adults, and it is associated with laboratory values suggestive of more severe intravascular hemolysis. Release of hemoglobin and arginase from lysed red cells causes scavenging of nitric oxide (NO) and catabolism of L-arginine, the obligate substrate for NO synthase. The resulting impairment in NO bioavailability is associated with pulmonary vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, and eventual development of plexogenic arterial lesions, the histological hallmark of all forms of PAH. Undoubtedly, additional pathophysiological mechanisms will also play a role in its multifactorial pathogenesis. Early data from children with SCD indicate a similar prevalence of elevated TRV, but the prognostic implications of this remain to be established. Individual patient diagnosis of PAH requires confirmation by right heart catheterization studies and individualized management. Hemolysis-associated PAH with impairments in NO bioavailability is being identified in thalassemia and other hemolytic disorders, and may be a general consequence of long-standing, severe intravascular hemolytic anemia.

### The diagnostic dilemma of congenital unstable hemoglobinopathies [^111ejCYa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Unstable hemoglobin variants represent a rare etiology of congenital hemolytic anemia. Without a high index of suspicion, plus proper laboratory testing and interpretation, the correct diagnosis can be elusive. We report on five children who were initially thought to have other congenital disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia, before β-globin gene sequencing led to the definitive diagnosis. Recognizing the variable clinical presentation and laboratory data reported will aid clinicians in diagnosis of unstable hemoglobins variants in children with atypical forms of hemolytic anemia, particularly those with low pulse oximetry values or whose hemoglobin electrophoresis suggest β-thalassemia trait.

### Rare form of autosomal dominant thalassemia – hemoglobin hakkari [^113edLjZ]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Autosomal dominant Beta Thalassemias are rare and are due to point or frame shift mutations resulting in production of abnormal unstable beta chains of hemoglobin which precipitate leading to hemolysis and anemia. We describe a case of Hemoglobin Hakkari, a rare variant of dominant Thalassemia arising due to a de novo mutation in the exon 2 of the beta globin gene.

### Editing an α-globin enhancer in primary human hematopoietic stem cells as a treatment for β-thalassemia [^113uo8jB]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

β-Thalassemia is one of the most common inherited anemias, with no effective cure for most patients. The pathophysiology reflects an imbalance between α- and β-globin chains with an excess of free α-globin chains causing ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. When α-thalassemia is co-inherited with β-thalassemia, excess free α-globin chains are reduced significantly ameliorating the clinical severity. Here we demonstrate the use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of primary human hematopoietic stem/progenitor (CD34+) cells to emulate a natural mutation, which deletes the MCS-R2 α-globin enhancer and causes α-thalassemia. When edited CD34+ cells are differentiated into erythroid cells, we observe the expected reduction in α-globin expression and a correction of the pathologic globin chain imbalance in cells from patients with β-thalassemia. Xenograft assays show that a proportion of the edited CD34+ cells are long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells, demonstrating the potential of this approach for translation into a therapy for β-thalassemia.β-thalassemia is characterised by the presence of an excess of α-globin chains, which contribute to erythrocyte pathology. Here the authors use CRISP/Cas9 to reduce α-globin expression in hematopoietic precursors, and show effectiveness in xenograft assays in mice.

### What to transfuse: specifications for red cell products… [^1172PrUh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key facts about β thalassemia
- β thalassemia is caused by β-globin gene variants that reduce the production of adult hemoglobin, which may cause anemia.
- Chronic anemia can have serious consequences for people with β thalassemia. Children may experience: reduced activity, growth problems and delayed puberty, hepatosplenomegaly, osteopenia, and cognitive impairment. Adults may experience: fatigue, decline in capacity to work or perform usual activities, cognitive impairment, osteopenia, fractures, hypersplenism, and reduced quality of life.
- The primary management of severe anemia in β thalassemia is regular red blood cell transfusions. Healthcare providers can work with their blood bank partners to develop thalassemia-specific red blood cell transfusion protocols.

In selecting RBC products for patients receiving regular transfusions, it's important for the clinical team to carefully consider which products emphasize efficacy while also minimizing risk of hemolytic and non-hemolytic transfusion complications. What type of RBC product is needed by people with β thalassemia. The optimization of RBC products is vital when transfusing people with β thalassemia. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends.
- Leukoreduction of RBC units via filtration during the pre-storage period to prevent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions
- Storage of RBC units in additive solutions or citrate phosphate dextrose-adenine
- Using non-apheresis-derived RBC units for transfusions in adults due to smaller hemoglobin increments with apheresis-derived units. What type of RBC antigen matching is needed by people with β thalassemia.

Prevention of red cell alloimmunization is an important goal of transfusion management in thalassemia. Ideally, an individual's RBC genotyping is performed once the decision to initiate regular transfusions is made. The results of this typing determine their risk for developing alloantibodies and/or autoantibodies and determine the extent to which antigen-matched blood is needed. The Thalassemia Western Consortium recommends: The materials have been developed as a supplemental resource for healthcare providers, blood banks, and persons with thalassemia and their families to provide key information from a recent evidence-based report that details recommendations for the transfusion management of beta thalassemia in the United States.

### Elevated CDKN1A (P21) mediates β-thalassemia erythroid apoptosis, but its loss does not improve β-thalassemic erythropoiesis [^11164hMR]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

β-thalassemias are common hemoglobinopathies due to mutations in the β-globin gene that lead to hemolytic anemias. Premature death of β-thalassemic erythroid precursors results in ineffective erythroid maturation, increased production of erythropoietin (EPO), expansion of erythroid progenitor compartment, extramedullary erythropoiesis, and splenomegaly. However, the molecular mechanism of erythroid apoptosis in β-thalassemia is not well understood. Using a mouse model of β-thalassemia (Hbbth3/+), we show that dysregulated expression of the FOXO3 transcription factor is implicated in β-thalassemia erythroid apoptosis. In Foxo3-/-/Hbbth3/+ mice, erythroid apoptosis is significantly reduced, whereas erythroid cell maturation, and red blood cell and hemoglobin production are substantially improved even with elevated reactive oxygen species in double-mutant erythroblasts. However, persistence of elevated reticulocytes and splenomegaly suggests that ineffective erythropoiesis is not resolved in Foxo3-/-/Hbbth3/+. We found the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21), a FOXO3 target gene, is markedly upregulated in both mouse and patient-derived β-thalassemic erythroid precursors. Double-mutant p21/Hbbth3/+ mice exhibited embryonic lethality with only a fraction of mice surviving to weaning. Notably, studies in adult mice displayed greatly reduced apoptosis and circulating Epo in erythroid compartments of surviving p21-/-/Hbbth3/+ mice relative to Hbbth3/+ mice, whereas ineffective erythroid cell maturation, extramedullary erythropoiesis, and splenomegaly were not modified. These combined results suggest that mechanisms that control β-thalassemic erythroid cell survival and differentiation are uncoupled from ineffective erythropoiesis and involve a molecular network including FOXO3 and P21. Overall, these studies provide a new framework for investigating ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia.

### Biochemical surrogate markers of hemolysis do not correlate with directly measured erythrocyte survival in sickle cell anemia [^1168rp5G]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hemolysis is a key feature of sickle cell anemia (HbSS). Direct quantitation of hemolysis could be used as an objective outcome in clinical trials of new therapeutics for HbSS and would also enable better human studies of the pathogenesis of complications of HbSS that are ostensibly hemolysis-related, such as pulmonary hypertension. However, contemporary human studies in HbSS have used only surrogate markers of hemolysis rather than direct measurements of RBC survival. We directly quantified hemolysis in HbSS by measuring survival of an age cohort of RBCs labeled with a stable isotope, administered orally as 15 N-glycine, a metabolic precursor of heme. The atomic excess of 15 N in heme extracted from blood was monitored by mass spectrometry over time. We performed 13 labeling experiments in 11 individuals with HbSS. Mean RBC survival was 31.9 days (range 14.1–53.6). Both HbF level, a known determinant of hemolysis, and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC), an index of the marrow's response to hemolysis, correlated with directly measured RBC survival (r = 0.61, P < 0.002; r = -0.84, P < 0.001). However, commonly used biochemical surrogates of hemolysis (LDH, AST, bilirubin, and plasma free hemoglobin) did not correlate with directly measured RBC survival. These biochemical surrogates should be interpreted cautiously, at best, in clinical trials and human physiologic studies in HbSS. ARC was the best correlate of total hemolysis, but only 70% of the variation in RBC survival was reflected in this marker. If greater accuracy is required in human studies, 15 N-glycine RBC labeling can directly and accurately quantify hemolysis. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1195–1201, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Ineffective erythropoiesis and its treatment [^114Xdu4m]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The erythroid marrow and circulating red blood cells (RBCs) are the key components of the human erythron. Abnormalities of the erythron that are responsible for anemia can be separated into 3 major categories: erythroid hypoproliferation, ineffective erythropoiesis, and peripheral hemolysis. Ineffective erythropoiesis is characterized by erythropoietin-driven expansion of early-stage erythroid precursors, associated with apoptosis of late-stage precursors. This mechanism is primarily responsible for anemia in inherited disorders like β-thalassemia, inherited sideroblastic anemias, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, as well as in acquired conditions like some subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The inherited anemias that are due to ineffective erythropoiesis are also defined as iron-loading anemias because of the associated parenchymal iron loading caused by the release of erythroid factors that suppress hepcidin production. Novel treatments specifically targeting ineffective erythropoiesis are being developed. Iron restriction through enhancement of hepcidin activity or inhibition of ferroportin function has been shown to reduce ineffective erythropoiesis in murine models of β-thalassemia. Luspatercept is a transforming growth factor-β ligand trap that inhibits SMAD2/3 signaling. Based on preclinical and clinical studies, this compound is now approved for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with β-thalassemia who require regular RBC transfusions. Luspatercept is also approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent anemia in patients with MDS with ring sideroblasts, most of whom carry a somatic SF3B1 mutation. While the long-term effectiveness and safety of luspatercept need to be evaluated in β-thalassemia and MDS, defining the molecular mechanisms of ineffective erythropoiesis in different disorders might allow the discovery of new effective compounds.

### Growth and endocrinopathies among children with β-thalassemia major treated at dubai thalassemia centre [^114FXciC]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

β-Thalassemia major (BTM) is a heterogenous group of hemolytic anemias that have an autosomal recessive inheritance. Anemia can result from reduced synthesis (β+) or complete absence (β0) of production of the β-globin's hemoglobin chain. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. Patients with BTM receive blood transfusion on regular basis loading the body with iron at a rate of 0.3–0.6 mg/kg/day and with the fact that the human body has poor mechanism of eliminating iron from the body. The excess iron is deposited in different organs predominantly in the heart, liver, and endocrine glands giving rise to medical complications from iron toxicity, oxidative stress, and cell death. The cardiac complications, such as left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, valvulopathies, arrhythmias and pericarditis, are the leading cause of death in patients with BTM. Iron overload can disrupt the normal coaptation of the valve leaflets, resulting in incomplete closure and regurgitation of blood. Valvar regurgitation can lead to volume overload of the affected chambers of the heart, potentially causing further complications and impairing cardiac function. Also, the liver is affected as iron overload can lead to liver failure and cirrhosis.

### Measures of cellular oxidative damage following vitamin E supplementation in young patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112yWHpw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellular oxidative damage occurs when the body has an imbalance of antioxidants and oxidants. This leads to the oxidation of cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA, which causes cell damage. The leading causes of cellular oxidative damage generated in thalassemia are the degradation of excessive, uncoupled and unstable hemoglobin (Hb) chains in erythroid precursors and iron overload. These subsequently aggravate the production of free radicals and lead to hemolysis. Various forms of cellular oxidative damage occur in thalassemia patients, including blood cell membrane lipid peroxidation and generation of blood cell pathology, including phosphatidylserine (PS)-bearing cells, PS-bearing cell vesicles, formation of microparticles (MPs) (alternatively named membrane vesicles or medium extracellular vesicles) and platelet activation.

PS is a negatively charged phospholipid typically located in the inner layer of cell membranes. In thalassemia patients, excessive membrane lipid peroxidation of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets results in a flip of PS from the inner to the outer layer of membranes. These pathologic cells are referred to as PS-bearing RBCs and PS-bearing platelets. In addition to the sequential worsening of ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis, increased formation of PS-bearing RBCs, as well as PS-bearing platelets, were found to be associated with the hypercoagulable state in thalassemia patients by activating the coagulation cascade and stimulating platelets. MPs are small membrane vesicles, size 0.1–1 μm in diameter, shed from cells undergoing activation or apoptosis. PS-bearing MPs stemming from PS-bearing RBCs and PS-bearing platelets were found at higher levels in β-thalassemia patients than in healthy individuals. Particularly, these PS-bearing MPs were significantly higher in splenectomized compared to non-splenectomized patients. Elevated level of MPs is an additional factor contributing to the hypercoagulable state and occurrence of thromboembolic events in β-thalassemia patients in reported literatures, as these MPs were shown to induce platelet activation, platelet aggregation, platelet-neutrophil aggregation and endothelial activation.

### Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias [^112mQgA9]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias include a variety of phenotypes that, unlike patients with beta (β)-thalassemia major, do not require regular transfusion therapy for survival. The most commonly investigated forms are β-thalassemia intermedia, hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia, and α-thalassemia intermedia (hemoglobin H disease). However, transfusion-independence in such patients is not without side effects. Ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis, the hallmarks of disease process, lead to a variety of subsequent pathophysiologies including iron overload and hypercoagulability that ultimately lead to a number of serious clinical morbidities. Thus, prompt and accurate diagnosis of non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia is essential to ensure early intervention. Although several management options are currently available, the need to develop more novel therapeutics is justified by recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of disease. Such efforts require wide international collaboration, especially since non-transfusion-dependent thalassemias are no longer bound to low- and middle-income countries but have spread to large multiethnic cities in Europe and the Americas due to continued migration.

### Β-thalassemias: paradigmatic diseases for scientific discoveries and development of innovative therapies [^116vNx3d]. Haematologica (2015). Low credibility.

β-thalassemias are monogenic disorders characterized by defective synthesis of the β-globin chain, one of the major components of adult hemoglobin. A large number of mutations in the β-globin gene or its regulatory elements have been associated with β-thalassemias. Due to the complexity of the regulation of the β-globin gene and the role of red cells in many physiological processes, patients can manifest a large spectrum of phenotypes, and clinical requirements vary from patient to patient. It is important to consider the major differences in the light of potential novel therapeutics. This review summarizes the main discoveries and mechanisms associated with the synthesis of β-globin and abnormal erythropoiesis, as well as current and novel therapies.

### Sickle trait and alpha thalassemia increase NOS-dependent vasodilation of human arteries through disruption of endothelial hemoglobin-eNOS interactions [^113U28tf]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

To better understand the evolving role of endothelial alpha globin in human arterial vasoregulation, we sought to characterize the expression, binding partners, and subcellular localization of alpha globin in resistance arteries obtained from human omental and subcutaneous adipose tissues. We found that human arteries express not only the alpha but also the beta subunit of hemoglobin. We used molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation to understand the revised hemoglobin-eNOS signaling complex and designed mimetic peptides that targeted the newly discovered interactions between beta globin and eNOS. We demonstrate that disrupting eNOS–beta globin or eNOS–alpha globin interactions increases NO signaling and inhibits vasoconstriction of human arteries. Last, we study individuals heterozygous for genetic variants in either the alpha or beta globin genes to understand the effects of these mutations on arterial vasoregulation and blood pressure. We focused on heterozygous individuals to avoid the potentially confounding effects of anemia, hemolysis, and NO scavenging that can lead to chronic vasculopathy in people living with homozygous sickle cell disease. –

Based on the studies presented herein, we propose that sickle cell trait, in which an amino acid substitution disrupts the interactions of beta globin with eNOS, and alpha thalassemia, in which vascular expression of alpha globin is decreased, both converge on a common phenotype of increased NO synthase (NOS)–dependent feedback vasodilation. This finding offers new insight into the vascular physiology of 2 common human hemoglobinopathies and highlights a potential mechanism by which sickle cell trait and alpha thalassemia might confer protection against severe malaria, – a disease characterized by impaired NO bioavailability and endothelial dysfunction. – Furthermore, these studies highlight specific structures, some of which may have been selected by malaria for their critical role in regulating NO signaling, that could potentially be targeted to treat severe malaria and other diseases in which endothelial NO signaling is impaired.

Our understanding of the molecular pathways and associated clinical presentations characterizing various thalassemia phenotypes has substantially improved over the years. Non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassemia (NTDT) refers to patients who present with mild–moderate anemia, which does not necessitate lifelong, regular transfusion therapy. This typically includes patients with β‐thalassemia intermedia, mild–moderate hemoglobin E/β‐thalassemia, and α‐thalassemia intermedia (hemoglobin H disease) (Figure 1). The underlying α/non‐α globin chain imbalance and subsequent ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis lead to chronic anemia, primary iron overload, and a hypercoagulable state. These, in turn, are associated with a range of clinical morbidities that can impact quality of life and lead to premature death (Figure 2). In view of the growing evidence on the negative impact of untreated anemia in these patients, long‐term management becomes key. However, the only options that have been available so far include transfusions which can worsen iron overload and introduce transfusion‐dependence burden, off‐label use of hydroxyurea based on data from small trials or observational studies, and splenectomy which is associated with increased risks of infections and thrombosis (Figure 3). Beyond anemia, cumulative iron overload due to increased intestinal iron absorption needs to be regularly monitored and managed with iron chelation therapy. Multimorbidity in NTDT also requires close monitoring and early intervention through a multidisciplinary team approach (Figure 4). In the last decade, we have witnessed several novel agents being developed to manage anemia in NTDT. Agents targeting hepcidin dysregulation have not been successful in clinical trials, despite encouraging data in animal models. Luspatercept, an erythroid maturation agent, showed efficacy in improving hemoglobin level in adults with β‐NTDT and is now approved in Europe (but not the United States). Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator, has also shown efficacy in improving hemoglobin level and functional status in a recent phase 3 trials in adult patients with both α‐ and β‐NTDT (Figure 5). Clinical management guidelines are now available, but awareness of the various morbidities and treatment options in NTDT, especially among patients remains essential (a patient friendly summary is provided in the Appendix S1).

### Beta-thalassemia cardiomyopathy: history, present considerations, and future perspectives [^115iM8Re]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Beta-thalassemia is an inherited hemoglobin disorder resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia that typically requires life-long transfusion therapy. Although traditionally prevalent in the Mediterranean basin, Middle East, North India, and Southeast Asia, immigration of those populations to North America and Western Europe has rendered beta-thalassemia a global health problem. Cardiac complications represent the primary cause of mortality and one of the major causes of morbidity in those patients. Heart disease is mainly expressed by a particular cardiomyopathy that progressively leads to heart failure and death. The beta-thalassemia cardiomyopathy is mainly characterized by 2 distinct phenotypes, a dilated phenotype, with left ventricular dilatation and impaired contractility and a restrictive phenotype, with restrictive left ventricular filling, pulmonary hypertension, and right heart failure. The pathophysiology of the disorder is multifactorial, with a central role of myocardial iron overload and the significant contribution of immunoinflammatory mechanisms. Patients' management is demanding and requires a multidisciplinary approach, preferably in specialized centers.

### Challenges in chronic transfusion for patients with thalassemia [^114wgacS]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The introduction of regular red cell transfusions 60 years ago transformed β-thalassemia major from a fatal childhood illness into a chronic disorder. Further advances in the prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections and management of iron overload have allowed survival and quality of life to approach normal. However, transfusion therapy for some other thalassemia syndromes continues to challenge clinical decision-making. Nearly one-half of the patients with E ß thalassemia are transfusion-dependent, yet the criteria for initiating transfusions or hemoglobin targets are not well defined. Patients with thalassemia intermedia who begin transfusions as adults are at very high risk for developing red cell alloimmunization and serious hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the growing number of survivors of Bart hydrops fetalis, the approach to transfusion therapy and iron chelation is rapidly evolving. A collaboration between hematology and transfusion medicine specialists will be essential to improving patient care and developing evidence-based guidelines.

### Disease burden, management strategies, and unmet needs in α-thalassemia due to hemoglobin H disease [^114KYFjE]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alpha-thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused by impaired α-globin chain production, leading to anemia and other complications. Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease is caused by a combination of mutations generally affecting the expression of three of four α-globin alleles; disease severity is highly heterogeneous, largely driven by genotype. Notably, non-deletional mutations cause a greater degree of ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis, higher transfusion burden, and increased complication risks versus deletional mutations. There are limited treatment options for HbH disease, and effective therapies are needed. This review discusses the pathophysiology of HbH disease, current management strategies, unmet needs, and emerging treatment options.

### Mutations and polymorphisms in hemoglobin genes and the risk of pulmonary hypertension and death in sickle cell disease [^115Tykcf]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and a risk factor for early death. Hemolysis may participate in its pathogenesis by limiting nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and producing vasculopathy. We hypothesized that hemoglobin mutations that diminish hemolysis in SCD would influence pulmonary hypertension susceptibility. Surprisingly, coincident alpha-thalassemia (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.46–1.94, P = NS) was not associated with pulmonary hypertension susceptibility in homozygous SCD. However, pulmonary hypertension cases were less likely to have hemoglobin SC (OR = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06–0.51, P = 0.0005) or Sbeta(+) thalassemia (OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.06–1.16, P = 0.10). These compound heterozygotes may be protected from pulmonary hypertension because of reduced levels of intravascular hemolysis, but develop this complication at a lower rate possibly due to the presence of non-hemolytic risk factors such as renal dysfunction, iron overload and advancing age. Despite this protective association, patients with SC who did develop pulmonary hypertension remained at significant risk for death during 49 months of follow-up (Hazard Ratio = 8.20, P = 0.0057).

### Β-thalassemia minor&renal tubular dysfunction: is there any association? [^114GkMRw]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

β-thalassemia is one of the most common hereditary hematologic disorders, characterized by disturbances in beta chain hemoglobin synthesis. It is the most common single-gene disorder in Iran and more than 25,000 major β-thalassemia have been reported. Three main clinical forms of β-thalassemia include thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia (TI) and (TM). Patients with TM or Cooley's anemia require regular transfusions before age 24 months to survive. Thalassemia intermedia patients do not require or rarely require blood transfusions. They may be asymptomatic up to adulthood but their sign and symptoms include biliary gallstone, jaundice, osteoporosis, hepatosplenomegaly and mass lesions related to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Individuals with TM or thalassemia carries have mild anemia with no or minimal symptoms. Clinical manifestations of beta thalassemia result from one or both beta globin gene mutations. Patients with TM are homozygotes or double heterozygotes, TI results from heterozygotes or homozygote and individuals with TM are heterozygote for beta gene mutations.

Thalassemia can be sub grouped to transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Phenotype of NTDT includes heterogeneous thalassemia genotypes that do not require frequent transfusions but is more severe than TM and have several complications due to ineffective erythropoiesis, extramedullary hematopoiesis and iron overload. Five form of NTDT has been described: beta thalassemia intermedia, hemoglobin E β-thalassemia, HbH disease, hemoglobin S β-thalassemia and hemoglobin C β thalassemia.

The improved TM and TI survival has allowed previously unrecognized renal complications to emerge. The effect of thalassemia on the kidney has not been extensively evaluated. Up to 60% of patients with beta-thalassemia major have been reported to develop signs of tubular dysfunction.

Renal dysfunction is an uncommon complication in patients with β-thalassemia. Mild impairment of tubular function and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) have been reported in older patients with alpha-thalassemia, β-thalassemia major and hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia. Tubular dysfunction among patients with beta-thalassemia has been related to long-term anemia with chronic hypoxemia, intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, chronic blood transfusions, iron overload, as well as desferrioxamine toxicity. Regular screening of renal function in high-risk thalassemia patients with diabetes, hypertension, proteinuria and GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and elderly people in order to detect early renal involvement and thus prevent the onset of renal impairment is recommended.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of genetic disorders arising from a single point mutation in the hemoglobin subunit beta gene (HBB), leading to the formation of sickle hemoglobin (hemoglobin S, HbS). HbS can occur in homozygosity (HbSS), known as sickle cell anemia (SCA), or compound heterozygosity with complicit hemoglobin variants, most commonly HbC (forming HbSC). Despite this relatively uniform genetic origin, the clinical phenotype varies widely. Co‐inherited genetic variations are thought to contribute a significant element to this phenotypic diversity.

α‐Thalassemia is regarded as one of the primary genetic modifiers of severity in SCD. In people of Sub‐Saharan African descent, α‐thalassemia is most commonly caused by the 3.7‐kb α‐deletion denoted −α 3.7. Other deletions, including −α 4.2, and various small deletions and point mutations can also be seen; however, double α‐globin deletions α −/− do not commonly occur. It is estimated that 30–35% of patients with SCD are heterozygous (αα/α−) and 3–5% homozygous for the deletion (α−/α−).

Abstract

Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is a type of protein aggregation disease. Its clinical heterogeneity imposes challenges in effective management. Red blood cell (RBC) variables may be clinically relevant as mechanistic parts or tellers of TDT pathophysiology. This is a cross-sectional study of RBC and plasma physiology in adult patients with TDT vs healthy control. TDT plasma was characterized by increased protein carbonylation, antioxidants, and larger than normal extracellular vesicles. RBCs were osmotically resistant but prone to oxidative hemolysis. They overexposed phosphatidylserine and exhibited pathologically low proteasome proteolytic activity (PPA), which correlated with metabolic markers of the disease. RBC ultrastructure was distorted, with splenectomy-related membrane pits of 300 to 800 nm. Plasma metabolomics revealed differences in heme metabolism, redox potential, short-chain fatty acids, and nitric oxide bioavailability, but also in catecholamine pathways. According to coefficient of variation assessment, hemolysis, iron homeostasis, PPA, and phosphatidylserine exposure were highly variable among patients, as opposed to RBC fragility and plasma antioxidants, amino acids, and catecholamines. Sex-based differences were detected in hemolysis, redox, and energy variables, whereas splenectomy-related differences referred to thrombotic risk, RBC morphology, and plasma metabolites with neuroendocrine activity. Hepcidin varied according to oxidative hemolysis and metabolic markers of bacterial activity. Patients with higher pretransfusion hemoglobin levels (> 10 g/dL) presented mildly distorted profiles and lower membrane-associated PPA, whereas classification by severity of mutations revealed different levels of hemostasis, inflammation, plasma epinephrine, hexosamines, and methyltransferase activity markers. The currently reported heterogeneity of cellular and biochemical features probably contributes to the wide phenotypic diversity of TDT at clinical level.

### Bone disease in thalassemia: a frequent and still unresolved problem [^111RsjCt]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study found a high prevalence of low BMD, fractures, and bone pain in both β and α thalassemia syndromes. It showed a strong association between bone mass and fractures, and it identified factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of bone disease in thalassemia. Bone disease would be expected to be less severe with mild or moderate hemolysis, as is generally found in patients with β TI, HbH disease, or HbH/CS. Indeed, bone mass was lower among β TM and E-β and higher among β TI, HbH disease, and HbH/CS. However, the effect of thalassemia syndrome seemed to be caused by underlying differences in growth, hypogonadism, and bone turnover, so that hypogonadal and lighter patients with high bone turnover had a higher likelihood of low BMD among all thalassemia syndromes.

### Introduction to the thalassemia syndromes: molecular medicine's index case [^114P2CTQ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Thalassemia is a heterogeneous group of inherited anemias having in common defective biosynthesis of one or more of the globin chain subunits of human hemoglobin. Their origins lie in inherited mutations that impair the expression of the affected globin genes. Their pathophysiology arises from the consequent insufficiency of hemoglobin production and the imbalance in the production of globin chains resulting in the accumulation of insoluble unpaired chains. These precipitate and damage or destroy developing erythroblasts and erythrocytes producing ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolytic anemia. Treatment of severe cases requires lifelong transfusion support with iron chelation therapy.

### Pathogenic mechanisms in thalassemia I: ineffective erythropoiesis and hypercoagulability [^114cgezr]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Erythropoiesis is the physiological process that results in the production of red blood cells (RBCs). In conditions of pathologically altered erythropoiesis or ineffective erythropoiesis, as in the case of β-thalassemia, the reduced ability of erythrocytes to differentiate, survive and deliver oxygen stimulates a state of stress that leads to the ineffective production of RBCs. We herein describe the main features of erythropoiesis and its regulation in addition to the mechanisms behind ineffective erythropoiesis development in β-thalassemia. Finally, we review the pathophysiology of hypercoagulability and vascular disease development in β-thalassemia and the currently available prevention and treatment modalities.

4 DISCUSSION

This study considers the various effects of α‐thalassemia in a large cohort of individuals with HbSS and HbSC‐disease. We confirm many well‐described effects of α‐thalassemia, such as that on red cell indices, total Hb, and markers of hemolysis, and go on to identify a number of important novel observations.

We found that co‐inheritance of α‐thalassemia significantly decreased the activity of the KCC co‐transporter, an effect that was most notable in patients with HbSC. This co‐transporter is markedly upregulated in sickle red cells, particularly in patients with HbSC diseaseand is thought to be an important driver of red cell dehydration. The mechanism by which α‐thalassemia induces a milder phenotype in HbSC, has so far been poorly understood. By demonstrating a significant reduction in KCC activity in the red cells of patients with HbSC, we have identified a novel biological mechanism by which α‐thalassemia may be acting in these patients to improve the cation content of the red cell and reduce the rate of hemoglobin polymerization. This concurs with our previous observation that lower KCC activity is associated with fewer clinical complications in HbSC disease. This effect on KCC co‐transporter activity was also seen in the HbSS cohort. The reduction in red cell dehydration is likely to be an important mechanism of the anti‐sickling effect of α‐thalassemia and may contribute to the improved rheological characteristics of sickle erythrocytes where α‐thalassemia is present. Exactly how co‐inheritance of α‐thalassemia and sickle Hb results in a reduced activity of KCC is an important question. KCC is regulated by protein phosphorylation involving a cascade of protein kinases and phosphatases. It also responds to cell volume, probably via effects on macromolecular crowding, and also to other modalities such as oxygen tension and pH. Some of these involve interactions between hemoglobin and the cytoplasmic tail of band 3 (the anion exchanger) and have been shown to affect phosphorylation status of the red cell cotransporters. We speculate that reduced levels of alpha chain impact one or more of these pathways, ultimately increasing phosphorylation of a key regulatory step leading to reduction in KCC activity. It is also possible that KCC activity is related to the rate of HbS polymerization in an undefined way, and that the change in KCC activity is caused by the reduced rate of polymerization associated with α‐thalassemia. Addressing these postulates will likely require careful analysis of the red cell phosphoproteome.

### Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patients with β-thalassemia major [^1125wymg]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Hemolysis is a common feature in patients with β-thalassemia major. As a result, autoimmune hemolytic anemia complicating β-thalassemia is easily overlooked. Here, the authors described the clinical features and management of 7 patients with β-thalassemia major and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. These patients had fever, cough, and tea-colored urine on admission. The laboratory investigations showed a significant drop in hemoglobin and increased serum bilirubin. Coombs' tests revealed that anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) and anti-C3 was positive in 7 and 5 cases, respectively, whereas anti-Rh E alloantibody was positive in 3 cases. All the patients received corticosteroids treatments and blood transfusions. Patients with anti-Rh E alloantibodies also received immunoglobulin treatments. Six of the patients responded well to the management, but 1 patient developed recurrent autoimmune hemolytic anemia that required cyclosporin A treatment. All the patients remained well by following up for more than 6 months.

### Β-thalassemia and ocular implications: a systematic review [^115ba4cs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thalassemia is a severe genetic blood disorder caused by a mutation in the globin gene. Abnormal globin chains lead to the excessive destruction of red blood cells. The phenotypes of homozygous or genetic heterozygous compound beta-thalassemias include thalassemia major (TM) and thalassemia intermedia (TI). Individuals with thalassemia major usually come to medical attention within the first two years of life. These patients require lifelong RBC transfusions at regular intervals to survive. Thalassemia intermedia includes patients with milder symptoms, who present at an older age and do not require regular transfusions. More than 42,000 newborns are affected by Beta-thalassemia every year worldwide. Without blood transfusions, Beta-thalassemia major (TM) causes death amongst infected children before the age of 3 years old. Although transfusions can prevent death and decrease mortality, iron accumulated from transfused red blood cells can lead to organ failure. Iron chelation treatment, to reduce iron store in the body and improve the long-term survival rate of patients with TM, is considered a mandatory adjuvant therapy.

As a group, the thalassemias are the most common single gene disorder in the world. High prevalence occurs in developing regions as well as in large multiethnic Western cities due to an expanding immigrant population. The inheritance of β-thalassemias is recessive. The mutations in the β-globin gene and consequent defective β-chain production leads to a devastating cascade: imbalance in α/β- globin chain synthesis, ineffective erythropoiesis, reduced red blood cell survival and subsequent anemia. Although the disease is confirmed genetically, the phenotype of β-thalassemia is determined based on clinical observation.

Therapeutic measures resulted in a progressive improvement in life expectancy in both developed and developing countries. Increased awareness, better education and optimal health care provision efforts, a large body of evidence attained by clinical trials and observational studies conducted in the last 3 decades, allowed for remarkable advances in diagnostic and therapeutic options. Milestones in this effort include the introduction of guidelines for safe processing of blood products, noninvasive techniques for the assessment of iron overload in target organs, oral iron chelators, and prevention/management schemes for specific complications.

### How I treat hypoxia in adults with hemoglobinopathies and hemolytic disorders [^115XnfEq]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies are caused by genetic mutations that result in abnormal hemoglobin molecules, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Chronic complications involving the lung parenchyma, vasculature, and cardiac function in hemoglobinopathies result in impaired gas exchange, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Hypoxia is defined as the deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body and is prevalent in patients with hemoglobinopathies, and its cause is often multifactorial. Chronic hypoxia in hemoglobinopathies is often a sign of disease severity and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of hypoxia in these disease processes is important in order to appropriately treat the underlying cause and prevent complications. In this article, we discuss management of hypoxia based on three different cases: sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis. These cases are used to review the current understanding of the disease pathophysiology, demonstrate the importance of a thorough clinical history and physical examination, explore diagnostic pathways, and review the current management.

Clinical manifestations of α-thalassemia range from no symptoms to severe transfusion-dependent anemia. Alpha thalassemia trait is deletion of 1 to 2 α-globin genes, whereas α-thalassemia major (ATM; Barts hydrops fetalis) is the deletion all 4 α genes. All other genotypes of intermediate severity are categorized as HbH disease, a vastly heterogenous group. Clinical spectrum is classified as mild, moderate, and severe by symptoms and need for intervention. Anemia in prenatal period may be fatal without intrauterine transfusions. New therapies to modify HbH disease or provide cure for ATM are under development.

### Treating iron overload in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia [^1148KQxz]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Why iron overload matters: complications

Complications in NTDT patients result from a number of factors, primarily ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic anemia, and hemolysis, and iron overload. Although some commonalities exist, the range of complications seen in patients with NTDT is distinct from those observed in the transfusion-dependent thalassemias.

Complications common to different types of NTDT include extramedullary hematopoiesis, thrombosis, and pulmonary hypertension (PHT), leg ulcers, hepatic disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholelithiasis, endocrinopathies, and bone disease. The rate of many of these complications increases with age. Nevertheless, it is thought that increased iron accumulation underlies some of these complications or contributes in some way to their severity. Observational studies have reported positive associations between iron overload and various morbidities in NTDT. Musallam et al recently found a strong correlation between the rate of change in serum ferritin level and the rate of change in transient elastography values (a measure of hepatic stiffness predictive of fibrosis) in a group of non-transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia intermedia. The results from this study clearly show that in NTDT, decreases in serum ferritin by means of iron chelation are associated with improvements in measures of hepatic fibrosis. There is also evidence of HCC in patients with NTDT. Hepatic manifestations of iron overload in NTDT therefore appear to resemble the reports of hepatic complication due to iron overload in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and β-thalassemia major–.

An association between iron overload and endocrine/bone disease was also observed in a cross-sectional study that recruited 168 patients with β-thalassemia intermedia, especially those with a LIC ≥ 6 mg Fe/g dw, further echoing data from β-thalassemia major patients. Ineffective erythropoiesis and age could still be potential confounders for the association between iron overload and osteoporosis. However, after adjustment for both risk factors in the aforementioned study, the association between iron overload and osteoporosis persisted. Evidence for a toxic role of iron on bone metabolism does exist. Also, a study from Thailand showed by means of bone histomorphometric analyses that suboptimally transfused thalassemia patients with osteopenia and osteoperosis have impaired bone matrix maturation, defective mineralization and focal iron deposition. In this study 12 of the 17 enrolled patients had NTDT (HbE/β-thalassemia).

DISCUSSION

This is the first study of World Health Organization–recommended weekly PQ therapy in Southeast Asia in which changes in the Hb level and other hemolytic markers over time are reported for patients with P. vivax malaria who have moderately severe G6PD deficiency or are G6PD normal. A minority of patients experienced marked decreases in the Hb level after the first PQ dose, including 1 patient who was transfused, but thereafter G6PD − patients were tolerant of additional doses. G6PD status was the most consistent determinant of the degree of acute hemolytic anemia and recovery, whereas thalassemia and baseline parasite count were important contributors.

We reconfirm the greater posttreatment decrease in the uninfected RBC count as compared to infected RBCs (ratio, approximately 90 to 1), which is a higher figure than the ratio (34 to 1) reported in experimentally infected patients, and we identified factors pertinent only to the decreased uninfected RBC count. These findings support the important role of extravascular hemolysis as a major mechanism in the pathogenesis of anemia following treatment.

The contribution of thalassemia to the initial decrease in Hb level, through the enhanced decrease in the uninfected RBC count, is a new finding. HbE is very common in our region and, like β-thalassemia minor, is characterized by mild anemia and a rigid (ie, less deformable) and fragile RBC membrane; by contrast, α-thalassemic RBCs only have rigid membranes. These membrane characteristics result in increased RBC destruction in the spleen.

A higher baseline parasite count was also associated with a greater initial decrease in Hb level and can be explained by a greater inflammatory response and oxidant environment, possibly enhancing physiological RBC destruction. Limited data suggest that intravascular hemolysis in P. vivax malaria is independent of the inflammatory response, consistent with the hypothesized dominance of extravascular hemolysis in hemolytic responses to therapy. Moreover, the observed low urine Hillmen scores support the relatively small contribution of intravascular hemolysis with weekly PQ dosing.

Intertwining biological networks in stored red blood cells and supernatants

In order to find out major aspects of bThal + RBC physiology, able to interconnect the in vivo / ex vivo states, and thus, to reveal the "effect" (if any) of baseline variables upon storage, we proceeded to comparative bThal + versus control in vivo / ex vivo network analysis.

Our findings highlighted osmotic hemolysis as a "hub" parameter in bThal + networks, with significant differences in the type and the amount of connections between the groups. The osmotic fragility of stored bThal + RBC exhibited strong correlations with several biochemical (e.g. transferrin, r = 0.560, P < 0.01), cellular (e.g. RBC mechanical hemolysis, r = 0.771, P < 0.01), protein and metabolic (e.g. L-arginine, r = 0.697, sphingosine-1-phosphate, r = -0.636, P < 0.01) parameters of bThal + RBC and plasma, in striking contrast to the controls (Figure 7A). Notably, in the case of bThal + RBC, fragility variation during storage was less correlated to the in vivo levels of fatty acids but more correlated to those of carboxylic acids, compared to control. Despite the above-mentioned differences, osmotic hemolysis during storage was found interrelated with the in vivo levels of RBC aging markers and energy metabolism in both donor groups.

### Gene therapy in transfusion-dependent non-β 0 / β 0 genotype β-thalassemia: first real-world experience of beti-cel [^114iY47e]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

β-thalassemia is an autosomal recessive, single-gene disorder that is caused by > 350 different mutations of the β-globin gene. These mutations lead to reduced (β⁺) or absent (β 0) β-globin chain production and α-globin chain aggregation in erythroid precursors as well as ineffective erythropoiesis, microcytic anemia, hypochromic anemia, and hemolysis. Patients with homozygous or a compound heterozygous genotype require lifelong red blood cell (RBC) transfusions; this is referred to as transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT), also known as thalassemia major. Regular packed RBC (pRBC) transfusions can correct for anemia but result in iron overload requiring iron chelation therapy. Despite advances in thalassemia care, patient life expectancy remains lower than the general population, and disease management remains a substantial burden for patients and their caregivers.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been available as a curative treatment option with favorable outcomes for patients with TDT, including young patients with limited iron overload and a HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) or HLA-matched unrelated donor. However, MSD availability has been limited in communities with small families and in groups not well represented in international donor registries. The use of mismatched family donors has been associated with substantial mortality and morbidity due to acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, graft rejection, and infertility. Although these factors have limited the feasibility of HSCT from mismatched donors, improvements in the conditioning regimen tailored for HSCT for TDT from haploidentical donors has resulted in promising outcomes with this treatment modality.

Recent clinical studies have shown that gene therapy, either through gene addition of functional copies of a modified β-globin gene (HBB) by lentiviral vector (LVV) or gene editing of BCL11A enhancer to induce fetal hemoglobin (Hb) expression by CRISPR/CRISPR–associated protein 9, results in transfusion independence (TI) in most patients with TDT aged ≥ 12 years irrespective of genotype, including patients as young as 4 years of age with lentiviral-based gene therapy.

### Beta thalassemia: monitoring and new treatment approaches [^11746xaS]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta thalassemias are a significant global health problem. Globin chain imbalance leads to a complex physiologic cascade of hemolytic anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron overload. Management of the broad spectrum of phenotypes requires the careful use of red blood transfusions, supportive care, monitoring, and management of iron overload. In this article, the authors discuss recommendations for monitoring of individuals with thalassemia, as well as ongoing preclinical and clinical trials of therapies targeting different aspects of thalassemia pathophysiology.

### Vasculo-toxic and pro-inflammatory action of unbound haemoglobin, haem and iron in transfusion-dependent patients with haemolytic anaemias [^111g67dW]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blood diseases such as sickle cell disease (SCD), β‐thalassaemia (β‐thal) and hereditary spherocytosis (SPH) are hallmarked by haemolysis, leading to cell‐free haemoglobin (Hb) release in the circulation. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Mechanistically haemolysis can be extra‐ or intra‐vascular. While extra‐vascular haemolysis involves red blood cell (RBC) phagocytosis by hepatic and splenic macrophages of the reticulo‐endothelial system, and accounts for most haemolytic events in β‐thal and hereditary SPH, intravascular haemolysis occurs in the form of erythrocyte destruction within the blood vessel lumen and accounts for one‐third of the haemolytic process in SCD. 5

Previous work showed that circulating free Hb levels are increased in these diseases and haptoglobin (Hp), the Hb scavenger is reduced. Hp is part of a detoxification system in mammals that scavenges haemolysis by‐products in the circulation and promotes intracellular metabolism. 1, 2, 9 This detoxification system also includes the haem scavenger haemopexin (Hx) and the cellular enzymes haem‐oxygenases (HO‐1 and ‐2). 9, 10 Hp and Hx, by binding with high affinity Hb and haem, respectively, deliver Hb to macrophages and haem to hepatocytes, thus preventing their pro‐oxidant action in the circulation and non‐specific uptake in non‐target cells. 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 Within cells, HOs degrade the haem porphyrin into iron, carbon monoxide and biliverdin, thus exerting primary anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidant and anti‐apoptotic effects. 10, 16, 17, 18, 19 Once iron is released, the ferritin heavy chain (H‐Ferritin) oxidises ferrous iron (Fe 2+) to catalytically inactive ferric iron (Fe 3+) through its ferroxidase activity and allows iron storage inside ferritin light chain (L‐Ferritin). 20, 21, 22 Due to a high rate of haemolysis, haem detoxification systems are often saturated in haemolytic diseases. 1, 11, 23, 24, 25 While Hp is used as a clinical marker for haemolysis and its reduction in SCD, β‐thal and SPH is known; the modulation and comparison of haem‐related parameters across different haemolytic diseases is less clear.

### Thalassemia and the hypercoagulable state [^114uALGb]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Thalassemia, an inherited hemolytic disorder, is associated with a high incidence of thrombosis. The major mechanisms underlying thromboembolism (TE) are an abnormal red blood cell surface, platelet activation and endothelial cell activation. A higher risk of TE is found in splenectomized patients due to thrombocytosis and increased abnormal RBCs in the circulation. Regular RBC transfusions can reduce the proportion of abnormal RBCs and suppress erythropoiesis. Regular transfusion may also reduce levels of circulating coagulation markers and reduce elevated pulmonary artery pressure. To prevent thromboembolic events, aspirin is now recommended for splenectomized patients with thrombocytosis.

Discussion

The physiological profile of TDT RBCs

Resistance to osmotic lysis is a common characteristic of thalassemic RBCs. We found it more pronounced in splenectomized individuals as previously reported, but also in males and those with milder globin biosynthesis defects. Osmotic hemolysis was inversely related to hemolysis rate, but positively related to membrane stress markers (PS, PPA) and mutations severity, suggesting adverse effects by the globin chain excess. Mechanical hemolysis (a measure of membrane stability) was similar to control in contrast to previous reports in transfusion-independent patients, showing a salutary effect of transfusion on it. The additional influences by the proteasome activity support the involvement of degradation machineries in mechanical stress response and cell protection.

In a context of iron overload, Hb oxidation and oxidative hemolysiswere found to be enhanced. Despite that, the baseline ROS accumulation was not pathological, likely due to effective chelation therapy and high plasma antioxidant capacity. Treatment with PHZ, which mimics thalassemic membrane damage in control RBCs, resulted in high hemolysis rate but not significantly elevated ROS accumulation, indicating that PHZ stimulates the translocation of preoxidized α-globin chains to the membrane. The oxidative targeting of the membrane disrupts lipid asymmetry, in both transfusion-independentand TDT, especially in younger RBCs, contributing to erythrophagocytosis, hypercoagulability, and postsplenectomy thrombosis. The observed linkages of hemolysis rate to oxidative stress, Hb scavengers, and iron regulation highlight the importance of maintaining optimal chelation schedules and of monitoring and managing the oxidative stress both in blood components and patients with TDT to reduce anemia and systemic complications.

### How I manage medical complications of β-thalassemia in adults [^1147VCX1]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

The complex pathophysiology in β-thalassemia can translate to multiple morbidities that affect every organ system. Improved survival due to advances in management means that patients are exposed to the harmful effects of ineffective erythropoiesis, anemia, and iron overload for a longer duration, and we started seeing new or more frequent complications in adult compared with younger patients. In this article, we highlight particular aspects of managing adult patients with β-thalassemia, using our own experience in treating such patients. We cover both transfusion-dependent and nontransfusion-dependent forms of the disease and tackle specific morbidities of highest interest.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114p41Ly]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia — evaluation for hemolysis in early or refractory cases includes that an infant < 24 hours old with a TSB concentration above the phototherapy threshold likely has hemolytic disease. Measurement of ETCOc, if available, may help identify hemolysis, and identifying whether there is G6PD deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis or other red cell membrane defects can help identify infants at risk for recurrent hemolysis and also provide information for families about increased risk in future pregnancies. In challenging clinical circumstances, such as an increasing TSB despite intensive phototherapy, which is suggestive of hemolysis, a neonatologist or hematologist can be consulted for guidance, and genomic sequencing may be helpful when the cause of hemolysis cannot otherwise be identified in neonates who receive escalation of care.

### Short-and long-term effects of transfusion in β-thalassemia: a longitudinal study of transfusion efficiency factors [^112JSkTa]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The complex interplay between donor and recipient factors likely influences transfusion outcomes in transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). We investigated physiological responses to transfusion shortly after it and one week later, focusing on Hb increment (ΔHb) and its determinants, using longitudinal data from 36 TDT subjects and 58 red blood cell (RBC) units. Immediate anemia correction post-transfusion was associated with decreases in platelets and nucleated RBCs, increases in ADAMTS13:Ag and plasma amino acid levels, and temporary rises in hemolysis and phthalates. One-week post-transfusion, at the peak of erythroid suppression, plasma antioxidants and mechanical hemolysis decreased, while proteasome activity at the RBC membrane increased. Leukocyte levels declined, markers of thrombotic risk and endothelium dysfunction improved, and hepcidin, as well as plasma glutamine and deoxyadenosine, increased. In addition to female sex and anemia, ΔHb was influenced by recipient baseline monocyte levels, hypercoagulability, and plasma metabolites, such as methionine, adenosine, acyl-carnitines, and bile acids. Donor RBC unit factors, including residual platelet levels, RBC proteasome activity, arginine metabolism, and catecholamine content also had significant correlations. Notably, the baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio strongly affected ΔHb soon after transfusion, after adjusting for confounders. At the one-week mark, ΔHb correlated with storability markers, like oxidative hemolysis and phthalates, a first-ever described connection. Importantly, the percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing donor RBCs and the uric acid-dependent antioxidant capacity of the RBC units significantly influenced ΔHb at the one-week timepoint. These findings enhance our understanding of transfusion dynamics, paving the way for more personalized and effective care strategies in TDT management.

### Hemolysis contributes to anemia during long-duration space flight [^114QS4qH]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Space tourism will considerably expand the number of space travelers. Medical screening of future astronauts and space tourists might benefit from a preflight profiling of globin gene and modifiers. Postlanding monitoring should cover conditions affected by anemia and hemolysis. Monitoring individual astronaut's levels of hemolysis during mission may be indicated to reduce health risks. Our results support adding space travel to the list of etiologies for hemolytic anemia.

Erythrokinetic response to microgravity may have critical relevance to understand erythroid physiology and pathophysiology in contexts other than space flight. Data from the mid-1990s focusing on the acute hemoconcentration entering space led to hypotheses on normal erythroid mass control, prevention from becoming excessive, hypoxic environments, polycythemia and EPO withdrawal. Preferential hemolysis of younger erythrocytes after descent from altitude is currently debated. Our findings of continuous hemolysis in space carry broad implications for populations on Earth with increased hemolysis or high prevalence of unexplained anemia, including patients receiving critical care, patients with chronic anemia, older patients, sedentary patients and bedridden patients –. Like astronauts, the environment of these individuals is characterized by a marked decrease in skeleton stimulation and decreased standing time. These individuals experience cardiovascular deconditioning, muscle atrophy and osteopenia. Potential alterations in bone marrow and spleen functions in space may be relevant to pathophysiological changes in their erythrocytic control. Our findings support investigating whether increased hemolysis contributes to anemia on Earth and could be targeted by specific physical rehabilitation strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Iron is essential for multiple cellular processes, with large amounts being used in the production of hemoglobin during erythropoiesis. Thus, erythropoietic demand for iron is a primary regulator of iron absorption. 1, 2, 3 Ineffective erythropoiesis can lead to excessive iron absorption in certain inherited hemoglobin disorders, such as thalassemia and other conditions associated with variations in hemoglobin structure. The two main forms of thalassemia, α‐ and β‐thalassemia, are caused by defects in α‐ and β‐hemoglobin chain synthesis, respectively. 4 In β‐thalassemia, partial or complete loss of β‐globin synthesis, due to mutations in the β‐globin gene, results in a relative excess of α‐chains and the formation of α‐globin‐heme complexes on red blood cell (RBC) membranes. 1, 5 The severity of symptoms, which are generally related to anemia and/or iron overload, depends on the extent to which β‐globin production is diminished and the degree of α‐ and β‐chain imbalance. 4, 5

Phenotypes of thalassemia and their severity can be characterized according to dependence on blood transfusions. Patients are conventionally described as having transfusion‐dependent thalassemia (TDT; β‐thalassemia major) when they have a life‐long requirement for regular transfusions, which results in iron overload. 6, 7 Chronic transfusions are not essential for those with non‐transfusion‐dependent thalassemia (NTDT; β‐thalassemia intermedia) to survive, but for limited periods of time, infrequent or sometimes repeated transfusions might be necessary. 6, 8, 9 In NTDT, ineffective erythropoiesis leads to chronic hemolytic anemia and subsequent hypoxia. This drives compensatory elevated levels of erythropoiesis and suppressed synthesis of the iron‐regulatory hormone, hepcidin. Consequently, intestinal iron absorption is increased, recycled iron from the reticuloendothelial system is released, macrophage iron is depleted, and portal and hepatocyte iron loading is increased. 1, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13 Subsequently, the amount of released iron exceeds the binding capacity of transferrin and non‐transferrin‐bound iron (NTBI) is formed in the circulation. 14, 15 Due to its ability to generate reactive‐oxygen species, accumulation of unbound iron in tissues can be toxic, resulting in tissue injury (including trophic skin changes and leg ulcers), organ dysfunction (including liver disease, heart failure and endocrinopathies), and death. 1, 7, 15, 16

### Role of red blood cells in clinically relevant bleeding tendencies and complications [^116fY6Un]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

1 | INTRODUCTION

The contributions of cells, plasma proteins, vascular wall, and flow dynamics are familiar building blocks for hemostasis. The numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) may be low due to deficiency in hematopoiesis (bone marrow failure), major bleeds, or cellular destruction because of membrane abnormalities (sickle cell trait or hemoglobinopathies, antibodies or malaria, or other pathogens and hemolysis associated with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with a thrombotic tendency). However, the most common reason for anemia is iron deficiency, either due to poor absorption of iron or loss of RBCs due to subtle bleeding, impairing oxygen delivery. All these disorders lead to coagulation abnormalities, which need special and proactive attention. Here, we will focus mostly on disorders with decreased RBC numbers from the point of view of hemorheology, bleeding tendency, and complications. After discussing the critical mechanisms of hemorheology, we will identify the most important disorders where anemia should be under active evaluation to be managed if possible (Figure 1). Finally, we will return to the bench for other valuable RBC-associated functional properties, including clot contraction and RBC microvesicles, to be further considered in clinics as well.

### Sickle cell disease and CKD: an update [^115ZBFxf]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited red blood cell disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people in the USA and 25 million people worldwide. Vaso-occlusion and chronic hemolysis lead to dysfunction of vital organ systems, with the kidneys being among the most commonly affected organs.

Summary

Early renal manifestations include medullary ischemia with the loss of urine-concentrating ability and hyperfiltration. This can be followed by progressive damage characterized by persistent albuminuria and a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate. The risk of sickle nephropathy is greater in those with the APOL1 G1 and G2 kidney risk variants and variants in HMOX1 and lower in those that coinherit α-thalassemia. Therapies to treat sickle cell disease-related kidney damage focus on sickle cell disease-modifying therapies (e.g., hydroxyurea) or those adopted from the nonsickle cell disease kidney literature (e.g., renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors), although data on their clinical efficacy are limited to small studies with short follow-up periods. Kidney transplantation for end-stage kidney disease improves survival compared to hemodialysis but is underutilized in this patient population.

Key Messages

Kidney disease is a major contributor to early mortality, and more research is needed to understand the pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies to improve kidney health in sickle cell disease.

### Quantitative proteomics of plasma vesicles identify novel biomarkers for hemoglobin E / β-thalassemic patients [^112Ak9Bq]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin E (HbE)/β-thalassemia has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that cannot be explained purely by its genetic background. Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are one factor that likely contributes to disease severity. This study has explored the differences in protein composition and quantity between EVs from HbE/β-thalassemic patients and healthy individuals. We used tandem mass tag labeling mass spectrometry to analyze the EV proteins isolated from the plasma of 15 patients compared with the controls. To reduce biological variation between individuals, the EV proteins isolated from randomly assigned groups of 5 HbE/β-thalassemic patients were pooled and compared with 5 pooled age- and sex-matched controls in 3 separate experiments. Alpha hemoglobin-stabilizing protein had the highest fold increase. Catalase, superoxide dismutase, T-complex proteins, heat shock proteins, transferrin receptor, ferritin, and cathepsin S were also upregulated in thalassemic circulating EVs. Importantly, haptoglobin and hemopexin were consistently reduced in patients' EVs across all data sets, in keeping with the existing hemolysis that occurs in thalassemia. The proteomic data analysis of EV samples isolated from 6 individual HbE/β-thalassemic patients and western blotting results corroborated these findings. In conclusion, we have successfully identified consistent alterations of protein quantity between EVs from HbE/β-thalassemic and healthy individuals. This work highlights haptoglobin, hemopexin, and cathepsin S as potential clinically relevant biomarkers for levels of hemolysis and inflammation. Monitoring of these plasma proteins could help in the clinical management of thalassemia.

### The effect of different types of anemia on HbA1c levels in non-diabetics [^111CxctP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA), which is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by hemoglobin S (Hb S) production, is one of the most prevalent hereditary hemoglobinopathy diseases worldwide. In the United States, SCA affects about 72,000 people and approximately 2 million are carriers. Hemoglobin S changes the normal shape of the red blood cells (RBCs) to become sickle-shaped cells. Sickle cell disease (SCD) may alter HbA1c's ability to accurately reflect past glycemia. When compared to people with normal hemoglobin, the lifespan of red blood cells in people with SCD may be shortened, leaving less time for glycation, which can falsely lower HbA1c levels.

Thalassemia is a diverse set of inherited autosomal recessive disorders, which are caused by a reduction in alpha or beta chains that compose the hemoglobin. Thalassemia is classified according to the affected hemoglobin molecule into alpha- and beta-thalassemia. Beta-thalassemia is caused by the deletion of the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11, which results in the formation of fewer or no beta-globin chains. It is characterized by a lack of erythropoiesis and persistent hemolysis. Heterozygous thalassemia (also known as thalassemia minor) is thalassemia that affects 1–5% of people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Because β-thalassemia carriers have a shorter erythrocyte lifetime, ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis may lower HbA1c levels.

### Pyruvate kinase activators: targeting red cell metabolism in thalassemia [^115sFfv6]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Thalassemia is an inherited red blood cell disorder whereby the qualitative and/or quantitative imbalance in α- to β-globin ratio results in hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Oxidative stress, from the precipitated excess globin and free iron, is a major factor that drives hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Pyruvate kinase activity and adenosine triphosphate availability are reduced due to the overwhelmed cellular antioxidant system from the excessive oxidative stress. Mitapivat, a pyruvate kinase activator in development as a treatment for thalassemia, was shown to increase hemoglobin and reduce hemolysis in a small phase 2 single-arm trial of patients with α- and β-thalassemia. The ongoing phase 3 studies with mitapivat and the phase 2 study with etavopivat will examine the role of pyruvate kinase activators as disease modifying agents in thalassemia.

### Novel potential therapeutics to modify iron metabolism and red cell synthesis in diseases associated with defective erythropoiesis [^1149yHTv]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Under normal conditions, iron metabolism is carefully regulated to sustain normal cellular functions and the production of hemoglobin in erythroid cells. Perturbation to the erythropoiesis-iron metabolism axis can result in iron imbalances and cause anemia or organ toxicity. Various congenital and acquired diseases associated with abnormal red cell production are characterized by aberrant iron absorption. Several recent studies have shown that improvements in red blood cell production also ameliorate iron metabolism and vice versa. Many therapeutics are now under development with the potential to improve a variety of hematologic diseases, from β-thalassemia and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia to anemia of inflammation and polycythemia vera. This review summarizes selected mechanisms related to red cell production and iron metabolism and describes potential therapeutics and their current uses. We also consider the potential application of the discussed therapeutics on various diseases, alone or in combination. The vast repertoire of drugs under development offers new opportunities to improve the clinical care of patients suffering from congenital or acquired red blood cell disorders with limited or no treatment options.

### How I treat non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^115SVhyQ]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Modifiers of the β-thalassemia phenotype leading to β-thalassemia intermedia. The primary modifier of phenotype is the severity of the β-globin chain mutation (β ++, β +, or β 0), with varying α/β-globin chain imbalance. Coinheritance of α-thalassemia and increased expression of α-globin stabilizing protein act as secondary modifiers that mitigate the α/β-globin chain imbalance. In contrast, inheritance of a triplicated or quadruplicated α-globin gene locus may amplify the severity of a heterozygous β-thalassemia state. In some instances, a single dominantly inherited β-globin locus mutation can be responsible for a β-thalassemia intermedia phenotype. HPFH, hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. Figure created with BioRender.

In the past decade, patients with β-thalassemia intermedia have been recognized as having NTDT to emphasize their independence from requiring lifelong transfusions for survival, compared with patients with β-thalassemia major. However, such transfusion independence did not come without its own side effects, and it has recently become apparent that untreated ineffective erythropoiesis can lead to various clinical morbidities attributed to chronic anemia and hemolysis, primary iron overload, and hypercoagulability. Altogether, this leads to a somewhat different morbidity profile than that seen in TDT (β-thalassemia major), as illustrated in Figure 2. As will be illustrated in the next cases, intermittent or regular transfusions may still be used for patients with NTDT to prevent or manage clinical sequelae at certain points in time. When management decisions and assessment for eligibility for clinical trials rely on the "real-time" status, we usually consider patients as having NTDT if they had received < 6 red blood cell units in the past 6 months and zero transfusions in the preceding 2 months.

Compound heterozygous and variant genotypes — screening considerations: a small population of children with SCD (< 3%) who are compound heterozygotes for HbS and do not have HbSC are at high risk of stroke, and the decision as to which children with compound heterozygous SCD should receive TCD screening and subsequent treatment should be made on an individual basis; in children with compound heterozygous SCD, we cannot identify a single marker of hemolysis or a threshold for markers of hemolysis that should be screened; for children with HbSC, the risk of abnormal TCD measurements and stroke is less than for those with HbSS; in HbSβ+ thalassemia, hemoglobin levels vary, with the range from hemoglobin levels of 7 g/dL to values within the normal range, and consequently, we cannot state with high certainty which children with HbSβ+ thalassemia should receive TCD screening.

### Measures of cellular oxidative damage following vitamin E supplementation in young patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^114LT8EP]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The data at T0 revealed that young patients with both β- and α-thalassemia generally carried higher numbers of cellular oxidative damages of both RBC and platelet origins compared to controls, similar to that found in adult thalassemia patients. This implied cellular pathology caused by oxidative stress accumulated since the patients were very young. However, patients in this cohort generally had high iron burden due to high transfusion to maintain Hb 9–10.5 g/dL in β- and 8–9 g/dL in α-thalassemia. This could have influenced the increase of oxidative damage of the blood cells observed at a young age in the study. A recent research supporting this showed an association between iron overload and oxidative stress on bone marrow erythropoiesis. This data also implied that adequate iron chelation is of the utmost importance as a primary treatment to minimize oxidative damage. In agreement with related studies, these pathologic RBCs and platelets were remarkably found in β-Thal-S patients, whose bodies could not remove such damaged thalassemic cells. The findings aligned with a recent study of similar populations, showing more severe oxidative stress and damage in splenectomized patients as measured by different markers. The data showed that while α-Thal-NS patients had a more severe degree of hemolysis compared to those in the β-Thal-S and β-Thal-NS groups, as delineated by higher LDH, they generally suffered lower levels of cellular oxidative damage. This supported that the degradation of excessive unstable Hb chains and iron overload, the leading causes of cellular oxidative damage, occurred less in α-thalassemia, mainly non-deletional HbH, compared to β-thalassemia patients. Moreover, hemolysis in α-thalassemia patients might not only result from cellular oxidative damage but is more likely a multifactorial process.

Depending on the genotype, alpha-thalassemia results in moderate to profound anemia, hemolysis, growth delays, splenomegaly, and increased risk for thromboembolic events; certain patients might require chronic transfusions. Although alpha-thalassemia is not a core condition of the United States Recommended Uniform Screening Panel * for state newborn screening programs, methodologies used by some newborn screening programs to detect sickle cell disease, which is a core panel condition, also detect a quantitative marker of alpha-thalassemia, hemoglobin (Hb) Bart's, an abnormal type of hemoglobin. The percentage of Hb Bart's detected correlates with alpha-thalassemia severity. The Association of Public Health Laboratories' Hemoglobinopathy Workgroup conducted a survey of state newborn screening programs' alpha-thalassemia screening methodologies and reporting and follow-up practices. Survey findings indicated that 41 of 44 responding programs (93%) report some form of alpha-thalassemia results and 57% used a two-method screening protocol. However, the percentage of Hb Bart's used for thalassemia classification, the types of alpha-thalassemia reported, and the recipients of this information varied widely. These survey findings highlight the opportunity for newborn screening programs to revisit their policies as they reevaluate their practices in light of the recently released guideline from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) on Newborn Screening for Hemoglobinopathies. Although deferring to local programs for policies, the report used a cutoff of 25% Hb Bart's in its decision tree, a value many programs do not use. Standardization of screening and reporting might lead to more timely diagnoses and health care services and improved outcomes for persons with a clinically significant alpha-thalassemia.

### Survival and causes of death in 2, 033 patients with non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia [^1174Kuu1]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (NTDT) is a broad term encompassing patients who do not require lifelong transfusion therapy for survival. NTDT patients commonly, but not exclusively, present to medical care later in childhood (commonly > 2 years of age) and with milder anemia and clinical symptoms compared to patients with transfusion-dependent forms. Our understanding of the disease process in NTDT has evolved significantly over the past two decades and it is now established that a diagnosis of NTDT can be associated with greater morbidity than previously recognized. Ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis lead to a state of chronic anemia, which can impact organ function in the long-term. There is a significant correlation between the degree of anemia and morbidity development in this NTDT patient population. Ineffective erythropoiesis is also linked to other pathogeneses manifesting as extramedullary hematopoiesis, bone disease, hypercoagulability and vascular disease, as well as primary iron overload due to increased intestinal iron absorption. Iron overload can be cumulative and leads to end-organ damage, especially in the liver. Despite advances in realizing risk factors and morbidity in NTDT, data on mortality and causes of death remain limited.

There are currently no approved drugs for the management of ineffective erythropoiesis, or anemia, in NTDT. Thus, despite the terminology, many patients are given sporadic transfusions or are even placed on regular transfusion programs later in their disease course. This is commonly undertaken in situations of acute stress (during pregnancy, surgery, or infection), in the context of supporting growth and development, or for the management and prevention of complications in adulthood. Decisions are often based on the physician's judgement, since management guidelines have only become available since 2013 and do not necessarily provide specific recommendations for transfusion therapy or for other erythropoiesis modulators when data from clinical trials is absent. Iron chelation therapy has been used in patients with NTDT for decades, but this have primarily based on expert opinion since data from dedicated clinical trials and management guidelines have only become available in the last 10 years.

### Thalassaemia [^114JCwib]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Inherited haemoglobin disorders, including thalassaemia and sickle-cell disease, are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide. Several clinical forms of α-thalassaemia and β-thalassaemia, including the co-inheritance of β-thalassaemia with haemoglobin E resulting in haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia, have been described. The disease hallmarks include imbalance in the α/β-globin chain ratio, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic haemolytic anaemia, compensatory haemopoietic expansion, hypercoagulability, and increased intestinal iron absorption. The complications of iron overload, arising from transfusions that represent the basis of disease management in most patients with severe thalassaemia, might further complicate the clinical phenotype. These pathophysiological mechanisms lead to an array of clinical manifestations involving numerous organ systems. Conventional management primarily relies on transfusion and iron-chelation therapy, as well as splenectomy in specific cases. An increased understanding of the molecular and pathogenic factors that govern the disease process have suggested routes for the development of new therapeutic approaches that address the underlying chain imbalance, ineffective erythropoiesis, and iron dysregulation, with several agents being evaluated in preclinical models and clinical trials.

### Elevated CDKN1A (P21) mediates β-thalassemia erythroid apoptosis, but its loss does not improve β-thalassemic erythropoiesis [^1149WgkJ]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

β-thalassemias are 1 of the most common hemoglobinopathies globally, caused by > 200 mutations in the β-globin gene. Patients experience variable degrees of anemia associated with a broad range of clinical manifestations. Patients with β-thalassemia may be affected by severe anemia, requiring chronic blood transfusions for survival (β-thalassemia major), or milder clinical anemia requiring only sporadic transfusions (β-thalassemia intermedia), whereas patients with minor thalassemia are asymptomatic.

Mutations in the β-globin gene lead to the absence or reduced β-globin synthesis. Decreased β-globin synthesis causes an imbalance in protein levels of α vs β chain, which disrupts production of functional adult α 2 β 2 hemoglobin A, a pathological mechanism that is most evident in homozygote β-thalassemia mutations. The accumulation of excessive unpaired α-globin chains in erythroblasts triggers redox-mediated reactions, leading to the generation of toxic aggregates that precipitate into red blood cell (RBC) precursors. In turn, the accumulation of α-globin aggregates result in premature death, ineffective erythroid maturation, and hemolytic anemia. Anemia induced by β-thalassemia further triggers the release of erythropoietin (EPO), which leads to the expansion of EPO–sensitive erythroid progenitors, leading to extramedullary erythropoiesis and splenomegaly. The increased apoptosis of late maturing erythroblasts is known as an aggravating factor in sustaining anemia despite enhanced erythropoiesis in patients with β-thalassemia, which results in further expansion of extramedullary hematopoiesis. The clinical aspects of β-thalassemia are orchestrated in response to stress and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in erythroid cells. However, the source and regulation of elevated ROS levels remains debated and whether ROS are implicated in inducing apoptosis in β-thalassemia erythroid cells is unclear. Importantly, the molecular underpinning of the enhanced apoptosis in β-thalassemia remains poorly understood.

### Baby on board: what you need to know about pregnancy in the hemoglobinopathies [^114vHSko]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Pregnancy poses a unique challenge to patients with sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia, who often have exacerbations of hemolysis or anemia during the gestational period, experience higher rates of obstetric and fetal complications, and may have distinct underlying comorbidities related to vasculopathy and iron overload that can endanger maternal health. Optimal management of pregnant women with hemoglobinopathies requires both an understanding of the physiologic demands of pregnancy and the pathophysiology of disease-specific complications of inherited blood disorders. A multidisciplinary team of expert hematologists and high-risk obstetricians is therefore essential to ensuring appropriate antenatal maternal screening, adequate fetal surveillance, and early recognition of complications. Fortunately, with integrated and targeted care, most women with sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia can achieve successful pregnancy outcomes.

### Hemoglobin e syndromes [^116VkvBo]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin (Hb) E is one of the world's most common and important mutations. It results in a heterogeneous group of disorders whose phenotype range from asymptomatic to severe. Hb E trait and Hb EE are mild disorders. The combination of Hb E and Hb S (Hb SE) results in a sickle cell disease syndrome similar to sickle beta(+) thalassemia. It is important to distinguish Hb E disorders diagnostically because of this marked difference in clinical course among different genotypes. Screening tests, including hemoglobin electrophoresis and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), may suggest other mutations, unless one is familiar with the findings. E beta-thalassemia, the most serious form of E syndromes, affects a million people worldwide and is increasing in North America. Its phenotype ranges from mild anemia to severe transfusion-dependent thalassemia major. Several genetic modifiers affect the phenotype, including the type of beta-thalassemia mutation, Hb F levels, and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia. However, the cause of the phenotypic variability is largely unknown. A prospective natural history study of E beta-thalassemia in Sri Lanka suggests that environmental modifiers are prognostically important. The clinical course of E beta-thalassemia is punctuated by acute and chronic complications that may cause serious morbidity and mortality. Recent studies indicate these patients are at high risk for thromboembolism secondary to a hypercoagulable state increased by splenectomy. Morbidity from iron overload in nontransfused patients secondary to increased gastrointestinal iron absorption is common. Cardiopulmonary disease, including pulmonary hypertension, requires ongoing monitoring and is secondary to iron overload, thromboembolism, and hemolysis-induced nitric oxide deficiency. These patients are excellent candidates for Hb F-modulating agents because moderate changes in hemoglobin may result in marked improvement in phenotype. Recent studies with hydroxyurea indicate 40% of patients will clinically improve with hydroxyurea.

### Alpha and beta thalassemia [^111RccRb]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The thalassemias are a group of inherited hematologic disorders caused by defects in the synthesis of one or more of the hemoglobin chains. Alpha thalassemia is caused by reduced or absent synthesis of alpha globin chains, and beta thalassemia is caused by reduced or absent synthesis of beta globin chains. Imbalances of globin chains cause hemolysis and impair erythropoiesis. Silent carriers of alpha thalassemia and persons with alpha or beta thalassemia trait are asymptomatic and require no treatment. Alpha thalassemia intermedia, or hemoglobin H disease, causes hemolytic anemia. Alpha thalassemia major with hemoglobin Bart's usually results in fatal hydrops fetalis. Beta thalassemia major causes hemolytic anemia, poor growth, and skeletal abnormalities during infancy. Affected children will require regular lifelong blood transfusions. Beta thalassemia intermedia is less severe than beta thalassemia major and may require episodic blood transfusions. Transfusion-dependent patients will develop iron overload and require chelation therapy to remove the excess iron. Bone marrow transplants can be curative for some children with beta thalassemia major. Persons with thalassemia should be referred for preconception genetic counseling, and persons with alpha thalassemia trait should consider chorionic villus sampling to diagnose infants with hemoglobin Bart's, which increases the risk of toxemia and postpartum bleeding. Persons with the thalassemia trait have a normal life expectancy. Persons with beta thalassemia major often die from cardiac complications of iron overload by 30 years of age.

### The relationship between the severity of hemolysis, clinical manifestations and risk of death in 415 patients with sickle cell anemia in the US and Europe [^114ugDEQ]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

The intensity of hemolytic anemia has been proposed as an independent risk factor for the development of certain clinical complications of sickle cell disease, such as pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia and cutaneous leg ulceration. A composite variable derived from several individual markers of hemolysis could facilitate studies of the underlying mechanisms of hemolysis. In this study, we assessed the association of hemolysis with outcomes in sickle cell anemia. A hemolytic component was calculated by principal component analysis from reticulocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin concentrations in 415 hemoglobin SS patients. Association of this component with direct markers of hemolysis and clinical outcomes was assessed. As primary validation, both plasma red blood cell microparticles and cell-free hemoglobin concentration were higher in the highest hemolytic component quartile compared to the lowest quartile (P ≤ 0.0001 for both analyses). The hemolytic component was lower with hydroxyurea therapy, higher hemoglobin F, and alpha-thalassemia (P ≤ 0.0005); it was higher with higher systemic pulse pressure, lower oxygen saturation, and greater values for tricuspid regurgitation velocity, left ventricular diastolic dimension and left ventricular mass (all P < 0.0001). Two-year follow-up analysis showed that a high hemolytic component was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio, HR 3.44; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.2–9.5; P = 0.02). The hemolytic component reflects direct markers of intravascular hemolysis in patients with sickle cell disease and allows for adjusted analysis of associations between hemolytic severity and clinical outcomes. These results confirm associations between hemolytic rate and pulse pressure, oxygen saturation, increases in Doppler-estimated pulmonary systolic pressures and mortality (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00492531).

### Thalassemia… [^113XLmPd]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Thalassemia is a group of inherited blood disorders caused by defects in one or more genes responsible for producing the globin chains in hemoglobin. The clinical syndromes are the result of two problems. First, insufficient synthesis of either α- or β-globin leads to inadequate production of the predominant adult hemoglobin A and results in microcytosis and hypochromia. Second, diminished synthesis of one type of globin leads to a relative excess of the globin with which it would normally pair. Excess unpaired globin chains form unstable tetramers that precipitate in red blood cells, causing impaired erythropoiesis or hemolysis. α-Thalassemia occurs when there is a defect or deletion in one or more of the four genes responsible for α-globin production, leading to insufficient or absent α-globin synthesis. A defect or deletion of one α-globin gene leads to a condition. Comments

### UGT1A1 polymorphism outweighs the modest effect of deletional (-3.7 kb) α-thalassemia on cholelithogenesis in sickle cell anemia [^113CsDMw]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Enhanced erythrocyte destruction in sickle cell anemia results in chronic hyperbilirubinemia. Only a subset of patients develop cholelithiasis. UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism is associated both with unconjugated bilirubin level and elevated risk for cholelithiasis in such subset. Here, we investigated the role of alpha-thalassemia, yet another genetic factor that modulates hemolysis, in conferring protection from cholelithiasis. We show that, although alpha-thalassemia is associated with modest reduction in hemolysis and unconjugated bilirubin level, UGT1A1 polymorphism outweighs its effect on cholethiogenesis in sickle cell anemia patients.

### Twenty-eight cases of thalassemia: a retrospective study of autologous and allogeneic erythrocyte transfusions during cesarean section [^1115dShm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Erythrocytes from patients with thalassemia might be susceptible to hemolysis during recycling and washing. Therefore, autologous erythrocyte transfusion using erythrocytes from parturient women with thalassemia has been suggested as a relative contraindication. Only a limited number of successful cases have been documented to date, and few clinical studies with large sample sizes are available as evidence to support this practice. This study aimed to assess the intraoperative safety and the degree of postoperative anemia correction in women with thalassemia receiving erythrocyte transfusions during cesarean section.

Methods

Between 2016 and 2024, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 27 parturient women with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia at the Affiliated Hospital for Women and Children of Xiamen University. Autologous (Group 1) and allogeneic (Group 2) erythrocyte transfusions were administered during cesarean section, based on the specifics of the intraoperative bleeding.

Results

In Group 1, urinalysis results for hemoglobin, bilirubin, and urobilinogen in all patients were negative. In Group 2, urinalysis results for hemoglobin and bilirubin were similarly negative in all patients, but one patient had a positive urobilinogen result.

Conclusion

The results showed that both transfusion strategies were safe and effective when strict indications and standardized operating procedures were followed.

### Thalassemias [^1156GtYz]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The thalassemia syndromes are hemoglobin disorders that result from significantly reduced or absent synthesis of either the α- or β-globin chains. The result is a chronic hemolytic anemia with ineffective erythropoiesis and bone marrow overstimulation. This article reviews current diagnostic approaches, complications, and disease management of thalassemia.

### Premature atherosclerosis in children with β-thalassemia major: new diagnostic marker [^114kyBrg]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-thalassemia represents the commonest cause of hemolytic anemia in Egypt with carrier rate ranges from 9–10%. Beta- thalassemia major (B-TM) patients usually present within the first two years of life with severe anemia requiring regular red blood cell transfusions. Early vascular alteration, atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases have emerged as important cardiovascular complications among B-TM patients.

Atherosclerosis is a slow progressive disease that may start at childhood. In atherogensis, arterial wall morphological changes occur during a presumably long subclinical lag phase, and characterized by gradual thickening of the intima. Beside the traditional diagnostic methods such as angiography and stress-testing, measurement of the intima-media thickness of the large arteries, especially the carotids, has emerged as one of the method of choice for determining the anatomical extent of arterial wall deterioration and for assessing cardiovascular risk. Several investigators have recommended the clinical use of this technique for detecting subclinical (asymptomatic) atherosclerosis and for identifying subjects at high-risk.

Circulating markers of atherosclerosis are associated with increased vascular risk; one of the new biomarkers of atherosclerosis is Osteoprotegerin (OPG). Osteoprotegerin is a cytokine of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and is classed as an osteoclastogenesis inhibiting factor. In the endothelial cell, OPG is associated with Von-Willebrand factor within secretory granules called Weibel-Palade bodies. Upon stimulation with TNF or interleukin-1 in vitro, the OPG- Von-Willebrand factor complex is secreted in the surrounding growth medium. This endothelial activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines is one of the possible sources of circulating OPG in patients with active atherosclerosis. Moreover, in view of the role of vascular smooth muscles in atherosclerosis and intimal calcification, it is likely that, they are the main source of increased circulating OPG noted in cardiovascular disease. Data suggest that OPG is induced by atherosclerosis and may be upregulated as an incomplete compensatory response to the vessel insult, possibly thereby limiting vascular calcification. Osteoprotegerin seems to prevent arterial calcification but is not able to reverse calcification once it has occurred.

### Cardiopulmonary complications of sickle cell disease: role of nitric oxide and hemolytic anemia [^113HrvNL]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Medical advances in the management of patients with sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and other hemolytic anemias have led to significant increases in life expectancy. Improved public health, neonatal screening, parental and patient education, advances in red cell transfusion medicine, iron chelation therapy, penicillin prophylaxis for children, pneumococcal immunization, and hydroxyurea therapy have all likely contributed to this effect on longevity. Importantly, as a generation of patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia ages, new chronic complications of these hemoglobinopathies develop. In this context, pulmonary hypertension is emerging as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in adult sickle cell and thalassemia patients, and likely in patients with other hemolytic anemias. A common feature of both sickle cell disease and thalassemia is intravascular hemolysis and chronic anemia. Recent data suggest that chronic intravascular hemolysis is associated with a state of endothelial dysfunction characterized by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory stress and coagulopathy, leading to vasomotor instability and ultimately producing a proliferative vasculopathy, a hallmark of which is the development of pulmonary hypertension in adulthood. In conclusion, pulmonary hypertension is common in patients with hereditary hemolytic anemias and is associated with a high risk of death in patients with sickle cell disease. New therapies targeting this vasculopathy and aimed at normalizing the vasodilator:vasoconstrictor balance are discussed.

### Cardiorenal syndrome in thalassemia patients [^115uqbdj]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thalassemia, characterized by a mutation of a globin gene, is a common cause of congenital chronic hemolytic anemia in many parts of Southeast Asia including Thailand. The severity of anemia varies by mutation type and the need for regular transfusion. The latter categorizes patients into two groups, transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT). The major cause of death in thalassemia is heart failure secondary to chronic iron overload, a condition known as iron overload cardiomyopathy. In the past, thalassemia patients with iron overload cardiomyopathy usually died within the 1 st or 2 nd decade of life. However, an improvement of medical care and iron chelation therapy has led to a decrease in cardiac death and improved life expectancy in these patients. Nevertheless, such patients are still at high risk of complications associated with chronic hemolytic anemia, especially those associated with heart and renal abnormalities.

Heart abnormalities are still mainly caused by chronic iron deposition in myocytes which results in an increase in oxidative stress, inducing myocyte injury, increased myocardial fibrosis and decreased cardiac contraction. Renal abnormalities in cases of thalassemia manifest themselves through tubular dysfunction, glomerular dysfunction, hyperfiltration and renal stones caused by chronic hemolytic anemia and chelation therapy. A coexistence of cardiac and renal abnormalities is known as 'Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)'. CRS has been defined by Ronco et al. as abnormalities of heart and kidney which can be categorized into five types. Types 1 to 4 CRS, known as primary CRS, are caused by either a diseased heart or kidney whilst type 5 CRS, or secondary CRS, is defined as systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of both heart and kidney. Thalassemia is classified as a systemic disease so the simultaneous occurrence of cardiac and renal dysfunction is categorized as secondary, type 5 CRS. However, if the onset of cardiac and renal abnormalities differs, it could be categorized as any type of primary CRS (type 1–4). There is currently little information concerning CRS in thalassemia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of secondary CRS in thalassemia patients and its associated risk factors.

### Hb H disease: clinical course and disease modifiers [^117MJWbS]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin H (Hb H) disease is the most common form of thalassemia intermedia and has many features that require careful consideration in management. In the majority of cases, Hb H disease results from double heterozygosity for alpha(0)-thalassemia due to deletions that remove both linked alpha-globin genes on chromosome 16, and deletional alpha(+)-thalassemia from single alpha-globin gene deletions (--/-alpha). However, Hb H disease may occur from interactions between alpha(0)-thalassemia with non-deletional mutations (alpha(T)alpha or alpha(T)) or with abnormal hemoglobins such as Hb Constant Spring, Hb Paksé, Hb Quong Sze, and Hb Pak Num Po. In a steady state, patients with Hb H diseases have hemoglobin levels around 9 to 10 g/dL; however, during hemolytic crisis, which frequently develops in or after acute infections with high fever, the hemoglobin level may drop significantly and patients can develop shock or renal shutdown. Even though splenectomy leads to significant elevation of hemoglobin levels, it is not recommended because the majority of patients do well with said steady-state hemoglobin levels. Patients with non-deletional Hb H disease are usually more anemic with significant splenomegaly, and some may require regular blood transfusions and be even as severe as "Hb H hydrops fetalis". However, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation associated with this severe clinical syndrome since patients with identical genotypes do not necessary show the same severity. This suggests that other genetic and environmental factors play a role in modifying the degree of clinical severity in patients with non-deletional Hb H disease.

### Mechanisms of vasculopathy in sickle cell disease and thalassemia [^11166Guj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Many mechanisms contribute to the complex pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD), with dysfunction of the vascular endothelium as a unifying theme. Specifically, hemolysis-associated low arginine and nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, amplified by NO synthase uncoupling, elevated arginase activity, superoxide production, oxidative stress, accumulation of arginine analogs such as asymmetric dimethylarginine, ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammation, apolipoprotein A-1 depletion, and a hypercoagulable state are significant mechanisms contributing to endothelial dysfunction. Genetic polymorphisms also influence disease severity. Clearly the variable spectrum of disease is the consequence of multiple events and genetic susceptibility that go beyond the occurrence of a single amino acid substitution in the beta globin chain of hemoglobin. Recent studies begin to demonstrate overlap among these seemingly unrelated processes. Impaired NO bioavailability represents the central feature of endothelial dysfunction, and is a common denominator in the pathogenesis of vasculopathy in SCD. The consequences of decreased NO bioavailability include endothelial cell activation, upregulation of the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1, vasoconstriction, platelet activation, increased tissue factor, and activation of coagulation, all of which ultimately translate into the clinical manifestations of SCD. Evidence supporting vasculopathy subphenotypes in SCD, including pulmonary hypertension, priapism, cutaneous leg ulceration, and stroke, will be reviewed and relevance to other hemolytic disorders including the thalassemia syndromes will be considered.

### Hemoglobin bart's hydrops fetalis: charting the past and envisioning the future [^1162tSNo]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hemoglobin Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome (BHFS) represents the most severe form of α-thalassemia, arising from deletion of the duplicated α-globin genes from both alleles. The absence of α-globin leads to the formation of nonfunctional hemoglobin (Hb) Bart's (γ4) or HbH (β4) resulting in severe anemia, tissue hypoxia, and, in some cases, variable congenital or neurocognitive abnormalities. BHFS is the most common cause of hydrops fetalis in Southeast Asia; however, owing to global migration, the burden of this condition is increasing worldwide. With the availability of intensive perinatal care and intrauterine transfusions, an increasing number of patients survive with this condition. The current approach to long-term management of survivors involves regular blood transfusions and iron chelation, a task made challenging by the need for intensified transfusions to suppress the production of nonfunctional HbH-containing erythrocytes. Although our knowledge of outcomes of this condition is evolving, it seems, in comparison to individuals with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, those with BHFS may face an elevated risk of complications arising from chronic anemia and hypoxia, ongoing hemolysis, iron overload, and from their respective treatments. Although stem cell transplantation remains a viable option for a select few, it is not without potential side effects. Looking ahead, potential advancements in the form of genetic engineering and innovative therapeutic approaches, such as the reactivation of embryonic α-like globin gene expression, hold promise for furthering the treatment of this condition. Prevention remains a crucial aspect of care, particularly in areas with high prevalence or limited resources.

### Hemolytic anemia [^115DmKz2]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.

### HbE / β-thalassemia: basis of marked clinical diversity [^112BAsin]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin E thalassemia accounts for about one-half of all cases of severe beta thalassemia. There is marked variability in its clinical severity ranging from an asymptomatic to a transfusion-dependent phenotype. The phenotypic variability and inadequate longitudinal data present challenges in determining the optimal management of patients. This article summarizes findings on the natural history of Hemoglobin E thalassemia and some factors responsible for its clinical heterogeneity. Major genetic factors include the type of beta thalassemia mutation, the co-inheritance of alpha thalassemia, and polymorphisms associated with increased synthesis of fetal hemoglobin. Other factors, including response to anemia, and the influence of infection with malaria and other environmental influences, may be important. The remarkable variation and instability of clinical phenotypes in Hemoglobin E thalassemia require individual management plans for each patient, which should be reassessed over time.

### Clinical complications and their management [^112NWBhX]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The hallmarks of thalassemias are ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral hemolysis leading to a cascade of events responsible for several clinical complications. This pathophysiologic mechanism can be partially controlled by blood transfusions or by correction of the severity of ineffective erythropoiesis. Thalassemias include a spectrum of phenotypes. Two main groups can be clinically distinguished: transfusion-dependent (TDT) and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) thalassemia. Both conditions are characterized by several clinical complications along life; some are shared, whereas some have higher prevalence in one group over the other. The authors present the most common clinical complications in TDT and NTDT and their management.

### Effective erythropoiesis and HbF reactivation induced by kit ligand in β-thalassemia [^113PdCKT]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

In human beta-thalassemia, the imbalance between alpha- and non-alpha-globin chains causes ineffective erythropoiesis, hemolysis, and anemia: this condition is effectively treated by an enhanced level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). In spite of extensive studies on pharmacologic induction of HbF synthesis, clinical trials based on HbF reactivation in beta-thalassemia produced inconsistent results. Here, we investigated the in vitro response of beta-thalassemic erythroid progenitors to kit ligand (KL) in terms of HbF reactivation, stimulation of effective erythropoiesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. In unilineage erythroid cultures of 20 patients with intermedia or major beta-thalassemia, addition of KL, alone or combined with dexamethasone (Dex), remarkably stimulated cell proliferation (3–4 logs more than control cultures), while decreasing the percentage of apoptotic and dyserythropoietic cells (< 5%). More important, in both thalassemic groups, addition of KL or KL plus Dex induced a marked increase of gamma-globin synthesis, thus reaching HbF levels 3-fold higher than in con-trol cultures (eg, from 27% to 75% or 81%, respectively, in beta-thalassemia major). These studies indicate that in beta-thalassemia, KL, alone or combined with Dex, induces an expansion of effective erythropoiesis and the reactivation of gamma-globin genes up to fetal levels and may hence be considered as a potential therapeutic agent for this disease.

### Β-thalassemia [^115PgHeV]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

β-Thalassemia is caused by reduced (β +) or absent (β 0) synthesis of the β-globin chains of hemoglobin. Three clinical and hematological conditions of increasing severity are recognized: the β-thalassemia carrier state, thalassemia intermedia, and thalassemia major, a severe transfusion-dependent anemia. The severity of disease expression is related mainly to the degree of α-globin chain excess, which precipitates in the red blood cell precursors, causing both mechanic and oxidative damage (ineffective erythropoiesis). Any mechanism that reduces the number of unbound α-globin chains in the red cells may ameliorate the detrimental effects of excess α-globin chains. Factors include the inheritance of mild/silent β-thalassemia mutations, the coinheritance of α-thalassemia alleles, and increased γ-globin chain production. The clinical severity of β-thalassemia syndromes is also influenced by genetic factors unlinked to globin genes as well as environmental conditions and management. Transfusions and oral iron chelation therapy have dramatically improved the quality of life for patients with thalassemia major. Previously a rapidly fatal disease in early childhood, β-thalassemia is now a chronic disease with a greater life expectancy. At present, the only definitive cure is bone marrow transplantation.

### Clinical classification, screening and diagnosis for thalassemia [^117Qtn7C]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

At present, thalassemia diseases are classified into transfusion-dependent thalassemia and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia. This classification is based on the clinical severity of patients determining whether they do require regular blood transfusions to survive (transfusion-dependent thalassemia) or not (non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia). In addition to the previous terminology of "thalassemia major" or "thalassemia intermedia", this classification has embraced all other forms of thalassemia syndromes such as α-thalassemia, hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia and combined α- and β-thalassemias. Definitive diagnosis of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies requires a comprehensive workup from complete blood count, hemoglobin analysis, and molecular studies to identify mutations of globin genes.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Association between hemolysis and albuminuria in adults with sickle cell anemia [^112DCvDW]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Studies have questioned whether renal dysfunction in sickle cell disease is linked to hemolysis-associated vasculopathy. We have investigated renal function and markers of hemolysis in a cohort of 424 adult African-British patients with sickle cell disease. While significant associations were found in HbSS and HbSβ(0) (sickle cell anemia) patients with and without controlling for covariates between hemolytic markers and albuminuria, the associations were not significant in patients with HbSC. Estimated glomerular filtration rate, a marker of renal function, correlated significantly with reticulocyte count and bilirubin. Alpha thalassemia, present in 34% of the sickle cell anaemia patients, had a protective effect against albuminuria in this group. Altogether, the incidence of hyperfiltration was 71% and microalbuminuria 37%, making nephropathy a common complication of sickle cell anemia.

### Alpha-and beta-thalassemia: rapid evidence review [^1154Zw2C]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thalassemia is a group of autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathies affecting the production of normal alpha- or beta-globin chains that comprise hemoglobin. Ineffective production of alpha- or beta-globin chains may result in ineffective erythropoiesis, premature red blood cell destruction, and anemia. Chronic, severe anemia in patients with thalassemia may result in bone marrow expansion and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Thalassemia should be suspected in patients with microcytic anemia and normal or elevated ferritin levels. Hemoglobin electrophoresis may reveal common characteristics of different thalassemia subtypes, but genetic testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. Thalassemia is generally asymptomatic in trait and carrier states. Alpha-thalassemia major results in hydrops fetalis and is often fatal at birth. Beta-thalassemia major requires lifelong transfusions starting in early childhood (often before two years of age). Alpha- and beta-thalassemia intermedia have variable presentations based on gene mutation or deletion, with mild forms requiring only monitoring but more severe forms leading to symptomatic anemia and requiring transfusion. Treatment of thalassemia includes transfusions, iron chelation therapy to correct iron overload (from hemolytic anemia, intestinal iron absorption, and repeated transfusions), hydroxyurea, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and luspatercept. Thalassemia complications arise from bone marrow expansion, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and iron deposition in peripheral tissues. These complications include morbidities affecting the skeletal system, endocrine organs, heart, and liver. Life expectancy of those with thalassemia has improved dramatically over the past 50 years with increased availability of blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy, and improved iron overload monitoring. Genetic counseling and screening in high-risk populations can assist in reducing the prevalence of thalassemia.

### Bone disease in thalassemia: a frequent and still unresolved problem [^1141rxYp]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2009). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The thalassemia syndromes are a group of congenital hemolytic anemias characterized by the reduced or absent synthesis of one or more globin chains of hemoglobin. The two most common forms are the α and β thalassemias. β Thalassemias include β thalassemia major (β TM), β thalassemia intermedia (β TI), and E-β thalassemia (E-β), and result from > 200 mutations affecting the β globin gene cluster. The α thalassemia syndromes include hemoglobin H disease (HbH, or three gene α thalassemia), the co-inheritance of HbH disease with hemoglobin Constant Spring (HbH/CS) or other nondeletional α-globin mutations, and homozygous α thalassemia (Hz α).

The hallmark of thalassemia is an imbalance in α to β globin production, with the severity of anemia related to the degree of this imbalance. The variable phenotypic expression within and among the thalassemia syndromes results in a wide spectrum of anemia, which may require periodic or regular transfusions to sustain life. Typically, patients with β TM, Hz α, and HbH/CS and some with E-β require regular transfusions, whereas β TI and HbH are transfused sporadically, if at all. Because there is no physiologic means of excreting iron, transfusion therapy leads to progressive iron overload and ultimately multiple endocrinopathies, and potentially, lethal hepatic and/or cardiac complications. Iron chelation therapy with deferoxamine (DFO), introduced in the mid-1960s, has changed the course of transfusional iron overload, reducing iron excess and dramatically prolonging survival.

### Β-thalassemia minor&renal tubular dysfunction: is there any association? [^112Apdti]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, eGFR was not significantly different between the two groups. In previous studies, GFR did not change significantly in any type of thalassemia (major, intermediate, and minor). In the study of Nickavar et al. eGFR was insignificantly increased in thalassemic patients, which was probably secondary to anemia and decrease in systemic vascular resistance in addition to elevated renal plasma flow. Both tubular dysfunction and renal glomerular disorder may occur in patients with thalassemia. These disorders are probably due to decreased production of adenosine triphosphatase, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, prostaglandin secretion imbalance, hyperdynamic cardiovascular system, increased renal blood flow and glomerular hyperfiltration. Proximal tubular disorder has been reported in 13–60% of patients with all types of thalassemia. Increased urinary excretion of sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, N-acetyl glucosamine, beta 2-microglobulin, retinol binding protein, and glucose in association with decreased urinary osmolality are symptoms of renal tubular dysfunction in thalassemic patients. Increased protein excretion is one of the most common clinical manifestations of renal involvement, which is seen in about 70% of patients with thalassemia with renal impairment.

It has been suggested that renal tubular disorder may be secondary to anemia. Changing the cell function due to reducing the oxygen supply to renal tubular cells can be a major cause of this phenomenon. Empirical evidence has shown that anemia, can lead to renal hypoxia. The proximal tubular disorder has been reported in patients with iron deficiency anemia in Özçay et al.'s study. Therefore, tubular iron loading or red blood cell hemolysis toxins are a potential cause of impaired proximal tubular function. In addition, increased iron exchange due to mild hemolysis of microcytic erythrocytes with a significant increase in LDH level may be another factor associated with proximal tubular injury in patients with TM. Therefore, tubular iron or toxins loading due to red blood cell hemolysis is a potential cause of impaired proximal tubular function.

Studies on the function of all patients with TM are very rare. Renal tubular dysfunction in adults with TM can be due to hemolysis, reduced lifespan of erythrocytes, tubular Iron deposit, oxidative lipid peroxidation, and toxins produced from erythrocytes. Tubular dysfunction has also been reported in patients with iron deficiency anemia. But we believe the mechanisms described for tubular injury in TM are not logically acceptable. TM is not usually associated with iron overload. They do not have chronic hemolysis or severe anemia that explains tissue hypoxemia.

### Cellular and biochemical heterogeneity contributes to the phenotypic diversity of transfusion-dependent î ²-thalassemia [^114dWmAt]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

β-Thalassemia major is an autosomal recessive disorder with worldwide distribution. It stems from severely reduced (β +) or absent (β 0) production of β-globin chains that construct the hemoglobin (Hb) tetramer. The unassembled alpha chains are prone to degradation and precipitation in the precursor erythroid and mature red blood cells (RBCs), thus promoting apoptosis/ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. Auto-oxidation of Hb contributes to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), methemoglobin (metHb), and hemichromes that exhibit high affinity binding to RBC membrane. This interaction leads to biophysical (eg, loss of stability or deformability) and biochemical (eg, ion channel activity) defects, accelerated aging, and surface expression of anionic phospholipids, which contributes to hypercoagulability, more often seen in splenectomized patients. Toxic accumulation, modifications, and interactions of free globin chains render β-thalassemia major a kind of protein aggregation disease. The resulting premature RBCs clearance may cause macrophage overwhelming, iron toxicity, and activation of proinflammatory pathways that transmit intracellular stress to plasma. Release of Hb and Hb degradation products affects nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability in this department and triggers further oxidative and proinflammatory reactions to blood cells, endothelium, and vital organs.

Although primary defects and genetic modifiers have been well determined, less is known about downstream pathways that disturb the survival and functionality of RBCs in severe transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). However, several aspects of diseased RBCs have been associated with clinical manifestations in sickle cell disease (SCD). Similarly to SCD, TDT is characterized by complex pathophysiology that affects multiple organ systems, as well as clinical heterogeneity in terms of genetics, transfusion and chelation regimes, splenectomy, and complications. Heterogeneity in RBC phenotypes and plasma biochemistry may highlight overlooked aspects of TDT pathophysiology, and its exploration could contribute to the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease severity. Moreover, it constitutes a potential source of clinical variability, with implications in disease management in the ever-changing landscape of traditional and novel treatments. To this end, we performed a cross-sectional study of RBC and plasma physiology in a cohort of patients with TDT. We elucidated the core cellular and biochemical profiles of the disease and how they change under the influence of sex, spleen status, transfusion interval, and other variables.

### Chronic organ injuries in children with sickle cell disease [^114pjoUf]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of chronic organ injury

SCD originates from the sickle mutation on the HBB gene (Glu6Val, bS), the most common and severe form being homozygous HbSS. Other forms of SCD include compound heterozygous conditions, such as hemoglobin C (HbC) with HbS (HbSC), HbS with b-thalassemia (HbS/b 0 -thalassemia or HbS/b + -thalassemia), and HbS with other b-globin variants resulting in sufficient HbS expression to cause sickling. Under deoxygenation, sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes and erythrocytes undergo a rapid but reversible change in shape, resulting in both chronic hemolysis and small-vessel obstruction, which have long been recognized as the main contributors to SCD pathophysiology. Paradoxically, tissue injury is exacerbated by reperfusionenabled re-entry of oxygen during the ischemia/reperfusion process (I/R). I/R is responsible for systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial dysfunction via various mechanisms. Endothelial vasoregulatory dysfunction is observed from childhood, and chronic anemia is responsible for concomitant increased blood flow. The association of macrovascular hyperemia and microvascular hypoperfusion, that Hebbel et al. referred to as the sickle cell "perfusion paradox", is extremely challenging for major organs such as the brain, kidney, and heart, which may fail to respond and adapt to the need for increased oxygen. Moreover, systemic inflammation is amplified by the release of free heme and hemoglobin during hemolysis, inducing oxidative stress, cell death, and vascular integrity damage. Heme was notably shown to be a potent activator of endothelial cells, leading to an increased expression of major adhesion molecules such as P-selectin. Finally, each organ (and, indeed, each patient) represents a unique combination of hypoxia, inflammatory and oxidative stress, activation of innate immunity, hyperviscosity and hypercoagulability in response to genetic and environmental agedependent drivers. Organ defense may be adapted for a certain length of time, or 'over-adapted', for example, when neoangiogenesis induces the generation of a network of collateral vessels which are prone to ruptures, provoking ocular or cerebral hemorrhages. Sickling-related acute events may be regressive with unsickling but endothelial damage is most often irreversible.

Chronic organ injuries will be presented here according to their impact on mortality in adult patients.

### Coagulation in the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias [^11424wky]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Coagulation abnormalities are frequently reported in hemolytic anemias (HA). Several pathophysiologic mechanisms are common to different HA. In this review three different hemolytic disorders will be discussed. In sickle cell disease and in beta-thalassemia, a thrombophilic status has been well documented as multifactorial involving hemostatic changes and activation of the coagulation cascade. Moreover, in such disorders, elevated levels of endothelial adhesion protein (ICAM-1, ELAM-1, VCAM-1, von Willebrand factor, and thrombomodulin) are often increased, suggesting that endothelial activation may be involved in vascular occlusion. As an additional mechanism of hypercoagulability in thalassemia, a procoagulant status of thalassemic red cells was recognized. The main clinical manifestation of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is HA, and the most common complications are thrombosis, pancytopenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia. The intravascular hemolysis is explained by a deficiency of glycosil phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored complement regulatory proteins such as CD59 and CD55 on the membrane of red blood cells (RBCs), but the mechanism responsible for the increased incidence of thrombotic events in PNH remains unclear. Recent advances have been made in understanding the coagulation involvement in a heterogeneous group of diseases, thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping in the microcirculation, leading to ischemic organ dysfunction with neurologic symptoms and renal impairment.

### Impact of iron overload on incidence of diabetes mellitus, cardiac disease, and death in congenital hemolytic anemias [^112fJyk3]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Humans are unable to actively excrete iron. Therefore, iron homeostasis requires modulation of intestinal iron uptake to reflect the body's iron stores. In patients with iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of iron absorption and metabolism is disrupted, resulting in accumulation of iron in body tissues such as the liver and spleen. In other disease states such as beta-thalassemia, known derangements in the hepcidin axis secondary to ineffective erythropoiesis similarly lead to dysregulated iron absorption; iron overload in severe thalassemia is further exacerbated by dependence on blood transfusions. Improved control of iron overload has been shown to strongly correlate with a lower probability of heart disease and death in patients susceptible to hemosiderosis.

Although the exact prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis is unclear, it is estimated to be as high as 1 in 227 in people of Northern European descent. Conditions causing iron overload, however, extend far beyond classical hemochromatosis. For example, an estimated 26 000 patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia are born annually. When combined with the population of patients with other hereditary or acquired anemias requiring chronic transfusions, iron overload and its associated complications contribute to a substantial global burden of adverse health outcomes.

Over the past several decades, life expectancies for patients with chronic hemolytic anemias such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease have improved substantially, in part due to the advent of iron chelators, among other innovations such as advances in blood safety and development of tailored therapies. As patients with these lifelong conditions are living longer into adulthood, there is a great need to better understand the long-term goals of iron chelation and the clinical risks of varying degrees of iron overload over long periods of time. These considerations need to be carefully balanced with the toxicity profiles of currently available iron chelators, which include adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, oculotoxicity, and ototoxicity. To date, there is significant practice variation among individuals and institutions in the use and titration of iron chelators. Emerging evidence suggests that even mild iron overload, when present over decades, can confer a substantial risk of malignancy, diabetes, and other adverse health outcomes, although these claims have not been studied in varied patient populations. To date, most studies related to iron overload and the associated long-term risks are limited to hereditary hemochromatosis. In patients with iron overload caused by congenital hemolytic anemias, there has been no study evaluating the temporal dose-response relationship between serum markers of iron overload and long-term health complications. Filling this critical gap was the aim of this study.
