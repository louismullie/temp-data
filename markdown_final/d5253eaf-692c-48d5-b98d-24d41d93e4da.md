## Question

Petequia in the lower extremitie localized to one leg causes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of petechiae localized to one leg (unilateral lower-extremity petechiae). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of unilateral versus bilateral petechiae and the immediate red flags. Then, I should categorize the differential by pathophysiology and prioritize life-threatening causes. Next, I will review key entities that can present unilaterally, including vasculitis, pseudovasculitis, vascular occlusion, and nutritional or hematologic disorders. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic approach, including when to biopsy and what labs to order. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management plan and highlight pitfalls and special populations, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of unilateral petechiae. Unilateral distribution is less common than bilateral and should prompt me to consider local mechanical or vascular factors, or focal vasculitis, while still excluding systemic bleeding disorders and infections. I should double-check that bilateral petechiae are more typical of systemic vasculitides, pigmented purpuric dermatoses, and thrombocytopenia, whereas unilateral lesions push me toward localized processes or asymmetric systemic disease expression. Wait, let me verify the bilateral predilection of pigmented purpuric dermatoses and stasis-related purpura; yes, both classically involve both lower extremities, reinforcing that unilateral lesions warrant a different initial branch in the differential [^117SphFE] [^112UEuAH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to screen for red flags that mandate urgent action. Fever, systemic toxicity, mucosal bleeding, neurologic symptoms, or rapidly progressive lesions should trigger concern for sepsis, purpura fulminans, meningococcemia, or catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and I should act before waiting for confirmatory tests if the patient is unstable. I should confirm that purpura fulminans presents with ecchymoses and skin necrosis in the setting of DIC and requires immediate resuscitation and source control, and that CAPS can present with diffuse microthrombosis and high mortality if not treated promptly [^115mcsUb] [^116RZmAc] [^11413nH8].

> Next, I will organize the differential by pathophysiology to keep the reasoning tight. Let me consider small-vessel vasculitis, pseudovasculitic hemorrhagic disorders, vascular occlusion or thrombosis, nutritional deficiencies, hematologic platelet disorders, and infectious etiologies. I should confirm that small-vessel vasculitis typically shows palpable purpura on the lower extremities and often requires biopsy with direct immunofluorescence for diagnosis, while pseudovasculitis mimics vasculitis clinically but lacks true vessel wall inflammation on histology [^116cWkhk] [^115eqzAo] [^115Nrb8y].

> I will now examine vasculitic causes that can present unilaterally. IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) is usually bilateral, but wait, I should verify exceptions; case-based literature shows parainfectious IgA vasculitis can be skin-limited and occasionally asymmetric, so unilateral involvement is not impossible, especially with recent infection. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis from drugs, infections, or idiopathic causes can also be asymmetric early on. I need to ensure I remember that biopsy with IgA deposition supports IgA vasculitis, whereas drug-induced LCV may show neutrophilic infiltrates and fibrin without IgA, guiding the workup and counseling on triggers [^115LKQhN] [^116fbkiW] [^115eqzAo].

> Let me consider pseudovasculitic hemorrhagic disorders next. Scurvy can produce perifollicular hemorrhage, petechiae, and ecchymoses, often on the lower extremities, and may be overlooked in patients with restricted diets or malabsorption. I should double-check that modern case series and reviews emphasize delayed diagnosis and the classic mucocutaneous triad, and that vitamin C deficiency impairs collagen-dependent vascular integrity, explaining petechiae and poor wound healing. But wait, what if the patient has no dietary risk? I should still ask about supplements, restrictive eating, alcohol use, and GI disease before excluding it [^115fASxk] [^111bgen5] [^114ukYF6] [^115Gy8VT].

> I need to check for vascular occlusion and thrombotic etiologies that can mimic or cause purpura unilaterally. Calciphylaxis in ESRD presents with intensely painful retiform purpura and ulceration and can be unilateral; warfarin-induced skin necrosis typically occurs within days of initiation and favors central areas, but I should confirm exceptions. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis from hepatitis C or lymphoproliferative disease can cause palpable purpura and livedo, sometimes asymmetric early, and may require cryoglobulin testing and rheumatologic evaluation. Essential thrombocythemia can cause occlusive vasculopathy with purpura and livedo, so I should review CBC and JAK2 testing if suspected [^113Z32SM] [^113g48au] [^116px51F] [^116yjH3R].

> But wait, what if the lesions are not vasculitic at all and reflect venous hypertension or stasis. Stasis dermatitis and pigmented purpuric dermatoses are typically bilateral, yet focal or early disease can appear asymmetric; I should confirm associated edema, hemosiderin deposition, and pruritus, and consider duplex ultrasound if the diagnosis is uncertain. Linear or segmental pigmented purpuric dermatosis variants have been reported, reminding me that unilateral presentations, while uncommon, do occur and are benign but chronic [^117SphFE] [^112UEuAH] [^1115whiq] [^112MFC8z].

> I should review hematologic platelet disorders carefully. Immune thrombocytopenia and drug-induced thrombocytopenia can present with petechiae, but I need to ensure the platelet count is actually low before anchoring on this. Let me verify severity thresholds: counts below 50,000 increase mucocutaneous bleeding risk, and below 10,000 the risk of serious bleeding rises; petechiae without systemic purpura can still be the first clue. I should also remember inherited thrombocytopenias and qualitative defects, which may present with easy bruising and petechiae even with modest count reductions [^11116SA2] [^1169QU2y] [^112piSZM].

> Next, I should review infectious etiologies that can produce petechial rashes, keeping in mind distribution. Parvovirus B19 can cause a generalized petechial eruption, often with fever and hematologic abnormalities, and may be accentuated distally; chikungunya can produce a maculopapular exanthem early, with thrombocytopenia in some cases. I need to ensure I correlate timing with systemic symptoms and travel or outbreak exposure before assigning infectious causes to unilateral lesions, as most infectious petechiae are generalized or symmetrically distributed [^115cSN5N] [^116K57C9].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach. I should start with a focused history for trauma, medications, diet, systemic symptoms, and comorbidities, then a thorough skin and joint exam, and basic labs including CBC, platelet count, PT/INR, aPTT, and renal and hepatic panels. If vasculitis is suspected, I should obtain a skin biopsy from the freshest purpuric lesion for routine histology and direct immunofluorescence, and add urinalysis to screen for renal involvement. If thrombocytopenia is present, I should verify with a peripheral smear and consider autoimmune, drug, viral, or hereditary causes. If occlusion is suspected, I should check for cryoglobulins, hepatitis C, and consider JAK2 testing for ET; if DVT is a concern, duplex ultrasound is indicated [^115eqzAo] [^116cWkhk] [^1169QU2y] [^116yjH3R] [^113EweB2].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to urgent imaging or inpatient care. Signs of DVT, rapidly progressive purpura with pain, necrosis, or systemic instability warrant expedited vascular studies and hospitalization. I need to ensure I do not miss purpura fulminans or CAPS in unstable patients, where delays in plasma exchange, anticoagulation, or immunosuppression can be catastrophic [^116b7XD2] [^115mcsUb] [^116RZmAc].

> Now, I will synthesize management by likely etiology, but I should double-check each step against guidelines. For vasculitis, systemic corticosteroids are first-line for cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, with immunosuppressive agents for refractory or systemic disease; for IgA vasculitis, supportive care and monitoring for renal and GI involvement are essential. For scurvy, vitamin C replacement produces dramatic improvement and should be instituted promptly once suspected. For stasis-related purpura, compression therapy, leg elevation, and topical anti-inflammatories are foundational. For thrombocytopenia, treat the underlying cause and transfuse platelets if there is active bleeding or counts are very low. For calciphylaxis, urgent wound care, pain control, and multidisciplinary management are critical, with attention to mineral metabolism and avoidance of warfarin when possible [^116cWkhk] [^115fASxk] [^114xiUbZ] [^1169QU2y] [^113Z32SM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked a pitfall: assuming unilateral petechiae are always benign. I should confirm that early vasculitis, asymmetric pseudovasculitis, and occlusive disorders can all begin focally, so a low threshold for biopsy and systemic evaluation is prudent when the story does not fit simple mechanical causes. I also need to remember that pigmented purpuric dermatoses can be linear or segmental and unilateral, which can mislead toward vasculitis if I do not correlate histology with the clinical course [^1115whiq] [^112MFC8z] [^115Nrb8y].

> Let me reconsider special populations briefly. In infants and young children, well-appearing children with localized petechiae on the lower extremities often have benign mechanical or tourniquet phenomena, but I should confirm absence of fever and systemic signs before deferring workup. In adolescents, unilateral swelling with petechiae should prompt evaluation for DVT, especially with risk factors or systemic symptoms. In older adults with chronic venous disease, stasis dermatitis and its mimics are common, but I should not miss calciphylaxis or drug-induced vasculitis in the right clinical context [^114D1Z6G] [^1116kp8n] [^116mLSjL] [^114xiUbZ].

> In summary, unilateral lower-extremity petechiae should trigger a structured approach: screen for red flags, categorize by pathophysiology, and pursue targeted labs and biopsy when indicated. I need to ensure I keep life-threatening vasculitides, occlusive disorders, and infections in view while also recognizing that pseudovasculitic and focal variants exist. Early biopsy with DIF, judicious use of imaging, and etiology-specific therapy are the cornerstones of safe, effective care, and I should verify each step against the clinical evolution to avoid premature closure [^113D181r] [^115eqzAo] [^116cWkhk].

Localized petechiae on one leg most often reflect **mechanical trauma** (minor injury, scratching, tight clothing, or friction) [^112hUC5Z] or **venous hypertension/stasis** from chronic venous insufficiency or edema, which cause capillary fragility and extravasation of red blood cells [^114xiUbZ] [^112UEuAH]. Less commonly, **vasculitis** (IgA vasculitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis) [^116cWkhk], **thrombocytopenia** [^11116SA2], or **infection** (meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever) [^11413nH8] may present unilaterally but are typically accompanied by systemic symptoms or abnormal labs [^115cSN5N]. Evaluation should include a focused history, exam for trauma/stasis, and labs (CBC, platelets, coagulation profile) [^notfound]; biopsy is reserved for persistent, atypical, or systemic features [^114kj8fR].

---

## Mechanical trauma and friction

- **Minor trauma**: Petechiae often result from minor injuries, scratching, or friction from tight clothing, shoes, or medical devices (e.g. compression stockings, casts) [^115Nrb8y].

- **Exercise-induced**: Strenuous exercise or prolonged standing can cause transient petechiae due to increased capillary pressure and fragility [^117SphFE].

- **Tourniquet phenomenon**: In infants, tight diapers or clothing can cause localized petechiae ("tourniquet phenomenon") [^114D1Z6G].

---

## Vascular disorders

### Venous insufficiency and stasis dermatitis

Chronic venous insufficiency causes venous hypertension, capillary fragility, and extravasation of red blood cells, leading to petechiae and pigmented purpuric dermatoses [^114xiUbZ]. Stasis dermatitis presents with erythema, edema, and petechiae, typically over the medial malleolus and lower legs [^112UEuAH].

---

### Vasculitis

- **IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura)**: Typically bilateral, but unilateral presentations can occur; characterized by palpable purpura, arthralgia, gastrointestinal, and renal involvement [^116RZmAc].

- **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis**: Small-vessel vasculitis presenting as palpable purpura, often unilateral, associated with drugs, infections, or autoimmune diseases [^115eqzAo].

- **Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis**: Associated with hepatitis C, presenting with purpura, arthralgia, and systemic symptoms [^113eJD3b].

---

## Hematological disorders

### Thrombocytopenia

Immune thrombocytopenia presents with **petechiae** due to low platelet counts, often unilateral but usually generalized [^11116SA2]. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia from medications such as heparin, quinine, or antibiotics can also cause petechiae [^1169QU2y].

---

### Coagulation disorders

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is rare but serious, presenting with **petechiae**, purpura, and bleeding; usually generalized but can be unilateral in early stages [^notfound]. Anticoagulant therapy (warfarin, heparin) may cause bleeding and petechiae, particularly with trauma or vascular injury [^116fXzLy].

---

## Infectious etiologies

- **Meningococcemia**: Rapidly progressive petechial rash associated with fever, hypotension, and systemic symptoms [^116RZmAc].

- **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**: Petechial rash starting on wrists and ankles, associated with fever and systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Parvovirus B19**: Can cause petechial rash, often generalized but occasionally localized [^115cSN5N].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

1. **History and physical examination**: Identify trauma, medications, systemic symptoms, vascular insufficiency
2. **Laboratory tests (CBC, platelet count, coagulation profile)**: Assess for thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders
3. **Skin biopsy**: Confirm vasculitis, pseudovasculitis, or other dermatologic conditions [^115eqzAo]
4. **Imaging (duplex ultrasound)**: Evaluate venous insufficiency or thrombosis [^113EweB2]

---

## Clinical significance and management

Localized petechiae on one leg are **usually benign** and often due to mechanical trauma or venous insufficiency [^114D1Z6G] [^1177Uxaf]. Persistent, recurrent, or associated systemic symptoms require further evaluation to exclude vasculitis, thrombocytopenia, or infection [^113D181r]. Management is cause-specific: compression therapy for venous insufficiency, immunosuppressive therapy for vasculitis, and supportive care for thrombocytopenia or infection [^112UEuAH] [^116px51F] [^1169QU2y].

---

Localized petechiae on one leg are most commonly due to **mechanical trauma** or **venous insufficiency**, but unilateral petechiae can also signal vasculitis, thrombocytopenia, or infection. A focused history, exam, and targeted labs usually clarify the cause; biopsy is reserved for persistent or atypical cases [^notfound].

### Diagnostic approach to leukemia cutis: a differential diagnostic step-by-step algorithm [^115jfVkU]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with leukemia cutis may have typically multiple, less often single lesions, usually representing nodules, plaques, and papules, but rarely, erythema, ulcers, or blisters may also appear. The most affected body parts are the legs, followed by arms, back, chest, scalp, and face, while palmoplantar and oral mucosa involvement is rare. Sites of previous or concomitant inflammation tend to be preferentially involved. It is important to note that a high proportion of patients with leukemia have skin lesions that are not leukemia cutis, mainly bleeding abnormalities (petechiae, purpurae) and infectious skin lesions due to cytopenia that should be taken into differential diagnostic considerations, both clinically and histologically.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis of Leukemia Cutis

Nonspecific Reactive Skin Lesions

Clinically and histologically, leukemia cutis can be confused with a wide array of skin conditions. The major clinical differential diagnoses are nonleukemic cutaneous manifestations of leukemia mentioned above that are known as leukemids. These cutaneous complications may be caused by various factors, such as cytopenias due to bone marrow failure, cutaneous side effects of antileukemic treatment, or immune-mediated diseases (eg, petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, neutrophilic/eosinophilic/blistering dermatoses, herpesvirus disease). Together with the evidence for a major clinical impact of only histologically confirmed extramedullary leukemia manifestations, this suggests that, whenever possible, histologic confirmation in any suspect case of leukemia cutis should be attempted.

### Painful medial thigh ulcer [^113Z32SM]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and warfarin presented with a new, painful ulcer on her left inner thigh. Gross examination showed retiform purpura with central ulceration and black-brown crusting (Fig 1, A). A biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the lesion showed full-thickness ischemic necrosis with overlying ulceration and diffuse dermal angiomatosis with scattered calcification deposits around the subcutaneous vessels in the subcutaneous septae (Fig 1, B). Grocott methenamine silver and gram stains were negative for fungal or bacterial organisms.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Calciphylaxis
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis
E. Venous ulcer

Answer:
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis – Incorrect. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a condition characterized by a transient hypercoagulable state that causes thrombotic skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis on dorsal or distal extremities within days of initiating warfarin.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Affecting the skin and kidneys, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that often presents with asymmetric polyneuropathy and abdominal pain.
C. Calciphylaxis – Correct. Characterized by small- and medium-vessel calcification causing chronic, low-grade ischemia, calciphylaxis most often occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease, known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Calciphylaxis can also occur in the absence of renal disease (nonuremic calciphylaxis). Risk factors include elevated calcium and phosphate levels, female sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, high alkaline phosphatase, warfarin therapy, low serum albumin, and systemic corticosteroid use. Clinical manifestations include intense local pain with ulceration of the medial thighs from microthrombi causing local infarction with diffuse calcification of small capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue.
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis – Incorrect. Levamisole-induced vasculitis arises from cocaine that has been laced with levamisole, an anthelminthic drug that can be reduced to a fine white powder but has been discontinued for humans. Widespread ulcers often involve the ears and affect at least 10% total body surface area.
E. Venous ulcer – Incorrect. While venous ulcers are the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, they are often shallow and present on calves and ankles.

### Acral petechial eruptions without gastrointestinal symptoms: three cases of dermatitis herpetiformis [^11415osa]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dermatitis herpetiformis classically presents with intensely pruritic vesiculopapules on the extensor surfaces and is associated with gluten sensitivity and celiac disease. Acral petechiae and purpura are an uncommon but important presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis that can help guide the astute diagnostician, especially because they may be the only sign of gluten sensitivity. We report 3 cases of dermatitis herpetiformis presenting with acral petechiae in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Auranofin (Ridaura) [^113wzuaj]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Danger signs of possible gold toxicity include fall in hemoglobin, leukopenia below 4,000 WBC/cu mm, granulocytes below 1,500/cu mm, decrease in platelets below 150,000/cu mm, proteinuria, hematuria, pruritus, rash, stomatitis or persistent diarrhea.

Thrombocytopenia has occurred in 1–3% of patients (See ADVERSE REACTIONS) treated with RIDAURA (auranofin), some of whom developed bleeding. The thrombocytopenia usually appears to be peripheral in origin and is usually reversible upon withdrawal of RIDAURA. Its onset bears no relationship to the duration of RIDAURA therapy and its course may be rapid. While patients' platelet counts should normally be monitored at least monthly (See PRECAUTIONS — Laboratory Tests), the occurrence of a precipitous decline in platelets or a platelet count less than 100,000/cu mm or signs and symptoms (e.g., purpura, ecchymoses or petechiae) suggestive of thrombocytopenia indicates a need to immediately withdraw RIDAURA and other therapies with the potential to cause thrombocytopenia, and to obtain additional platelet counts. No additional RIDAURA should be given unless the thrombocytopenia resolves and further studies show it was not due to gold therapy.

Proteinuria has developed in 3–9% of patients (See ADVERSE REACTIONS) treated with RIDAURA. If clinically significant proteinuria or microscopic hematuria is found (See PRECAUTIONS — Laboratory Tests), RIDAURA and other therapies with the potential to cause proteinuria or microscopic hematuria should be stopped immediately.

### Purpuric eruption of the breasts, abdomen, thighs, and buttocks [^1131CS6g]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What cutaneous diagnosis is most likely?
A. Angiosarcoma
B. Kaposi's sarcoma
C. Reactive angioendotheliomatosis (RAE)
D. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)
E. Calciphylaxis

Answers:
A. Angiosarcoma – Incorrect. Angiosarcoma is more typically seen in older adults, and would most commonly appear as indurated purpuric or bruise-like lesions on the face and scalp.
B. Kaposi's sarcoma – Incorrect. Kaposi sarcoma would typically present with slowly enlarging vascular patches or plaques with more defined demarcation than this case.
C. RAE – Correct. RAE is a rare, benign entity characterized by proliferation of endothelial cells within vascular lumina. It is often seen in patients with coexistent systemic disease, such as autoimmune disease (as in our patient, who met criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus), chronic infection, lymphoproliferative disorder, cryoproteinemia, severe atherosclerotic disease, or valvular heart disease.RAE may present with erythematous to violaceous patches, plaques, or nodules, with or without a livedoid pattern, necrosis, blisters, or ulceration. The presence of superimposed focal purpura, petechiae, or ecchymoses may serve as a clinical clue.
D. PAN – Incorrect. The clinical features of cutaneous PAN can be similar to RAE, commonly presenting with lower extremity subcutaneous nodules, livedoid changes, and occasionally ulceration.
E. Calciphylaxis – Incorrect. Retiform purpura and marked pain would be more classic for a diagnosis of calciphylaxis. The lesions of calciphylaxis are most commonly noted on the lower legs, though a large portion of patients can also exhibit involvement on central, adipose-rich areas of the body; acral and genital lesions are also possible.

### Reticular rash on the lower extremities [^111HHZSg]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old woman presented with numbness, tingling, and an asymptomatic rash on the bilateral lower extremities. She had a history of recently diagnosed untreated multiple myeloma. Physical examination found decreased sensation over the bilateral feet and symmetric, violaceous, reticular patches over the bilateral lower extremities (Fig 1). Laboratory studies found a monoclonal IgG κ gammopathy and elevated serum viscosity elevation to 2.0 centipoises. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiphospholipid antibodies, and hepatitis serologies were negative. Skin biopsy found subcuticular vessels with intimal hyperplasia, increased reactive small vessels, and hemosiderin deposition suggestive of prior vascular thrombosis and no associated vasculitis (Fig 2).

Question 1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Classic polyarteritis nodosa
B. Rheumatoid vasculitis
C. Type I cryoglobulinemia
D. Mixed cryoglobulinemia
E. Antiphospholipid syndrome

### Patterned eruption following fishnet stocking use [^116fbkiW]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lichen planus
B. IgA vasculitis
C. Urticarial vasculitis
D. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis
E. Dermatitis herpetiformis

Answers:
A. Lichen planus – Incorrect. Lichen planus presents with pruritic violaceous papules and plaques with Wickham striae on the lower extremities and exhibits the Koebner phenomenon. Direct immunofluorescence shows shaggy fibrinogen deposition along the basement membrane and Civatte bodies staining for IgM, IgG, IgA, or C3.
B. IgA vasculitis – Correct. IgA vasculitis (IgAV), also known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, presents with palpable purpura on the bilateral lower extremities and can rarely exhibit the Koebner phenomenon, as shown in this case. Malaise and arthralgias support the diagnosis, along with direct immunofluorescence findings of granular IgA within the walls of superficial papillary dermal blood vessels, as shown in Fig 3.
C. Urticarial vasculitis – Incorrect. The pruritic papules and plaques in urticarial vasculitis typically affect the trunk and proximal extremities. Additionally, histology shows evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis with neutrophilic infiltrate and fibrinoid necrosis in vessels without IgA deposition.
D. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis – Incorrect. Lesions often appear as purpuric papules, plaques, and petechiae with a characteristic "cayenne-pepper-like" appearance on the bilateral lower extremities, accompanied by pruritus and pain. Histopathology shows perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate around blood vessels with endothelial cell swelling, without leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Fibrinogen can be seen on direct immunofluorescence; however, IgA deposition is not characteristically noted.
E. Dermatitis herpetiformis – Incorrect. The eruption is pruritic but typically vesiculopapular, affecting extensor surfaces, buttocks, and scalp. Granular IgA deposition occurs within superficial dermal papillae, not within blood vessel walls.

### Unilateral leg swelling in a newborn [^114nV3KP]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

A female neonate was born with asymmetric lower limbs, the right leg appearing enlarged, with thickened, reddish-purple skin and ectasic superficial reticulum (figure 1A, B). Limb pulses were present and symmetrical. The girl's family history and prenatal scans were unremarkable. Laboratory findings were within the normal range, except for a mild thrombocytopenia (90 000/μL), which spontaneously resolved during the next few days. A leg X-ray and the Doppler analysis ruled out the presence of calcifications and venous varices, respectively. Ultrasound showed significant skin thickening, with marked dermal hypertrophy and hyperechogenicity. Magnetic resonance showed circumferential thickening of the derma, with mild hypertrophy of some perforating vessels (figure 2). A biopsy of the right thigh showed capillary malformations on histology.

### 2011: the scurvy odyssey [^114ukYF6]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors report the case of a 50-year-old alcoholic man with chronic hepatitis C virus infection, who presented to the emergency department with fever and exuberant ecchymoses and petechiae on both legs. After a careful examination and laboratory assessment, the not-so-obvious hypothesis of scurvy was disclosed. Simply with vitamin C replacement and nutritional advice, a dramatic improvement in his condition was observed. In modern societies, a generalised access to food renders scurvy as a rare disease, often misdiagnosed. A multidisciplinary approach is emphasised as the key to a more simple differential diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary exams and preventing serious complications, or even death, if left untreated.

### Edema: diagnosis and management [^113EweB2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.

### Stasis dermatitis: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^112UEuAH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Stasis dermatitis commonly occurs in older age. It is caused by venous hypertension resulting from retrograde flow due to incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or obstruction of the venous system. Further tissue changes arise from an inflammatory process mediated by metalloproteinases, which are up-regulated by ferric ion from extravasated red blood cells. Stasis dermatitis presents initially as poorly demarcated erythematous plaques of the lower legs bilaterally, classically involving the medial malleolus. It is one of the spectrum of cutaneous findings that may result from chronic venous insufficiency. Its mimics include cellulitis, contact dermatitis, and pigmented purpuric dermatoses. Duplex ultrasound is useful in demonstrating venous reflux when the clinical diagnosis of stasis dermatitis is inadequate. Conservative treatment involves the use of compression therapy directed at improving ambulatory venous pressure. Interventional therapy currently includes minimally invasive techniques such as endovenous thermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, which have supplanted the use of open surgical techniques.

4.3 Neoplasm

Hypopigmented mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common childhood variant of cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma (CTCL); it may resemble pityriasis alba found in AD patients. Indeed, AD accounts for almost one‐third of the initial diagnoses of MF. It presents as ill‐defined hypopigmented and minimally desquamating patches distributed mainly in the photo‐protected areas (bathing suits area), which may be itchy and finely wrinkled due to atrophy. The gold standard of diagnosis is biopsy, which will show a lymphocytic infiltrate with marked epidermotropism, and an immunohistochemical examination and T‐cell rearrangement study may be useful.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is also in differential diagnosis.LCH on the skin has a heterogeneous presentation, but the most typical is with flesh‐colored papules and plaques on the folds, scalp, and lower trunk. Petechiae are found on seborrheic areas, making the differential diagnosis with ISD and AD easier. Another differential is the unresponsive nature of the classic AD therapies. Letterer‐Siwe disease (LSD) is a malignant form of LCH most seen in children with a clinic resembling ISD or more frequently with ulceration of the scalp and folds. Petechiae and pustules are also reported.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^112mvDwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age, the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP's diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.

### Hemorrhagic rash on the legs [^115LKQhN]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old woman presented with hemorrhagic macules and papules, especially affecting the lower extremity (Fig 1). Two weeks prior to presentation, she had cough, diarrhea, malaise, and limb pain. Infection with COVID-19 was confirmed through polymerase chain reaction. The rash began as a pruritic eruption on her right tibia, progressing to the current presentation over 2 days. C-reactive protein level was found to be increased (60.4 mg/L; normal level, ≤ 5.0 mg/L). The measurement of kidney function and blood count revealed no anomalies. Two skin biopsies were taken: one for histologic examination and the other for direct immunofluorescence (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Schamberg disease
B. COVID-associated vasculopathy
C. Skin-limited IgA vasculitis
D. Thrombocytopenic purpura
E. Rocky Mountain spotted fever

Answers:
A. Schamberg disease–Incorrect. Although the distribution of Schamberg disease is often symmetrical on the lower extremities as in the present case, this condition does not account for the severe fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls as identified in the histology.
B. COVID-associated vasculopathy–Incorrect. Vasculopathy is defined by thickening of the intima due to the deposition of immunoglobulins, complement components, and fibrinogen without inflammatory lymphocyte infiltration. In the present case, fibrinoid necrosis and leukocytoclasia were present.
C. Skin-limited IgA vasculitis–Correct. The patient showed a typical manifestation of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which often occurs parainfectious. The fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls, nuclear dust from neutrophil fragmentation, and extravasation of red blood cells in addition to direct immunofluorescence staining with IgA are common characteristics of IgA vasculitis.
D. Thrombocytopenic purpura–Incorrect. Laboratory findings showed no sign of thrombocytopenia.
E. Rocky Mountain spotted fever–Incorrect. Although hemorrhagic rash is one of the common symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, our patient had no history of potential tick exposure and was not in an endemic area.

### Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated localized extremity edema and erythema [^116wQ7EU]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Our cases exhibit the variability in disease course of localized extremity edema and erythema in the setting of BTK inhibitor therapy. Both cases began with a well-demarcated, irregularly bordered, erythematous-violaceous plaque that presented proximally and progressed distally, but only one case progressed to debilitating edema that persisted despite discontinuation of therapy. Overall, this presentation is quite distinct from typical peripheral edema. Although early findings were clinically suggestive of an inflammatory etiology such as a pigmented purpuric dermatosis, or less likely angiosarcoma, later findings in case 1 were more suggestive of eosinophilic cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis. As histopathology showed no evidence of inflammation or neoplastic cells, imaging was done to evaluate for thrombosis or obstruction that could produce this irregular edema with duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Although age may have contributed to their risk of venous insufficiency, they had no clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal insufficiency or hypoalbuminemia and their clinical presentation was not typical of standard peripheral edema. Awareness of the initial disease presentation, which is clinically suggestive of an inflammatory dermatosis, will allow early initiation of compression therapy, and potentially improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in these patients. Further research into the pathogenesis of this adverse effect is necessary to improve treatment options for these patients.

Unique Patient Populations

Chronic Bleeding Disorders

Scope of the Problem

SCS has enjoyed increased popularity over the past decade in the treatment of chronic pain owing to its safety profile, established efficacy for several chronic pain pathologies, and minimally invasive nature. The last of these is especially attractive among patients with medical comorbidities aiming to avoid the risks of general anesthesia, prolonged recovery times with more invasive surgical options, and procedural blood loss. While there are published guidelines by the Neuromodulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee (NACC) regarding chronic anticoagulation therapy during SCS procedures, this situation differs critically from the care of patients with chronic bleeding disorders. The risk for patients with chronic bleeding disorders extends beyond the immediate perioperative time frame. There is a theoretical increased bleeding risk related to the presence of SCS leads in the epidural space, which coexists with a network of epidural venous plexuses. The consequences and management of spontaneous or late bleeding must be considered as well. Specifically, we consider patients with chronic thrombocytopenia and hepatic dysfunction.

Disease State: Chronic Thrombocytopenia

There exists a myriad of rare causes of chronic thrombocytopenia which require special consideration in relation to SCS. Causes include, but are not limited to, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), aplastic anemia, leukemias, and hypersplenism. The severity of thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction among patients with MDS is variable. Among those afflicted, data indicate that 26% have moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts 20,000–50,000 cells/L) and 17% have severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts < 20,000 cells/L). Though the severity of thrombocytopenia is benchmarked by serum platelet counts, this does not reliably predict clinical manifestations or complications of the disorder. Furthermore, the clinical presentation may range from minor signs, such as petechiae, gingival bleeding, or traumatic hematomas, to more deleterious complications that can include occult bleeding or retinal hemorrhage. The incidence of hemorrhagic complication is reported to range from 3% to 53%, and hemorrhagic deaths range from 14% to 24%. In the cohort of MDS patients who progress to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), treatment with chemotherapy is further associated with an increased incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia. Consistent with the data from MDS, the incidence of bleeding disorders among patients with aplastic anemia is increased in those with platelet counts less than 20,000 cells/L.

Case report

A 65-year-old African American man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mechanical aortic valve replacement (on warfarin) presented to the emergency department with a pruritic and painful purpuric rash on his left arm, lower extremities, and abdomen. The patient first observed the rash on the morning of presentation when he noticed localized pruritus and redness of the upper portion of the left extremity. Over the course of the day, a pruritic and painful red rash developed in the lower portions of his bilateral extremities and abdomen, leading him to present to the emergency department that evening. On review of systems, he noted "pins and needles" in his feet but denied respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary symptoms. He denied the initiation of new medications; however, on further inquiry, he acknowledged receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for the first time 7 days prior to presentation. He denied any prior vaccine or medication-associated adverse events except for a minor rash to ibuprofen several decades ago.

Examination revealed exquisitely tender petechiae and purpura on the lower portions of bilateral extremities (Fig 1, A and B), scattered petechiae on the lower portion of the abdomen (Fig 1, C), and palpable purpura on the left arm (Fig 1, D). No mucosal or palmar/plantar involvement, livedo reticularis, skin ulcerations, skin nodules, or lymphadenopathy were apparent. All vital signs were within normal limits. Significant laboratory abnormalities included a C-reactive protein level of 86 mg/L and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 34 mm/hr. Complete blood cell counts were within the normal ranges. International normalized ratio was therapeutic. Urinalysis, chest x-ray, and venous Doppler of the lower portion of the extremity were unremarkable. He was admitted for further workup and management.

A 64-year-old man with a history of celiac disease (CD), congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus complicated by end-stage renal disease and peripheral neuropathy, was admitted to the hospital for non-healing ulcerations of his hands with osteomyelitis from his peripheral arterial vascular disease. He reported that his CD was under good control with a strict gluten-free diet prior to admission. Physical exam revealed prominent petechiae on his bilateral palms and fingers (Fig 1). A biopsy was performed and demonstrated collections of neutrophils in the papillary dermis (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Arterial vascular disease
B. Capillaritis
C. Dermatitis herpetiformis
D. Janeway lesions
E. Rheumatoid vasculitis

Answers:
A. Arterial vascular disease – Incorrect. Cutaneous findings of arterial vascular occlusive disease typically include erosions, ulcers, and ischemic changes.
B. Capillaritis – Incorrect. Capillaritis classically presents as copper-brown macules and petechiae on the lower extremities.
C. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) – Correct. Palmar petechiae are a rare presentation of DH in adults and can result in delayed diagnosis when being the initial or isolated manifestation of disease. Although papules and vesicles on extensor surfaces in DH are pruritic, palmar petechiae may be pruritic, painful, or asymptomatic.
D. Janeway lesions – Incorrect. Janeway lesions are seen in bacterial endocarditis and present as angular hemorrhage on the palms.
E. Rheumatoid vasculitis – Incorrect. Rheumatoid vasculitis develops during advanced rheumatoid arthritis and can manifest as purpura, ulcerations, digital ischemia, and nodules on the hands.

Nonhealing lower-extremity wounds with normal physiological testing — alternative diagnoses and distinguishing features: Alternative diagnoses include venous ulcer, distal small arterial occlusion (microangiopathy), local injury, medication related, neuropathic, autoimmune injury, infection, malignancy, and inflammatory. Venous ulcer typically occurs at the distal leg, especially above the medial malleolus and develops in regions of skin changes due to chronic venous disease and local venous hypertension and is typically wet (i.e., wound drainage) rather than dry lesion. Distal small arterial occlusion (microangiopathy) involves toes, foot, leg with causes including diabetic microangiopathy, end-stage renal disease, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's), sickle-cell anemia, vasculitides, scleroderma, cryoagglutination, embolic, and thrombotic etiologies. Neuropathic ulcers occur at pressure zones of foot and may show hyperkeratosis surrounds the ulcer with diabetes mellitus with peripheral neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy without diabetes mellitus, and leprosy.

Both inherited and acquired hypercoagulable states can present with nonspecific clinical manifestations, such as petechiae, purpura, livedo reticularis, and ulcerations. A good history and physical examination are crucial to diagnoses of these conditions. Inherited conditions tend to present either in neonatal period or later in life, while acquired conditions typically occur later in life. Diagnostic studies are performed to identify the coagulation cascade deficiency or defect. Treatment primarily hinges on anticoagulation and wound care. In this article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the clinical manifestations, diagnostic considerations, and management options of patients in hypercoagulable states.

### Clinical diagnosis and assessment of severity of confirmed dengue infections in Vietnamese children: is the World Health Organization classification system helpful? [^1141mo3L]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2004). Low credibility.

Classification of dengue using the current World Health Organization (WHO) system is not straightforward. In a large prospective study of pediatric dengue, no clinical or basic laboratory parameters clearly differentiated between children with and without dengue, although petechiae and hepatomegaly were independently associated with the diagnosis. Among the 712 dengue-infected children there was considerable overlap in the major clinical features. Mucosal bleeding was observed with equal frequency in those with dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and the tourniquet test differentiated poorly between the two diagnostic categories. Fifty-seven (18%) of 310 with shock did not fulfill all four criteria considered necessary for a diagnosis of DHF by the WHO, but use of the WHO provisional classification scheme resulted in considerable over-inflation of the DHF figures. If two separate entities truly exist rather than a continuous spectrum of disease, it is essential that some measure of capillary leak is included in any classification system, with less emphasis on bleeding and a specific platelet count.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^117SphFE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs) and exercise-induced vasculitis may also resemble SD due to their main clinical feature of punctate petechiae secondary to the extravasated erythrocytes. Like SD, PPDs are limited to the lower limbs bilaterally and are often chronic with recurrent exacerbations. Hemosiderin deposition is found in the superficial dermis in PPDs, with the deposition being deeper in SD. Other SD mimickers include atopic dermatitis (AD), diabetic dermopathy, and xerotic eczema. Being familiar with the appearance of such conditions, as well as pursuing the correct diagnostic workup that includes both the history and the clinical presentation, is important to correctly diagnose cutaneous disorders associated with the inflammation of lower extremities. Moreover, general physicians may not recognize venous disorders or appreciate their seriousness and, consequently, may not refer the patient to a specialist.

### Serpiginous purpuric eruption of the leg [^114b8bDh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 68-year-old male presented with a rash on his right lower leg. The lesions had spread along the leg since onset 9 days prior, and the patient reported localized soreness and pruritus. He denied systemic symptoms including fever, fatigue, myalgia, joint pain, and recent illness. Physical examination revealed a serpiginous, purpuric eruption on the anterior and posterior right thigh and lower leg. A 4mm punch biopsy from the right lower leg revealed a Th2 dominant process reflective of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Superficial and deep angiocentric and eccrinotropic lymphocytic infiltrate and tissue eosinophilia were noted. Degranulated eosinophils forming 'flame figures' were also identified with accompanying mural edema and red blood cell extravasation. Further evaluation revealed an elevated antistreptolysin O antibody, though the remainder of the work up was unremarkable. Clinicohistopathologic correlation supported the diagnosis of Blaschkolinear purpuric Wells' Syndrome. This case highlights a unique presentation of a rare inflammatory dermatosis, and serves as a reminder that given Wells' can be associated with underlying malignancy, an age appropriate work up, based on patient history and presentation, may be warranted. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(10):1036–1038. </em>.

A 16-year-old girl presented to clinic with a 2-month history of painful, waxing and waning unilateral erythematous ecchymotic patches on the right lower extremity (Fig 1). She was otherwise healthy and of normal affect, and she denied any history of trauma to the area. She also denied any psychiatric disturbance or history. Two punch biopsies were obtained that both showed a mild perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Topical corticosteroids were of limited help, and the lesions spontaneously resolved within 1 week (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Psychogenic purpura (PP)
B. Urticarial vasculitis
C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP)
D. Livedo reticularis
E. Livedo vasculopathy

Answers:
A. PP – Correct. PP, also known as Gardner-Diamond syndrome or autoerythrocyte sensitization, is a rare syndrome of recurrent painful spontaneous ecchymosis that can be associated with a prodromal phase of itch, pain, and warmth at the site of ecchymosis.
B. Urticarial vasculitis – Incorrect. Urticarial vasculitis is characterized by wheals lasting more than 24 hours accompanied with burning and pain. Wheals can resolve with hyperpigmentation or ecchymosis. However, lesions are typically bilateral and symmetrical.
C. TTP – Incorrect. TTP presents as a pentad of renal failure, fever, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic symptoms. Petechial and purpuric lesions are common cutaneous manifestations.
D. Livedo reticularis – Incorrect. Livedo reticularis classically presents on the lower extremities as a violaceous-erythematous and reticulated pattern caused by slow venous flow. It commonly presents as a physiologic response to cold temperatures but can be secondarily caused by a luminal obstruction or systemic disease.
E. Livedo vasculopathy – Incorrect. Livedo vasculopathy is associated with hypercoagulability and presents as tender, punched out ulcers on a background of livedo reticularis on the lower extremities. Involved areas heal with stellate white atrophic scarring, telangiectasias, and hemosiderin deposition known as atrophie blanche.

### Prevalence and location of petechial spots in well infants [^1116kp8n]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence and distribution of petechiae in well infants and to evaluate their relationship with age.

Design

500 afebrile and well-appearing infants aged 1–12 months were examined for petechiae. The sites of the petechiae were noted on a skin map and the parent's explanation recorded. Data collection included the number of petechiae, age and birth rank.

Results

10% of the infants had petechiae: 6.6% had one petechia and 3.4% more than one. Petechiae were on the trunk in 58% of infants, two of whom had them on more than one area. In 42% of the infants, the petechial spots were distributed on the head and neck as well as on the upper and lower extremities. Petechiae were significantly more common in infants over 6 months of age (68% vs 32%, p < 0.05). During a 3-week follow-up period, all study infants remained well.

Conclusion

10% of infants less than 1 year of age were found to have petechiae. These data suggest that no further evaluation is necessary in cases where up to four isolated petechiae are observed, even if not confined to one body area, and the infant is well and afebrile.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### Linear lichenoid pigmented purpura: an unusual histopathologic pattern [^1115whiq]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Linear pigmented purpura, also known as unilateral linear capillaritis, is a clinical subtype of pigmented purpuric dermatoses (PPDs). Although several variants exist, the PPDs are a benign group of skin eruptions that present with petechiae and hyperpigmented macules, papules, and/or patches. Morphology, clinical examination findings, and histopathology differ across PPD subtypes. Thus far, the exact etiology of PPD is unknown.

First described by Riordan et al, linear PPD presents in a strikingly linear distribution, often unilaterally on an upper or lower extremity. Linear PPD is more commonly seen in men, with occurrences in young adults and children. Although around 15 cases of linear PPD have been reported in the literature, here we present a rare case of linear pigmented purpura with a concurrent lichenoid inflammatory pattern on histology.

### A sharply marginated erythematous dermatitis in a toddler [^116xpP9N]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis of the eruption includes atopic dermatitis, vasculitis, infections, and other nutritional disorders. The generalized distribution of the eczematous lesions in atopic dermatitis may resemble kwashiorkor, which could be unrecognized in overlapping cases. Vasculitis can result in a wide range of multi‐organ and skin manifestation, including petechiae, purpura, nodules, livedo, urticaria, ulcers, and alopecia. Henoch‐Schonlein purpura (HSP), the most common vasculitis in children, may display a painful edema in both feet mimicking kwashiorkor. However, HSP is characterized by a palpable purpuric rash predominantly on lower limbs and buttocks, and by other systemic symptoms, including gastrointestinal, joint, and kidney involvement. Among nutritional disorders, dermatitis resembling that of kwashiorkor has been described in patients with inherited or acquired zinc and biotin deficiencies. Moreover, biotin and other B vitamins deficiencies usually display neurological signs. As children with kwashiorkor may have a concomitant multivitamin deficiency, the presence of edema is helpful in distinguishing kwashiorkor from other nutritional disorders. Whereas in kwashiorkor the caloric intake is adequate, in marasmus there is deficiency of both protein and calories, resulting in emaciation with dry and scaling skin in the absence of edema. Complications of protein‐energy malnutrition include hypothermia, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy, heart failure, and infections.

Alopecia, as might be expected, may occur in all nutritional disorders, but dyspigmentation typically appears in kwashiorkor, marasmus, and essential fatty acid deficiency.

Management of kwashiorkor starts with correction of metabolic abnormalities. A nutrition consult is recommended to set up dietary therapy and prevent refeeding syndrome. Milk‐based formulas are the treatment of choice along with a multivitamin supplement. Recovery of brain function is plausible if the nutritional status is re‐established while the affected growing process is still occurring.

This case highlights the importance of a detailed dietary history and careful examination of skin and appendages in evaluating patients with dermatoses suspicious for nutritional deficiency.

### Tender violaceous nodules and petechia on the legs [^114c1da6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case

A 46-year-old female with hypogammaglobinemia, iron-deficiency anemia, and multiple food allergies presented with tender, indurated, violaceous nodules and petechiae predominantly on the lower extremities for 6 weeks (Fig 1). She endorsed fatigue, gingival bleeding, joint hemarthrosis, and shortness of breath. A 4-mm punch biopsy demonstrated prominent fat necrosis with hemorrhage and foamy histiocytes with focal granulomas (Fig 2). No infections were identified, and acid-fast bacilli staining was negative. Labs revealed elevated c-reactive protein, anemia, and hematuria. Platelet count, International normalized ratio, amylase, lipase, liver function tests, antineutrophil antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Her medications included oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and monthly intravenous immunoglobulin and iron infusions.

### Chikungunya infection in travelers [^116K57C9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Fever and joint pain were noted in all patients. The median duration of fever was 4 days (range 2–7 days), and joint pain was mainly distal and symmetric, involving wrist (18 patients, 81%), ankles (17 cases, 77%), phalanx (16 patients, 73%), knees (14 patients, 64%), and elbows and shoulders (4 patients each, 18%). The other extradermatologic signs were asthenia in 17 patients (77%), headache in 13 (59%), muscle pain in 12 (55%), swelling in 10 (45%), peripheral lymphadenopathy in 9 (41%), bleeding from the nose or gums in 4 (18%), nausea or vomiting in 3 (14%), and eyesight trouble in 1 (4%). In the 6 patients seen during the first week of symptoms (acutely ill patients), lymphopenia was present in 67%, thrombocytopenia in 50%, and increase of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase in 67%.

Skin manifestations occurred in 17 patients (77%). Because skin eruption occurs during the first week of the disease, however, only 6 (27%) patients with these signs were seen at the time of consultation. All 6 had a generalized exanthema consisting of noncoalescent macular or papular lesions (Figure). The elementary cutaneous element was an erythematous macule in 5 patients and maculopapules in 1. The number of macules was > 50, and the anatomic location of the rash was abdomen, thorax, back, and limbs. No lesions were seen on the face; palms and soles were involved in 3 patients. Islands of normal skin were seen in 5 patients. An aphthoid lesion was seen in 1 patient. Pruritus of the skin or a burning sensation was reported in 3 patients. Bleeding from the nose or gum, purpura, petechiae, ecchymosis, and bullous lesions were not observed. Erythema followed the onset of fever by 1 to 2 days, lasted 3–7 days, and disappeared without scaling in all cases, regardless of the patient's skin color.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113eJD3b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis — cryoglobulinemia is often found in many conditions that result in vasculitis; it arises from immunoglobulins that precipitate when body temperature decreases and is associated with cold-induced urticaria, urticarial vasculitis, pernio (chilblains), Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Schamberg vasculitis (pigmented purpura), and hepatitis B and C infection. Presentations can include livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and purpura in cold-exposed areas with occasional necrosis, and in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia there is palpable purpura with petechiae of the lower extremities producing a "cayenne pepper" appearance with brawny edema of the lower legs. Classification is by immunoglobulin type; type I is usually associated with a monoclonal gammopathy (IgM > IgG > IgA or light chain).

### Edematous lower extremities with overlying verrucous plaques [^115qYa7T]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa – Incorrect. While this patient's clinical presentation closely resembles elephantiasis nostras verrucosa with enlarged, disfigured extremities with a fibrotic, cobblestone-like appearance, the presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos hints toward a different diagnosis.
B. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema – Correct. Elephantiasic pretibial myxedema presents with verrucous papules and plaques, most commonly on the anterior aspects of the lower legs, on a background of non-pitting edema. The presence of digital clubbing and exophthalmos further supports a diagnosis of underlying GD. Histological examination demonstrates abundant mucin accumulation in the dermis, collagen attenuation, and stellate fibroblasts.
C. Lymphatic filariasis – Incorrect. Filariasis is a parasitic infection, common in tropical countries, and caused by the filarial parasites Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi/timori, presenting as elephantiasis. While clinically, the condition may be similar to the one presented here, the patient's history does not support a diagnosis of filariasis.
D. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides – Incorrect. Papillomatosis cutis carcinoides describes a form of verrucous carcinoma, secondary to the human papilloma virus, which presents as verrucous papules and plaques involving the lower extremities. While the clinical appearance may be similar to the condition presented here, the disease is often unilateral and asymmetric, and the histologic findings in this case do not support the diagnosis of papillomatosis cutis carcinoides.
E. Lymphedema not otherwise specified – Incorrect. Lymphedema not otherwise specified can present with unilateral and bilateral lower extremity swelling. Without proper treatment, it may take on a similar presentation. However, the histopathologic findings do not support this diagnosis.

### Segmental pigmented purpura [^115RgTCh]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A segmental distribution of pigmented purpura (PP) is rare. Our patient presented at 5 years of age with red-brown petechial macules and telangiectases on her chest, the inner and dorsal aspects of the right upper extremity, and the dorsal aspect of the hand, which had developed slowly over the previous 7 months. The lesions were intermittently pruritic. A biopsy from the right arm revealed discrete hydropic degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, dilation of the blood vessels, numerous extravasated erythrocytes and lymphocytes, and lymphocytes in the lower part of the epidermis. The skin disease resolved almost completely within 18 months. The general physical examination revealed an open foramen ovale, slight hypogammaglobulinemia (G and A), and enhanced fragility of the blood vessels.

### Acral petechial eruptions without gastrointestinal symptoms: three cases of dermatitis herpetiformis [^115xZsEW]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Petechiae and purpura as primary acral lesions are a recognized cutaneous manifestation in dermatitis herpetiformis and celiac disease, but may be overlooked in the absence of classic pruritic, vesiculopapular lesions on extensor surfaces and in individuals without overt gastrointestinal symptoms. Acral petechiae in dermatitis herpetiformis have been reported several times but are likely underreported; the differential diagnosis for acral purpura is broad (Table I). Petechiae may be the sole presenting sign or may be present in conjunction with classic dermatitis herpetiformis skin findings. Because acral stratum corneum is thick, edema and hemorrhage become trapped in the papillary dermis, forming "dots" instead of the more common, excoriated erosions on nonacral skin. Petechiae may appear linear or curvilinear as they follow dermatoglyphics on acral skin. Linear petechiae may be referred to as vibices.

### Painful ulcerations: the sole clinical sign of mixed cryoglobulinaemia secondary to marginal zone lymphoma [^113g48au]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A man in his 70s with background vascular disease presented with 7months of painful non-resolving lower leg ulcers with eschar and petechiae, left lower ear lobe ulceration and dusky inflammation of the right ear. He demonstrated good bilateral pedal pulses and no peripheral oedema. No lymphadenopathy was palpated. Biopsy suggested leucocytoclastic vasculitis on chronic stasis changes. Blood investigations showed elevated rheumatoid factor and mixed polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM cryoglobulins. He was diagnosed with mixed cryoglobulinaemia, and consequent conducted flow cytometry revealed CD5 +marginal zone lymphoma with elevated serum free light chains and kappa/lambda ratio. One-month following rituximab and chlorambucil therapy, the patient's pain had much improved, ear ulcers had healed and several leg ulcers had reduced in width and depth. The petechial eruption had also resolved.

### Italian consensus conference on guidelines for conservative treatment on lower limb muscle injuries in athlete [^114ddTvB]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

On examination of US and MRI, the dirMI does not differ significantly from the indMI, showing a more or less circumscribed oedema or haematoma, with a possible discontinuity of the secondary fascicles. In the US examination, the appearance of a haematoma is quite variable and depends on the trauma dating. A recent and high-pressure haematoma is sometimes more echogenic because of its high cellular content and can, therefore, remain difficult to differentiate from muscle tissue. In any case, it important to note that a haematoma in the first 24 hours post-trauma may have a very variable appearance, from not echogenic at all or hypoechogenic to a frankly hyperechogenic appearance. Finally, in the following 2–3 days the haematoma moves to hypoechogenicity or not echogenicity appearance.

It should be noted that in dirMI the extent of haematoma is not necessarily correlated, as opposed to indMI, with the severity of the lesion and consequently with the severity of the prognosis. In fact, a direct trauma causes vascular damage and internal bleeding. Structural fibre lesion is rare since the contusing force tends to crush them. In other words, a diffused haematoma can only be caused by a rupture of the vessels and not necessarily by the loss of continuity of muscle fibres, as it is the case with indMI. For this reason, in dirMI the prognosis is usually better than the indMI of equal size.

### Tender violaceous nodules and petechia on the legs [^115Gy8VT]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What are the most common cutaneous manifestations of this condition?
A. Cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis
B. Follicular hyperkeratosis, petechiae, and ecchymoses
C. Generalized xerosis, follicular hyperkeratosis, and bitot spots
D. Photosensitive dermatitis and hyperpigmentation
E. Alopecia and periorificial dermatitis

Answers:
A. Cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis – Incorrect. Cheilitis, glossitis, and seborrheic dermatitis are common cutaneous manifestations seen in vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency.
B. Follicular hyperkeratosis, petechiae, and ecchymoses – Correct. The most common and early cutaneous manifestations of vitamin C deficiency include follicular hyperkeratosis, scattered petechiae, and ecchymoses. Vitamin C is crucial for collagen synthesis, and deficiency can lead to blood vessel fragility and poor wound healing, thereby contributing to these skin findings.
C. Generalized xerosis, follicular hyperkeratosis, and bitot spots – Incorrect. Although follicular hyperkeratosis may also be seen with vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), generalized xerosis and bitot spots are cutaneous manifestations mostly associated with vitamin A deficiency or phrynoderma.
D. Photosensitive dermatitis and hyperpigmentation – Incorrect. While hyperpigmentation can occur in various vitamin deficiencies, dermatitis in sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and hands is more specific to vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency. In particular, the Casal necklace is characterized by a circular, broad collar rash around the neck that affects dermatomes C3 and C4. If the deficiency is severe, it can manifest as Pellagra, which is characterized by the "3 D's" – dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia.
E. Alopecia and periorificial dermatitis – Incorrect. Alopecia and periorificial dermatitis are cutaneous manifestations often seen in vitamin B7 (biotin) deficiency.

### It's not what it looks like: atypical rash in cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis [^116px51F]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use and chronic, untreated hepatitis C presented to the emergency room with acute bilateral lower extremity swelling, erythema and maculopapular rash. Serum C4 levels were low, but dermatology felt the rash was due to venous stasis dermatitis. The patient was discharged with compression stockings, but returned to the hospital 5days later with no improvement in his symptoms. A more extensive laboratory workup revealed hepatitis C viral load of 4million, elevated serum cryoglobulins, and skin biopsy showing leucocytoclastic vasculitis. He was treated with oral prednisone, with complete resolution of his symptoms after 2weeks. He was scheduled for follow-up in gastroenterology clinic for treatment of his hepatitis C for definitive cure of his mixed cryoglobulinaemia, but failed to get insurance authorisation to begin treatment with Harvoni. He presented to the hospital 4months later with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

### The clot thickens with COVID-19 and cryofibrinogenemia: a thought-provoking association [^112Uexpb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 65-year-old woman with a history of trochanteric osteoarthritis and COVID-19 presented to a tertiary care facility with painful purpura. She had been diagnosed with COVID-19 7 months prior to presentation using nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Within 3 days of testing positive, she had manifested myalgias and purpuric macules on the nose, fingers, and legs, which resolved after steroid taper (Fig 1).

Fig 1

Erythematous and purpuric patches with overlying petechiae of the dorsal aspect of the hand, fingers (A), and upper parts of the lower extremities (B) with areas of confluence. Purpuric patch along the nasal dorsum with incidental background erythemato-telangiectatic rosacea (C). Source: Anonymous. 2020. Patient documented livedoid vasculopathy and nasal purpura associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Georgia, USA.

Seven months after the COVID-19 diagnosis, she was admitted to an outside hospital with 4 days of burning, pruritic purpura, and edema of her fingers, arms, and legs associated with chills, myalgias, and fever (up to 38.7 °C). She was given intravenous glucocorticoids because of the concern for IgA vasculitis and discharged the next day on a corticosteroid taper. Despite the administration of glucocorticoids, the pruritus and pain worsened, prompting her current presentation to a tertiary care hospital.

Examination revealed symmetric hemorrhagic bullae of both distal fingers, racemose purpura of both forearms, and dusky purpuric patches involving the nasal tip and both helices (Fig 2). Confluent erythemato-violaceous petechiae and livedoid purpura were present on the abdomen, chest, and extremities (Fig 2), notably sparing the intertriginous areas. Sublingual violaceous macules were evident.

### Platelet disorders [^112xsRTV]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

After vascular injury and exposure of subendothelial matrix proteins to the intravascular space, mediators of hemostasis are triggered and allow for clot formation and restoration of vascular integrity. Platelets are the mediators of primary hemostasis, creating a platelet plug and allowing for initial cessation of bleeding. Platelet disorders, qualitative and quantitative, may result in bleeding signs and symptoms, particularly mucocutaneous bleeding such as epistaxis, bruising, petechiae, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Increasing evidence suggests that platelets have functional capabilities beyond hemostasis, but this review focuses solely on platelet hemostatic properties. Herein, normal platelet function as well as the effects of abnormal function and thrombocytopenia are reviewed.

### Generalized petechial rashes in children during a parvovirus B19 outbreak [^115cSN5N]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Human parvovirus B19 infection is associated not only with erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) but also, rarely, with purpuric or petechial rashes. Most reports of these atypical rashes describe sporadic cases with skin lesions that have distinctively focal distributions. During a community outbreak of fifth disease, we investigated a cluster of illnesses in children with generalized petechial rashes to determine whether parvovirus was the causative agent and, if so, to describe more fully the clinical spectrum of petechial rashes that are associated with this virus.

Methods

Systematic evaluation was conducted by general pediatricians of children with petechial rashes for evidence of acute parvovirus infection.

Results

During the outbreak, acute parvovirus infection was confirmed in 13 (76%) of 17 children who were evaluated for petechial rash. Confirmed case patients typically had mild constitutional symptoms, and most (11 [85%] of 13) had fever. Petechiae were typically dense and widely distributed; sometimes accentuated in the distal extremities, axillae, or groin; and usually absent from the head/neck. Most case patients had leukopenia, and several had thrombocytopenia. Parvovirus immunoglobulin M was detected in 8 (73%) of 11 acute-phase serum specimens, and immunoglobulin G was detectable only in convalescent specimens. Parvovirus DNA was detected in all 7 tested serum specimens, including 2 acute-phase specimens that were immunoglobulin M-negative. All case patients had brief, uncomplicated illnesses, but 6 were briefly hospitalized and 1 underwent a bone marrow examination. Two case patients developed erythema infectiosum during convalescence.

Conclusions

During an outbreak of fifth disease, parvovirus proved to be a common cause of petechial rash in children, and this rash was typically more generalized than described in case reports. Associated clinical features, hematologic abnormalities, and serologic test results are consistent with a viremia-associated illness that is distinct from and occasionally followed by erythema infectiosum.

B, Close-up view of left arm demonstrating superficial vesiculation and perilesional pallor. C, Pinpoint petechiae without erosions on the palate. D, Punch biopsy revealing perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis with eosinophils and papillary dermal edema without evidence of vasculitis (A and B, Hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnifications: A, 40×; B, 100×).

At 1-week follow-up, the patient's rash had markedly improved with resolution of pruritus and flattening and fading of existing lesions. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy was negative for immune deposits, and hematoxylin-eosin staining revealed a perivascular lymphocytic dermatitis with eosinophils and papillary dermal edema without evidence of vasculitis (Fig 1, D) most suggestive of an urticarial hypersensitivity reaction. The prednisone taper was continued, and the patient restarted avapritinib at a reduced dose of 100 mg every other day. At the 2-week follow-up, his rash had completely resolved, and he continues to tolerate his reduced dose.

### Coagulation abnormalities following Brown recluse spider (loxosceles reclusa) envenomation: a description of 2 cases and review of the literature [^117TDyiX]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature review

Following removal of duplicate reports, a total of 977 studies were screened, 793 of which were deemed irrelevant based on their title and abstract (Figure 5). The 184 remaining full-text studies were assessed for eligibility. Eighty were excluded, primarily because reported cases of L reclusa envenomation occurred outside the accepted endemic region for L reclusa (n = 28) or because the study did not include individual patient details (n = 25). Other reasons for exclusion were that the patient was described in a separate publication that was already included in the review (n = 13) or the article did not report a patient (n = 9) or specifically stated that a patient did not or was unlikely to have a brown recluse bite (n = 2). Finally, 3 articles could not be located online or with the assistance of a biomedical librarian. Nine additional studies were included following manual search of the reference lists of the included articles.

Figure 5
Flow Diagram of Literature Search Results.

The 113 articles included in this study described 263 individuals with reported L reclusa envenomation (Supplementary Table S1). Age was reported for 245 individuals, with a median age of 23 years (IQR, 12–40 years) (Table 6). Sex was reported for 249 individuals (125 female and 124 male). There was no difference in the median age of female and male individuals (23.5 years [IQR, 14–36 years] vs 23 years [IQR, 11–42.5 years]; p = 0.77). Forty-six patients had observed a spider at the time or immediately following envenomation. Of these, 17 patients reported that the spider was identified as L reclusa by a physician. Only 4 patients reported that an expert (toxicologist, arachnologist, or entomologist) confirmed the spider as L reclusa. The most common anatomic location of the bite was the lower extremity (97/263 [36.9%] — ankle, foot, leg, thigh). Cutaneous necrosis or eschar formation at the bite was reported in 51.7% (136/263) of cases. Subjective or objective findings of systemic loxoscelism occurred in 57.0% (150/263) of cases, and hemolysis occurred in 41.8% (110/263) of cases.

### The histological assessment of cutaneous vasculitis [^115eqzAo]. Histopathology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined as inflammation directed at vessels, which compromises or destroys the vessel wall leading to haemorrhagic and/or ischaemic events. Skin biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis, whose manifestations include urticaria, infiltrative erythema, petechiae, purpura, purpuric papules, haemorrhagic vesicles and bullae, nodules, livedo racemosa, deep (punched out) ulcers and digital gangrene. These varied morphologies are a direct reflection of size of the vessels and extent of the vascular bed affected, ranging from a vasculitis affecting few superficial, small vessels in petechial eruptions to extensive pan-dermal small vessel vasculitis in haemorrhagic bullae to muscular vessel vasculitis in lower extremity nodules with livedo racemosa. Skin biopsy, extending to subcutis and taken from the earliest, most symptomatic, reddish or purpuric lesion is crucial for obtaining a high-yielding diagnostic sample. Based on histology, vasculitis can be classified on the size of vessels affected and the dominant immune cell mediating the inflammation (e.g. neutrophilic, granulomatous, lymphocytic, or eosinophilic). Disruption of small vessels by inflammatory cells, deposition of fibrin within the lumen and/or vessel wall coupled with nuclear debris allows for the confident recognition of small vessel, mostly neutrophilic vasculitis (also known as leukocytoclastic vasculitis). In contrast, muscular vessel vasculitis can be identified solely by infiltration of its wall by inflammatory cells. Extravasation of red blood cells (purpura) and necrosis are supportive, but not diagnostic of vasculitis as they are also seen in haemorrhagic and/or vaso-occlusive disorders (pseudovasculitis). Vasculitic foci associated with extravascular granulomas (palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis), tissue eosinophilia, or tissue neutrophilia signal the risk for, or co-existence of systemic disease. This essential histological information coupled with direct immunofluorescence and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic data and clinical findings enables more precise and accurate diagnosis of localized and systemic vasculitis syndromes.

### Prevalence and distribution of petechiae in well babies [^1158TAkC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the prevalence of petechial spots in well babies.

Methods

A total of 116 babies under the age of 12 months were fully examined at child health surveillance clinics. The number and site of petechiae were recorded together with details of possible causes.

Results

A total of 27.6% of babies had one or more petechiae, 8.6% had two or more petechiae, and 2.6% had more than two. None of these babies subsequently developed sepsis.

Conclusions

Many well infants examined in the community are likely to have petechial spots. In this setting one or two petechiae are common and their presence should not be taken as pathological without other clinical signs. Recognition of this fact may also be helpful when examining otherwise well infants with petechiae in a secondary care setting.

### Case of localized bullous pemphigoid with unique clinical manifestations in the lower legs [^117Broak]. The Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 71-year-old Japanese woman who presented with persistent band-like erosions in the lower legs. Histological examination suggested subepidermal blister formation. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed tissue-deposited and circulating immunoglobulin G autoantibodies against the basement membrane. Western blotting revealed autoantibodies to BP230, but not to BP180. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having a localized type of bullous pemphigoid. We suggest that the unique clinical manifestations in this patient could be attributable to bacterial or fungal infection, and/or mechanical trauma, such as the pressure of her socks.

### The troubling rise of scurvy: a review and national analysis of incidence, associated risk factors, and clinical manifestations [^111bgen5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Often thought of as an outdated diagnosis, scurvy is frequently not included on the list of differential diagnoses for pediatric musculoskeletal reports, which results in delayed diagnosis, increased morbidity, and unnecessarily invasive, costly testing. The most common musculoskeletal presenting report of patients with scurvy is generalized lower extremity pain. Upper extremity symptoms have been reported but are less common. These musculoskeletal symptoms have been theorized as sequelae of subperiosteal or soft-tissue hemorrhage and/or hemarthrosis, commonly presenting in the pediatric patient as refusal to walk, inability to bear weight, or an antalgic gait. In infants and young children, lower extremity pain may manifest as a pseudoparalysis. Infants may display the characteristic 'frog leg' position, with externally rotated and flexed hips and knees, while older children may present with flexion contractures at the knee.

Additional musculoskeletal manifestations may include swelling of the knee or ankle joints, which may initially be misdiagnosed as septic arthritis or other joint pathologies. In addition, in advanced disease, skeletal growth abnormalities, delayed bone age, or beading at the costochondral joints, known as the 'scorbutic rosary', may be observed. Spontaneous fracture may occur, and this should raise suspicion for scurvy, particularly when these fractures show inadequate or delayed healing.

Mucocutaneous symptoms, such as gingival bleeding, corkscrew hairs, and petechiae, are commonly associated with scurvy (Figure 1). Perifollicular hemorrhage and follicular hyperkeratosis, particularly of the lower extremity, may occur and are considered pathognomonic. Other potential signs and symptoms include psychomotor restlessness, muscular weakness, irritability, excessive fatigue, and failure to thrive. Thus, a young patient with scurvy may present with chief reports including rash, easy bruising, easy bleeding, fussiness in infant/toddler, generalized weakness/fatigue, or appetite/gastrointestinal disturbances. In addition, physicians should be aware that up to 80% of patients with scurvy may have concomitant iron-deficiency anemia, likely due to associated bleeding and potentially decreased iron absorption. Iron-deficiency anemia may also be a manifestation of a poor diet and other co-occurring nutritional deficiencies.

### Melanin-associated pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa: presentation, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^11423KHt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Intraoral pigmentation is quite common and has numerous etiologies, ranging from exogenous to physiological to neoplastic. Many pigmented lesions of the oral cavity are associated with melanin pigment. The differential diagnosis of mucosal pigmented lesions includes hematomas, varices, and petechiae which may appear to be pigmented. Unlike cutaneous melanomas, oral melanomas are diagnosed late and have a poor prognosis regardless of depth of invasion. As such, the clinical presentation and treatment of intraoral melanoma will be discussed. Developing a differential diagnosis is imperative for a clinician faced with these lesions in order to appropriately treat the patient. This article will focus on the most common oral melanocytic lesions, along with mimics.

### Localized aseptic neutrophilic dermatoses of the extremities triggered by stasis and tissue damage: two case reports of an unrecognized condition misdiagnosed as bacterial cellulitis [^111RB8u5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our 2 observations represent striking inflammatory dermatosis associated with an inflammatory systemic response that closely mimicked acute bacterial infections. Although in 1 case, the acute eruption affected acral edematous areas, the second case was characterized by acute relapsing episodes involving an edematous leg related to chronic venous insufficiency. Although a search for underlying infectious pathogens remained negative in both cases and antibiotics showed little effect on the clinical course, both patients had an inflammatory dermatosis with histologically dermal edema with a neutrophil-rich infiltrate, which promptly responded to topical/systemic corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, such as colchicine.

Hence, these 2 cases should best be considered as autoinflammatory reactions triggered by a disturbance of the local homeostasis. We have recently described a series of patients with erythematous, inflammatory papules, plaques, and extensive infiltrated lesions, histologically characterized by a dermal neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate that affected sites of surgery, chronic venous insufficiency, or lymphedema. Identical clinical phenotypes have previously been reported under a variety of confusing names.,

Therefore, we have proposed the unifying term of "localized NDs triggered by tissue injury" to better describe similar conditions that pose diagnostic and classification challenges. In our second case, the development of cutaneous lesions at distance from the primarily affected site suggests, that these localized NDs potentially spread under certain circumstances.

This question is clinically and economically relevant because of the significant incidence of erysipelas and bacterial cellulitis in the Western countries. The idea that some of these cases are incorrectly diagnosed as bacterial cellulitis and rather represent a localized ND is supported by 3 observations. First, some cases of these "infectious" dermatoses respond to simple anti-inflammatory regimens alone. Second, despite antibiotic prophylactic treatment, relapses surprisingly occur in more than 40% of patients. Finally, acute pseudocellulitis is a well-recognized condition that is frequently misdiagnosed and unnecessarily treated with antibiotics in the inpatient setting. Pseudocellulitis has been related in up to 30% of cases to venous stasis and is almost invariably mechanically explained by venous hypertension. Therefore, it is conceivable that both, rapid and chronic abnormal interstitial fluid and transcapillary fluid imbalance, result in tissue damage and local ischemia, leading to activation of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules with an inflammatory reaction, with cytokines activating neutrophilic leukocytes. In this setting, the presence of bacterial antigens, such as lipopolysaccharides, might also contribute to the inflammation.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115HRcaT]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Section I. A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: second-line treatment options

The patient's history

A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist sees that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5×10⁹/L The internist sends her urgently to the emergency room concerned that she might possibly have leukemia. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

Review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL) and several of her very few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she has typical steroid-related side effects: feeling "a little crazy", insomnia and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147×10⁹/L and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure, and also thalassemia trait or microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Similarly, the normal hemoglobin and neutrophil count do not suggest Evans syndrome. Her platelet counts remain in the normal range and her hemoglobin improves to the normal range. At her next visit, her platelet count has decreased to 80x10 9 /L. One month later, her platelet count is 28x10 9 /L with continued normal hemoglobin and infrequent small bruises. With her platelets trending downward, second-line treatment for her ITP is considered.

There is less urgency to consider secondary ITP or a missed diagnosis since she is doing well but at any change of management, it is good practice to re-evaluate. Below we consider some of the " what if " clinical scenarios for this young female.

### Cutaneous pseudovasculitis [^115Nrb8y]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Cutaneous pseudovasculitis represents a heterogeneous collection of disorders that are capable of simulating cutaneous vasculitis and can be broadly classified into diseases that produce hemorrhage (petechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses) or vessel occlusion with resultant livedo, cyanosis, ulcers, digital necrosis, and/or gangrene. Overlap is not uncommon, but if present, one mechanism dominates. Hemorrhagic pseudovasculitis is due to vessel wall dysfunction (incompetence), which can be related to diverse factors that include vessel wall deposition of metabolic substances (amyloid, calcium), nutritional deficiencies (scurvy), nonvasculitic inflammatory purpura (pigmented purpuric dermatitis, arthropod, viral and drug reactions), degeneration of the vessel wall and supporting stroma (senile/solar purpura), direct vessel wall invasion of infective organisms, coagulation-fibrinolytic disorders (eg, thrombocytopenia), and vessel wall trauma. Cyanotic-infarctive pseudovasculitis is due vaso-occlusion by emboli, thrombi, or fibrointimal hyperplasia (endarteritis obliterans) and includes varied conditions such as purpura fulminans, Coumadin necrosis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, cardiac myxoma, cholesterol embolization, calciphylaxis, and radiation arteritis. Delayed and inappropriate diagnosis of pseudovasculitis leads to incorrect management and exposure to potentially deleterious treatment modalities such as corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents. The diagnosis of a pseudovasculitic disorder requires a high index of suspicion and should always be part of the differential diagnosis of vasculitis. Skin biopsy is a crucial step in differentiating pseudovasculitis from authentic vasculitis; absence of histologic evidence of vasculitis, particularly after multiple biopsies, should direct evaluation and diagnosis towards pseudovasculitis.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^112piSZM]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment

As with all inherited platelet disorders, spontaneous bleeding includes epistaxis, gum bleeding, easy bruising and petechiae while gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurs in some severe cases; bleeding may be prolonged after cuts, trauma, or surgery, while for women, menorrhagia and childbirth are added risks. For example, in a European study of pregnancy, the risk of bleeding was greater when mothers had a severe bleeding history and a platelet count below 50×10⁹/L. Platelet count appeared more important as a parameter than the genetic cause of the inherited thrombocytopenia. Clearly, studies support the classic theory that a primary role of platelets is to maintain vascular integrity. Nevertheless, many subjects with new forms of inherited thrombocytopenias have modest reductions in platelet count and will bleed rarely or not at all in normal life. Bleeding in such patients depends not only on the extent of the fall in platelet count but also on the nature of accompanying functional defects. Furthermore, much evidence has accumulated on the non-hemostatic roles of platelets. Using mouse models, Goerge et al. observed that thrombocytopenia rapidly leads to bleeding in inflamed skin and brain due to the loss of vascular integrity. Much needs to be learned on how the genetic defects described in our review influence the non-hemostatic roles of platelets.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^113D181r]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^114xiUbZ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians. The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis.

### Long-standing purpuric exanthema [^116yjH3R]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Schamberg disease–Incorrect. Schamberg disease is the most common condition among the pigmented purpuric dermatoses. The clinical presentation ranges from petechiae to brown-orange macules, favoring the lower extremities and sometimes involving also the trunk, buttocks, and arms.
B. Occlusive vasculopathy secondary to essential thrombocythemia–Correct. Essential thrombocythemia is a chronic myeloproliferative condition characterized by an increase in the number of circulating platelets caused by the proliferation of megakaryocytes, resulting in recurrent thromboses of small and medium or large vessels. Cutaneous manifestations occur in almost one fourth of the patients. Essential thrombocythemia can cause a wide range of dermatological manifestations including pruritus, hematomas, ecchymoses, petechiae or purpura, as well as other symptoms related to the occlusive vasculopathy (erythromelalgia, livedo reticularis, livedo racemosa, Raynaud phenomenon, and acrocyanosis).
C. Drug eruption–Incorrect. Drug eruptions represent a broad spectrum of cutaneous adverse reactions to several drugs. The clinical presentation is protean, depending on the involved drug and type of cutaneous reaction. Our patient did not receive any new medication in the past several months, and the purpuric exanthema was present for 3 years, and therefore, a diagnosis of drug eruption could be ruled out.
D. Immune complex vasculitis–Incorrect. Immune complex vasculitis is a type of small-vessel vasculitis often presenting with palpable purpura, sometimes with necrosis and ulceration.
E. Teleangiectasia eruptiva macularis perstans–Incorrect. Teleangiectasia eruptiva macularis perstans is an uncommon form of cutaneous mastocytosis. It is characterized by telangiectatic macules and brown background color.

### Childhood bruising distribution observed from eight mechanisms of unintentional injury [^112hUC5Z]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To inform the assessment of described mechanisms of bruising in children.

Design

Prospective cross-sectional study.

Setting

The emergency department, and children in the local community.

Patients

Children aged 0–13 years with bruises from unintentional injuries.

Exclusions

bleeding disorder, medication affecting coagulation or child protection concerns.

Interventions

Injury incidents were categorised into one of eight causal mechanisms (fall from < 1m, 1–2 m, fall from standing height or less and hitting an object during fall, stairs or impact, crush, sports or motor vehicle collision).

Main Outcome Measures

Location, number and mechanism of bruising for each injury mechanism.

Results

372 children had 559 injury incidents, resulting in 693 bruises; 85.2% of children were walking independently, with impact injuries and fall from standing height (including hitting an object) being the predominant mechanisms. A single bruise was observed in 81.7% of all incidents. Stair falls resulted in ≥ 3 bruises only with falls involving ≥ 10 steps (6/16). Bruising was rarely observed on the buttocks, upper arm, back of legs or feet. No bruises were seen in this dataset on ears, neck or genitalia. Petechial bruising was only noted in 1/293 unintentional incidents, involving a high-impact injury in a school-aged child.

Conclusion

These findings have the potential to aid an assessment of the plausibility of the explanation given for a child with bruising. Certain bruise distributions were rarely observed, namely multiple bruises from a single mechanism, petechiae and bruising to the ears, neck or genitalia.

### A randomized controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of betamethasone valerate 0.12% foam on the short-term treatment of stasis dermatitis [^1177Uxaf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There are no published studies examining either the effectiveness of topical steroids in the treatment of stasis dermatitis or indicating what steroid strength or duration of treatment is optimal to treat this common condition.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of twice-daily application of the topical steroid betamethasone valerate 0.12% foam for the treatment of stasis dermatitis.

Design

42-day randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled, pilot study.

Settings

Outpatient dermatology clinic at a university-affiliated clinic.

Subjects

19 subjects, mean age of 73, with mild to moderate bilateral stasis dermatitis.

Intervention

Twice-daily application of betamethasone valerate 0.12% foam versus vehicle foam to bilateral randomly assigned lower legs for 28 days with follow-up to day 42.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary clinical endpoints were the mean change in erythema, scale, swelling, petechiae, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and self-reported pruritus, assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe). Secondary endpoints were changes in health related quality of life (HRQL) using the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) utility score and visual analog scale (VAS) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

Results

Although there was no overall difference between the foam and vehicle-treated leg at days 14 and 28, the steroid-treated leg, but not the vehicle-treated leg, showed statistical improvement over baseline. Improvement in the steroid-treated leg was statistically better than vehicle at days 14 and 28 in terms of erythema (P < .05) and petechiae (P < .05). Improvement in VAS was notable at days 14 (7.1%), 28 (9.7%), and 42 (9.6%) (P < .001). Similarly, there was a statistically significant improvement in the DLQI compared to baseline on visit days 14 (188.9%) and 28 (126.1%) (P < .001).

Conclusions

This study suggests that betamethasone valerate 0.12% foam is an effective and well-tolerated short-term treatment of stasis dermatitis, but that higher potency steroids may be needed to achieve better efficacy. Furthermore, these results are the first to suggest that the application of effective topical anti-inflammatory therapy can lead to improvement in HRQL.

### Rapidly evolving necrotic skin lesions of the face [^116RZmAc]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
B. Meningococcemia
C. Thrombotic vasculopathy in the context of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection
D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura
E. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS)

Answers:
A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) – Incorrect. Acute DIC evolves within hours or days and induces mainly hemorrhagic manifestations. It is associated with prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which was not observed in our patient.
B. Meningococcemia – Incorrect. Meningococcal meningitis presents as rapidly evolving diffuse petechiae associated with high fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, confusion, headache and vomiting. Clinical evolution over 1 week, the absence of meningeal symptoms and the preferential location of the necrotic lesions on the face ruled out this diagnosis.
C. Thrombotic vasculopathy in the context of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection – Incorrect. Acro-ischemic lesions secondary to the systemic consequences of severe or critical SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly present as peripheral cyanotic lesions and reticulated livedos. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs was negative and thoracic portion of thoracoabdominal CT-scan was normal.
D. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. Henoch-Schönlein purpura presents as symmetrical palpable purpura, predominantly on the lower limbs and buttocks. It is much more common in children. The adult form, which is rare, can be responsible for severe renal, digestive, joint and skin involvement.
E. Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) – Correct. CAPS refers to a rapid progression of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) leading to the onset of multiple thrombotic events. The association of quasi-simultaneous multiple organ/tissue failure, histopathological images showing diffuse microthrombosis of dermal and hypodermal vessels (Fig 1, C and D), and history of APS, was consistent with this diagnosis. This potentially lethal syndrome is observed in approximately 1% of patients with APS. Triggers of CAPS include infections (49% of the cases), surgical procedures (17%), malignancies (16%), anti-coagulation withdrawal or low international normalized ratio (8%), pregnancy complications (8%), drugs (5%), and sequelae of systemic lupus erythematosus (3%). In the first descriptions of CAPS, the mortality risk was up to 50% of patients, but the most recent data from the "CAPS registry", reports that mortality risk is up to 37%.

### The 2023 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities. part II: endorsed by the Society of Interventional Radiology and the Society for Vascular Medicine [^116fXzLy]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The true incidence of bleeding from varicose veins is unknown due to under-reporting but appears to occur in approximately 4% of patients presenting with varicose veins. Bleeding often arises from small veins at the ankle with surrounding skin pigmentation and induration or following exacerbation of a venous ulcer leading to erosion of veins underlying the ulcer bed. Patients may report bleeding when the varicosities are exposed to warm water (in the shower or bathing), causing the veins to vasodilate, or bleeding can occur because of minor trauma. Patients with right heart failure or cardiomyopathy may also experience intermittent, often heavy, bleeding from dilated veins. Regardless of the cause, when a varicose vein ruptures, profuse bleeding can occur due to associated venous hypertension.

Although most bleeding associated with varicose veins is not associated with hypotension and does not require transfusion, fatal hemorrhage is an uncommon, but not entirely rare event. Most cases of fatal variceal hemorrhage have come from autopsy reports. A 2011 report documented < 100 fatalities over several decades. Twenty-three fatalities were reported in England and Wales in 2001. A systematic review including 17 articles found that deaths secondary to bleeding varicose veins accounted for 0.01% of autopsy cases. The victims were patients aged 60 to ≥ 90 years of age with no gender discrimination. Deaths due to hemorrhage occurred in older persons who lived alone, were mobility impaired, had skin fragility or an ulcer located near the malleolus, were on anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication, or had a comorbidity such as dementia or liver failure. These rare case reports describe pulsatile bleeding both from the thin-wall veins themselves and from exposed veins in a venous ulcer bed leading to hypovolemic shock and death, especially in the presence of ischemic heart disease. Another single-center study found that patients with bleeding episodes had decreased access to basic first aid or hemorrhage control techniques.

As many of the fatal hemorrhagic events can be prevented, it is critical that patients be asked about prior bleeding episodes, be warned about the possibility, and be instructed in first aid and hemorrhage control techniques, such as leg elevation and direct compression on the bleeding varicose veins. The danger of applying venous tourniquets and increasing venous pressure has often been emphasized in the literature.

### Gemcitabine-associated acute lipodermatosclerosislike eruption: an underrecognized phenomenon [^113U8Wd5]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Case series

Patient 1

A 73-year-old man with a history of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma was started on gemcitabine and Abraxane (protein-bound paclitaxel, Celgene Corp, Summit, NJ) and presented 5 days after his first dose with a new-onset lower extremity eruption. Pertinent medical history was notable for atrial fibrillation on warfarin, venous hypertension with lower extremity edema, and no history of radiation therapy. Physical examination found exquisitely tender red plaques of the bilateral shins (predominantly above the medial malleoli) with overlying petechiae (Fig 1, A). In addition, there was 2+ pitting edema of the feet extending up to the knees. The patient was afebrile and complete blood count found thrombocytopenia (platelets, 60) but normal white blood cell count. Gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption was diagnosed and treated with leg elevation, compression socks, and clobetasol 0.05% ointment under saran wrap occlusion. At 2-week follow-up, his cutaneous eruption was markedly improved with decreased edema, resolution of the tender plaques, and residual hemosiderin deposition (Fig 1, B). The patient remained on treatment without dose reduction.

### Dermatitis herpetiformis presenting as pseudovasculitis [^116Sbva8]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The pleomorphic clinical appearance of DH can at times make diagnosis challenging. The classic findings of a pruritic grouped papulovesicular eruption favoring the extensor surfaces can clinically support the diagnosis; however, the dermatologist must be aware of the clinical variability of DH even in a clinical presentation mimicking eruption from other etiologies, such as vasculitis in this patient's presentation. This variability can be present in both the distribution — isolated scalp or facial involvement — and in the primary lesion — urticarial plaques or isolated excoriations secondary to pruritus.

Additionally, palmoplantar petechiae is increasingly reported in the literature as a component in the clinical presentation of DH with a significant predilection for the pediatric patient. Clinically, petechiae are only present on the palmoplantar surfaces with no involvement of the dorsal hands or feet. Although the specific pathophysiologic mechanism for this phenomenon is still unknown, the petechial lesions are present more often on the dominant hand, suggesting a possible role for trauma as an etiologic factor.

Our case of a 47-year-old white man with diffuse confluent erythematous macules and patches in addition to remarkable purpuric changes is an unusual presentation of DH. Although a vasculitic process was initially favored in the differential diagnosis because of the exuberant clinical appearance, no evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis was seen on histopathology. We find it intriguing that Naylor et alreported a similar presentation with diffuse petechiae in a 58-year-old man; however, histopathology findings in their case were consistent with both DH and leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Our case is unusual in that no such changes consistent with small-vessel inflammation were present on histopathology results but rather findings favoring pseudovasculitis with pronounced extravasated red blood cells, which can simulate vasculitis clinically. Further, our patient with no known history of thrombophilia also had petechiae on the distal fingertips. Although acral petechiae can be a common DH presentation in the pediatric population as previously mentioned, it is rarely reported in an adult. The constellation of clinical findings in this patient show the pleomorphic manifestations of DH.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^112SQW9H]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old male ultramarathoner presented with severe swelling, redness, and pain in bilateral lower extremities. Symptoms began a few hours after finishing a 100-mile trail-running race in eastern Texas. The race occurred in February, with ambient temperatures ranging from 44 to 76 °F. The swelling progressively worsened, and he presented to the clinic approximately 3 days after finishing. He reported having run almost continuously for > 30 hours but denied any specific injury. He denied any changes in urine color, fever, severe/focal pain, or numbness/tingling. He reported running 3 prior races of 100+ miles but denied any history of similar symptoms. His medical and surgical histories were unremarkable.

The patient arrived in a wheelchair but transitioned to the examination table unassisted. His vital signs were normal, and he was in no distress. Upon inspection, prominent 4+ pitting edemas and moderate diffuse erythema and warmth were noted from the knees to the toes bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no purpura. The knees, ankles, and feet were nontender, and there was only mild tenderness to palpation of the lower leg muscular compartments. There was mild pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Strength testing revealed mild weakness (4+/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Neurovascular examination was unremarkable.

Fig 1
Photographs taken of the patient's legs on day 5 after completion of the 100-mile ultramarathon race. Mild confluent erythema and pitting edema, with lack of petechiae or purpura.

Initial laboratory testing revealed a serum creatine kinase (CK) level of 5800 U/L and urinalysis positive for protein (30 mg/dL). Urine was negative for hemoglobin, and only rare red blood cells were present in sediment. A basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were completely normal.

Bilateral tibia/fibula x-rays were normal. Ultrasound of the lower legs showed widespread thickening of the subdermal adipose layer with prominent streaky anechoic signal interspersed among the hypoechoic fat lobules bilaterally and mild anechoic tenosynovial effusion of the anterior, medial, and lateral ankle tendons. Muscles in all 4 compartments demonstrated normal architecture throughout.

B, prominent fat necrosis with hemorrhage, hemosiderin deposition, numerous foamy histiocytes with focal granulomas, and microcyst formation.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema nodosum (EN)
B. Pancreatic panniculitis
C. Nutritional deficiency
D. Nodular vasculitis
E. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema nodosum (EN) – Incorrect. EN presents with tender red subcutaneous nodules on the lower extremities and may be associated with infections, oral contraceptives, and other systemic inflammatory disorders. While our patient's nodules could represent EN, the expected histopathology would be a septal and not lobular panniculitis, as seen in our case.
B. Pancreatic panniculitis – Incorrect. Pancreatic panniculitis may present as tender nodules on the lower limbs and may be associated with arthropathy and pleural effusions. Histologically, it may also show fat necrosis and foamy histiocytes. However, contrary to typical presentations, there were no signs of abdominal pain or elevated serum amylase or lipase.
C. Nutritional deficiency – Correct. Given our patient's history of multiple food allergies and findings of petechiae, ecchymoses, hemarthrosis, and gingival bleeding, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) levels were evaluated, revealing a striking deficiency (< 0.1 mg/dl). As ascorbic acid is involved in collagen formation within the capillary walls, its deficiency can result in vessel fragility and hemorrhage, causing the skin findings seen in our patient. Consequently, vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) was diagnosed.
D. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. While nodular vasculitis may present with erythematous, tender nodules, they typically appear more commonly on the calves than on the shins. Histopathology often reveals lobular or septolobular panniculitis with vasculitis involving the medium-sized vessels, along with granulomatous inflammation and necrosis. Additionally, acid-fast bacilli staining was negative.
E. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura – Incorrect. Although immune thrombocytopenic purpura can present with petechiae and ecchymoses, thrombocytopenia is typically present.

Lower extremity oedema is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The challenge is to correctly identify the aetiology of oedema, and hence correctly manage the cause. Oedema can be classified as venous oedema and lymphoedema. Lymphoedema of the lower extremities is usually bilateral. Unilateral leg lymphoedema may occur secondary to radiation, surgery, compression by a tumour or early filariasis infection. Unilateral lower extremity lymphoedema has been reported as a rare initial presentation for lymphoma, mostly in women, usually without B-symptoms, and often with inguinal lymphadenopathies or abdominal masses. In this paper, we report a rare case of unilateral lower extremity oedema in a healthy male presenting to the outpatient clinic following trauma; further work-up revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac veins.

### Hemorrhagic bullae on bilateral lower extremities [^111CjgCc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 33-year-old man newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with worsening hemorrhagic bullae on the extremities that started 4 days earlier as a pink macular rash sparing the trunk. The patient denied any past medical history, medications, allergies, illicit drugs, or trauma over the last year.

On physical exam, the dorsal hands had scattered petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles. The palms and soles were unaffected. Nonpitting edema and numerous hemorrhagic bullae with erythematous rims mixed with purpuric papules and plaques in a retiform pattern were noted on the lower extremities.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous erythema multiforme
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita

Answers:
A. Bullous erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Bullous erythema multiforme is an immune mediated hypersensitivity reaction that presents with targetoid lesions on the skin and mucosal surfaces.
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster is a dermatomal eruption that occurs when the varicella zoster virus is reactivated in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and commonly occurs in association with immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, and/or anticoagulant use.
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a self-limiting rare manifestation of a common vasculitic disease in childhood and is frequently associated with abdominal pain, arthralgias and/or renal involvement.
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis (Fig 1) – Correct. Bullous LCV is a manifestation of small vessel vasculitis, characterized by immune complex deposition in postcapillary venules leading to destructive inflammatory venulitis (Fig 1, Fig 2 3). Syphilis-induced endothelial cell swelling and endarteritis obliterans have been documented, but cases of LCV, especially with concurrent HIV infection, are rare. The potential mechanisms involve delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by antibody-antigen complexes and neutrophil hyperactivation, with HIV-induced immune alterations contributing.
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune blistering condition that arises due to autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen. These bullae typically erupt in sites of trauma and can progress to milia and scarring.

### Dermatitis herpetiformis presenting as digital petechiae [^112Wui2x]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

We present a 15-year-old female patient with a 6-month history of recurrent painful petechiae on the fingers and feet. Trauma or pressure were denied, but she reported recurrent tonsillitis and urinary tract infections and a single event of bilateral scotoma. Extensive investigations (e.g., echocardiography) for a suspected diagnosis of septic emboli were unremarkable. Routine histopathology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy led to the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. The therapeutic strategy comprised gluten-free diet and dapsone to alleviate the symptoms. Dermatitis herpetiformis should be included in the differential diagnosis of palmar or plantar petechiae, especially when occurring in children or young adults.

### Histopathology aiding diagnosis of viscerocutaneous loxoscelism in a nonendemic region [^114phCFL]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A previously healthy 19-year-old Black man was transferred to our intensive care unit for an acute drop in hemoglobin. In the week before admission, the patient presented to his local emergency department for fever, malaise, and vomiting. A lesion behind his left knee was noted, initially considered unrelated and benign. He was diagnosed with a viral illness and sent home. The day before transfer, he returned to the emergency department for worsening symptoms and a syncopal episode. The lesion behind his knee had become tender and swollen. Computed tomography of the left lower extremity was consistent with cellulitis. Given clinical concern for sepsis, he received clindamycin before his hemoglobin dropped to 3.4 g/dL. He was stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells and transferred.

Admission laboratory results showed hemolytic anemia. Etiology was unknown at the time. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone while the hematology and infectious disease services conducted their investigations. During initial hospitalization, he experienced significant respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema, gross hematuria, and laboratory studies showed transaminitis, leukocytosis, and significantly elevated inflammatory markers (Table I).

Longitudinal laboratory values, important events, and workup during hospitalization

On day 2 of hospitalization, a widespread desquamating rash developed on his trunk, face, and extremities. Dermatology was consulted for the rash and the lesion in the left popliteal fossa (Fig 1). On interview, the patient had noted a "scratch" in the left popliteal area 1 week before hospitalization, which was itchy but not painful. He did not recall a definite spider bite but mentioned noticing spiders in their home in Iowa and sleeping on a floor mattress. The lesion had developed into a depressed, ulceronecrotic, atrophic, hyperpigmented plaque with scalloped borders, eschar formation, and surrounding induration.

Regarding surgical interventions for lower extremity amputation, more specifically with respect to indications for amputation, frostbite, WMS 2024 guidelines recommend to perform expeditious amputation if the patient develops signs and symptoms of sepsis attributed to infected frostbitten tissue. Delay amputation if otherwise until definitive demarcation occurs, a process that may take weeks to months.

### Lower limb necrosis secondary to purpura fulminans: a case report [^115mcsUb]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpura fulminans is a rare and rapidly progressive septic process characterized by the development of hemorrhagic and ecchymotic lesions and skin necrosis. In this work, we report a case of a 52-year-old woman admitted to the Department of Emergency due to progressive purpura. The physical examination demonstrated a decreased skin temperature, unpalpable dorsalis pedis arteries, and ecchymoses covering both lower extremities. Laboratory tests indicated disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), low prothrombin time (PT), elevated d-dimer levels, and a low platelet count. A diagnosis of purpura fulminans was made, and steroids, therapeutic plasma exchange and empiric therapy, including antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy, were initiated immediately. Our treatment resulted in a good and sustained clinical response, as evidenced by the receding of blood blisters and the normalization of the patient's coagulation factors, but bilateral below-knee amputation was inevitable. Finally, the patient recovered well and was discharged home without any complications other than amputation.

Monitoring and Dosing

Patients who are not able to adhere to the recommended laboratory monitoring or to the related treatment recommendations must not receive TEGSEDI. Do not initiate TEGSEDI in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 109/L. Follow recommended monitoring and treatment recommendations for platelet count [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of thrombocytopenia, obtain a platelet count as soon as possible, and hold TEGSEDI dosing unless the platelet count is confirmed to be acceptable. Recheck the platelet count as soon as possible if a platelet measurement is uninterpretable (e.g., clumped sample) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Hold TEGSEDI dosing until an acceptable platelet count is confirmed with an interpretable blood sample.

Concomitant Medications with Platelet Effects

When considering use of TEGSEDI concomitantly with antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants, be aware of the risk of potential bleeding from thrombocytopenia with TEGSEDI, and consider discontinuation of these drugs in patients with a platelet count less than 50 x 109/L [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Symptoms of Thrombocytopenia

Symptoms of thrombocytopenia can include unusual or prolonged bleeding (e.g., petechiae, easy bruising, hematoma, subconjunctival bleeding, gingival bleeding, epistaxis, hemoptysis, irregular or heavier than normal menstrual bleeding, hematemesis, hematuria, hematochezia, melena), neck stiffness or atypical severe headache. Patients and caregivers should be instructed to be vigilant for symptoms of thrombocytopenia and seek immediate medical help if they have concerns.

Severe Thrombocytopenia: Treatment with Glucocorticoids

Glucocorticoid therapy is strongly recommended in patients with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L, and in patients with suspected immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Avoid using TEGSEDI in patients for whom glucocorticoid treatment is not advised.

### Petechiae / purpura in well-appearing infants [^114D1Z6G]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Well infants with petechiae and/or purpura can present to emergency departments, and their management can be difficult. Many will have extensive investigations and treatment that may not be necessary.

Methods

This was a retrospective and descriptive audit investigating well infants (< 8 months of age) presenting with petechiae or purpura in the absence of fever to a pediatric emergency department over a 9½-year period. All presenting problems of petechiae or purpura were reviewed. Patients were excluded if they appeared unwell, were febrile or have a history of fever, or had eccyhmoses on presentation.

Results

Thirty-six babies were identified. The average age was 3.8 months (range, 1–7 months). The majority of the infants had localized purpura/petechiae to the lower limbs (92%) with two thirds of these patients having bilateral signs. None had generalized signs. Most infants had a full blood count (94%), coagulation profile (59%) and C-reactive protein (59%), and blood cultures (59%), with all being normal (except for mild elevation in platelets). Nine patients were admitted for observation, with only 1 patient having progression of signs. This patient had a diagnosis of acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy. The rest of the patients were thought to have either a mechanical reason for their petechiae/purpura (tourniquet phenomena) or a formal diagnosis was not specified.

Conclusions

Well infants with localized purpura and/or petechiae with an absence of fever are more likely to have a benign etiology. Further study is required to determine if a full blood count and coagulation profile is necessary, or a period of observation (4 hours) is all that is required. If there is no progression of signs, it is likely that they can be safely discharged. The likely cause may be due to a tourniquet phenomenon (eg, diaper).

### Risk factors for lower extremity injury: a review of the literature [^113jn4oi]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Prospective studies on risk factors for lower extremity injury are reviewed. Many intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors have been implicated; however, there is little agreement with respect to the findings. Future prospective studies are needed using sufficient sample sizes of males and females, including collection of exposure data, and using established methods for identifying and classifying injury severity to conclusively determine additional risk factors for lower extremity injury.

### An unusual swelling in the neck [^114g8P2L]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thrombosis is a fundamental pathological entity. Our patient provides an opportunity to consider etiology in terms of Virchow's classic triad. We also draw attention to the effort syndrome, in which recurrent, vigorous exertion of an upper extremity is thought to produce venous thrombosis by virtue of local endothelial trauma.

### Two cases of unilateral pigmented purpuric dermatosis [^112MFC8z]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Two cases of pigmented purpuric dermatosis showing unusual distribution are reported. Case 1: 35-year-old female. A group of three asymptomatic purpuric macules developed on the ulnar side of the elbow flexure of the left forear 3–6 months before presentation. Histopathological analysis revealed a band-like inflammatory infiltrate in the Uppermost dermis and extravasation of red blood cells just beneath the epidermis, but there was no evidence of lichefaction degeneration in the basal layer of the epidermis. Case 2: 26-year-old female. Asymptomatic purpuric pigmentations developed on the flexure side of the right lower extremity in a linear arrangement 2–3 months before presentation. Histopathological analysis revealed focally perivascular inflammatatory infiltrates consisting mainly of lymphocytes and conspicuous extravasation of red blood cells into the papillary dermis. There was no histological evidence of vasculitis in either case. Hemosiderin deposits were more limited than expected in both patients. Both cases are compatible with diagnoses of pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Case 1 on the left arm was compatible with lichen purpuricus. Case 2 occurred in a linear arrangement on the right leg and had a history of aspirin use for chronic headache. We therefore suspected that medication had been an etiological or contributing factor.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^1169QU2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150×10³ per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50×10³ per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50×10³ per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10×10³ per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 103 per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50×10³ per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.
