## Question

Should you retake lipid panel 4 weeks after after initiating a statin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a lipid panel should be rechecked 4 weeks after starting a statin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline recommendations for timing of on-therapy lipid assessment. Then, I should verify whether any major society explicitly recommends a 4-week interval. Next, I will consider the pharmacologic rationale for timing, including steady-state LDL-C changes and safety labs. After that, I should review exceptions where a 4-week check is reasonable or required. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm whether fasting is necessary.

> Let me first confirm the mainstream guidance. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on rechecking a lipid panel 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose change, with subsequent monitoring every 3 to 12 months as clinically indicated, and they frame the purpose as assessing adherence and percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline rather than treating to a single LDL-C target [^d227270f] [^8d1b5eba] [^4abf7b30] [^62408dbe] [^0ebd5704].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative source specifically mandates 4 weeks. The PES Lipid SIG Diabetes and Lipids Algorithm explicitly instructs to recheck a fasting lipid profile, ALT, and AST 4 weeks after starting or titrating a statin, and to repeat every 4 weeks until the LDL-C goal is reached; this is a high-credibility, specialty-specific pathway that operationalizes earlier checks to expedite titration and safety review in diabetes care [^59e85ad1] [^72a5a3e1]. Similarly, the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline recommends a fasting lipid panel 4–8 weeks after initiation or dose change in post-ACS patients, reflecting the need for early assessment in very-high-risk secondary prevention settings [^fb432022] [^44e61adb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the pharmacologic rationale. LDL-C typically falls by about 30–50% with moderate- to high-intensity statins within 2–4 weeks, so a 4-week check can reasonably capture the early treatment effect and allow timely dose intensification if the response is suboptimal, while also enabling early detection of liver enzyme elevations in higher-risk patients or those on interacting medications [^cafcb52b] [^8617f7bd].

> I need to ensure I'm balancing benefits and burdens. Earlier checks can reduce therapeutic inertia and improve adherence, and observational data in large systems show that completing guideline-directed lipid panels is associated with modestly higher statin adherence and more frequent therapy intensification, which can translate into better risk reduction over time [^9745dc55] [^d6acd3e2]. But wait, what if we over-test low-risk patients? That could add burden without changing management, so I should tailor the interval to risk and clinical context rather than use a one-size-fits-all 4-week approach [^d227270f].

> Let me consider special populations where a 4-week check is particularly sensible. In diabetes, the PES algorithm's 4-week interval supports rapid titration to LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals and concurrent safety monitoring. In post-ACS or very-high-risk ASCVD, 4–8 week checks align with early secondary prevention targets and the propensity for dose changes. In pediatrics with familial hypercholesterolemia, 4-week labs are standard during titration. And in patients with interacting drugs or baseline liver disease, earlier hepatic surveillance is prudent [^59e85ad1] [^fb432022] [^8e1e8b4f] [^8617f7bd].

> But wait, what if the patient is low risk and on a stable, well-tolerated regimen? I should double-check that guidelines still allow flexibility. Yes, outside of high-risk or specialty contexts, repeating lipids anywhere in the 4–12 week window is acceptable, and once at goal with good adherence, extending to every 3–12 months is reasonable; nonfasting samples are generally acceptable for routine monitoring, reserving fasting for hypertriglyceridemia workups or when accurate LDL-C calculation is needed [^d227270f] [^533e7e75].

> I should confirm the bottom line. Should you retake a lipid panel at 4 weeks after starting a statin? Not universally, but yes in high-risk settings such as diabetes per PES, post-ACS per ACC/AHA/ACEP, and pediatric FH titration, and consider it when rapid titration or early safety assessment is clinically important; otherwise, any check within 4–12 weeks is guideline-concordant, with subsequent monitoring every 3–12 months based on adherence, tolerability, and risk [^59e85ad1] [^fb432022] [^8e1e8b4f] [^d227270f] [^8d1b5eba].

---

It is **appropriate to recheck a lipid panel 4 weeks after starting a statin** in certain high-risk scenarios, such as recent ACS [^fb432022], severe hypercholesterolemia, or when rapid titration is needed [^notfound]. However, for most patients, **guidelines recommend rechecking at 4–12 weeks** [^d227270f] to assess adherence and response, with subsequent monitoring every 3–12 months [^8d1b5eba]. A 4-week check is reasonable if there is concern about adherence, intolerance, or a need for early dose adjustment, but it is not mandatory for all patients [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for lipid panel monitoring after statin initiation

Monitoring lipid levels after statin initiation is essential to **assess adherence**, **evaluate therapeutic response**, and **identify adverse effects**. Statins typically reduce LDL cholesterol by 30–50% within 4–12 weeks [^cafcb52b]; early monitoring ensures patients achieve target reductions and remain adherent [^9745dc55].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Several authoritative guidelines provide clear recommendations on the timing of lipid panel monitoring after statin initiation:

| **Guideline** | **Recommended timing for lipid panel recheck** |
|-|-|
| American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2018 | - 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment [^d227270f] <br/> - Then every 3–12 months [^8d1b5eba] |
| American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2025 | - 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change [^f43fc6be] <br/> - Then annually [^90a93258] |
| Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) 2024 | - Recheck fasting lipids at 4 weeks [^59e85ad1] <br/> - Then every 3–4 months in the first year [^59e85ad1] |
| American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) 2022 | - Recheck within 12 weeks [^1131aa65] <br/> - Adjust therapy if LDL-C remains > 70 mg/dL |

---

These guidelines emphasize a **4–12 week window** for initial monitoring, with subsequent checks tailored to clinical context and risk profile [^d227270f].

---

## Clinical scenarios where a 4-week lipid panel is appropriate

While the general recommendation is 4–12 weeks, certain clinical scenarios **warrant earlier monitoring at 4 weeks**:

- **High-risk patients**: Patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [^fb432022], severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), or familial hypercholesterolemia may benefit from earlier assessment to ensure rapid achievement of lipid targets [^notfound].

- **Rapid titration**: When rapid dose titration is anticipated or required, a 4-week check allows timely adjustment [^notfound].

- **Adherence concerns**: If there are concerns about patient adherence or potential drug interactions, early monitoring can identify issues promptly [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where a 4-week lipid panel is not necessary

In stable, low-risk patients without significant comorbidities, **routine 4-week monitoring is not necessary**. Extending the initial check to 8–12 weeks is reasonable and aligns with guideline flexibility [^d227270f].

---

## Clinical implications of early lipid panel monitoring

Early lipid panel monitoring at 4 weeks can have **important clinical implications**:

- **Adherence assessment**: Early monitoring helps identify nonadherence, enabling targeted interventions to improve persistence [^9745dc55].

- **Therapeutic adjustment**: If lipid targets are not met, early monitoring allows prompt dose escalation or addition of nonstatin therapies [^a1ac297b].

- **Safety monitoring**: Early detection of adverse effects, such as hepatotoxicity or myopathy, facilitates timely management [^8617f7bd].

---

## Potential drawbacks of early lipid panel monitoring

Despite its benefits, early monitoring may have **some drawbacks**:

- **Patient anxiety**: Frequent testing may increase anxiety or perceived illness severity.

- **Resource utilization**: Additional visits and laboratory tests may increase healthcare costs and resource use.

- **Limited clinical utility**: In stable, low-risk patients, early monitoring may not significantly alter management decisions.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General recommendation**: Recheck lipid panel 4–12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment [^d227270f], then every 3–12 months [^8d1b5eba].

- **High-risk patients**: Consider a 4-week check for rapid titration, severe hypercholesterolemia, or recent ACS [^fb432022].

- **Low-risk patients**: Extending to 8–12 weeks is reasonable if stable and adherent [^notfound].

- **Individualized approach**: Tailor timing to patient risk, adherence, and clinical context [^notfound].

---

A 4-week lipid panel after statin initiation is **not universally required** but is appropriate in high-risk patients or when rapid titration is needed. For most patients, **4–12 weeks is the standard window**, with subsequent monitoring every 3–12 months [^d227270f].

2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline—The expert panel recommended a paradigm shift away from a treat-to-goal strategy to treatment intensity using fixed doses across four statin benefit groups, including ASCVD, diabetes mellitus (DM), LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, or a calculated 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5%. Statin doses to achieve LDL-C reductions of ≥50% for patients with either ASCVD or LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, or 30–49% for persons with DM or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%, were recommended. A repeat lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation of statin therapy was recommended as a Class IA recommendation (should be performed), with measurement every 3–12 months thereafter, and monitoring of lipid levels was established as a Class IA recommendation.

Monitoring of lipid levels.

There is no consensus on the best approach to monitor lipid profiles in patients before and during treatment. Generally, lipids should be assessed at least twice before starting drug therapy, and then repeated 8-12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment (Table 3). For individuals being treated for secondary prevention of ASCVD or higher risk primary prevention with LDL-C below treatment intensification thresholds, monitoring annually is reasonable. For low-risk primary ASCVD prevention individuals with LDL-C levels below treatment intensification thresholds, less frequent monitoring (ie, every 5 years) may be appropriate.

Table 3. 
Laboratory assessment of patients with dyslipidemias

For biochemical monitoring for adverse effects of statins, we advocate that ALT and creatine kinase (CK) should be measured before starting treatment to obtain a baseline as a point of reference should future concerns arise; however, routine monitoring is generally unnecessary. Several studies have concluded that the rates of statin-induced elevations of aminotransferase levels are rare and may not be significantly different than in the general population. Statins are not contraindicated in individuals with mild baseline elevation in transaminases (<3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) or in those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and these individuals do not seem to be at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Statins are, however, contraindicated in those with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure. For those individuals with transaminase elevations >3× ULN, using a lower starting dose of statin and monitoring transaminases at 4- to 12-week intervals during cautious up-titration may be reasonable. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed later.

If baseline CK is >5 times ULN, some would advise refraining from statin initiation and considering alternative therapy because CK may rise even higher when a statin is introduced. However, if a patient has no risk factors for myopathy, CK does not need to be routinely monitored. A clinical approach to the patient with statin intolerance is discussed in more detail later.

### Early impact of the 2018 AHA / ACC / multisociety cholesterol guideline on lipid monitoring after statin initiation [^75d0afea]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline emphasizes the need for lipid monitoring more strongly than the previous 2013 guideline to ensure patients reach recommended percent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions. Real-world compliance to monitoring recommendations is currently unknown.

Objectives

This study examined the proportion of patients with a lipid panel measured within 3 months of statin initiation.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated University of Colorado Health primary care patients aged 18 to 89 years with a new statin prescription identified via the Epic Clarity database. Patients initiated on a statin during January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 and January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 were included in the pre-2018 guideline cohort and the post-2018 guideline cohort, respectively. Patients with active liver disease, pregnancy, or missing demographic data were excluded.

Results

A total of 13,726 patients were included, 7476 in the preguideline cohort and 6250 in the postguideline cohort. A total of 13.9% of patients in the preguideline cohort had a lipid panel completed within 3 months of statin initiation compared with 16.2% in the postguideline cohort (adjusted P < .001). In the postguideline cohort, 56% (n = 857) of patients with lipid monitoring warranted a therapeutic intensification as recommended by the 2018 guideline; however, only 5% had their lipid-lowering regimen changed.

Conclusion

In a large integrated health system, lipid monitoring increased among patients newly started on statin therapy soon after release of the 2018 guideline but remains low. Clinical interventions are needed to improve lipid monitoring to optimize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy and ensure that guideline-recommended goals are achieved.

Initiation of drug therapy—statin intensity and targets: Unless contraindicated, first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated atherogenic cholesterol levels is a moderate- or high-intensity statin, and a moderate-intensity statin will generally lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 30% to <50% and a high-intensity statin by ≥50%, although individual patient responses should be expected to vary considerably. Some clinicians prefer to start with a high-intensity statin and reduce the dosage if the patient experiences intolerance, while others prefer to start with a moderate-intensity statin and titrate upward if additional lowering of atherogenic cholesterol is desired; if drug therapy is used, the panel consensus view was that at least a 30% reduction in atherogenic cholesterol should be targeted. Some patients have contraindications for, or intolerance to, statin therapy, and for such patients, nonstatin drug therapy may be considered.

Thresholds for consideration of drug therapy—risk-based initiation: Because of available inexpensive, generic statins with favorable safety and demonstrated efficacy, the NLA Expert Panel consensus view is that risk thresholds for initiating drug treatment should be lowered as compared with the NCEP ATP III but raised as compared with ACC/AHA 2013 recommendations; based on the ACC/AHA 2013 guidelines, most men >60 years of age and most women >70 years of age would be eligible for statin therapy, and recommendations involve a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Some clinicians may prefer to prescribe drug therapy to patients with lower levels of risk or atherogenic cholesterol, and such an approach may be considered based on clinical judgment and patient preferences in light of primary prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing risk reduction at projected 10-year ASCVD event rates as low as approximately 5% to 7.5%.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^e119d9db]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Implication of findings

Contemporary guidelines have incorporated non-HDL-C thresholds into treatment algorithms. Our findings lend support to the thresholds proposed in Canadian guidelines. Lipid-lowering therapy decisions in primary prevention should be shared decisions based on individual CV risk (eg, Framingham Risk Score), the absolute chance of benefit and harm from therapy, and individual health goals and preferences. Repeat lipid testing might allow for identification of patients with residual risk for CV events despite initial statin therapy, and an opportunity for discussion of additional lipid-lowering therapy. This discussion will allow for shared decision-making to determine whether pursuing additional lipid lowering is consistent with a person’s health goals and treatment preferences. This discussion might be particularly important in patients at higher baseline risk of CV events, such as those with diabetes or CKD.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Lipid monitoring and treatment response after statin initiation: Assess adherence and percentage response to LDL-C–lowering medications and lifestyle changes with repeat lipid measurement 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, repeated every 3 to 12 months as needed. Define response to lifestyle and statin therapy by percentage reductions in LDL-C levels compared with baseline. In ASCVD patients at very high-risk, triggers for adding nonstatin drug therapy are defined by threshold LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on maximal statin therapy.

### An assessment by the statin liver safety task force: 2014 update [^a6efc54f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

In the 2006 Report of the National Lipid Association's Statin Safety Task Force, a panel of experts in hepatology published their findings on specific questions related to the liver blood testing during statin therapy. Among their recommendations was that regulatory agencies reconsider the statin-labeling recommendation at that time, which required post-statin liver enzyme testing. Since then, the Food and Drug Administration altered statin labeling such that unless clinically indicated for other reasons, after a pre-statin therapy baseline evaluation, follow-up liver enzyme testing was not uniformly required after statin initiation. This 2014 report provides an update on interim issues relevant to statins and liver safety. Some of the points discussed include the value of baseline liver enzymes before initiating statin therapy, safety of statin use in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potential drug interactions between statins and drugs used to treat hepatitis, the use of statins in liver transplant recipients, and the use of statins in patients with autoimmune liver disease. Finally, this panel provides diagnostic and algorithmic approaches when evaluating statin-treated patients who experience elevations in liver enzymes.

### Provider understanding of the 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol guideline [^bf2720c5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Providers' understanding of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) cholesterol guideline in clinical practice is not known.

Methods

We designed a questionnaire, which was administered to internal medicine, family practice, cardiology, and endocrinology providers at 21 venues across the United States. We compared responses between providers in training or practice and between specialists (cardiology and endocrinology) and nonspecialists (internal medicine and family practice).

Results

Response rate was 72.1% (543 of 725). About 43% of the providers in training and 48% of those in practice indicated having read the guideline. Almost 50% in each group were unable to identify the 4 statin benefit groups and a large proportion (41% in training and 49% in practice) were not aware of the ≥7.5% 10-year risk threshold for discussion regarding statin therapy. Most (∼85%) were unaware of the 4 outcomes assessed by the 10-year ASCVD risk equation. About 36% of the providers in training and 48% in practice could identify a patient with familial hypercholesterolemia and start a discussion regarding statin therapy. Only 27.6% of the providers in training and 40.4% in practice recommended repeating a lipid panel 6-8 weeks after starting statins in a patient with recent myocardial infarction. Similar gaps were noted when comparing specialists to nonspecialists.

Conclusion

Most providers do not completely understand the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline. As an unintended consequence, providers are moving away from lipid testing to document response and adherence to statin therapy. Efforts are needed to address these gaps.

### Statins for all? [^e360cd1a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

### Waiting for the national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel IV guidelines, and in the meantime, some challenges and recommendations [^82f7b96a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) has provided education and guidance for decades on the management of hypercholesterolemia. Its third report (ATP III) was published 10 years ago, with a white paper update in 2004. There is a need for translation of more recent evidence into a revised guideline. To help address the significant challenges facing the ATP IV writing group, this statement aims to provide balanced recommendations that build on ATP III. The authors aim for simplicity to increase the likelihood of implementation in clinical practice. To move from ATP III to ATP IV, the authors recommend the following: (1) assess risk more accurately, (2) simplify the starting algorithm, (3) prioritize statin therapy, (4) relax the follow-up interval for repeat lipid testing, (5) designate <70 mg/dl as an "ideal" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target, (6) endorse targets beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (7) refine therapeutic target levels to the equivalent population percentile, (8) remove misleading descriptors such as "borderline high," and (9) make lifestyle messages simpler. In conclusion, the solutions offered in this statement represent ways to translate the totality of published reports into enhanced hyperlipidemia guidelines to better combat the devastating impact of hyperlipidemia on cardiovascular health.

### Frequency of obtaining national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III goals for all major serum lipoproteins after initiation of lipid altering therapy [^f354c04a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction, but many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported. Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006, continued therapy for 1 year, and had full lipid panels within 6 months before and 9 to 15 months after therapy initiation. Therapy (primarily statins) reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%. HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged (49% and 50% were less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively) in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups (patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 10-year heart disease risk >20%). After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, current dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. About half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.

Statin therapy monitoring in patients with diabetes risk factors—The panel recommends that fasting glucose or glycated hemoglobin be checked before initiation of statin therapy and within 1 year afterward in those with diabetes risk factors. In addition, lifestyle therapies should be emphasized to aid in lowering atherogenic cholesterol levels and for reducing diabetes risk.

Lifestyle modifications

In addition to pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions should be emphasized. These include:
• Heart-healthy diet: Adopting a diet low in saturated fats and refined carbohydrates, while rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, is essential.
• Physical activity: Encouraging regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, can help improve lipid profiles and overall cardiovascular health.

Although the patient's CAC score of 0 AU suggests a low short-term risk of cardiovascular events, the elevated Lp(a) level and family history of premature CAD indicate an elevated long-term ASCVD risk. Initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy, along with lifestyle modifications, is recommended to reduce LDL-C and mitigate the patient's lifetime ASCVD risk. Regular monitoring of lipid levels and continued cardiovascular risk assessment are critical to ensure appropriate management and adherence to therapy. A fasting lipid panel should be repeated 4 to 12 weeks after initiating statin therapy to assess the patient's response. The goal is to achieve at least a 30% reduction in LDL-C from baseline or an LDL-C level below 100 mg/dL. Further follow-up visits should assess adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes, as well as monitor for any adverse effects of the medication. This approach of using Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing factor is consistent with AHA/ACC guidance.Furthermore, de-risking patients with a CAC of 0 is consistent with the ACC ECDP although no specific note is made of Lp(a) and CAC of 0.Similarly, the ESC and CCS guidelines discuss Lp(a) as a risk-enhancing feature but do not discuss a role for CAC testing in this setting. No guideline provides specific treatment recommendations based on elevated Lp(a).

### Optimisation of lipids for prevention of cardiovascular disease in a primary care [^7d8eb66f]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A team-based approach including patient’s engagement was critical in the success of this quality improvement project. We have implemented ASCVD risk score assessment as a standard of care in the Internal Medicine Clinic. We plan to increase ASCVD risk score assessment substantially and make interventions sustainable by shifting the responsibility of ASCVD risk calculation from the physician to the nursing staff, and creation of a chart alert to remind physicians during previsit planning. These steps may increase physician’s efficiency and physician’s acceptance of ASCVD risk score discussion with patients, and offering of evidence-based treatment for primary prevention of ASCVD in clinic patients. The next phase of this study will focus on ensuring appropriate of statin prescriptions (dose and recommended intensity) based on ACA/AHA guidelines. With regard to future directions to improve and continue our efforts towards primary prevention of ASCVD, we are planning to monitor therapeutic responses as well as adherence to statin therapy by repeating lipid panels to confirm the percent decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein within 6 months to 1 year after initiation of statin therapy.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^6c6544bc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^b77563ee]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

There was virtually no evidence to support any recommendations regarding the frequency of ongoing monitoring once lipid-lowering therapies had been commenced. Guidelines that recommended retesting following statin initiation tended to additionally recommend liver function tests were performed as a safety indicator, especially if hepatic symptoms were present, including those produced by the ACC/AHA and the ESC/EAS.Guidelines frequently conflate the issue of short term safety bloods with longer term lipid monitoring when reporting the strength of evidence. Despite this, only one guideline (ACD) cited evidence that they considered to be strong in their recommendations. The evidence referenced would suggest that monitoring patients regularly is associated with improved adherence to medication, and, consequently, patient outcomes.However, this study was open to confounding due to its observational nature, and as far as we are aware, this has never been tested within a randomised controlled trial. Furthermore, the purpose of such follow-up testing in guidelines is seldom stated. Where evidence was cited, though, this would suggest that the purpose of such reviews is to promote adherence, but this may not be the rationale for all of the guidelines included, which could also include the monitoring of lipids to check if targets are still being achieved or of safety concerns. Regardless, the majority of guidelines recommended that secondary prevention patients were reviewed annually based purely on clinician’s opinion. However, in the UK, simulations have suggested that this is likely to be optimal economically as well as reducing the impact of any natural variation in an individual’s cholesterol levels.Nonetheless, some patients will not be optimally managed under these recommendations, and by integrating algorithms into electronic health records to aid clinical decision making, there is the potential to personalise an individual patient’s lipid management.

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society consensus panel statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^f4ed2a36]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Lowering LDL-C with statin therapy reduces CVD risk by up to 40% in a wide range of patients. Given that the main reason for statin non-adherence/discontinuation relates to the onset of (perceived) side effects, it follows that the high prevalence of SAMS reported from observational studies is likely to adversely affect the CVD benefits of statins.Strategies to prevent the loss of effective statin therapy because of SAMS are still lacking. In the absence of a gold standard definition, this EAS Consensus Panel proposes to base the probability of SAMS being caused by statins on the nature of symptoms and their temporal relationship with statin initiation, statin discontinuation (or dechallenge), and repetitive re-challenge (Figure 2). Optimal therapy should combine a maximally tolerated, or even non-daily statin dose, together with non-statin-based lipid-lowering therapies in order to achieve LDL-C targets.

This Consensus Panel also highlights the need for further research into the pathophysiology of SAMS. Accumulating preclinical data show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, and alter muscle protein degradation, providing a possible pathophysiological link between statins and muscle symptoms. Studies in the clinical setting are a priority to further understanding of these mechanisms, and may offer therapeutic potential. In the absence of therapies to prevent these symptoms, this Consensus Panel recommends that the response of patients with SAMS to three or more statins should be considered for referral to specialized settings. By recognizing SAMS and adhering to a structured work-up, the Panel anticipates that individuals with clinically relevant SAMS will be offered alternative and/or novel therapeutic regimens that can satisfactorily address their CVD risk.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^2655fe70]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Statin therapy in children and adolescents—initiation and titration (laboratory thresholds and dose escalation) specifies that after 4 weeks, fasting lipid profile (FLP), ALT, and AST are measured and compared with laboratory-specific reported normal values; the threshold for worrisome ALT or AST is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of reported normal; and target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) levels are minimal < 130 mg/dL and ideal < 110 mg/dL. If target LDL–C levels are achieved without potential myopathy symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, therapy is continued and FLP, ALT, and AST are rechecked in 8 weeks and then 3 months. If laboratory abnormalities are noted or symptoms are reported, the medication is temporarily withheld and blood work repeated in 2 weeks, with restart when abnormalities resolve and close monitoring. If target LDL–C levels are not achieved, the dose is increased by one increment (usually 10 mg) and blood work repeated in 4 weeks; if still not achieved, the dose may be increased again or another agent (bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor) may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for... [^e21c004d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.
1. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo. Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring.

After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^45e40a07]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol clinical practice guidelines—key “Top 10 Take-Home Messages” include actions and thresholds for statin therapy and follow-up. In very high-risk ASCVD, use an LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to consider the addition of nonstatins to statin therapy. In patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L)), without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk, begin high-intensity statin therapy. In patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), start moderate-intensity statin therapy without calculating the 10-year ASCVD risk. In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5%, start a moderate intensity statin if a discussion of treatment options favors statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and a 10-year risk of 7.5% to 19.9% (intermediate risk), risk-enhancing factors favor the initiation of statin therapy, and in patients with a 10-year risk of ASCVD at 5% to 7.5% (borderline risk), risk-enhancing factors may favor statin therapy. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5% to 19.9%, if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain, consider measuring CAC. Assess adherence and the percentage response to LDL-C–lowering medication and lifestyle changes with repeat lipid measurement 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, repeated every 3 to 12 months, as needed.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults: recommendations and... [^e548cb67]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The USPSTF found good evidence that lipid measurement in low-risk young adults can detect some persons at increased long-term risk of heart disease, but the absolute risk reduction as a result of treating dyslipidemia in most persons is small before middle age. Fair evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of the treatment benefits may be realized within five years of initiating therapy. The USPSTF concludes that the net benefits of screening for lipid disorders in low-risk young persons are not sufficient to make a general recommendation. Clinical Considerations Total cholesterol and HDL levels can be measured on nonfasting or fasting samples. In conjunction with HDL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol provide comparable information, but measuring LDL requires a fasting sample and is more expensive.

In patients with elevated risk on screening results, lipoprotein analysis, including fasting triglyceride levels, may provide information that is useful in choosing optimal treatments. The optimal screening interval is uncertain. On the basis of other guidelines and expert opinion, reasonable options for optimal screening intervals include every five years, shorter intervals for persons who have lipid levels close to those warranting therapy, and longer intervals for low-risk persons who have had low or repeatedly normal lipid level measurements. An age at which screening should stop has not been established. 5, 6 Treatment choices should take into account costs and patient preferences. Drug therapy is usually more effective than diet alone, but choice of treatment should consider overall risk, costs of treatment, and patient preferences. Guidelines for treating high cholesterol are available from the National Cholesterol Education Program of the National Institutes of Health.

7 Although diet therapy is an appropriate initial treatment for most patients, a minority achieve substantial reductions in lipid levels from diet alone. Drugs are frequently needed to achieve therapeutic goals, especially in high-risk patients. Lipid-lowering treatments should be accompanied by interventions that address all modifiable risk factors for heart disease, including smoking cessation, treatment of blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, as well as promotion of a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Long-term adherence to therapies should be emphasized. EFFECTIVENESS OF EARLY INTERVENTION In four large primary prevention trials, cholesterol-lowering drug treatment for five to seven years decreased the risk of coronary heart disease events by approximately 30 percent in persons with high total cholesterol or average cholesterol and low HDL levels. In the one trial that included women, treatment appeared to be as effective in post-menopausal women as in men.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^2bc8883a]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Statins rank among the most commonly prescribed drug classes. Recent revisions of clinical guidelines for CVD risk reduction have significantly expanded the population of patients deemed eligible for statin therapy.As the high levels of statin prescribing in the UK are similar to those in the USA and many other countries,the findings should translate well, particularly to other similar western populations. There was a substantial duration of follow-up for outcomes. A wide range of potential confounders were also evaluated and adjusted for in the analyses.

Based on evidence from clinical trial settings, the response of patients to statins varies widely, with reductions in LDL-C values following the administration of statins ranging from 5–70%.In our study using a large general population reflecting routine practice, over half of the patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response.

Currently, there is no management strategy in clinical practice which takes into account patient variations in LDL-C response,and no guidelines for predictive screening before commencement of statin therapy. Validated clinical decision tools which can predict cholesterol response to statins, or to non-statin drugs, with interventions to help clinicians to tailor and optimise statin treatments for individual patients are needed.

### Association between lipid testing and statin adherence in the veterans affairs health system [^9745dc55]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Measurement with a lipid panel after statin initiation and in long-term follow-up is recommended in both 2013 and 2018 cholesterol guidelines to assess statin efficacy and adherence. We assessed whether routine laboratory evaluation with lipid panels is associated with greater statin adherence.

Methods

We identified patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease within the entire Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system with at least one primary care visit between October 2013 and September 2014, who were on statin therapy (n = 813,887; n = 52,583 for new statin users). Statin adherence was determined using medication refill data and assessed by proportion of days covered (PDC). Association between number of lipid panels completed and PDC was assessed with adjusted regression models.

Results

Within the study period, the mean number of lipid panels that were completed per patient was 1.5 ± 1.0. In the overall cohort, percentage of statin users with PDC ≥80% was 66.0% for patients with ≥1 lipid panel and 61.2% for patients with 0 lipid panels (P < .0001). Among new statin users, PDC ≥80% was 68.0% for patients with lipid panels completed within 4-12 weeks of therapy initiation and 59.3% for those without lipid panels completed within the timeframe (P < .0001). In adjusted analysis, number of lipid panels completed was associated with a modest but significant increase in PDC, when PDC was evaluated as a continuous (beta-coefficient 0.0054, P < .001) or categorical (PDC ≥80% [odds ratio (OR) 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.01]) measure of statin adherence. The significant association was also observed in new users (beta-coefficient 0.0058, P < .001; OR 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03).

Conclusion

Routine, guideline-directed completion of lipid panels in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients on statins overall and among new statin users is associated with a modes6t but significant increase in statin adherence.

### Coronary artery calcium testing-too early, too late, too often [^d94edda3]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional risk factors, enhancing factors, and risk scores help clinicians assess atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk for primary prevention. The latest cholesterol guidelines suggest measuring coronary artery calcium (CAC) score by computed tomography (CT) in those at intermediate risk when there is uncertainty about statin initiation for primary prevention. CAC testing can improve both risk estimation and adherence to cardiovascular risk-reducing behaviors.

Observations

As measuring CAC score has become more widely available, this article focuses on 3 situations where CAC testing may be omitted or deferred until a time when CAC testing can provide clinically useful information. Three clinical scenarios to facilitate the clinician-patient risk discussion are as follows: (1) when CAC testing is too early, (2) when CAC testing is too late, and (3) when CAC testing is repeated too often. The timing of CAC testing sits within the decision point of lipid-lowering therapy use. High-risk young adults may face an elevated lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease despite a CAC level of 0, whereas older adults may not see an expected benefit over a short time horizon or may already be taking lipid-lowering therapy, rendering a CAC score less valuable. Integrating a CAC score into the decision to initiate lipid-lowering therapy requires understanding of a patient's risk factors, including age, as well as the natural history of atherosclerosis and related events.

Conclusions and Relevance

These clinical scenarios reflect when consideration of CAC score is of use and when it is not. Although CAC testing is becoming more widely available and sought after by clinicians and patients alike, it is only as useful as the clinical context. Understanding when assessing CAC score is too early to effectively rule out risk, too late to influence decisions, or too often to yield clinically relevant information provides important insights that optimize the clinical utility of this potentially valuable prognostic tool.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^d6e129d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 Years after release of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association (ACC / AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^0ee97834]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. 1 One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy that selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations. The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials. The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events; for those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. 1 With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence‐based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues for that individual. Monitoring LDL‐C levels would then be performed to assess appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence‐based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high‐intensity statin (Figure 1).

Several studies have been conducted since the guideline was introduced in an attempt to identify the potential impact of the guideline. In studies evaluating statin prescribing in which the presence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease was determined by coronary imaging, a greater proportion of patients were eligible for a statin based on the ACC/AHA guideline compared with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guideline. 2, 3 Chia et al compared the Pooled Cohort Risk Score with actual practice data from 1998 to 2007 and found that statin use would need to increase under the new guideline. 4, 5 Preguideline data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry (2008–2012) and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 2005 to 2010 were assessed to estimate the impact of the guideline on statin practice patterns. This analysis found that compliance with the new guideline should result in a meaningful increase in statin use, especially in the group of patients with 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%. 6, 7

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: paradigm shifts in managing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk [^efb5fedd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults represents a major shift from prior cholesterol management guidelines. The new guidelines include data from individual randomized trials as well as the most comprehensive meta-analyses, and introduce several major paradigm shifts, which include: aiming for ASCVD risk reduction as opposed to targeting LDL-C levels, advocating for the use of evidence-based doses of statins as first line therapy, and utilizing a new risk calculator and risk cut point to guide initiation of statin therapy. These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^4d80db6d]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review illustrates the variation in recommendations surrounding optimal on-statin lipid monitoring within secondary prevention. Specifically, there were considerable differences in the recommendations for cholesterol targets (including their use) and the ongoing monitoring of lipid levels over the longer term. These findings reflect the fact that no guideline identified a specifically designed randomised controlled trial to assess either treatment targets or monitoring of therapy. However, such trials are likely to be expensive, although in the future advances with electronic health records may facilitate the evidence base for this. Nonetheless, this systematic review illustrates that better evidence is needed to provide an optimal approach to lipid monitoring in order to balance safety, adherence, cost, and time burden to patients.

All guideline committees are likely to be searching a broadly similar evidence base, where the efficacy and safety of statins has been well established in the prevention of further cardiovascular events.Furthermore, the WHO recommends the use of statins as part of their secondary prevention programme,with the increased risk widely accepted within this population. It is therefore not surprising that all guidelines agree that statins should be commenced as the lipid-lowering therapy with a high level of evidence, commensurate with the availability of randomised controlled trials. Guidelines that specify drugs or doses generally recommend high dose therapy and titrating down as necessary to a tolerated dose, rather than titrating up. This is in line with large randomised controlled trials over the preceding decades that have shown that higher dose statin therapy improves outcomes.Nonetheless, despite this widespread recommendation, there is some evidence to suggest that statins are not consistently prescribed within the secondary prevention population depending on the cardiovascular events experienced.Meanwhile, recommendations for the use of other lipid-lowering therapies illustrate that such guidelines are likely a reflection of the evidence available when the guidelines were created; for example, PCSK9 inhibitors were only discussed in guidelines published after 2016. Therefore, in clinical practice, consideration may need to be given to the timing of the publication where new evidence has emerged.

### Reinstating LDL-C measurement as a Quality metric: this is the way [^c51a2e3d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The present study demonstrates how far our current clinical practice strays from current guideline recommendations, with less than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries meeting the recommendations for timely lipid testing. Colantonio et al assert that timely lipid testing is an important first step that could help mitigate the clinical inertia associated with prescription of lipid-lowering therapeutics and reduce recurrent cardiovascular events. In a study of more than 1 million patients in the Veterans Affairs Health System, patients with one or more lipid panels were more likely to be initiated on statin therapy compared with patients without a lipid panel. Additionally, in multivariable-adjusted analyses, performance of lipid panels was independently associated with intensification of lipid-lowering therapy in a dose-dependent manner. Simply checking a lipid panel was associated with improved initiation and intensification of lipid-lowering therapy. The recent joint clinical perspective between the National Lipid Association and American Society for Preventive Cardiology articulates the importance of reinstating LDL-C as a quality metric to optimize lipid management and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.Unfortunately, in contrast to the quality metrics for hypertension and diabetes, which include measurement of blood pressure and hemoglobin A1C, the current quality metrics for cholesterol management do not include measurement of LDL-C but focus only on statin treatment.

Delays in lipid measurement and treatment are associated with increased adverse cardiovascular outcomes and greater socioeconomic burden that disproportionately affects women, racial and ethnic minorities, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status, thereby worsening health care inequities.,Standardized quality metrics for measuring and treating all modifiable CVD risk factors, including LDL-C, could not only reduce CVD burden but help reduce disparities in health care. Implementation of lipid measurement metrics has beneficial effects for patients and clinicians including: 1) assessing the efficacy of and response to the prescribed therapeutic regimen; 2) identifying nonadherence and providing the opportunity for open communication regarding nonadherence; and 3) mitigating health care inequities by applying standardized metrics to all patients. Future studies to assess gaps in optimization of lipid and other modifiable CVD risk factors may consider addressing specific factors contributing to clinical inertia in lipid testing and prescription and testing strategies to mitigate them.

The burden of CVD affects every aspect of life—social, emotional, financial, and physical. Optimizing the cardiovascular health of our society remains a priority, and one important way forward is to incorporate into quality metrics the assessment and management of the major modifiable CVD risk factors, including measurement of LDL-C.

Dyslipidemia therapeutic recommendations—statin initiation, monitoring, targets, and escalation: A high-intensity statin should be started along with therapeutic lifestyle changes to attain ≥50% reduction of baseline LDL-C. Lipids should be rechecked within 12 weeks of initiating therapy, and if the LDL-C, or non-HDL-C concentration remains >70 mg/dL or >100 mg/dL, respectively, the statin dose should be increased with the goal of lowering LDL-C to <70 mg/dL and non-HDL-C to <100 mg/dL. If these targets cannot be achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, then these considerations should include a more potent statin or the addition of ezetimibe, and when treatment goals are not met despite these strategies, bempedoic acid, or pharmacotherapy targeting PCSK9 should be considered.

### Statins in acute coronary syndromes: do the guideline recommendations match the evidence? [^eb59fe9f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

On the basis of the evidence obtained from observational studies, randomized controlled trials and their meta-analyses, current guidelines recommend initiating high-dose statin therapy pre-discharge regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Careful review of the evidence indicates that early initiation of high-dose statin therapy reduces recurrent ischemia and may reduce revascularization, but does not confer benefit in terms of hard clinical outcomes such as death or myocardial infarction in any of the randomized controlled trials, and may be associated with increased liver and muscle-related adverse outcomes leading to increased withdrawal and suboptimal long-term adherence. A mortality benefit is apparent in pooled analyses of randomized controlled trials only at long-term (24-month) but not short-term (4-month) follow-up. The critical role of the timing of initiation of therapy (early vs. late) on the benefit-risk profile of statin treatment has not been systematically assessed. It is unclear whether the clinical benefits are attributable to lipid-lowering or lipid-lowering-independent effects. Finally, an optimal LDL threshold for initiating treatment or target LDL level for treatment in ACS remains yet to be defined. On the basis of these observations, and despite a compelling pathophysiologic rationale, the justification for current Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation for statin therapy in patients with ACS remains open to question.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / multisociety cholesterol guideline [^533e7e75]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Methods

A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts was chosen to carry out systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence about the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

Recommendation

The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is still strongly recommended before a decision is made about statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into 4 risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before initiation of statin therapy. Among intermediate-risk patients, identification of risk-enhancing factors and coronary artery calcium testing can assist in the decision to use a statin. Compared with the 2013 guideline, the new guideline gives more attention to percentage reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a treatment goal and to long-term monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. To simplify monitoring, nonfasting lipid measurements are allowed.

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^1e2b08bf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Targeted lipid management is a multistep process in which the post‐MI patient discharged on a statin is required to have their lipid levels followed after a few months of treatment. If LDL‐C levels have not reached guideline‐recommended targets, then statin intensification would be considered. The cycle of lipid remeasurement and dose titration is repeated until the LDL‐C goal is reached, which introduces barriers or delays to treatment intensification. In shifting toward a strategy of treating post‐MI patient populations uniformly with high‐intensity statins, the ACC/AHA guidelines effectively replaced the prior paradigm of tailoring statin dosing to target LDL‐C level goals, thereby reducing the reliance of dose titration on follow‐up lipid testing. These current guidelines may promote a more aggressive approach to lipid management and cardiovascular risk reduction; our study data project that implementation of these guidelines could substantially raise the likelihood of reaching LDL‐C <70 mg/dL. This simplified treatment strategy also streamlines the transition‐of‐care process after hospital discharge and reduces potential therapeutic inertia in responding to lipid test results. Examination of MI patients in the year after the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines already showed an increase in high‐intensity statin use at discharge. Of course, patients discharged on a high‐intensity statin may not necessarily continue on a high‐intensity statin long term. However, prior studies have shown that patients are more likely to be adherent to therapies when these therapies are prescribed at discharge. 25

Pharmacologic treatment of dyslipidemia—ages 11–21 y algorithm and statin considerations: Detailed family history (FHx) and risk factor (RF) assessment are required before initiation of drug therapy. If average LDL–C ≥ 250 mg/dL, consult a lipid specialist. If average LDL–C ≥ 130–250 mg/dL, or non–HDL ≥ 145 mg/dL, refer to dietitian for medical nutrition therapy with Cardiovascular Health Integrated Lifestyle Diet (CHILD 1) → CHILD 2–LDL for 6 months, then repeat a fasting lipid panel (FLP). On repeat FLP: LDL–C < 130 mg/dL, continue CHILD 2–LDL and reevaluate in 12 months; LDL–C ≥ 190 mg/dL, consider initiation of statin therapy per Tables 9–11 and 9–12; LDL–C ≥ 130–189 mg/dL with FHx (+) and no other RF or RC, continue CHILD 2–LDL and reevaluate q. 6 months; LDL–C = 160–189 mg/dL + FHx (+) OR ≥ 1 high-level RF/RC OR ≥ 2 moderate-level RFs/RCs, consider statin therapy per Tables 9–11 and 9–12; LDL–C = 130–159 mg/dL + ≥ 2 high-level RFs/RCs OR 1 high-level + 2 moderate-level RFs/RCs, consider statin therapy per Tables 9–11 and 9–12. Children on statin therapy should be counseled and carefully monitored per Table 9–12. Consideration of drug therapy is based on the average of 2 x FLPs obtained at least 2 weeks but no more than 3 months apart, and if average LDL–C ≥ 190 mg/dL after CHILD 2–LDL and the child is 8–9 years old with (+) FHx or ≥ 1 high-level RF/RC or ≥ 2 moderate-level RFs/RCs, statin therapy may be considered.

HIV—lipid monitoring and lipid screening directives: Lipid screening should be performed in people with HIV (AIII), with a fasting or random lipid profile obtained at entry into care or at the time of ART initiation or modification, and if a random profile is abnormal, a fasting lipid profile should be obtained; lipid levels should be rechecked 3 to 6 months after starting ART or later if viral suppression is not achieved within 6 months, and lipid levels measured after initiation of ART should then be used to calculate an ASCVD risk score and determine indications for statin therapy; among people with HIV who are aged 40 years or older or who are any age and are receiving statin therapy, lipid monitoring should be performed annually, whereas those under age 40 and not receiving statin therapy should have lipid levels monitored every 1 to 3 years, with lipid monitoring occurring more frequently based on lifestyle factors or clinical scenarios, and for those on statin therapy, the approach to monitor lipids at least annually to assess adherence and the need for treatment intensification is consistent with broader cholesterol management guidelines.

### Advanced lipid thinking prior to incorporating advanced lipid testing [^0f9a915a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lipid profiles help estimate patient's short- and long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk over the life course and inform treatment decisions. Advanced lipid testing can provide additional information in selected patients. New 2018 cholesterol guidelines suggest which patients may benefit from additional testing. In patients ages 40-75 years, calculation of a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score begins the clinician-patient risk discussion. In those at intermediate risk (10-year risk 7.5%-19.9%) for future events, inclusion of enhancing factors personalizes the risk decision. The guidelines identify enhancing factors that can support initiating statin therapy. Two advanced lipid tests may be used. Apolipoprotein B levels improve risk estimations and identify genetic disorders in hypertriglyceridemic patients. In patients with a family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, significantly elevated lipoprotein (a) levels may reclassify risk. The decision-making cascade of estimating 10-year risk, personalizing risk status with risk-enhancing factors, and, if appropriate, reclassifying risk with a coronary artery calcium score is advanced lipid thinking that can utilize advanced lipid testing to optimize atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^cafcb52b]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, given the lack of effective targeted pharmacologic therapies in individuals with low HDL-C, lifestyle modifications targeted toward minimizing ASCVD risk are the mainstay of management in these patients. These include regular exercise, attaining ideal body weight, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy diet, all of which also raises HDL-C. Indeed, management of other ASCVD risk factors is important for all individuals with dyslipidemia, including smoking cessation and control of elevated blood pressure and blood glucose.

Pharmacological therapy

The priority of drug therapy is to reduce LDL-C to comply with guideline recommended treatment thresholds or targets. The patient’s level of risk guides the timing of treatment initiation and the intensity of the treatment. In general, drug therapy may be started together with lifestyle intervention in high-risk patients. The response to drug therapy and possible adverse effects should be checked with a repeat lipid profile in about 6 to 8 weeks and recommendations on dose adjustment made at that time. Once drug therapy has been decided upon for ASCVD risk reduction, an LDL-lowering drug is almost always the first step.

LDL-C lowering agents

Statins.

Statins are oral agents that inhibit HMGCR, thus depleting intracellular cholesterol and upregulating the LDL receptor, which in turn increases LDL particle catabolism and lowers plasma LDL-C levels. Statins also have a minor effect on reducing secretion of apo B-containing lipoproteins. This resulting decrease in circulating LDL particles reduces the proportion of plasma cholesterol residing within LDL by 30% to 50% depending on agent, dose, pharmacogenetic factors, and compliance. This in turn reduces exposure of the arterial wall to the deleterious effects of LDL. The definitive meta-analysis of 27 randomized statin trials found that for each 1 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) of LDL-C reduction, there was a significant 9% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 21% reduction in major ASCVD events. Statins are very widely used, are generally well tolerated, and only very rarely cause severe myopathy or hepatic toxicity. About 10% of patients report annoying myalgia symptoms, which can reduce compliance but are reversible and not threatening to health. With high doses of statins, there is a small increased risk of developing diabetes among predisposed individuals who would likely have developed this in any event. Available statins include lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin (Table 8).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Lifestyle intervention and monitoring of response to LDL-C–lowering therapies—For all patient groups, the consensus emphasizes lifestyle modifications (adherence to a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise habits, avoidance of tobacco products, and maintenance of a healthy weight) and that these remain critical components of ASCVD risk reduction, both before and in concert with the use of cholesterol-lowering drug therapies. Dietary adjuncts for lowering atherogenic cholesterol may also be considered for patients with dyslipidemia, including phytosterols and viscous soluble dietary fibers, and referral to a registered dietitian (RD)/registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) may be considered to improve understanding of heart-healthy dietary principles and individualize nutrition recommendations. Adherence to lifestyle modifications should be regularly assessed at the time of initiation or modification of statin therapy and during monitoring of ongoing therapy, and it is critical that the clinician assess and reinforce adherence to intensive lifestyle changes before initiation of these additional agents. For response monitoring, the writing committee recommends the use of an initial fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^02e07cf7]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening and classification of initial lipoprotein lipid levels—In all adults (≥20 years of age), a fasting or nonfasting lipoprotein profile should be obtained at least every 5 years and should include at minimum total cholesterol and HDL-C to allow calculation of non–HDL-C (total-C – HDL-C); if fasting (generally 9–12 hours), the LDL-C level may be calculated provided the triglyceride concentration is <400 mg/dL. If atherogenic cholesterol levels (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) are in the desirable range, lipoprotein lipid measurement and ASCVD risk assessment should be repeated in 5 years, or sooner based on clinical judgment, with earlier rescreening prompted by changes in ASCVD risk factors (including weight gain), a premature ASCVD event in a first-degree relative, evidence of ASCVD in the patient, or a new potential secondary cause of dyslipidemia; for those with atherogenic cholesterol in the desirable range, public health recommendations regarding lifestyle should be emphasized.

### Baseline and on-statin treatment lipoprotein (a) levels for prediction of cardiovascular events: individual patient-data meta-analysis of statin outcome trials [^9dfb8722]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general population studies. However, its contribution to risk for cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease or on statin therapy is uncertain.

Methods

Patient-level data from seven randomised, placebo-controlled, statin outcomes trials were collated and harmonised to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for cardiovascular events, defined as fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease, stroke, or revascularisation procedures. HRs for cardiovascular events were estimated within each trial across predefined lipoprotein(a) groups (15 to <30 mg/dL, 30 to <50 mg/dL, and ≥50 mg/dL, vs <15 mg/dL), before pooling estimates using multivariate random-effects meta-analysis.

Findings

Analyses included data for 29069 patients with repeat lipoprotein(a) measurements (mean age 62 years [SD 8]; 8064 [28%] women; 5751 events during 95576 person-years at risk). Initiation of statin therapy reduced LDL cholesterol (mean change -39% [95% CI -43 to -35]) without a significant change in lipoprotein(a). Associations of baseline and on-statin treatment lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular disease risk were approximately linear, with increased risk at lipoprotein(a) values of 30 mg/dL or greater for baseline lipoprotein(a) and 50 mg/dL or greater for on-statin lipoprotein(a). For baseline lipoprotein(a), HRs adjusted for age and sex (vs <15 mg/dL) were 1·04 (95% CI 0·91-1·18) for 15 mg/dL to less than 30 mg/dL, 1·11 (1·00-1·22) for 30 mg/dL to less than 50 mg/dL, and 1·31 (1·08-1·58) for 50 mg/dL or higher; respective HRs for on-statin lipoprotein(a) were 0·94 (0·81-1·10), 1·06 (0·94-1·21), and 1·43 (1·15-1·76). HRs were almost identical after further adjustment for previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking, systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. The association of on-statin lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular disease risk was stronger than for on-placebo lipoprotein(a) (interaction p=0·010) and was more pronounced at younger ages (interaction p=0·008) without effect-modification by any other patient-level or study-level characteristics.

Interpretation

In this individual-patient data meta-analysis of statin-treated patients, elevated baseline and on-statin lipoprotein(a) showed an independent approximately linear relation with cardiovascular disease risk. This study provides a rationale for testing the lipoprotein(a) lowering hypothesis in cardiovascular disease outcomes trials.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^9f78cada]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The WHO recommends that those with established cardiovascular disease should be treated with lipid-lowering therapy, but there is no specific guidance regarding lipid monitoring. Unnecessary general practitioner visits may be a burden for patients and increase healthcare costs. A systematic review of the current guidelines was performed to reveal gaps in the evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring approaches.

Methods

For this systematic review, a search of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Turning Research Into Practice databases was conducted for relevant guidelines published in the 10 years prior to 31 December 2019. Recommendations surrounding the frequency of testing, lipid-lowering therapies and target cholesterol values were compared qualitatively. Each guideline was assessed using the 2009 Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool.

Results

Twenty-two guidelines were included. All recommended statins as the primary lipid-lowering therapy, with a high level of supporting evidence. Considerable variation was found in the recommendations for cholesterol targets. Seventeen guidelines provided at least one cholesterol target, which for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was <1.8 mmol/L (n=12). For long-term follow-up, many recommended reviewing patients annually (n=9), although there was some variation in recommendations for the interval of between 3 and 12 months. Supporting evidence for any approach was limited, often being derived from clinical opinion.

Conclusions

Further research is required to provide an evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring of the on-statin secondary prevention population.

### Lovastatin [^00854d6d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be obtained prior to initiating therapy with Lovastatin and repeated as clinically indicated.

There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including lovastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with Lovastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart Lovastatin.

The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of lovastatin.

Moderate (less than three times the upper limit of normal) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with lovastatin (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with lovastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and interruption of treatment was not required.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline on pharmacologic management of adults with dyslipidemia [^ce729ee2]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for ASCVD risk assessment—The risk calculator tool is a particularly important aspect of risk factor assessment with greatest utility for individuals at intermediate ASCVD risk where treatment decisions may be uncertain, and it is best used in shared decision-making to decide whether to initiate lipid-lowering medication. This tool should not be widely used when the decision to offer pharmacologic treatment is already supported by clinical findings or assessment, and its applicability is limited in those who have no CVD risk factors; risk calculators should be used before the initiation of treatment, and if a person has not begun pharmacotherapy, repeat calculations can be performed to monitor changes during lifestyle modification. Many risk calculators may not be suitable for individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia; several risk assessment tools are interchangeable and appropriate for routine care, and there are inherent issues with inappropriate use of race in many algorithms. The task force issued a good practice statement recommending the use of a validated ASCVD risk assessment tool to determine an individual’s 10-year ASCVD risk for persons 40 to 79 years of age.

HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) initiation and titration in children and adolescents: Start with the lowest dose once daily, usually at bedtime, and note that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin can be taken in the morning or evening because of their long half-lives. Measure baseline CK, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Whenever potential myopathy symptoms present, stop medication and assess CK; determine relation to recent physical activity, and use the threshold for worrisome level of CK of 10 times above the upper limit of reported normal. After 4 weeks, measure fasting lipid profile (FLP), ALT, and AST; the threshold for worrisome levels of ALT or AST is ≥ 3 times the upper limit of reported normal; target levels for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL–C) are minimal < 130 mg/dL and ideal < 110 mg/dL. If target LDL–C levels are achieved and there are no potential myopathy symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, continue therapy and recheck FLP, ALT, and AST in 8 weeks and then 3 months. If laboratory abnormalities are noted or symptoms are reported, temporarily withhold the medication and repeat the blood work in 2 weeks, restarting when abnormalities resolve with close monitoring. If target LDL–C levels are not achieved, increase the dose by one increment (usually 10 mg) and repeat the blood work in 4 weeks; if still not achieved, dose may be further increased by one increment or another agent (bile acid sequestrant or cholesterol absorption inhibitor) may be added under the direction of a lipid specialist. Check for potential interaction whenever any new medication is initiated.

• Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus. • Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin.

A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. MONITORING RESPONSE TO THERAPY Based on high-quality RCTs, fasting lipid measurement should be repeated four to 12 weeks after starting the statin or making a dose adjustment to assess adherence and response to LDL-C–lowering medications and lifestyle changes. Following that, lipid measurement should be repeated every three to 12 months as needed. Moderate-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years without diabetes who have a 10-year risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% and risk-enhancing factors start or intensify statin therapy. If the CAC score is zero, statin therapy should be withheld or delayed unless the patient is a cigarette smoker, has diabetes, or has a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 suggests statin therapy, particularly for patients 55 years and older.

If the CAC score is 100 or greater or in the 75th percentile or greater, statin therapy is indicated for any patient unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of the physician–patient risk discussion.

### Lipid testing and statin dosing after acute myocardial infarction [^957c4ead]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Some clinicians view the current guidelines as a sledgehammer approach to a nuanced problem. The 2016 ESC/EAS cholesterol guidelines 18 have inspired new momentum to return to pursuing LDL‐C goals, advocating >50% LDL‐C reduction for patients with high or very high cardiovascular disease risk. Arguably, the role of lipid‐level monitoring extends beyond simply assessing progress toward an LDL‐C goal. Regular lipid measurements may help ascertain patient medication adherence, monitor safety of statin treatment, and offer an opportunity to actively educate and engage post‐MI patients in risk factor modification behaviors. Early and routine follow‐up outpatient visits, as required with lipid testing, have been associated with improved adherence to lipid‐lowering therapy. 26, 27 Recent trials have emerged that suggest improved patient outcomes with targeted lipid management. Results from IMPROVE‐IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) demonstrate significant reductions in cardiovascular events when ezetimibe was added to statin therapy to lower LDL‐C levels below previous targets. 28 Novel lipid‐lowering therapies, such as PCSK9 inhibitors, have shown substantial LDL‐C–lowering capability, with imminent outcomes trial results. 29, 30, 31 How these data will influence future guideline updates is unknown, but our results encourage reengineering of clinical processes if we return to a lipid‐level–driven treatment strategy, because only a minority of post‐MI patients actually completed follow‐up lipid testing in routine clinical practice during the time period when this follow‐up was strongly recommended by national guidelines, and the association between lipid testing and therapy intensification was significant but modest.

Follow-up visits for atherogenic cholesterol management—if goal levels have not been achieved, the statin dosage may be increased or the patient might be switched to a more efficacious agent; after an adequate trial of the highest intensity statin therapy tolerated, the clinician may consider referral to a lipid specialist or addition of a second cholesterol-lowering agent. Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

Lipid levels, adherence to statin therapy and lifestyle modification, and adverse events should be monitored regularly for patients who are receiving lipid-lowering agents.

For patients initiating tofacitinib therapy, levels of lipid parameters should be monitored within approximately 4 to 8 weeks of initiating therapy, and the patient should be managed according to current clinical guidelines. Following 8 weeks of tofacitinib induction therapy, lipid levels may be expected to have stabilized due to the effects of therapy on inflammation. Use of lipid panels before treatment initiation or during periods of acute flare may not be informative, due to the effects of acute inflammation in suppressing lipid metabolism leading to low lipid levels. However, for those patients with recognized cardiovascular risk factors, lipid profiles prior to treatment with tofacitinib should be monitored and managed as per applicable clinical guidelines. General recommendations for lipid management in patients with UC initiating tofacitinib therapy are summarized in Fig. 3.

Primary prevention with CAC = 0 AU

A 57-year-old African American female with a history of hyperlipidemia, not currently on therapy, and with well-controlled hypertension on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily presents for her annual primary care visit. Her fasting lipid panel reveals the following:
• LDL-C: 156 mg/dL
• HDL-C: 29 mg/dL
• Triglycerides: 170 mg/dL
• Total cholesterol: 219 mg/dL

Her blood pressure is 130/79 mm Hg, and her hemoglobin A1c is 4.6%. She is a never-smoker, and there is no family history of heart disease. Her primary care physician calculates her 10-year ASCVD risk using the PCE, resulting in a 10.6% estimated risk (PREVENT 10-year risk of CVD 7.1%, ASCVD 4.3%). The patient expresses hesitation about initiating statin therapy. To further refine her risk estimation, a CAC score is obtained, which returns a result of 0 AU.

Discussion

Given this patient's intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk, as calculated by the PCE, and her CAC score of 0, the patient's risk can be further refined. Both the 2018 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines and the 2022 ACC ECDP provide specific guidance for cases where CAC scoring is used to refine risk stratification and guide therapy decisions, particularly when there is patient uncertainty about statin initiation.

For patients with a zero CAC score, considerable evidence suggests low short-term risk of cardiovascular events.Consensus recommendations support that in these cases, statin therapy may be safely deferred if there is absence of severe hyperlipidemia (LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL), diabetes, tobacco use, or family history of premature coronary artery disease. Recommendations support reassessing a CAC score at 3 to 5 years.This is similar to recommendations from the CCS guidelines although no specific guidance on treatment deferral for CAC of 0 is made.Notably, while the ESC guidelines note a low event rate with a CAC score of 0, no comment is made on the impact on treatment.

In summary, for this patient, the CAC score of 0 shifts her risk profile into a low-risk category. Given the excellent short-term prognosis, statin therapy can be safely deferred with interval testing of her lipids and CAC score.

National Lipid Association Chart 4—statin intolerance, monitoring, and advanced measures: In patients with statin intolerance, strategies such as limiting the daily dosage and modified regimens may be considered, and if the patient still cannot tolerate the statin, a nonstatin drug alone or in combination with another cholesterol-lowering agent may be considered. Glucose or glycated hemoglobin should be checked before initiation of statin therapy and within 1 y afterward in those with diabetes risk factors. For selected patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, an alternative goal is to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels by at least 50%, and LDL apheresis may be considered for selected patients. Very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered for patients with progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events, despite receiving high-intensity statin therapy, and other potential causes should also be investigated and nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled.

Dyslipidemia/Lipid Management

Screening

In most adult patients, measure fasting lipid profile at least annually. In adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol >50 mg/dl, and triglycerides <150 mg/dl), lipid assessments may be repeated every 2 years. (E)

Treatment recommendations and goals

Lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes. (A)
Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients: with overt CVD (A) without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factors. (A)
For patients at lower risk than those mentioned above (e.g. without overt CVD and under the age of 40 years), statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains above 100 mg/dl or in those with multiple CVD risk factors (E)
In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). (A)
In individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of <70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option. (B)
If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A)
Triglyceride levels <150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol >40 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) in men and >50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) in women are desirable. However, LDL cholesterol–targeted statin therapy remains the preferred strategy. (C)
If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but has not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy. (E)

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^1f8e2207]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association recommendations—patient-centered dyslipidemia management: An Expert Panel developed a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. Major conclusions include that an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, and that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies. The intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient’s absolute risk for an ASCVD event, and because atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting in a clinical ASCVD event, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies. For patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD.

Benefits of lipid monitoring at the clinician level—ordering lipid panels was associated with reduced therapeutic inertia: among 1,061,753 Veterans Affairs patients with ASCVD, those with 1 or more panels had more medication intensification than those with none (9.3% vs 5.4%; P < .001), and among ASCVD patients not on a statin, statin initiation was higher with 1 or more panels (21.5% vs 8.7%; P < .001); in multivariable-adjusted analyses, performance of lipid panels was independently associated with treatment intensification in a dose-dependent manner. After an ASCVD hospitalization in 2016–2017, postevent LDL-C testing was associated with intensification (16.1% vs 10.7%; odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.29–1.76, P <0.001). In an urban medical center, treatment intensification rates increased with more lipid panels (6.6%, 9.2%, 12.2%, and 22.4% for 0, 1, 2, or ≥2 panels), with adjusted odds of 1.51 (1.16–1.97), 2.09 (1.61–2.71), and 4.37 (3.37–5.67) versus no panels.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.) and incurs significant cost to the healthcare system. Management of cholesterol remains central for ASCVD prevention and has been the focus of multiple national guidelines. In this review, we compare the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Cholesterol guidelines. We review the evidence base that was used to generate recommendations focusing on 4 distinct themes: 1) the threshold of absolute 10-year ASCVD risk to start a clinician-patient discussion for the initiation of statin therapy in primary prevention patients; 2) the utility of coronary artery calcium score to guide clinician-patient risk discussion pertaining to the initiation of statin therapy for primary ASCVD prevention; 3) the use of moderate versus high-intensity statin therapy in patients with established ASCVD; and 4) the utility of ordering lipid panels after initiation or intensification of lipid lowering therapy to document efficacy and monitor adherence to lipid lowering therapy. We discuss why the VA/DoD and AHA/ACC may have reached different conclusions on these key issues.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: synopsis of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^6ed7724e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

Methods

In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

Recommendations

This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in 8 areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### Cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes following statin initiation for primary prevention: a cohort study [^2e7a9ba0]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The residual risk of incomplete control of non-HDL-C in the context of controlled LDL-C has been explored by 2 recent studies in Denmark. One study of 13,015 statin-treated patients from the general population found that a non-HDL-C above the sample median was associated with residual risk of mortality and MI even with LDL-C below median.In secondary prevention, a cohort study conducted in Denmark found that among persons with LDL-C at target (≤70 mg/dL [1.8 mmol/L]), a non-HDL-C ≥97 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) was associated with increased risk of MI, ASCVD, and death.To our knowledge, no studies have explored guideline-directed non-HDL-C thresholds after statin initiation and the association with incident CV events in primary prevention. Thus, our findings add to existing literature.

There remains debate around a treat-to-target approach vs simply initiating a moderate or high-intensity statin depending on CV risk. The Canadian Patients Experience Evidence Research (PEER) simplified lipid guidelinerecommends against repeat lipid testing and use of lipid targets/thresholds, and U.S. guidelines moved away from lipid targets in 2013 with more recent guidelines incorporating percent LDL-C lowering.In 2023, the U.S. National Lipid Association and American Society for Preventive Cardiology advocated for use of LDL-C targets.A treat-to-target approach is centered around analyses that show lower risk of CV events with lower achieved LDL-C levels in statin randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There is a lack of RCT evidence demonstrating whether targeting specific lipid levels is superior to simply initiating statins in primary prevention. Among patients with coronary artery disease, a 2023 RCTfound that a treat-to-target approach was noninferior to high-dose statins in reducing risk of adverse CV events. It is argued that a treat-to-target approach may allow for tailored therapy (eg, use of moderate dose statins to achieve lipid targets in patients at >20% 10-year CVD risk). While our study cannot show which approach is best, we found that 20% to 30% of patients remain above guideline-directed thresholds for intensification with initial statin therapy and that there is an associated risk of adverse CV events associated with this. Given a small portion were on high-intensity statins, increasing statin doses could be considered without the need for a second agent.

### Hyperlipidemia: drugs for cardiovascular risk reduction in adults [^059e1339]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) indicate that lipid-lowering drugs have benefit for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. The evidence is strongest for statins. ACC/AHA, NICE, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend statin therapy based on patients' risk of an ASCVD event, rather than treating to specific lipid levels. For patients with no previous ASCVD event, risk calculators should be used to determine the 10-year risk of ASCVD. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends starting moderate- to high-intensity statins if the risk is 7.5% or greater, whereas the NICE and USPSTF guidelines recommend statins if the risk is 10% or greater. Patients with known ASCVD should receive high-intensity statins unless they fall into special categories (e.g., older age) or do not tolerate high-intensity statins, in which case moderate-intensity statins are appropriate. Liver transaminase levels should be checked before starting statins; guidelines vary on if and when to recheck them in the absence of symptoms. Lipid levels should be rechecked one to three months after starting statins, although guidelines differ on subsequent checks. Other lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe) can be considered if patients do not tolerate statins. Niacin should not be used. Some evidence supports adding ezetimibe to statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease. The role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors is unclear, but initial studies suggest a decrease in the rate of acute ASCVD events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

### A critical appraisal of lipid management in the post-statin era: comparison on guidelines, therapeutic targets, and screening in a case-based framework of lipid management [^1604ee85]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Key considerations

• Role of CAC score and Lp(a) in risk assessment: The absence of CAC in this patient reduces his short-term risk of ASCVD events, as individuals with a CAC score of 0 generally have a low risk of cardiovascular events over the next 5 to 10 years.However, elevated Lp(a) is associated with the development of noncalcified, vulnerable plaques, which may pose a risk that CAC scoring alone cannot capture. Lp(a) is an independent predictor of ASCVD, even in the absence of calcified plaque. Therefore, it warrants careful consideration in long-term risk stratification.
• Additional risk factors to consider: Given the borderline 10-year ASCVD risk (6.6%) and the presence of 2 risk-enhancing factors—elevated Lp(a) and a family history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD)—additional markers could be considered to further refine risk: 1) High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): Elevated levels of hs-CRP can indicate systemic inflammation, which may provide insights into the patient's atherosclerotic risk. 2) ApoB: Measuring ApoB could give a more accurate assessment of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, complementing traditional LDL-C measurements. 3) Ankle-Brachial Index: A simple, noninvasive test that may identify subclinical peripheral arterial disease. 4) Metabolic syndrome: Assessing for components of metabolic syndrome, such as increased waist circumference or elevated fasting glucose, could help guide management.
• Management strategy: Despite the low CAC score, the patient's elevated Lp(a) and family history suggest an elevated lifetime risk of ASCVD, justifying consideration of pharmacotherapy. The primary goals are to reduce LDL-C levels and overall cardiovascular risk.

Pharmacologic therapy

• Statin therapy: Initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy is reasonable, with the aim of lowering LDL-C by at least 30% or achieving LDL-C levels below 100 mg/dL. Statins are the first-line treatment in this case, given their proven efficacy in reducing ASCVD risk, even in patients with normal or low CAC scores.
• Lp(a) monitoring: While elevated Lp(a) is a risk-enhancing factor, it does not necessitate serial monitoring after the initial measurement. The primary focus of treatment is the management of modifiable risk factors, particularly LDL-C, as current therapies do not specifically target Lp(a).

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy—NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that “little evidence is available from RCTs” to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; “very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered,” although “this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence.” Additional evaluation “such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted,” and “nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients.”

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and lipid management in diabetes mellitus—persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D) without ASCVD and with less than 2 traditional risk factors should be assessed with one of the ASCVD risk calculators to determine initiation and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy, and clinicians should assess nontraditional ASCVD risk factors beyond a lipid panel to guide management when the initial shared decision is not self-evident. Manage persons with prediabetes and persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the age of 40 in the same manner as those with T2D. In persons with high ASCVD risk, use a moderate-intensity statin regardless of DM type or status; in very high ASCVD risk (including family history of premature ASCVD in men <55 y and women <65 y), use a high-intensity statin regardless of baseline LDL-C level, and for extreme risk use a high-intensity statin plus other therapies as needed to achieve lipid targets. Treatment targets are specified by risk: high (LDL-C <100 mg/dL, apolipoprotein B [apo B] <90 mg/dL, non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL), very high (LDL-C <70 mg/dL, apo B <80 mg/dL, non-HDL-C <100 mg/dL), and extreme (LDL-C <55 mg/dL, apo B <70 mg/dL, non-HDL-C <90 mg/dL). Statins are recommended for the initial treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Monitor efficacy every 6 to 12 wk and increase the dose or intensity of statin as needed to achieve goals; once targets are achieved, lipid panel or apo B can be monitored less often. Combining the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe with a statin may be considered when the desired lipid targets are not achieved with a maximally tolerated statin dose; alternately add bempedoic acid or consider adding icosapent ethyl (in persons with triglycerides 135 to 499 mg/dL) for ASCVD risk reduction. Management of hypertriglyceridemia in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk should begin with intensive lifestyle modification and statin therapy; in those on a maximally tolerated statin who have triglyceride concentrations ≥200 mg/dL and HDL-C <40 mg/dL, add a fibrate or high-dose omega-3 fatty acid to achieve the desired apo B or non-HDL-C goal, and icosapent ethyl can be considered in persons with high or very high ASCVD risk.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^9693b0f3]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally.The positive correlation between the incidence of CVD and levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration has been well-established.Statins are recognised as being effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of future CVD events for both primary or secondary prevention.

Following a meta-analysis of cholesterol treatment trials,the percentage reductions in LDL-C achieved by specific statins (and their doses) have been established from the data of patients in whom statins reduced CVD events. Accordingly, national guidelines in the USA and UK recommend intended LDL-C reduction targets for statin therapy to reduce CVD.The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines suggested a fixed dose (or intensity) of statin for each risk category, with an intended LDL-C reduction of 30–49% and ≥50% for moderate and high intensity statins, respectively.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK aim for >40% reduction in non-HDL-C.

Both individual biological and genetic variability in LDL-C response to statin therapy,as well as variation in adherence, have been identified.However, there is limited evidence on variation in LDL-C response in the general population for patients initiated on statins for primary prevention of CVD.

In this large, prospective open population cohort study, we sought to assess differences in LDL-C response in primary care patients initiated on statins and their impact on future CVD events.

### Optimizing lipid management in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^94254958]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

According to the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III), patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dL should be discharged on lipid-lowering therapy. When LDL cholesterol levels are between 100 and 129 mg/dL, evaluation of ratios of LDL cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol may provide additional insight into a patient's risk status. Patients who were using statin therapy before admission for an acute coronary syndrome should be continued on lipid-lowering therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2002 guideline update for management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction recommends statin therapy at discharge as a class I indication, level of evidence A. Furthermore, studies confirm that statin therapy begun early during hospitalization can prevent ischemic events in patients who are treated by an invasive strategy and those who are treated only by a medical strategy. However, studies suggest that patient compliance with a statin regimen after discharge is far from optimal. There are 2 programs available to help ensure that appropriate patients receive and continue taking lipid-lowering therapy. These programs are the Cardiac Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) and the Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP).

Statins and new-onset diabetes—risk characterization and monitoring guidance are provided: Clinical trial data suggest a modest, but statistically significant, increase in new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, yet the well-established benefits of statin therapy outweigh this risk; the Panel did not recommend changes to clinical practice other than measuring glycated hemoglobin or fasting glucose prior to and within 1 year of statin initiation in those with diabetes risk factors, the risk seems greater for intensive-dosage statin therapy and most evident in those with major risk factors for diabetes, and clinicians should be vigilant in screening and monitoring for worsening glycemia in South Asian patients given statin therapy.
