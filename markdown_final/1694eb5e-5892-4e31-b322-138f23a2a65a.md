## Question

Can marijuana be present in your urine drug screen through secondhand smoke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can result in a positive urine drug screen and how to interpret that. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological plausibility of THC uptake from passive exposure. Then, I should verify the epidemiologic evidence linking in-home smoking to urinary cannabinoids. Next, I will examine the specific biomarkers detected and their detection limits. After that, I need to consider the clinical context and testing methodology, including cutoffs and confirmation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical conclusion and counseling points, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. THC is present in cannabis smoke and can be absorbed via inhalation. Metabolites such as 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (COOH-THC), 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (OH-THC), and Δ9-THC itself are measurable in urine after exposure, which makes passive uptake and detection biologically plausible in secondhand smoke scenarios [^115wTKEU] [^114MVU5P].

> Next, I should review the epidemiologic evidence. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of association. In a large cross-sectional study of 275 children, the odds of detectable urinary cannabinoids were about five times higher in households with reported in-home cannabis smoking compared with households without, and each additional daily cannabis smoking event increased the odds by a factor of 2.5, indicating a dose-response relationship consistent with passive exposure rather than random chance or reporting bias alone [^113FoiBX] [^114ztKu2] [^115Nczyn].

> I will now examine the biomarkers and detection limits. Modern LC-MS/MS assays can detect very low concentrations of THC, OH-THC, and COOH-THC, with limits of detection around 0.005 ng/mL. In exposed children, COOH-THC has been detected in the 0.03–1.5 ng/mL range, and pooled total THC equivalents (TTE) have averaged around 0.13 nmol/L, which are far below typical immunoassay cutoffs but clearly above analytical detection thresholds, supporting true exposure rather than analytical noise [^114MVU5P] [^1172vSU9] [^112Uzzf8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical interpretation. I need to check the testing context and cutoffs. Workplace and many clinical immunoassays commonly use a 50 ng/mL screening cutoff for THC metabolites, with confirmatory GC-MS at 15 ng/mL; passive exposure generally yields levels in the low ng/mL or sub-ng/mL range, so routine screens are unlikely to be positive from secondhand smoke alone, though highly sensitive research assays will detect exposure, and chronic heavy users can remain positive for weeks, complicating timing inference [^114Nv9tv] [^1172vSU9] [^1151cDzW].

> But wait, what if the exposure is intense or prolonged. Let me consider dose and environment. Higher frequency of in-home smoking, poor ventilation, and proximity increase exposure; children in attached housing where smoking is allowed have higher detection rates, and experimental data show that even brief secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can acutely impair vascular endothelial function, reinforcing that biological uptake occurs and that exposure intensity matters for both biomarker levels and potential health effects [^116U94ij] [^116xtJEP] [^1143Exkg].

> I should double-check the clinical implications. A positive urine cannabinoid test does not prove impairment or recent use; it only indicates prior exposure within the drug's detection window, which is longer for chronic users and varies by matrix and assay. Therefore, if a patient with minimal risk has a low-level positive, especially on a highly sensitive assay, secondhand exposure becomes a credible explanation, whereas a high-level positive or a positive on a standard workplace screen more strongly suggests direct use and warrants confirmatory testing and clinical correlation [^116AtaWF] [^116qrZiC] [^111wvn9u].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. Yes, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable urinary cannabinoids, particularly with sensitive methods, but routine clinical or workplace immunoassays are unlikely to be positive from passive exposure alone. Interpretation should integrate the quantitative level, assay characteristics, timing, and the patient's history, and unexpected positives should be confirmed with definitive methods before making clinical or forensic conclusions [^113FoiBX] [^114MVU5P] [^111ffj2E].

> Finally, I should confirm practical counseling. For patients concerned about passive exposure, advise avoiding enclosed spaces where cannabis is being smoked, improving ventilation, and advocating for smoke-free home policies. For clinicians facing unexpected cannabinoid positives, consider secondhand exposure as a plausible contributor when levels are low and the history fits, and confirm with definitive testing before labeling use, especially in sensitive contexts such as pediatrics, pregnancy, or occupational health [^114Eq6Mk] [^1143Exkg] [^111ffj2E].

---

Yes, secondhand marijuana smoke can cause a positive urine drug screen, but only under specific conditions: **prolonged exposure in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces** and use of **high-sensitivity assays** [^114MVU5P] [^115Nczyn]. Routine workplace or clinical immunoassays (typically 50 ng/mL cutoffs) are unlikely to detect passive exposure unless exposure is extreme and recent [^114Nv9tv]. If passive exposure is suspected, confirmatory testing with LC-MS/MS can detect lower levels of THC metabolites, but results should be interpreted cautiously and in context [^114MVU5P] [^111wvn9u].

---

## Evidence of secondhand marijuana smoke exposure

Several studies have documented **measurable THC metabolites in urine** following passive exposure:

- **Pediatric studies**: Children exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke in the home had detectable urinary THC metabolites, with detection rates ranging from 16% to 46% depending on exposure intensity and assay sensitivity [^1172vSU9] [^116U94ij] [^1157SkF3].

- **Adult studies**: Controlled studies show that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of marijuana smoke in enclosed spaces can result in detectable urinary THC metabolites, particularly with sensitive analytical methods [^116xtJEP].

---

## Factors influencing detection

Several factors influence whether **secondhand marijuana smoke exposure** results in a positive urine drug screen:

| **Factor** | **Influence on detection** |
|-|-|
| Exposure intensity and duration | Prolonged exposure in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces increases detection likelihood [^115Nczyn] [^114ztKu2] |
| Ventilation | Poor ventilation significantly increases detection risk [^notfound] |
| Proximity to smokers | Closer proximity increases exposure and detection likelihood [^113mfELs] |
| Sensitivity of analytical method | High-sensitivity assays (e.g. LC-MS/MS) detect lower levels of THC metabolites than standard immunoassays [^114MVU5P] [^114Nv9tv] |

---

## Detection windows and analytical methods

The detection window for THC metabolites in urine varies with **analytical method** and **exposure level**:

- **Standard immunoassays**: Typically detect THC metabolites at or above 50 ng/mL, suitable for detecting recent active use but generally insensitive to low-level passive exposure [^114Nv9tv].

- **High-sensitivity assays (LC-MS/MS)**: Can detect THC metabolites at levels as low as 0.005 ng/mL, capable of identifying low-level passive exposure under specific conditions [^114MVU5P].

- **Detection window**: For passive exposure, THC metabolites are typically detectable for 1–3 days, depending on exposure intensity and individual metabolism [^notfound].

---

## Clinical and legal implications

Passive exposure leading to a positive urine drug screen has **important clinical and legal implications**:

- **Clinical interpretation**: Clinicians should consider passive exposure when interpreting unexpected positive results, particularly in non-smokers or individuals in environments with known marijuana use [^115Nczyn].

- **Legal considerations**: Legal systems may need to account for passive exposure when interpreting drug test results, especially in child custody cases or workplace testing scenarios [^117RqVzx].

---

## Recommendations for minimizing false positives

To minimize the risk of **false positives** from passive exposure:

- **Improve ventilation**: Ensure adequate ventilation in areas where marijuana is smoked [^notfound].

- **Limit exposure**: Avoid prolonged exposure to marijuana smoke, particularly in enclosed spaces [^115Nczyn].

- **Use confirmatory testing**: Employ high-sensitivity confirmatory testing (e.g. LC-MS/MS) when passive exposure is suspected [^111ffj2E].

---

Secondhand marijuana smoke can cause a positive urine drug screen, but this typically requires **prolonged exposure in enclosed, poorly ventilated spaces** and the use of **high-sensitivity assays**. Routine immunoassays are unlikely to detect passive exposure unless it is extreme and recent.

### Ischemic stroke after use of the synthetic marijuana "spice" [^112WuL9N]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report and associate acute cerebral infarctions in 2 young, previously healthy siblings with use of the street drug known as "spice" (a synthetic marijuana product, also known as "K2"), which they independently smoked before experiencing acute embolic-appearing ischemic strokes.

Methods

We present history, physical examination, laboratory data, cerebrovascular imaging, echocardiogram, ECG, and hospital course of these patients.

Results

We found that in both siblings spice was obtained from the same source. The drug was found to contain the schedule I synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018. Full stroke workup was unrevealing of a stroke etiology; urine drug screen was positive for marijuana.

Conclusions

We found that our 2 patients who smoked the street drug spice had a temporal association with symptoms of acute cerebral infarction. This association may be confounded by contaminants in the product consumed (i.e., marijuana or an unidentified toxin) or by an unknown genetic mechanism. The imaging of both patients suggests an embolic etiology, which is consistent with reports of serious adverse cardiac events with spice use, including tachyarrhythmias and myocardial infarctions.

Analytical methods for biomarkers of SHSe

Choosing a laboratory for analysis should occur early in a study to assure that the collection protocol is suited to the assay. Analysis actually begins with sampling, and the collection protocol may have significant implications for subsequent assays. Analytical methods include radioimmunoassay, ELISA, gas chromatography (GC)-nitrogen-phosphorous detection (NPD), GC-thermal energy analysis (GC-TEA), GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography (LC)-electrochemical detection (ECD), LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and GC-MS/MS(table 2).

Table 2
Analytical methods for measurement of biomarkers of secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe)

Urine nicotine and metabolites

Urine cotinine is a widely used biomarker of SHSe, with the sum of free cotinine and cotinine glucuronide (conjugated) resulting in higher concentrations in some studies. For comparison purposes, researchers must consider whether free cotinine or total (free plus conjugated) cotinine was measured. Free cotinine is preferable to use as it correlates better with plasma cotinine than total cotinine. Current state-of-the-art methods are GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.05 ng/ml, a sensitivity concentration needed in countries with low SHSe due to clean air regulations and lower air nicotine concentrations.

The advantages of determining SHSe with urine are that cotinine concentrations and other metabolites are higher than in other biological fluids; it represents relatively acute exposure; and collection is non-invasive. Disadvantages include the facilities for privacy during collection, difficulty collecting in population-based or children studies, variability in cotinine conversion factor and needing to adjust for creatinine clearance (data on renal diseases and prescription drugs that interfere with metabolism and renal secretion).

### Secondhand marijuana exposure in a convenience sample of young children in New York city [^116U94ij]. Pediatric Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Biomarkers of exposure to marijuana smoke can be detected in the urine of children with exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke, but the prevalence is unclear.

Methods

We studied children between the ages of 0 to 3 years who were coming in for well-child visits or hospitalized on the inpatient general pediatric unit between 2017 and 2018 at Kravis Children's Hospital at Mount Sinai. Parents completed an anonymous survey, and urine samples were analyzed for cotinine and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (COOH-THC), a metabolite of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol.

Results

Fifty-three children had urine samples available for analysis. COOH-THC was detectable in 20.8% of the samples analyzed and urinary cotinine was detectable in 90.2%. High levels of tobacco exposure (defined as cotinine ≥ 2.0ng/ml) were significantly associated with COOH-THC detection (p < 0.01). We found that 34.8% of children who lived in attached housing where smoking was allowed within the property had detectable COOH-THC compared to 13.0% of children who lived in housing where smoking was not allowed at all.

Conclusions

This study adds to the growing evidence that children are being exposed to marijuana smoke, even in places where recreational marijuana use is illegal. It is critical that more research be done on the impact of marijuana smoke exposure on children's health and development.

Impact

We found that 20.8% of the 53 children recruited from Mount Sinai Hospital had detectable marijuana metabolites in their urine. Children with household tobacco smoke exposure and children who lived in attached housing where smoking was allowed on the premises were more likely to have detectable marijuana smoke metabolites. This study adds to the growing evidence that children are being exposed to marijuana smoke, even in places where marijuana remains illegal by state law. As states consider marijuana legalization, it is critical that the potential adverse health effects from marijuana exposure in children be taken into account.

### Differential effects of electronic hookah vaping and traditional combustible hookah smoking on oxidation, inflammation, and arterial stiffness [^114sd98z]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

The study population included healthy young habitual hookah smokers between 21 and 39 years of age who do not smoke cigarettes and met the following criteria: (1) no evidence of cardiopulmonary disease by history or physical examination; (2) BP < 140/90 mm Hg; (3) BMI of > 18.50 kg/m 2 and < 30 kg/m 2; (4) resting heart rate of < 100 beats/min; (5) take no prescription medication; (6) not pregnant (confirmed by urine test) or breastfeeding; (7) have smoked hookah at least 12 times in the past 12 months; (8) have not smoked cigarettes in the past 12 months, smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes, or both; (9) have not smoked marijuana in the past 12 months and showed negative results on a urine tetrahydrocannabinol screen; and (10) end-expiratory CO of < 10 parts per million before the study (evidence for no recent or current combusted tobacco exposure).

All participants agreed to fast for 8 h and abstain from exercise, antioxidants, caffeine, and alcohol for 48 h before the study. Participants were instructed not to smoke or vape e-hookah or any other electronic nicotine device, including e-cigarettes, and to avoid exposure to any secondhand smoke for 72 h before the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Institutional Review Board 3 (Identifier: 18–001559), and informed written consent was obtained from all participants.

### Screening for unhealthy drug use: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116QVjKp]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Unhealthy drug use — psychosocial interventions in adults showed significant abstinence effects for cannabis but not for stimulants or mixed drug use, with follow-up ranging from 3 to 4 months to 12 or more months and assessment completion rates of thirty-eight percent to 98%. Effects were statistically significant for abstinence from cannabis use at 3 to 4 months (7 trials; RR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.51–3.07]) and at 6 to 12 months (4 trials; RR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.17–3.06]), while evidence on health, social, or legal outcomes in adults was sparse and showed no or limited effectiveness.

### Three cases of "spice" exposure [^111D5gaN]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

We describe three cases with confirmed exposure to "spice" by detection of the metabolites JWH-018 and/or JWH-073 in urine. All cases had a negative urine drug screen. Case 1. A 25-year-old male with possible seizure, tachycardia, acidosis, and unresponsiveness, presented to a local emergency department (ED) after smoking a "spice" product. His symptoms resolved with benzodiazepines, fluid, and observation. His urine tested positive for JWH-018 and negative for JWH-073 metabolites. Case 2. A 21-year-old male was found unresponsive after smoking "spice". He had hypertension, was agitated, and had a Glasgow Coma Score of 7; the patient was intubated. The skin was warm and dry. His symptoms resolved with IV fluids and he was discharged home after 24 h. His urine tested positive for metabolites of JWH-018 and JWH-073. Case 3. A 19-year-old male was brought to the ED 1 h after smoking a "spice" product and having paranoia and delusions. His urine tested positive for JWH-018 and JWH-073 metabolites. He was discharged asymptomatic after observation for a few hours.

Discussion

Spice products are new and abused for their psychogenic effects and mood alteration. These cases exhibited changes consistent with either an anticholinergic or sympathomimetic agent that resolved following general supportive care.

### Screening for unhealthy drug use: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114K4RH1]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force screening for unhealthy drug use — adults: The USPSTF recommends screening by asking questions about unhealthy drug use in adults 18 years or older, and screening should be implemented when services for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate care can be offered or referred; screening refers to asking questions about unhealthy drug use, not testing biological specimens, and this is a B recommendation.

Second, the quantitative level of THC‐COOH in urine can be obtained to corroborate self‐reported continuous abstinence. It also predicts withdrawal symptoms, CUD severity, tolerance to the acute effects of cannabis and level of cognitive impairment. The level of THC‐COOH in urine can also be used to confirm regular cannabis use status in chronic users, where residual circulating levels of cannabinoids from chronic use can be detected up to 4 weeks after last use. Therefore, the level of THC‐COOH in urine is recommended for use in experimental, neuroimaging and cognitive studies as a way of corroborating current cannabis use or abstinence. It can also be used to examine the quantity of THC exposure such as in clinical trials of CUD. It cannot sensitively measure the duration of abstinence because of the long half‐life of THC and individual differences in metabolism. Its major limitations are that it requires access and costs of laboratory facilities and analyses, it requires multiple samples and creatinine normalisation for reliable testing and does not offer an immediate test result, unlike rapid, qualitative testing. Therefore, it is particularly well suited to research settings where detailed assessment of cannabis exposure is required. Often, drug testing programs will integrate the use of both qualitative and quantitative urine THC‐COOH testing.

Third, the quantitative level of THC in saliva is a proxy of recent cannabis exposure that has been associated with cognitive function and driving performance. Limitations of this measure include uncertainty of time of last exposure and risk of contamination of the buccal area (e.g. food). It may be used in experimental, neuroimaging and cognitive studies investigating how recent cannabis use affects acute drug effects, brain function and cognition.

Fourth, THC, THC‐COOH or 11‐OH‐THC in plasma provide precise and reliable quantitation of THC consumption and metabolism. Measuring these involves taking a blood sample and quantifying THC or its metabolites either in that sample, or using a centrifuge to extract plasma for analysis. As a more invasive measure, it may reduce compliance levels. It is recommended for use in settings where rigorous checking of THC and other cannabinoid levels is required. THC in plasma can be used to confirm recent exposure to THC in experimental studies with acute cannabinoid administration. Interpretation of results showing THC levels in blood can be more complicated in sober chronic users and people exposed to environmental cannabis smoke.

### Clearing up the smoke: physical and mental health considerations regarding cannabis use in adolescents with cystic fibrosis [^114W68jH]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should never assume whether a patient is using or not using cannabis. Screening can be an effective, nonjudgmental way to routinely elicit information about cannabis use that can also be explored further in the clinical interview. The AAP encourages primary care clinicians to follow the screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment model and recommends universal screening for substance use with adolescents. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has launched two brief online screening tools, Screening to Brief Intervention (S2BI) tool and Brief Screener for Tobacco, Alcohol and other Drugs (BSTAD) to assess to for substance use disorder risk among adolescents 12–17 years old. Clinicians can access S2BI viaand to BSTAD via. Routine urine drug screening is not advised, as the relative utility and yield is low. Urine testing can be further stigmatizing for youth who are not prepared to discuss or disclose their cannabis use and can result in avoidance or disengagement from treatment.

Education directed toward the child should be developmentally appropriate and collaborative. Discussion should be provided at a time and in a setting where the child feels safe and can pay full attention to the conversation. Careful use of language is important to support dialogue, foster understanding, and enhance patient engagement. Using language that is simple, succinct, familiar, and nonthreatening can significantly contribute to improved interactions with the adolescent patient. Educational interventions should be geared to the literacy level, preferred language, level of education attainment, and baseline understanding of the caregiver. Equally important is empowering families with the necessary information and tools to have thoughtful, nonconfrontational conversations with their adolescent. It can be helpful to ask, in advance, the caregiver's understanding of the adolescent's CF status and its cares, as well as their understanding of their child's use of cannabis and its impacts on CF. This will then guide what content should be delivered and focused on. It can be helpful to then ask the adolescent and/or the family for permission to share information with them so they may serve as active, rather than passive, participants in receiving information. Checking for understanding after sharing communications can ensure that the adolescent and/or the family and the clinician have a shared understanding of the factors influencing the adolescent's presentation and care. Further resources for clinicians, families, and teachers are freely available and can be reviewed through NIDA.

### Prevalence and factors associated with self-reported exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke in the United States and Canada in 2019 [^1143Exkg]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Little is known about exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke (SHCS) among residents of detached single-family homes and multiunit housing (MUH). Using data from the 2019 International Cannabis Policy Study, the prevalence of (a) self-reported exposure to SHCS at home (n = 33,024) and (b) self-reported SHCS incursions into MUH (defined as SHCS from another unit/the outdoors, n = 15,634) was estimated in (1) Canada; (2) US states where non-medical cannabis use was legal, and (3) US states where it remained illegal. Factors associated with exposures and incursions were assessed using weighted logistic regression. Overall, 16.9% of residents in Canada, 20.6% in US legal states, and 15.5% in US illegal states reported exposure to SHCS in their homes at least once in the previous month. One quarter (25.7%) of Canadian MUH residents, 26.6% from US legal states, and 20.1% from US illegal states reported at least monthly incursions. Sociodemographic factors associated with incursions suggested MUH residents reporting incursions lived in qualitatively different MUH than those not reporting incursions. Irrespective of the legality of non-medical cannabis use, smoke-free policies in MUH should protect residents from involuntary exposure to all types of secondhand smoke.

### Assessing secondhand smoke using biological markers [^113mfELs]. Tobacco Control (2013). Low credibility.

Selection of biomarkers of SHSe

Selection of a SHSe biomarker depends on the scientific or public health question of interest, study design and setting, subjects, funding and laboratory access (figure 1). Novel biomarkers under development for use in highly controlled settings, such as chamber studies of exposures to volunteers, are not discussed here.

Figure 1
Types of study designs and biomarker use. NHANES, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; SHS, secondhand smoke.

Nicotine and metabolites

Nicotine is present in substantial concentrations in virtually all tobacco products and in insignificant amounts in some foods. Nicotine is extensively metabolised, primarily in the liver, and its major proximate metabolite is cotinine: on average, 75% of nicotine is converted to cotinine, primarily by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2A6. Cotinine's half-life (t 1/2), the time in which its concentration halves, is longer (average: 16 h) than nicotine's (2 h). Cotinine concentrations are more stable throughout the day, making it the preferred blood, saliva and urine biomarker for SHSe (table 1). Blood's cotinine concentrations and saliva are highly correlated. Urine cotinine concentrations average fourfold to sixfold higher than those in blood or saliva, making urine a more sensitive matrix to detect low-concentration exposure. Six metabolites (nicotine, cotinine and trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (3-HC) and their respective glucuronide conjugates) account for about 85% to 90% of a nicotine dose, and the sum of these metabolites in urine provides an approximate estimate of daily nicotine intake.

Considerable between-individual variability exists in the rate and pattern of nicotine metabolism, possibly affecting cotinine concentration resulting from a given nicotine exposure. Factors influencing nicotine metabolism can include genetic variation, race, gender, oral contraceptive use or other oestrogen-containing hormones, kidney failure and drugs, including anticonvulsants and rifampin. Cotinine concentrations in biofluids and nicotine in hair are generally higher in infants and children, compared to SHS-exposed adults; this is probably due to greater inhaled nicotine doses (closer proximity to smokers and higher minute ventilation per body mass) and slower cotinine metabolism.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^117PxL3x]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine testing for specific substances — addiction treatment emphasizes that urine testing for the use of alcohol is appropriate with current clinical tools and that EtG is an appropriate target metabolite when monitoring a patient for complete alcohol abstinence; ethanol-containing products, including hand sanitizers and mouthwash, should be avoided before an EtG test; urine testing is helpful when assessing amphetamine use and particular caution should be paid to the interpretation of amphetamine immunoassays due to known limitations in specificity; urine testing is helpful when assessing benzodiazepine use and particular caution should be paid to the interpretation of benzodiazepine immunoassays due to known limitations in specificity; immunoassay results should be used cautiously when monitoring a patient's adherence to prescribed benzodiazepines, and if a patient reports taking the medication but the screening test is negative, further analysis is needed; urine testing is helpful when assessing opioid use and particular caution should be paid to the interpretation of opiate immunoassays due to known limitations in specificity, and patients should be instructed to avoid the consumption of food items that contain poppy seeds because they can result in a positive opiate test; urine testing is helpful when assessing cannabis use, although it is difficult to determine the timing or cessation of consumption in chronic users due to extended windows of detection for THC.

### The E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury epidemic: pathogenesis, management, and future directions: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115fKQzx]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Biomarkers of exposure in EVALI — active ingredients and degradation products are highlighted, including that "Positive urine ELISA screening for Δ9-THC preceded the EVALI outbreak to cannabinoid e-cigarettes", while emerging cannabinoids such as "CBD, Δ8-THC" may evade routine screens so "more comprehensive drug screenings are warranted in patients who report any e-cigarette use". A urinary biomarker for acrylonitrile "was reported to be significantly higher in nicotine e-cigarette users than in nonsers but lower than in cigarette smokers", and e-cigarette aerosols include acetaldehyde and acrolein. Unique to nicotine e-cigarettes are "PG and VG formaldehyde hemiacetals" that are "present at concentrations of up to 350 μg per puff, and four to eight times as much formaldehyde is in the aerosol in this form as is in the gaseous state"; formaldehyde gas is rapidly absorbed in the upper respiratory tract, whereas hemiacetals likely partition to particles with potential alveolar deposition and bloodstream absorption.

Table 2.
Presence of CBD or THC Metabolites by Self-reported CBD-THC Content and Primary Route of Administration

Abbreviations: CBD, cannabidiol; THC, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol.

Although vaping was the most common method of administration, 27 samples (19.7%) from participants who reported vaping contained no measurable cannabinoid whatsoever. CBD metabolites were more likely to be detected in participants who used oral than vaped (odds ratio [OR], 3.01; 95% CI, 1.58–5.74; P < .001) or smoked (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.38–6.47; p = 0.005) products. THC metabolites were more likely to be detected in participants who used oral (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.42–8.96; p = 0.007) and smoked (OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.26–9.27; p = 0.02) products than in vaped products.

### Intoxication from accidental marijuana ingestion in pediatric patients: what may lie ahead [^114SYd4H]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug. In young children, there are relatively few reports in the literature of acute marijuana intoxication. Here, we describe the case of a previously healthy 2-year-old girl who presented with clinical seizures. A urine toxicology screen showed elevated levels of tetrahydrocannabinol. The source of the drug was not identified. After a short stay in the hospital, the patient fully recovered with only supportive measures. In this report, we also summarize all domestic and international cases of marijuana intoxication in children younger than 6 years, in conjunction with the number of exposures in children of similar age identified by the US National Poison Data System. This report highlights what is becoming a more common problem. As cannabis continues to be decriminalized across the United States with its increasingly diverse modes of delivery, the potential for accidental exposure in infants and young children also rises. Clinicians should now routinely consider marijuana intoxication in children who present with acute neurological abnormalities.

### The effects of adulterants and selected ingested compounds on drugs-of-abuse testing in urine [^117A4wZJ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Household chemicals such as bleach, table salt, laundry detergent, toilet bowl cleaner, vinegar, lemon juice, and eyedrops are used for adulterating urine specimens. Most of these adulterants except eyedrops can be detected by routine specimen integrity tests (creatinine, pH, temperature, and specific gravity); however, certain adulterants such as Klear, Whizzies, Urine Luck, and Stealth cannot. These adulterants can successfully mask drug testing if the concentrations of certain abused drugs are moderate. Several spot tests have been described to detect the presence of such adulterants in urine. Urine dipsticks are commercially available for detecting the presence of such adulterants, along with performance of tests for creatinine, pH, and specific gravity. Certain hair shampoo and saliva-cleaning mouthwashes are available to escape detection in hair or saliva samples, but the effectiveness of such products in masking drugs-of-abuse testing has not been demonstrated. Ingestion of poppy seed cake may result in positive screening test results for opiates, and hemp oil exposure can cause positive results for marijuana. These would be identified as true-positive results in drugs-of-abuse testing even though they do not represent the actual drug of abuse.

USPSTF definitions of unhealthy drug use and screening — Unhealthy drug use is defined as the use of substances (not including alcohol or tobacco products) that are illegally obtained or the nonmedical use of prescription psychoactive medications; it includes use of medications for reasons, or duration, in amounts, or ways, other than prescribed or by persons other than the prescribed individual, with substances ingested, inhaled, injected, or administered using other methods to affect cognition, affect, or other mental processes; to "get high"; or for other nonmedical reasons. Screening refers to asking 1 or more questions about drug use or drug-related risks in face-to-face, print, or audiovisual format and does not refer to testing urine, saliva, blood, or other biological specimens for the presence of drugs.

Measures of Cannabis Exposure

At CDC's Tobacco and Volatiles Branch, urine samples were first hydrolyzed with β-glucuronidase to free the bound analytes, then a panel of 3 cannabis biomarkers (THC, OH-THC, and COOH-THC) were measured by isotope-dilution ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry based on modification of the validated method of Wei et al. The limit of detection (LOD) for each biomarker was 0.005 ng/mL. Values below LOD were estimated as half LOD (0.0025 ng/mL).

The molar equivalents of THC, OH-THC, and COOH-THC were summed to create a cumulative measure of exposure, total THC equivalents (TTE, measured in nmol/L). For those detectable for at least 1 biomarker, TTE was calculated as the sum of detectable values plus 0.0025 ng/mL for undetectable metabolites. We created a binary TTE variable, coded "not detected" if undetectable for all 3 biomarkers, and coded "detected" if detectable for 1 or more biomarker;. Each biomarker was also coded according to whether that urinary metabolite had a detectable value.

Covariates

Covariates included household demographic variables (sex and age of child, parent or guardian's education, family income, race and ethnicity, and type of home), in-home tobacco smoking variables, report of particle generating (eg, use of incense, gas or propane appliances) and ventilation (eg, use of air purifier, exhaust fan) activities, and nicotine dosimeter assay (eMethods in Supplement 1). To capture the diversity of our lower income sample, investigators categorized race and ethnicity as Black, Hispanic, White, and other (including Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, multiple races, and unspecified).

### One minute of marijuana secondhand smoke exposure substantially impairs vascular endothelial function [^116xtJEP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is widespread belief that, unlike tobacco smoke, marijuana smoke is benign. 1 While the psychoactive substance in marijuana is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) rather than nicotine, marijuana smoke is still the result of biomass combustion and contains many of the same toxins as tobacco smoke, 2 including fine particles that cause cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 3, 4, 5 Tobacco secondhand smoke (SHS) alone is responsible for ≈50 000 deaths in the United States each year, with ≈46 000 from cardiovascular disease, 6, 7, 8 and implementation of laws prohibiting smoking in public places and workplaces is followed by drops in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction, other cardiac events, stroke, and pulmonary diseases. 9 However, due to the illegality of marijuana, it has been difficult to prospectively study the effects of marijuana smoke, and the rare secondhand marijuana smoke studies have focused on whether exposed people test positive on drug tests. 10, 11, 12 The increasing number of states legalizing medicinal and recreational marijuana, and increasing potential for corporate expansion within the cannabis industry, 13 make it important to understand the health consequences of secondhand exposure to marijuana smoke.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^115PJigC]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Marijuana is classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as Schedule I, drugs having no accepted medical value. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. This conflict inhibits physicians from prescribing marijuana and the systematic study of marijuana in medical care. This study concerns the use of the clinical laboratory as a resource for physicians recommending cannabidiol (CBD) to patients, or for patients using medical marijuana. Marijuana containing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is psychoactive. CBD is not psychoactive. CBD is reported to have medical benefit for seizure control, neurologic disorders including multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain and pain associated with cancer. Use of opiates leads to increasing dosage over time that may cause respiratory depression. The Medical Board of California has termed this a serious public health crisis of addiction, overdose, and death. Is it feasible that CBD might alleviate persistent, severe pain and therefore diminished opiate use? Further study is needed to determine medical effectiveness of CBD including the effect on concurrent opiate therapy due to competition for receptor sites. This study is the application of a gas chromatography mass spectrometry procedure adapted for use in our laboratory, to detect CBD in urine. The intended use is as a tool for physicians to assess that marijuana being used by a patient is of a composition likely to be medically effective. A law ensuring physicians freedom from federal prosecution would provide confidence essential to formal study of medical uses of marijuana and treatment of clinical problems. Detection of CBD in a urine sample would be a convenient test for such confirmation.

ACOG/SMFM Obstetric Care Consensus #10 — maternal exposures associated with stillbirth risk report that any illicit drug use detected by biological sampling of the umbilical cord homogenate is associated with increased risk of stillbirth (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.16–3.27). Smoking during pregnancy is significantly associated with a 47% increase in the odds of stillbirth (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.37–1.57, P < .0001). Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases risk, with women exposed to secondhand smoke at higher risk of stillbirth than never smokers with lower or no secondhand exposure and with comparable risks to some active smokers. Smoking during the first trimester is associated with increased risk of stillbirth (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.4).

### ASRA pain medicine consensus guidelines on the management of the perioperative patient on cannabis and cannabinoids [^111gk19s]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Preoperative screening for cannabinoids — The ASA statement encompasses any and all medically relevant substances, including cannabinoids, regardless of whether they are medicine, recreationally used, or illicitly obtained; therefore, physicians should screen during preoperative evaluation, and all patients should be questioned about cannabinoid use, dose and frequency, route of administration, and time of last use. Drug screening by laboratory analysis of urine, saliva, blood, or hair generally detects only THC or carboxy-THC and is not recommended unless clinically indicated, such as for acute intoxication; perioperative physicians should also evaluate patients for acute intoxication. It may be useful to use a standardized tool to screen preoperatively for cannabis use, and the Cannabis Use Disorder Test has been validated and used to identify cannabis use disorder (CUD). A review of 28 studies with 65,720 participants by the USPSTF in 2020 found no evidence for benefits or harms from screening for drug use.

Study Procedures

After study enrollment, project staff installed an air particle monitor (Dylos) in the room where tobacco smoking most commonly occurrred. The monitor continuously counted fine air particles (0.5 to 2.5 μm in diameter). Passive air nicotine dosimeters were also placed within 2 feet of the air particle monitor. Approximately 7 days after installing the particle monitor, project staff administered a face-to-face computer-assisted interview with the enrolled parent or guardian to assess participant and household characteristics and air particle generating activities that occurred in the past 7 days.

The parent or guardian was provided a urine collection kit, including verbal, written, and pictorial instructions on how to collect urine samples from the enrolled child. Urine samples were collected within 24 hours of the visit and were transported by project staff to the biosafety laboratory. Contaminated samples (eg, containing feces or baby powder) were discarded, and another sample was collected. Valid urine samples were stored in lab freezers at or below −20 °C. In July and August 2020, at the very beginning of the EIS study, archived urine aliquots were sent frozen to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health, Tobacco and Volatiles Branch for analysis of cannabis exposure biomarkers.

Measures of In-Home Cannabis Smoking

In-home cannabis smoking was measured using data from air particle monitoring and reported in-home cannabis smoking in the past 7 days, concurrent with the air particle monitor data collection period. The air particle monitor produced a sensitive measure of smoking and other air particle generating activities in the home but did not identify the source of air particles. Reported in-home cannabis smoking had high specificity but may have false negatives that can underestimate true exposure. To assess in-home cannabis smoking, parents and guardians were asked, "How often in the past 7 days did anyone smoke medicinal or recreational marijuana in your home?" The responses were then binary coded as "no" for households with zero times and "yes" when reporting 1 time or more. To assess number of daily nonspecific smoking events, we used particle counts from air monitors, using a previously validated algorithm from Hovell et al (information on the algorithm available in the study supplement). Monitors counted particles irrespective of their source (eg, smoking cigarettes, smoking cannabis, burning toast, cooking with oil, burning incense). Daily smoking events were identified if the maximum particle count was 15 000 counts/0.01 ft 3 or above within a 5-minute period.

### Are adolescents more vulnerable to the harmful effects of cannabis than adults? A placebo-controlled study in human males [^111CGvet]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Drug administration

Medicinal-grade active (Bedrobinol; THC 12.0%) and placebo (THC < 0.3%) cannabis were imported under UK Home Office license from Bedrocan (Veendan, The Netherlands). Dose was weight-adjusted as age differences in body weight were anticipated. Following previous protocols, participants received 0.89 mg kg −1 of cannabis, corresponding to ~8.0 mg THC for an individual weighing 75 kg. This dose corresponds to that contained in about a third of a typical joint. Similar doses have previously been shown to produce robust subjective effects via the administration method used in this study.

Drug was administered via a Volcano Medic vaporizer (Storz and Bickel, Tuttlingen, Germany), operating at 210 °C. This method has been shown to be safe, producing equivalent pulmonary and plasma cannabinoid levels to those from smoked cannabis, but with lower expired carbon monoxide levels. Vapor was collected in a 'balloon' with a non-return valve, and inhaled according to a previous timed breath-holding protocol. Participants inhaled, held their breath for 8 s and repeated this at their own pace until the balloon was empty. Each dose was vaporized in two sequentially administered balloons to minimize residual cannabinoids.

Measures

Baseline assessments

Premorbid verbal intelligence was assessed by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, and scores were adjusted for age. Depression and anxiety were assessed on the Beck Depression Inventoryand Beck Anxiety Inventory. A validated short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviour Scale (SUPPS-P), indexed impulsivity and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaireindexed schizotypy.

Drug use

A structured interview recorded: lifetime use (yes/no); time since last use (days); duration of use (years); frequency (days/month); and amount per session (alcohol units (standard UK units of alcohol; equivalent to 8 g of pure alcohol or ~3/5ths of a NIAAA standardized drink) per typical drinking session; cigarettes/day; other illicit drugs grams/pills/tabs). Instant urine drug screens at the start of every session assessed recent use of illicit drugs (amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methadone, opiates, oxycodone, phencyclidine (Supplementary Table S1). Problematic drug use was assessed using the Cannabis Abuse Screening Test, the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependenceand the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^112ATx2J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine detection window and sample integrity — It takes approximately 2 hours after use for a substance to be detected in urine, and the window of detection for most substances of interest is 1–3 days and up to 4 days in some cases, with duration dependent on factors such as fluid intake and urinary pH. Urine is the specimen most prone to sample tampering, and UDT can be circumvented through sample substitution, dilution and adulteration. A substituted sample replaces the patient's urine with another sample, either urine or some other liquid; diluting a urine sample makes it less likely that a drug or its metabolite(s) can be detected above the cutoff threshold of an immunoassay test; and adulteration uses a masking agent that destroys the presence of drugs in urine or interferes with the enzymatic reactivity of an immunoassay test.

Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) drug screening and marijuana — Consideration should be given to drug screening as part of the MSLT protocol, and when concern exists about undisclosed substances, urine screening 1–2 days before the MSLT may be considered, with the task force concluding that drug screening may be indicated in adult patients depending on community and clinical circumstances. Regarding marijuana, recent discontinuation can result in REM sleep rebound, and when a washout period is not possible, a stable dose and consistent use of marijuana for at least 2 weeks before the MSLT is recommended; because tetrahydrocannabinol has a long half-life, a 2-week washout may not be sufficient for a negative drug screen.

### Assessing secondhand smoke using biological markers [^1122HoAd]. Tobacco Control (2013). Low credibility.

Utility of NNK metabolites versus nicotine metabolites

A moderately strong correlation is evident between NNK metabolites and nicotine metabolites in the urine of SHS-exposed non-smokers, with similar results in smokers. In a study of 74 children, as tNNAL increased from 0.05 to 0.35 pmol/ml urine, total cotinine (the sum of cotinine and its glucuronide) increased from 15 to 50 ng/ml urine, leaving little doubt that cotinine at these concentrations in non-smokers' urine implies the presence of tNNAL. Since it is easier and less expensive to measure nicotine than tNNAL, one could argue that the latter is not necessary. tNNAL in urine, however, may have greater public health impact and better predictive utility for the adverse health effects of SHSe, compared to detection of nicotine metabolites. This specificity reflects the pulmonary carcinogen NNAL and its parent NNK, although nicotine may be related to carcinogenesis, atherosclerosis, platelet adhesion and coronary heart disease (CHD) vasoconstriction, and has addictive properties and high-dose toxicity. Detection of an actual carcinogen, tNNAL, in non-smokers' urine, signals a hazard, and using this biomarker to discourage smoking (eg, feedback for parents of exposed children) has been proposed. Its detection in the urine of SHS-exposed non-smokers repeatedly attracts media attention, leading to further support for tobacco-free legislation and tobacco control.

Smoking Events

The household demographics-adjusted odds of detecting cannabis biomarkers in children's urine among households that reported in-home cannabis smoking in the past 7 days were 5.02 times (95% CI, 2.42–10.40) the odds of households without reported in-home cannabis smoking (Table 2).

Table 2.
Estimates From Logistic Regression of Total Detectable THC Equivalents (TTE) in Children and Linear Regression of TTE Among Children With Detectable Urinary Cannabinoids a

Abbreviations: LOD, limit of detection; OR, odds ratio; THC, tetrahydrocannabinol.

The household demographics-adjusted odds of detecting cannabis biomarkers in children's urine increased by a factor of 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04–1.17) for each additional daily in-home nonspecific smoking event up to 10 events (Table 2). Although the point estimate for TTE levels was higher among children with detectable urinary cannabinoids and exposure to more daily smoking events (increase per event, 4.72%; 95% CI, −0.44% to 10.16%), the difference was not statistically significant.

For every ascertained daily cannabis smoking event, the household demographics-adjusted odds of cannabis biomarkers being detected in the children's urine increased statistically significantly by a factor of 2.50 (95% CI, 1.59–3.92) (Table 2). Although the point estimate for TTE levels was higher among children with detectable urinary cannabinoids and exposure to more daily cannabis smoking events (increase per ascertained daily cannabis smoking event, 35.68%; 95% CI, −7.12% to 98.21%), the difference was not statistically significant.

In an additional analysis, we compared households with and without missing data for in-home cannabis smoking in the last 7 days due to the substantial proportion of missing data (77 households [28.0%]) for this key variable (eTables 5 and 6 in Supplement 1). Households with missing data had nonsignificant lower levels of TTE detection (15 of 77 [19.5%]) than households without missing data (60 of 198 [30.3%]) (P = 0.10) (eTable 5 in Supplement 1).

### Testing for cannabis in the work-place: a review of the evidence [^115oecUf]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Urinalysis testing in the work-place has been adopted widely by employers in the United States to deter employee drug use and promote 'drug-free' work-places. In other countries, such as Canada, testing is focused more narrowly on identifying employees whose drug use puts the safety of others at risk.

Aims

We review 20 years of published literature on questions relevant to the objectives of work-place drug testing (WPDT), with a special emphasis on cannabis, the most commonly detected drug.

Results

We conclude (i) that the acute effects of smoking cannabis impair performance for a period of about 4 hours; (ii) long-term heavy use of cannabis can impair cognitive ability, but it is not clear that heavy cannabis users represent a meaningful job safety risk unless using before work or on the job; (iii) urine tests have poor validity and low sensitivity to detect employees who represent a safety risk; (iv) drug testing is related to reductions in the prevalence of cannabis positive tests among employees, but this might not translate into fewer cannabis users; and (v) urinalysis has not been shown to have a meaningful impact on job injury/accident rates.

Conclusions

Urinalysis testing is not recommended as a diagnostic tool to identify employees who represent a job safety risk from cannabis use. Blood testing for active tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can be considered by employers who wish to identify employees whose performance may be impaired by their cannabis use.

Legalization of cannabis – impairment and testing limitations states that "ACOEM unambiguously states that cannabis products have the capacity to negatively affect judgment, motor coordination, reaction times, and driving ability", yet "to date there is no consistent definition of a dose or blood concentration of cannabis at which impairment begins or ends". In this context, "Taking that into account, urine testing is not a measure of impairment, it is only an indicator of past use", and "Although there are ways to measure impairment, well-validated tools are not readily available or easy to implement in the workplace and at present are more useful in research settings". Reflecting product variability, "Unlike Federal Drug Administration approved medications which have identified active component(s), a known side effect profile, a scientifically identified half-life and specific dose and dosing interval, these characteristics are not identified nor consistent between cannabis products". Accordingly, "ACOEM is advocating for increased research and collaboration between all stakeholders in defining and/or measuring the impairment risks of cannabis products use as it relates to the workplace".

Drug testing, when carefully collected and thoughtfully interpreted, offers a critical adjunct to clinical care and substance use treatment. However, because test results can be misleading if not interpreted in the correct clinical context, clinicians should always conduct a careful interview with adolescent patients to understand what testing is likely to show and then use testing to validate or refute their expectations. Because of the ease with which samples can be tampered, providers should also carefully reflect on their own collection protocols and sample validation procedures to ensure optimal accuracy".

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^113FoiBX]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is cannabis smoking in the home associated with resident children's exposure to cannabis smoke, as measured by urinary biomarkers?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 275 children, the odds of detectable THC equivalents in children's urine were 5 times higher in households with reported in-home cannabis smoking compared with households without.

Meaning

These results suggest that reducing in-home cannabis smoking could substantially reduce children's exposure to cannabis smoke, which contains toxic chemicals including known carcinogens.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113MGrjr]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic opioid therapy — definitive urine drug testing (UDT) panels and specimen type — states that physician-directed definitive profile testing is reasonable and necessary when ordered for a particular patient based upon historical use, clinical findings, and community trends, and that definitive UDT orders should be individualized based on clinical history and risk assessment and must be documented in the medical record. Urine or oral fluid is the preferred biologic specimen for testing because of the ease of collection, storage, and cost-effectiveness, and UDT cannot detect the dosage of drug ingested/used, the time of use, or the means of delivery. Detection time of a substance in urine is typically 1–3 days depending on the drug, although lipid-soluble drugs such as marijuana may remain in body fat and be detected upwards of a week or more. The LCD does not discuss ethanol; ethanol is a known drug of abuse, but is routinely tested in blood, not in urine, and the Drug Enforcement Agency resource guide states that alcohol is exempt from control by the Controlled Substance Act.

### Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of newborn drug testing [^1157w6yh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Prior studies suggest marijuana is the most common non-medical drug used during pregnancy, consistent with our data in which THC accounted for 75% of non-medical drug use. Although delta-9-THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, crosses the placenta, the association of prenatal marijuana use with premature delivery, low birth weight, or congenital malformations is not clear. Long term, prenatal marijuana exposure may have adverse effects on learning, attention and behavior. Three urine specimens in our study screened positive for THC but showed negative confirmatory testing, a phenomenon previously noted in other studies.

Opiate exposure is estimated to occur in 2 to 20% of pregnancies. Recent studies using meconium drug testing have documented misuse of prescription pain medication among pregnant women. The incidence of non-medical use of prescription opiates identified via meconium drug testing was 0.5% (n = 40) in this study. This figure excludes the 68 unexplained positive meconium samples for opiates. Interpretation of positive opiate screens is complicated given the complexity of opiate metabolism and multiple possible sources of opiates such as medications prescribed for the mother and/or newborn, poppy seeds, heroin, or intentional misuse of prescription opiates (See Additional file 1).

A major finding of this study is that detection of prescribed medications is common with meconium and/or urine drug screening. The study institution includes a neonatal intensive care unit which cares for many premature infants. Many premature infants receive medications prior to the passage of meconium, which may be delayed until the ninth day of life. Morphine, lorazepam, and phenobarbital administered to newborns prior to meconium collection accounted for 96.5% of the 283 samples whose meconium findings were completely explained by prescribed medications. Detection of prescribed medications requires thorough review of the maternal and newborn medical records, along with consideration of the metabolic pathways of opiates and benzodiazepines, to avoid unnecessary accusations of non-medical drug use (See Additional file 1).

Our study found very low yield of urine drug screening. Over a 4 year period, urine drug screening did not detect any non-medical drug use not seen in meconium. In addition, urine drug testing failed to detect 128 cases of non-medical drug use determined by meconium analysis.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^115wHWyb]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

The following ions are used to quantitate and identify (qualify) the compounds: internal standard (CBD-D3): quantitation: 393, qualifier: 461; CBD: quantitation: 390, qualifiers: 458, 443. The linearity of the assay is 2–100 ng/mL. The limit of detection of the assay is 2 ng/mL. Results are normalized to urine creatinine determined using the Jaffe method.

Two different groups were studied. Group I consisted of specimens from individuals who were submitted for drug screening and confirmation if positive. Forty depersonalized samples were randomly selected from the confirmed positives. The study of the samples in this group was intended to demonstrate that the assay for urine CBD was negative for individuals using THC-rich marijuana. Group II consisted of the study of 15 volunteers who used CBD or CBD-rich marijuana as follows: 12 marijuana using volunteers who agreed to a one time use of a CBD-rich oil capsule; one volunteer used a CBD-rich, THC-poor cigarette; one volunteer used a commercially produced CBD-rich oil capsule; one volunteer used commercially produced herbal (hemp) extract. The study of samples in this group was intended to demonstrate that the assay for urine CBD was positive for individuals known to use CBD-rich marijuana. All samples were also tested for THC by assaying for the metabolite, carboxy-THC.

A single volunteer was studied to develop a time profile of the detection time of urinary CBD postdose.

Abbreviations: COOH-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol; LOD, limit of detection; OH-THC, 11-hydroxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol.

Participating households had a mean (SD) 2.9 (5.0) daily smoking events. Parents or guardians of 29 households (10.6%) reported that cannabis was smoked inside their home in the past 7 days; 75 children (27.3%) had detectable cannabis exposure biomarkers in their urine. The mean (SD) TTE was 0.13 (0.42) nmol/L. Detailed descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 1.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^115Nczyn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The degree that in-home cannabis smoking can be detected in the urine of resident children is unclear.

Objective

Test association of in-home cannabis smoking with urinary cannabinoids in children living at home.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used baseline data from Project Fresh Air, a 2012–2016 randomized clinical trial to reduce fine particulate matter levels. Eligible participants were recruited from households in San Diego County, California, with children under age 14 years and an adult tobacco smoker in residence. Children's urine samples were analyzed in 2022.

Exposures

In-home cannabis smoking, measured by: parent or guardian report of in-home cannabis smoking; number of daily nonspecific smoking events computed via an air particle count algorithm; and number of daily cannabis smoking events ascertained by residualization, adjusting for air nicotine, tobacco smoking, and other air particle generating or ventilating activities.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Levels of the cannabis biomarker Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its major metabolites, 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Biomarker molar equivalents were summed to represent total THC equivalents (TTE) in urine. Logistic regression assessed whether in-home smoking was associated with cannabis biomarker detection. For children with detectable urinary cannabinoids, linear regression assessed in-home smoking association with quantity of urinary TTE.

Results

A total of 275 children were included in analysis (mean [SD] age, 3.6 [3.6] years; 144 male [52.4%]; 38 Black [13.8%], 132 Hispanic [48.0%], and 52 White [18.9%]). Twenty-nine households (10.6%) reported in-home cannabis smoking in the past 7 days; 75 children [27.3%] had detectable urinary cannabinoids. Odds of detectable TTE in children's urine were significantly higher in households with reported in-home cannabis smoking than households without (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% CI, 2.4–10.4) and with each additional ascertained daily cannabis smoking event (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6–3.9). Although the point estimate for TTE levels was higher among children with detectable urinary cannabinoids and exposure to more daily cannabis smoking events (increase per event, 35.68%; 95% CI, -7.12% to 98.21%), the difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, in-home cannabis smoking was associated with significantly increased odds of child exposure to cannabis smoke, as assessed by urinary cannabinoid biomarkers. As young children spend most of their time at home, reducing in-home cannabis smoking could substantially reduce their exposure to the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in cannabis smoke.

### Maternal marijuana use and neonatal morbidity [^114JH5ks]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Marijuana use is becoming increasingly common in the obstetric population; however, it is unknown whether it is associated with poor neonatal outcomes. We sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors for marijuana use in pregnancy and to evaluate whether marijuana use is independently associated with poor neonatal outcomes.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive, nonanomalous, term deliveries at 1 institution over a 4-year study period. Women with marijuana use during pregnancy, either by self-report or positive urine drug screen, were compared with women who did not use marijuana. The primary outcome was a composite neonatal morbidity including birthweight less than 2500 g, neonatal intensive care unit admission, 5-minute Apgar score less than 7, and umbilical artery pH less than 7.10. Univariate, bivariate, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed.

Results

Among the 8138 women in the cohort, 680 (8.4%) used marijuana during pregnancy. Women who used marijuana were younger; more likely to be of African American race; have inadequate prenatal care; and use tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. Medical comorbidities did not differ between groups. After adjusting for smoking, other drug use, and African American race, the composite and all individual markers of poor neonatal outcome were not significantly higher among women who used marijuana during pregnancy.

Conclusion

Marijuana use is common in pregnancy but may not be an independent risk factor for poor neonatal outcomes in term pregnancies.

### Marijuana use among young women in a primary care setting [^112MLEXw]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence of marijuana use among young women, ages 18–24, within a primary care setting.

Design

From 2/05 to 12/05, women completed a brief, anonymous self-report screening instrument in two urban primary care clinics for potential participation in a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to reduce marijuana use and sexual risk-taking behavior. During the last few months of recruitment, women who completed the screening instrument were also asked to provide a urine sample to test for the presence of marijuana and other drugs.

Results

Of the 607 women who completed the screening instrument, 38.6% reported lifetime marijuana use, 8.4% used marijuana at least monthly, and 1.7% reported using marijuana daily. Within this ethnically diverse sample (45% Hispanic), women who used marijuana at least monthly were more likely to smoke cigarettes (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.04, 3.96), binge drink at least once a month (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 1.34, 5.28), and to have ever used other drugs (OR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.31, 6.45). Of the 67 urine samples provided, 60 (89.6%) were concordant with self-reported use, but six of the seven discordant samples were positive despite negative self-report.

Conclusions

The prevalence of marijuana use and binge drinking in this ethnically diverse sample of young, female primary care patients was lower than rates reported in national surveys. Providers should consider marijuana use as a part of a process that addresses more prevalent high-risk behaviors, bearing in mind that these behaviors may be underreported during routine screening.

### Marijuana and tobacco coexposure in hospitalized children [^1157SkF3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of secondhand marijuana smoke exposure on children is unknown. New methods allow for the detection of marijuana smoke exposure in children.

Methods

We studied children who were hospitalized in Colorado and had a parent participating in a smoking cessation study; all children had urine samples remaining from the original study as well as consent for future research. Parents completed a survey and urine samples were analyzed for cotinine and marijuana metabolites, including 11-hydroxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (COOH-THC), by using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Results

The median age of the children was 6.0 years (range 0–17 years); 57% were boys. Half (55%) were white, 12% were African American, and 33% were of another race; 39% identified as Hispanic. Approximately 46% had detectable COOH-THC, and 11% had detectable THC. Of those with detectable THC, 3 were teenagers, and 6 were < 8 years of age. There were no significant differences in urinary COOH-THC concentrations by age, sex, race and/or ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Children with positive results for COOH-THC were more likely to have parents who use marijuana daily, smoke marijuana versus other forms of use, use daily in the home, and smoke marijuana in another room if the children are around compared with smoking outside.

Conclusions

Approximately half of the children who qualified for our study had biological evidence of exposure to marijuana. Researchers in studies such as this provide valuable data on secondhand exposure to children from parents using tobacco and marijuana and can inform public health policies to reduce harm.

### Factors associated with marijuana use among treatment-seeking adult cigarette smokers in the criminal justice population [^116imvNi]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Due to the elevated rates of cigarette use and marijuana use within the criminal justice system, it is critical to develop a stronger understanding of tobacco and marijuana co-use among this population to inform future interventions.

Methods

This study is a secondary analysis of baseline data from a smoking cessation randomized clinical trial of adults (n = 500) in a community correction program. Participants were classified as using cigarettes only or both cigarettes and marijuana through either self-report or positive urine drug screening. Demographics and measures regarding legal, drug use, smoking, mental health, and interpersonal histories were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with co-use.

Results

Among adults who smoked cigarettes, 25% reported current marijuana use. Individuals who used both cigarettes and marijuana were more likely than those who only used cigarettes to be African American (80%), male (73.6%), and younger (M = 32.4 [SD = 11.0]). Increasing difficulties with last quit attempt was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of co-use (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–0.94, P < 0.05), and benzodiazepine (OR 9.09, 95% CI 1.25–65.94, P < 0.05) and opioid (OR 8.17, 95% CI 2.03–32.93, P < 0.01) use was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of co-use.

Conclusions

This study identified several factors that are associated with an increased risk of cigarette and marijuana co-use among a community correction population. These findings will be valuable for informing targeted prevention and treatment interventions.

### Using measured cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites in urine to differentiate marijuana use from consumption of commercial cannabidiol products [^112AbbF9]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Detecting marijuana use is a component of most urine drug screens targeting a single Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol metabolite. Recently, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), has gained popular acceptance for a myriad of reasons. Commercially available CBD products sold without purity regulations have become ubiquitous. Many products contain trace tetrahydrocannabinol. Long-term or high dose use of CBD products can result in tetrahydrocannabinol exposures, potentially producing a positive marijuana drug test. These results are not false positives since marijuana biomarkers are present, but inaccurately identify donors as marijuana users. Addressing this conundrum, we developed an assay discriminating marijuana use from the use of CBD contaminated with tetrahydrocannabinol.

Methods

Following the synthesis of a primary CBD metabolite, a LC-MS/MS assay was developed measuring the urinary metabolites tetrahydrocannabinol, 11-nor-carboxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, CBD, and 7-carboxy-cannabidiol. The assay was utilized on 425 patients claiming CBD use, and sixteen samples from trusted users of commercial CBD products.

Results and Discussion

Clear data clusters enabled metabolic cut-points assignments. Forty-three percent of samples contained CBD metabolites in ten-fold excess to tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites which was then used as a set point to classify donors as CBD users. An excess of tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites classify donors as marijuana users. Additionally, urine samples were procured from donors personally known to use commercial CBD ad libitum, yet abstain from tetrahydrocannabinol. Results from trusted users substantiated the use of the resulting metabolic ratios despite 11-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol measured in 75% of these samples.

Conclusion

A method has been developed and utilized to distinguish marijuana use from tetrahydrocannabinol exposure from contaminated CBD use.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^113HoEi3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Cocaine and cannabis urine testing — target analytes and sensitivity are outlined: Cocaine use can be detected in urine by targeting the metabolite benzoylecgonine (BZE) because cocaine has a very short half-life, and presumptive tests for cocaine are described as more sensitive and specific than those for opiate, benzodiazepine, and amphetamine because they target a specific analyte. Cannabis use can be detected in urine by targeting the THC metabolite THC-9-carboxylic acid (THC-COOH).

### A 21st century problem: cannabis toxicity in a 13-month-old child [^115ygckU]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis is one of the most abused drugs worldwide, with more than 20 million users in the United States (US). As access to cannabis products increases with expanding US legislation and decriminalization of marijuana, emergency physicians must be adept in recognizing unintentional cannabis toxicity in young children, which can range from altered mental status to encephalopathy and coma.

Case Report

We report the case of a 13-month-old female presenting with self-limiting altered mental status and lethargy, with a subsequent diagnosis of tetrahydrocannabinol exposure on confirmatory urine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Considering caretakers rarely report possible cannabis exposure, history-taking must review caretakers' medicinal and recreational drug exposures to prevent inadvertently missing the diagnosis. In the young child with altered mental status, prompt urine screening for cannabinoid detection can prevent further invasive and costly diagnostic investigations, such as brain imaging and lumbar puncture.

### Interpretation of workplace tests for cannabinoids [^116AtaWF]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Workplace urine drug testing for an inactive THC metabolite is common in both federally regulated and non-regulated drug testing. A positive result does not document impairment, or even recent use, when impairment is likely the most important parameter being searched for by the drug testing procedure. Most cannabinoid testing does not detect imported synthetics. Currently, urine is the most widely tested matrix, but blood, plasma, oral fluid, and hair may also be accepted in federally regulated testing in the future. This article will discuss the history, the status quo, and the possible near term future of workplace testing for marijuana in employees.

### Rapid urine screening for ethyl glucuronide from pregnant women as a tool for detecting prenatal alcohol exposure [^115MKu3L]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the study

In urine EtG analysis there is a theoretical possibility of both false negative and false positive results, especially in cases of urinary tract infections. However, use of alcohol containing mouthwash and heavy use of hand sanitizer are not likely to cause positive results in pregnant women. There are also other possible extraneous sources of alcohol exposure that might in theory cause positive EtG results if those alcohol containing products are inhaled or ingested in substantial quantities. However, for the fetal development the amount and timing of alcohol exposure is likely to be more relevant than the route of exposure. Low participation rate in user self-recruiting units caused probable bias in results, because there were only two screening positive samples, a very low percentage of tobacco users and no cannabis users in those who participated through such recruiting procedures. Still, in quantitative analysis of samples including uncertain screening results and randomly selected screening negative samples and using lower cut-off, 6.7% of samples in those units exceeded 100 ng/mL.

### Large scale enzyme based xenobiotic identification for exposomics [^117BZhMA]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Identification of undocumented xenobiotic exposures

To test whether the use of accurate mass m / z, RT, and co-detection of related xenobiotics could be used for identification of xenobiotics in human samples with undocumented environmental, drug, or dietary exposures, we examined a healthy cohort (n = 120) with no documented xenobiotic exposures where paired urine and plasma samples were available. Nicotine, a common environmental xenobiotic that humans can be exposed to through tobacco products and secondhand smoke, was detected alongside related metabolites (cotinine, hydroxycotinine, and nicotine glucuronide) in 7 out of 120 people in both urine and plasma (Fig. 6a). Naphthalene, an industrial chemical that can also be found in mothballs, tobacco smoke, and other environmental sources, was detected as hydroxynaphthalene sulfate (naphthol sulfate) and hydroxynaphthalene glucuronide (naphthol glucuronide) in 4 out of 120 people in urine. In two out of the four individuals with naphthalene exposures detectable in urine, hydroxynapthalene sulfate was also detected in plasma (Fig. 6a). Omeprazole, an over-the-counter medication used for the treatment of heartburn, was detected alongside related metabolites (deoxyomeprazole, omeprazole sulfate, omeprazole glucuronide) in 7 out of 120 people in urine or plasma. Piperine, a chemical found in black pepper, was detected in all plasma samples. Hydroxypiperine and piperine dihydrodiol were correlated with piperine in plasma (Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition to correlations of related metabolites within a single biofluid, some compounds were correlated across plasma and urine samples (Supplementary Fig. 4). All of these chemicals were detected at the same accurate mass m / z and retention time as S9-enzyme generated metabolites. While obtaining MS 2 spectra for each metabolite was not possible due to low abundance, at least one metabolite from each group of related xenobiotics had MS 2 spectra that matched MS 2 spectra from S9-enzyme generated metabolites (Fig. 6b). Thus, large-scale HRMS characterization of S9-enzymatic generated biotransformation products of diverse xenobiotics provides a strategy to identify exposures based on co-occurrence of related metabolites to complement traditional approaches to MS-based metabolites identification.

### Pilot validation of a brief screen tool for substance use detection in emergency care [^114KnxUV]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Screening and brief intervention for substance use in health care systems is recommended to identify and intervene with patients who abuse alcohol and other substances. However, there is limited research on the utility of short, single-item questions to identify illicit substance users.

Objective

Pilot validation of two single-item screening questions to detect illicit substance use, one for marijuana and one for other illicit drugs. The goal was to identify sensitive, time-efficient screening questions that can be easily integrated into busy health care settings.

Methods

A cross-sectional design was used. At intake, along with questions for tobacco and alcohol, nurses administered two brief screen questions to adult patients seen in designated areas in a large urban medical center. After patients were triaged to rooms, health educators (blind to brief screen responses) administered the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) as the reference standard.

Results

On the ASSIST, 14% and 9% of participants reported risky marijuana and illicit (nonmarijuana) drug use, respectively. Sensitivity values for the marijuana and street drug questions were 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 67% to 78%) and 40% (95% CI 32% to 48%), respectively. Specificity values for the marijuana and street drug questions were 96% (95% CI 95% to 97%) and 99% (95% CI 98% to 99%), respectively. Values differed minimally as a function of patient characteristics.

Conclusions

It is important to use validated questions to identify substance misuse so that individuals are not missed in the screening process. It is the possible that administration protocols play a role in detection rates. Future research is needed to identify easy-to-administer drug use screening questions.

### Detecting biomarkers of secondhand marijuana smoke in young children [^1172vSU9]. Pediatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of secondhand marijuana smoke exposure on children is unknown. New methods allow detection of secondhand marijuana smoke in children.

Methods

We studied children ages 1 mo to 2 y hospitalized with bronchiolitis in Colorado from 2013 to 2015. Parents completed a survey, and urine samples were analyzed for cotinine using LC/MS/MS (limits of detection 0.03ng/ml) and marijuana metabolites including COOH-THC (limits of detection 0.015ng/ml).

Results

A total of 43 subjects had urine samples available for analysis. Most (77%) of the subjects were male, and 52% were less than 1 y of age. COOH-THC was detectable in 16% of the samples analyzed (THC+); the range in COOH-THC concentration was 0.03–1.5ng/ml. Two subjects had levels > 1ng/ml. Exposure did not differ by gender or age. Non-white children had more exposure than white children (44 vs. 9%; P < 0.05). 56% of children with cotinine > 2.0ng/ml were THC+, compared with 7% of those with lower cotinine (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Metabolites of marijuana smoke can be detected in children; in this cohort, 16% were exposed. Detectable COOH-THC is more common in children with tobacco smoke exposure. More research is needed to assess the health impacts of marijuana smoke exposure on children and inform public health policy.

### Variation in cannabinoid metabolites present in the urine of adults using medical cannabis products in Massachusetts [^117SMaWB]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Among adults using medical cannabis frequently and recently, THC and CBD metabolite concentrations in urine often differed from expected exposure. Approximately one-third of samples from people reporting using CBD-dominant products contained no measurable CBD metabolite. Nearly 1 in 5 samples from those using vaped cannabis contained no detectable cannabinoids. There were no dose-metabolite associations for vaped products. This may indicate that vaping devices may not heat cannabis products appropriately, and US Food and Drug Administration–approved devices may deliver more consistent cannabinoid exposure. Product and delivery method variability present challenges to assessing the efficacy and safety of medical cannabis.

Methodological limitations of this study include participant-determined doses, possible errors in self-report, no analysis of the cannabis products themselves, and individual differences in rate of absorption and metabolism. Products were purchased in Greater Boston dispensaries, so results may not generalize to regions with different regulations.

The findings of this cohort study are consistent with those of a studyof cannabis products purchased in California and Washington, in which more than one-half of products were incorrectly labeled. These findings indicate that adults using medical cannabis products may have incomplete or incorrect information regarding expected cannabinoid exposure from these purchased products, impeding informed patient choice and investigation of pharmacologic and therapeutic properties of cannabis products.

### Quality improvement approach to increase inpatient pediatric secondhand smoke exposure screening [^1158M68f]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) is highly prevalent among children and has numerous adverse health effects. Consistent screening for SHSe is an essential first step to helping families break the toxic cycle of smoking.

Methods

With this quality improvement project, we evaluated a SHSe screening and cessation resource distribution protocol in a general pediatrics inpatient unit of a safety-net hospital. Our primary outcome measure was the percent of admissions screened for SHSe, with a goal of increasing our documented rate of SHSe screening from 0% to 70% within 6 months of implementation. Our secondary outcome measure was the percent of those who screened positive for SHSe who were offered smoking cessation resources. Process measures included tracking nurse confidence in screening and compliance with new workflow training. Balancing measures were nurse satisfaction and brevity of screening.

Results

From May 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020, nurses screened 97.2% of the 394 patients admitted to the pediatric unit for SHSe. Of the patients screened, 15.7% were exposed to cigarettes or other tobacco products, 5.6% to e-cigarettes, and 6.5% to marijuana. Nurses documented offering "Quit Kits" with cessation materials to 45 caregivers (72.6% of positive screen results) and offering 33 referrals to the California Smokers' Helpline (53.2% of positive screen results).

Conclusion

In this project, we successfully implemented a screening protocol for SHSe to tobacco, e-cigarettes, and marijuana and a workflow for cessation resource distribution in an inpatient pediatric setting that far exceeded goals. Requiring minimal maintenance and using just a simple paper-based format, the workflow could be adopted at other institutions.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^114q55E4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design

Project Fresh Air (PFA) was a 2-group randomized clinical intervention aimed at reducing indoor fine particulate matter (PM 0.5–2.5) levels through real-time feedback and coaching in San Diego County, California. This secondary cross-sectional study, Eliminating In-Home Smoking (EIS), funded in 2020, used deidentified data collected during an approximately 7-day period before PFA intervention commencement. The University of California, San Diego institutional review board certified that our study presented no human participants protection concerns. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant in Project Fresh Air using a consent form approved by the San Diego State University institutional research board. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Study Participants

PFA recruited participants May 2012 through December 2015 through various sources, including community events and organizations such as the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition programs. Study inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, having at least 1 child under age 14 years living in the home, having a resident adult tobacco smoker, and having no plans of moving for 3 months. We sequentially enrolled 298 households, 1 parent or guardian and the youngest child from each household, with each participating in the trial for approximately 3 to 4 months during October 2012 to February 2016. Details of participant recruitment and enrollment are reported elsewhere. Of 298 children enrolled, at baseline 10 had no stored urine samples, 2 lacked all cannabinoid data due to assay issues, 10 were missing air particle data, and 1 participant's data were excluded due to extreme cannabis biomarker values (THC, 8.0 ng/mL; OH-THC, 168.0 ng/mL; COOH-THC, 331.0 ng/mL) consistent with primary exposure to cannabis. The final analytic sample was 275 households (Figure).

### Consensus document for the selection of lung transplant candidates: an update from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [^1127DSkt]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2021). High credibility.

Substance use disorders and nicotine/cannabis/opioid management — lung transplant candidates should be assessed for active substance use disorders and, during evaluation and the pre-transplant period, blood and urine testing may be used to verify abstinence; candidates must demonstrate abstinence from all tobacco and nicotine products prior to transplant, and a short duration of abstinence (≤ 6 months) and exposure to second-hand smoke confer a higher risk for relapse; inhaled cannabis use must be ceased prior to transplant, orally consumed cannabis should only be used if recommended by a medical provider and approved by the lung transplant team, and orally consumed cannabinoids may cause positive urine drug tests and, if continued post-transplant, have the potential to interact with immunosuppression medications; the safety of pre-lung transplant opioid use has not been widely studied, the risks and benefits should be considered on an individual basis, and medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder has not been studied in advanced lung disease patients with consultation with a psychiatrist or addictions specialist possibly indicated.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^114q5BHn]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Primary Analyses — Association of In-Home Cannabis Smoking With Urinary Cannabinoids in Children

To model the association of in-home cannabis smoking with urinary cannabinoids, 2 multivariable models were examined: a logistic regression model estimated the odds of cannabis biomarkers being detected in the children's urine (model 1); among children with detectable cannabis biomarkers, a linear regression model quantified the effect size of frequency of in-home cannabis smoking with TTE (model 2). In these linear models, outcome variables were natural log–transformed to address the non-normal distributions. The final model (model 3) is adjusted for all household demographic variables.

We evaluated the linearity of number of daily nonspecific smoking events and ascertained number of daily cannabis smoking events using restricted cubic splines (RCS). Number of daily nonspecific smoking events exhibited statistically significant nonlinearity (nonlinear P < .05), while ascertained number of daily cannabis smoking events did not (nonlinear P > .14). We modeled number of daily nonspecific smoking events with 4 knots using the fully adjusted logistic model (model 3) fit within the multiple imputation framework and Rubin rules to pool adjusted predictions and variances across imputations. We plotted the results with the referent category set to zero, outputting predictions for the zero through 99th percentile to facilitate interpretation (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). We also included logistic regression estimates when reporting TTE because they are informative for most households, given the association appears linear up to approximately 10 events, representing 225 of 275 households (81.2%) in this study.

Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted stratified logistic regression by children's age (under age 6 years vs 6 years and older) to identify important differences by activity patterns and locations. As 208 of 275 children (75.6%) were under the age of 6 years, the results among children ages 6 years and older may not be reliable due to the small sample size.

### Dopamine cross-sensitization between psychostimulant drugs and stress in healthy male volunteers [^1156HgU8]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, although the participants were carefully screened for use of drugs in the past and a urine drug test was done at the beginning of each session, some participants had used tobacco or cannabis in the past, and the timing of last nicotine exposure was not confirmed by blood testing. On the basis of the findings, in animals, that repeated nicotine or cannabis exposure can induce sensitization, it could be argued that participants who had previously smoked may already be sensitized, hence the theoretical possibility of another confound. However, the amount of prior nicotine or cannabis exposure was very low. Moreover, the-amphetamine and placebo group did not significantly differ in their prior use, and an effect of the stress-amphetamine regimen could still be observed despite the potential influence of past use.

Urine testing for specific substances — urine is the most well-established and well-supported biologic matrix for conducting drug testing for patients with addiction, but its utility depends on the substance of interest and the information the provider needs. Providers should consider the questions they are seeking to answer when conducting a urine test and be aware of known detection issues; for example, THC is detectable in urine, but it is difficult to distinguish when the substance was used.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^1157E6Vo]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Our study offers unique contributions to the cannabis control field by examining the association between in-home cannabis smoking and children's SHCS exposure. Not only did we use the state-of-the-art ascertainment of cannabis exposure (urinary biomarkers), we calculated the molar sum (TTE) of 3 urinary cannabis biomarkers (THC, OH-THC, and COOH-THC) to provide a more sensitive estimate of exposure than would measurement of a single biomarker. But as a high percentage of cannabinoids are excreted in feces, our measure may still underestimate exposure. Furthermore, we used 3 measures of in-home cannabis smoking including a newly developed metric that integrated objective air particle data and self-reported in-home cannabis smoking. This metric enabled us to partition out the portion of air particle data due to reported in-home cannabis smoking. We used 2 regression modeling approaches to determine both the likelihood of TTE detection and the quantity of TTE in those with detectable TTE. However, our analysis of the quantity of TTE was constrained to children with evidence of exposure, which limited our sample size and likely led to findings that were directional but not statistically significant.

Another methodological strength is the temporal alignment of our exposure and outcome measures. Urine samples, collected on the final day of the pretest week, aligned with the COOH-THC half-life averaging 6 to 7 days. Moreover, parental reports of in-home cannabis smoking, air particle measures, and air nicotine measures also covered that 7-day period.

Our study had several limitations. In-home cannabis smoking could be underreported due to social desirability bias — particularly as non–medical cannabis use was illegal in California when data were collected (2012 to 2016) — potentially underestimating associations between in-home cannabis smoking and child urinary cannabinoids. Nevertheless, our estimates were significant. PFA focused on tobacco, not cannabis, resulting in unmeasured factors that might impact children's cannabis exposure. In-home cannabis smoking can vary in location and frequency (weekly to hourly). Cannabis smoking method, and level of PM 2.5 emissions, differs from joints to blunts to bongs.

### Assessment, detection, and validation of clinical associations of thirdhand smoke exposure (ADVOCATE) study protocol [^112xjXj4]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Adult participants were required to meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment in the trial: (1) parents/legal guardian age ≥ 18 years; 2) if recruited from the PED/UC, the legal guardian had to be accompanying a child 0–11 years of age who presented to the PED/UC with a non-critical condition that did not require immediate care; (3) had lived in their home for at least six months; (4) were able to speak/read English; (5) had a permanent address and a working phone number; and (6) had no plans to move within the next nine months. For children of nonsmoking parents, additional eligibility included (7) having implemented a strict home and car smoking ban for the past > 6 months (to exclude recent SHSe sources); (8) that the child had not been around anyone who smoked ≥ 4 times in the past month; and (9) parents or household members did not use cannabis.

Parent-child dyads were excluded if the: (1) children used tobacco, e-cigarettes, or cannabis; (2) children or parents were unable to complete assessments due to medical, cognitive, or other reasons; and (3) children were immunosuppressed or had malignancies. Notably, prior to recruitment, we planned to exclude parents who were exclusive electronic cigarette users due to differing emission types and use patterns, nicotine content, and exposure patterns. However, after the study started, we elected to include parents who were exclusive electronic cigarette users in the study so that we could conduct exploratory analyses of children who had exclusive secondhand aerosol exposure.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^115wTKEU]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The most common method of cannabis use, smoking, is known to generate emissions, that are harmful to those exposed. Cannabis is often smoked indoors, and nonsmokers such as children are at risk for exposure, even more so now that cannabis use is on the rise among parents with children living at home. While the long-term health consequences of exposure to cannabis smoke are not yet well known, cannabis smoke contains carcinogens, respiratory irritants, and other harmful chemicals. Cannabis smoking also emits large amounts of PM 2.5 (fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters 2.5 μm or below), which negatively impacts cardiovascular and pulmonary healthand correlates with respiratory burden of carbon monoxide and insoluble particulates (tar). Secondhand cannabis smoke (SHCS) is smoke either directly from burned cannabis or from smoker exhalations. SHCS exposure has only recently been objectively quantified through detection of small amounts of cannabinoids in the urine.,

SHCS exposure is often involuntary and those exposed may be especially vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. One small study found child exposure to indoor cannabis smoke to increase the likelihood of reporting adverse health outcomes (emergency department visits, ear infections, bronchitis or bronchiolitis, asthma, or skin conditions) when compared with children with no such exposure), although these results were not statistically significant. Another study found children having caregivers who smoked cannabis had higher rates of viral respiratory infections. Some studies reported a positive association of adverse or problematic cognitive, emotional, or mental health outcomes with pre- and postnatal cannabis smoke exposure. Given children's vulnerability to environmental exposures, studying how their cannabis smoke exposure can be decreased is important.

The principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is (-)-trans-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In the human body, THC is metabolized to 11-hydroxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (OH-THC), and OH-THC is further metabolized to 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (COOH-THC). All 3 cannabinoids, THC, OH-THC, and COOH-THC, can be measured in urine and can be used as biomarkers for cannabis exposure.

Medical toxicologist and metabolite definitions relevant to drug testing are provided: a medical toxicologist is a physician specializing in a medical subspecialty with focused training in diagnosis, management and prevention of adverse health effects due to medications, toxins, biological agents, and clinical evaluation; a metabolite is a product of metabolism, and urine drug tests typically identify the presence of 1 or more metabolites that can originate in a potentially addictive substance.

### Urine drug screening in adolescents [^1138VrgV]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The urine drug screen is an important tool in adolescent medicine. Several ethical, and numerous technical, issues are associated with the use of this tool. The nature and limitations of the specific tests of which the screen is composed must be known to the physician. Two-way communication with the laboratory, both before the test is ordered and after the results are reported, can be very helpful. Laboratory testing cannot substitute for an ongoing therapeutic alliance with the patient. Testing is an important element of the substance use assessment, but is only one element, is not required in every case, and is not sufficient alone in any case.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^114Eq6Mk]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Through the application of 3 distinct measures of cannabis smoking — subjective (self-report), objective (air particle monitor data), and statistically ascertained (integrating self-report and air particle monitor data) — our findings demonstrate a consistent association between in-home cannabis smoking and biological markers (evidenced in urine samples) of SHCS exposure in children residing within these households. Research on cannabis lags more than 50 years behind that of tobacco due to restrictive policies and regulations around cannabis research. There are limited data assessing long-term cannabis smoking health effects, and even fewer assessing SHCS exposure effects. A 2017 studyof young children (aged 1 month to 2 years) who were hospitalized for bronchiolitis in Colorado from 2013 to 2015 found 16% had detectable COOH-THC and 16% reported cannabis use by a caregiver in the home. In a 2021 studyof children aged zero to 3 years who had well-child appointments in the hospital or were in an inpatient unit (in 2017 and 2018), 22% had detectable COOH-THC and 15% of caregivers reported cannabis use by a caregiver in the home. In comparison, 23% of the children in our study had detectable levels of COOH-THC and 11% of parents or guardians reported cannabis was smoked inside the home recently.

As evidence regarding the health effects of cannabis grows, adopting strategies from the tobacco control playbook — eg, comprehensive smoke-free laws and policies for homes, vehicles, workplaces, and public spaces prohibiting indoor use at all times — could safeguard children's health. Among US adults who reported smoking cannabis in the past year, 70% lacked set rules against indoor cannabis smoking in their homes; notably, 13% of these individuals resided with children under age 6 years. The adoption and strict enforcement of household rules forbidding indoor smoking have been shown to deter tobacco smoking within homes with children. Similar measures could be equally effective in preventing cannabis smoking indoors.

### Urinary tetrahydrocannabinol after 4 weeks of a full-spectrum, high-cannabidiol treatment in an open-label clinical trial [^117SRynC]. JAMA Psychiatry (2021). High credibility.

Despite the growing popularity of cannabidiol (CBD) products, specifically those derived from legal industrial hemp sources, few studies have directly assessed whether the use of high-CBD products could yield positive results on urinary drug tests assessing cannabis use through the detection of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) metabolites. A recent short-term administration study found that a single exposure to vaporized CBD-dominant cannabis flower (CBD, 10.5%; Δ9-THC, 0.39%), which the authors noted was similar to hemp, resulted in positive drug test results (> 15 ng/mL) for 2 of 6 participants within 4 to 8 hours of administration. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined drug test results in those consistently using full-spectrum (ie, Δ9-THC–containing) CBD products. Accordingly, as part of an open-label clinical trial examining the use of a full-spectrum high-CBD product for anxiety (with unpublished results as yet), we monitored THC urinary drug status.

### Self-reported and laboratory evaluation of late pregnancy nicotine exposure and drugs of abuse [^11799Bjz]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of late pregnancy nicotine exposures, including secondhand smoke exposures, and to evaluate the associated risk of exposure to drugs of abuse.

Study Design

The study was a retrospective single-center cohort analysis of more than 18 months. We compared self-reported smoking status from vital birth records with mass spectrometry laboratory results of maternal urine using a chi-square test. Logistic regression estimated adjusted odds for detection of drugs of abuse based on nicotine detection.

Results

Compared with 8.6% self-reporting cigarette use, mass spectrometry detected high-level nicotine exposures for 16.5% of 708 women (P < 0.001) and an additional 7.5% with low-level exposures. We identified an increased likelihood of exposure to drugs of abuse, presented as adjusted odds ratios, (95% confidence interval (CI), for both low-level (5.69, CI: 2.09 to 15.46) and high-level (13.93, CI: 7.06 to 27.49) nicotine exposures.

Conclusion

Improved measurement tactics are critically needed to capture late pregnancy primary and passive nicotine exposures from all potential sources.

### Urine drug screening: a valuable office procedure [^111ffj2E]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Urine drug screening can enhance workplace safety, monitor medication compliance, and detect drug abuse. Ordering and interpreting these tests requires an understanding of testing modalities, detection times for specific drugs, and common explanations for false-positive and false-negative results. Employment screening, federal regulations, unusual patient behavior, and risk patterns may prompt urine drug screening. Compliance testing may be necessary for patients taking controlled substances. Standard immunoassay testing is fast, inexpensive, and the preferred initial test for urine drug screening. This method reliably detects morphine, codeine, and heroin; however, it often does not detect other opioids such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, and tramadol. Unexpected positive test results should be confirmed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. A positive test result reflects use of the drug within the previous one to three days, although marijuana can be detected in the system for a longer period of time. Careful attention to urine collection methods can identify some attempts by patients to produce false-negative test results.

### Urine drug screening for isolated marijuana use in labor and delivery units [^117DkNVo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Isolated marijuana use is frequently used as an indication for urine drug screening in labor and delivery units. We aimed to identify the results of urine drug screening in a labor and delivery unit for isolated marijuana use. This retrospective cohort study reviewed data from patients admitted for delivery at an urban academic center from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Patients undergoing urine drug screening for isolated marijuana use were more likely to be younger (median age 25 vs 29 years, P < .001), more often Black (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.58, 95% CI 1.94–3.41), and more likely to have public insurance (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.21–1.95). A few (5/338, 1.5%) urine drug screening tests performed for isolated marijuana use were positive for substances besides marijuana. Most patients (177/197, 89.8%) with a urine drug screening test result that was positive for marijuana were reported to the state child abuse hotline. The utility of isolated marijuana use as a criterion for urine drug screening thus appears limited in benefit but rife with inequitable potential to harm.

### AKI associated with synthetic cannabinoids: a case series [^116sfBGR]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

SPICE, or K2, encompasses preparations of synthetic cannabinoids marketed as incense products, bath additives, and air fresheners and used for recreational purposes. These preparations are usually smoked for their cannabis-like effects and do not appear on routine urine toxicology screens. We report four cases of oliguric AKI associated with SPICE use in previously healthy men. All showed improvement in renal function without need for renal replacement therapy. Renal biopsy, performed in three of the patients, revealed acute tubular necrosis. The close temporal and geographic associations between the clinical presentation and the development of AKI strongly suggest an association between these SPICE preparations and AKI. Further investigations are required to identify the potential nephrotoxic agent(s). Nephrotoxicity from designer drugs should be included in the differential diagnosis of AKI, especially in young adults with negative urine drug screens.

### Retrospective analysis of the diagnostic yield of newborn drug testing [^1124c9KY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, our study demonstrates that maternal history of non-medical drug use and tobacco use in pregnancy were the highest yield risk factors for identifying non-medical drugs in meconium. Inadequate prenatal care and social risk factors were also helpful. Newborn urine drug testing was poor for detecting maternal non-medical drug use and has little diagnostic yield. Meconium drug testing frequently detects prescribed medications, necessitating a thorough review of the pharmacy history. Our results suggest that focused screening criteria based on specific maternal risk factors may detect many prenatal non-medical drug exposures.

### Rational urine drug monitoring in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain: consensus recommendations [^117XnBQb]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Description of UDM Technologies

A presumptive UDM test is a screening immunoassay that is relatively inexpensive, can be used in the office at point of care (POC), and produces a rapid result (e.g. within minutes). Clinicians may be unfamiliar with the characteristics of immunoassays, which have variable sensitivity and specificity (e.g. 0%–50% missed positive results and 11%–100% incorrectly identified positive results across drug classes), and may therefore miss substances that can lead to inaccurate immunoassay results (Figure 1). The classic "urine screen tests" are often enzyme immunoassays that target amphetamines/methamphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, phencyclidine, and opioids (i.e. the "federal five") and are based on a specific antidrug antibody reaction. Opiate immunoassays can more accurately detect naturally occurring opiate alkaloids (i.e. morphine, codeine) than commonly prescribed synthetic (e.g. fentanyl, methadone) and semisynthetic (e.g. buprenorphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone) opioids. Immunoassays are at best semiquantitative (i.e. an estimate of levels only) because of cross-reaction across multiple drugs. Reasonably sensitive options are now available for testing many common drug classes.

### A urinary test procedure for identification of cannabidiol in patients undergoing medical therapy with marijuana [^115XXJ2e]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Marijuana is classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule I controlled substance. Marijuana is complex, having some 480 natural components and more than 100 cannabinoids. Of the cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most prevalent cannabinoids, respectively. The plant, marijuana, and its components are classified as Schedule I. Exceptions are the synthetic cannabinoids, dronabinol (Marinol), a Schedule III compound, and nabilone, which is Schedule II. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a substance having "no currently accepted medical use in the USA, a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse". A few examples of drugs included in the Schedule I list, in addition to marijuana, are heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide, 3,4-methylenedioxym-ethylamphetamine (ecstasy), and peyote. Paradoxically, 23 states and the District of Columbiahave recognized that marijuana has therapeutic benefits and have considered the risk for abuse as an acceptable level of risk. Additionally, 17 states have approved CBD for medical use. This change in the legal status has been substantially driven by voter referendum rather than by scientific studies that have been described as "thin and conflicting". Effectively, this means that these initiatives have been the result of personal choices rather than systematic law based on a substantial body of accepted medical evidence.

Procedure

Participants gave written, informed consent on both testing days and were paid at the end of the second day. They were texted 24 h before each testing day to remind them to abstain from using alcohol or other drugs from then until after testing had finished. On the intoxicated test day (before testing), participants gave a urine sample. Prior to testing they also provided a 0.3 g sample of the cannabis they were about to smoke and testing began immediately after the participant had finished smoking it. On the non-intoxicated day, a hair sample was taken from each participant of which 3 cm (from the scalp) was analysed. Researchers were fully trained to administer and score clinician-rated as well as other measures.

Purpose and triggers for definitive urine drug testing (UDT) clarify that "Presumptive UDT is typically requested by a clinician caring for a patient when there is a need for swift access to results that can be promptly integrated into the clinical evaluation and treatment decisions", whereas "Definitive UDT is considered justifiable and essential when the clinical context provides strong support for the need for comprehensive testing". Situations include when "There's a requirement to identify a specific substance or metabolite not adequately detected by a presumptive UDT screen", the need "to definitively pinpoint specific drugs within a broad drug category", identification of agents such as "fentanyl, meperidine, synthetic cannabinoids, and other synthetic or analog drugs" that "aren't typically detected by presumptive UDT", when "Precise drug concentrations are needed to guide patient management (e.g., discontinuing THC use as part of a treatment plan)", when "A presumptive UDT result contradicts a patient's self-report, clinical presentation, medical history, or current prescribed pain medication plan", when "There's a need to eliminate the possibility of an error as the cause of a presumptive UDT result", when "Non-prescribed medication or illicit substance use needs to be identified for the safe ongoing prescribing or other interventions", and because "Definitive UDT is essential for conducting a thorough assessment of medication effectiveness, side effects, or potential drug interactions". The decision "should be guided by patient-specific considerations", and "the clinician's rationale for ordering definitive UDT and the chosen tests must be documented in the patient's medical record".

### Self-reported use of tobacco, E-cigarettes, and marijuana versus urinary biomarkers [^113me1So]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surveys have been instrumental in describing adolescent use of tobacco, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and marijuana. However, objective biomarker data are lacking. We compared adolescent self-reported use to urinary biomarkers.

Methods

From April 2017 to April 2018, adolescents 12 to 21 years old completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding tobacco, e-cigarette, and marijuana use and provided a urine sample. Urine was analyzed for biomarkers cotinine, total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol, and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA).

Results

Of 517 participants, 2.9% reported using tobacco, 14.3% e-cigarettes, and 11.4% marijuana in the past week. Only 2% reporting no smoking had total 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol levels above cutoff (14.5 pg/mL); 2% of non-e-cigarette users had cotinine above cutoff (10 ng/mL); 2% of those denying marijuana use had THCA above cutoff (10 ng/mL). Daily e-cigarette users showed significantly higher median cotinine than nondaily users (315.4 [interquartile range (IQR) 1375.9] vs 1.69 ng/mL [IQR 28.2]; P < .003). Overall, 40% who reported using nicotine-free products had cotinine > 10 ng/mL. Pod users' median cotinine was significantly higher than in nonpod users (259.03 [IQR 1267.69] vs 1.61 ng/mL [IQR 16.3]; P < .003). Median THCA among daily marijuana users was higher than in nondaily users (560.1 [IQR 1248.3] vs 7.2 ng/mL [IQR 254.9]; p = 0.04). Sixty-one percent of those with cotinine > 10 ng/mL vs 39% of those with cotinine < 10 ng/mL had THCA > 10 ng/mL (P < .001).

Conclusions

Adolescents' self-report correlated with measured urinary biomarkers, but subjects were unaware of their nicotine exposure. More frequent e-cigarette and pod use correlated with elevated biomarkers. Co-use of tobacco, e-cigarettes, and marijuana was corroborated by higher THCA in those with higher cotinine.

### Cannabis use as a risk factor for causing motor vehicle crashes: a prospective study [^116qrZiC]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The legal status of cannabis is changing rapidly. Cannabis has been legal for medical use in Canada since 2001, and 25 US States have legalized or decriminalized medical cannabis 1. At present, four US states and several countries have gone further and legalized cannabis for recreational use. The Canadian government recently legalized the production, possession, distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational use.

Cannabis contains more than 60 cannabinoids, but most impairing effects are caused by Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 2, the main psychoactive compound. After smoking a 'joint', whole blood THC levels typically peak at > 100 ng/ml within 15 minutes and then drop rapidly, so that THC is usually < 2 ng/ml within 4 hours after a single acute exposure 3. Psychotrophic effects typically peak at 20–30 minutes and resolve by 4 hours. Ingesting cannabis delays the onset and extends the duration of effect. The main THC metabolite, 11‐nor‐9‐carboxy‐delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC‐COOH), is not psychoactive and persists in blood and urine long after impairment has resolved. Thus, THC‐COOH provides evidence of previous cannabis exposure but does not necessarily indicate impairment or recent use. Urine tests for cannabis measure THC‐COOH, and cannot confirm recent use 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. THC is also found in oral fluid of cannabis users due to local absorption of THC in the oral cavity during smoking 13, 14. Oral fluid is easier to obtain than blood and is useful for screening 15, 16, 17, but THC concentration in oral fluid correlates poorly with blood level or impairment 17, 18, 19, and blood is considered to be the best medium for measuring THC in the impairing range 20.

### BACKGROUND: stacks… [^115SZmYg]. stacks.cdc.gov (2019). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers of exposure to marijuana smoke can be detected in the urine of children with exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke, but the prevalence is unclear. 20 Research data shows that there is a higher prevalence of detectable urinary marijuana smoke metabolites among children whose parents are tobacco smokers than children whose parents are nonsmokers. This raises concern as children with dual exposure to tobacco and marijuana smoke could be at a higher risk for damaging effects of smoke exposure and adverse health outcomes. As secondhand tobacco smoke exposure is highest among low-income individuals, African Americans, and children under the age of 11 years, 7, 13, 21 these vulnerable groups may be at higher risk for exposure to smoke from marijuana as well.
22. A urine sample was obtained from the child using a collection bag or cotton balls placed in the child's diaper. The cotton balls were then removed, and urine was extracted using a syringe.

About 2ml of urine was collected from each participant and stored at −80 °C immediately. These samples were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for measuring biomarkers of exposure to marijuana and tobacco smoke. Analysis of urinary biomarkers of marijuana and tobacco exposure Cannabinoids and their metabolites were measured using a modification of the method by Wei et al. THC and CBN are rapidly metabolized and indicate active or recent exposure, while COOH-THC, a metabolite of THC, has a longer half-life and is a more sensitive measure for detecting intermittent exposure. 28 The urinary cannabinoid method was adequately sensitive to detect recent secondhand or thirdhand exposure to marijuana smoke.
29. Of the 53 participants with urine samples, 51 subjects had sufficient remaining urine for analysis for cotinine levels. Forty-six had detectable urinary cotinine levels ranging from 0. 045 to
19. 4 ng/ml with a geometric mean of 0. 77 ±
2. 23 ng/ml.

Fifteen had urinary cotinine ≥ 2. 0 ng/ml, suggesting high levels of tobacco smoke exposure. High levels of tobacco smoke exposure was significantly associated with COOH-THC detection in urine families reported living in an apartment or other attached housing. Half of families living in attached housing who were aware of their housing smoking polices reported that smoking is not allowed at all (.

Materials and methods

Subjects

The urine samples were from participants who were non-smokers, cigarette smokers and electronic cigarette users. Participants were recruited through local media and flyers posted in various locations around the Buffalo, New York area. Potential participants were provided with a brief description of the study and had an opportunity to ask questions about the study procedures. All potential participants were screened over the phone for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The exclusion criteria included concurrent use of smokeless tobacco, pipes or cigars; alcohol or illicit drug dependence within the past 6 months or current illicit drug use (including marijuana; self-reported); psychiatric illness; and use of nicotine replacement therapy. Information about medication and vitamins/antioxidants/metal usage was not collected. All eligible subjects who had been asked to come to the clinic for screening were given an informed consent form to read and sign. Copies of the signed consent forms were given to the research subject and were also stored in a secure location, along with the participant's research chart. Informed written consent was obtained from each participant prior to their participation. Eligible participants were then asked to come to Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center for a one-time visit, which lasted approximately 1 hour. Spot urine samples were collected during this on-site visit. The Roswell Park Institutional Review Board (IRB) had reviewed all procedures prior to implementation (protocol number I 247313).

### Secondhand marijuana smoke is not benign [^115J6Zhw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Certainly this study raises concerns about the potential for SHMS to impact cardiovascular health in adults and provides a potential etiology for the prior finding that marijuana use increases the risk of heart attack after use. 5 And Wang et al make an important call for further research to be done into the impact of SHMS. However, there are several other, related issues that this research can inform.

First, because marijuana use is limited to private homes and apartments, we in the public health community have a significant concern about the impact on other residents in multiunit housing (MUH). Studies have demonstrated that tobacco smoke can infiltrate adjacent apartments 6 and that residents in MUH have high rates of exposure to nicotine. 7 We found that children in MUH were significantly more likely to have tobacco smoke exposure, even if they lived in a nonsmoking household. 8 There is no reason to suspect that SHMS would be less likely to diffuse into adjacent apartments, and this study highlights the potential risk to other residents, especially those who are elderly, disabled, have heart disease, or are children. As more MUH residences restrict tobacco smoking, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development examines whether to ban smoking in publically funded MUH, 9 we should make sure that marijuana smoking is also included.

The impact on pregnant women and the developing fetus is also a significant concern. It has been very difficult to study the impact of marijuana smoking on the fetus because even in states where recreational marijuana is legal, there are still laws on the books requiring referral to child protective services for a positive marijuana screen at birth. However, medical marijuana is being touted in the lay literature as a treatment for morning sickness, 10 and at least some dispensaries are recommending marijuana to pregnant women as an alternative to drugs for nausea and pain. In 2015 the Colorado Legislature voted down a bill that would have required marijuana dispensaries to post signs warning pregnant women of the potential dangers to their unborn child. The current study suggests that a pregnant women who smokes marijuana, or who is even exposed by a friend or partner, could impact circulation to the fetus, with unknown effects. This would be an excellent area of study for animal models. We know that smoking and SHS exposure in pregnancy have long‐lasting effects on children's immune system, lung function, and cognitive development 11; we need to ensure that we place the same scrutiny on marijuana.

### Notes from the field: E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury cases during the COVID-19 response-California, 2020 [^116h45BV]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

In April 2020, during the early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, eight patients hospitalized with e-cigarette, or vaping, product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) were reported to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Patients resided in five counties and were aged 14–50 years (median = 17 years); seven were aged < 21 years. All hospitalizations occurred in April 2020, a median of 4 days (range = 4–13 days) after symptom onset. Four patients were admitted to an intensive care unit; two required mechanical ventilation. Nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was performed on all patients at the time of hospitalization; all tests yielded negative results. Seven patients were tested two or more times, and lower respiratory tract specimens were tested from the intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Patients met California and CDC EVALI case definitions, including negative respiratory pathogen testing and chest imaging findings consistent with EVALI (Box). * Health care providers first documented suspicion for EVALI in their notes on hospital days 1–8 (median = day 3), after testing for SARS-CoV-2 returned negative results. Six patients reported vaping tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products, one reported vaping only nicotine-containing products, and one did not specify products vaped. Seven patients had positive test results for THC on urine drug screen; one patient not tested by urine drug screen reported vaping THC. No epidemiologic links were identified among the patients. Two patients reported obtaining their vaping products from friends; six patients were not asked or did not disclose vaping product source. Recreational cannabis use is legal in California for adults aged ≥ 21 years. Products might have been acquired from informal or unlicensed sources by patients aged < 21 years who reported THC product use.

### Exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke among children [^111PAonr]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

While a few studies have described COOH-THC in children's urine and parental report of cannabis smoking around the children, they did not quantify the relationship between in-home cannabis smoking and urinary cannabis biomarkers. These studies depended exclusively on the measurement of urinary COOH-THC, the primary metabolite of THC in urine. Additional biomarkers of exposure, such as THC and OH-THC, may help produce better estimates of total exposure. This study assessed the association between in-home cannabis smoking and SHCS exposure in resident children as assessed by urinary cannabinoid levels (THC, OH-THC, and COOH-THC).
