## Question

A 23-year-old woman presents with a painless, transilluminant swelling in the right inguinal region extending to the labia majora. Ultrasound shows a simple fluid collection along the round ligament, consistent with a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in a 23-year-old woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and its female-specific embryology. Then, I should verify the most specific ICD-10-CM code that captures a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. Next, I will check whether laterality is required and, if so, how to encode right-sided disease. Finally, I will consider alternatives if the exact term is not found and confirm the final code with coding principles and references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its specificity. A hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is a female homologue of a patent processus vaginalis with a fluid collection along the round ligament extending to the labia majora; ultrasound typically shows a simple fluid collection and confirms the diagnosis, which aligns with the clinical scenario described [^ea29e29b] [^3243e6c9] [^491eba20].

> Now, I need to check the ICD-10-CM index and code set for the most specific match. Wait, let me verify the exact phrasing: the Index to Diseases directs "Hydrocele, canal of Nuck" to code N94.89, which is the most specific available code for this entity in ICD-10-CM, and there is no more granular subcategory listed for canal of Nuck hydrocele specifically [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify whether laterality is required for this code. N94.89 sits within the N94 category, which does not carry a 7th-character requirement for laterality; laterality is not built into N94.89, so I should not append a side indicator or placeholder X here, even though ICD-10-CM supports laterality in other categories where it is explicitly required [^c5bd4139] [^5e1c6ada].

> But wait, what if I considered a hernia code instead, given the inguinolabial location? Let me reconsider: a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is a cystic fluid collection from a patent processus vaginalis rather than a hernia with solid content, so using an inguinal hernia code would be inaccurate; the correct approach is to stay with the hydrocele-specific code rather than forcing a hernia diagnosis code for billing purposes [^ea29e29b] [^3243e6c9].

> I should double-check that there isn't a more specific congenital anomaly code that fits better. Initially, I wondered about Q52.4 for congenital cyst of canal of Nuck, but wait, I need to ensure validity: Q52.4 refers to congenital cysts of the canal of Nuck, which would apply if the condition were documented as congenital; however, in adults presenting de novo, N94.89 remains the appropriate clinical diagnosis code unless the record explicitly states a congenital origin, so I should not default to Q52.4 without supporting documentation [^notfound].

> Final answer: I will use N94.89 for "Hydrocele of canal of Nuck", documenting the laterality in the clinical note even though it is not encoded in the ICD-10-CM code itself, and I will avoid adding a 7th character or placeholder since none is required for this category [^notfound].

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in a 23-year-old female is **N94.89** (Other specified conditions associated with female genital organs and menstrual cycle). This code applies to female hydroceles and should be used when the condition is not congenital; if congenital, use **Q52.4** (Congenital cyst of canal of Nuck). Accurate documentation of the diagnosis and laterality supports correct coding and billing [^d495525c].

## ICD-10-CM code for hydrocele of the canal of Nuck

The ICD-10-CM code for hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in a 23-year-old female is **N94.89** — Other specified conditions associated with female genital organs and menstrual cycle [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and documentation requirements

Accurate documentation is essential for correct coding and billing. The following details should be recorded in the patient's medical record:

- **Diagnosis**: Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck.
- **Laterality**: Right inguinal region extending to the labia majora.
- **Clinical findings**: Painless, transilluminant swelling.
- **Imaging findings**: Ultrasound showing a simple fluid collection along the round ligament.

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes

If the hydrocele is congenital, the appropriate ICD-10-CM code is **Q52.4** — Congenital cyst of canal of Nuck. However, in this case, the patient is 23 years old, and the condition is not specified as congenital; therefore, **N94.89** is the appropriate code.

---

## Conclusion

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a 23-year-old female with a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is **N94.89**. Accurate documentation of the diagnosis, laterality, and clinical findings is essential for proper coding and billing.

### Canal of nuck abnormalities [^ea29e29b]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Canal of Nuck abnormalities are underrecognized causes of labial masses with potential adverse outcomes. The 2 main categories of canal of Nuck abnormalities are hernias and hydroceles. There are 3 types of canal of Nuck hydroceles: communicating, encysted, and bilocular. Canal of Nuck hernia contents vary, but those containing ovaries need urgent medical attention because of an increased risk of ischemia. Ultrasound can establish a definite diagnosis in all cases. This article reviews the embryologic characteristics, anatomy, pathologic characteristics, and imaging features of these abnormalities while providing a clear pictorial depiction of various unique hernias and hydroceles seen with this entity.

### Hydroceles-not just for men [^87121757]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hydroceles develop in females through the canal of Nuck. This canal is formed when the processes vaginalis fails to obliterate during development. The canal of Nuck can lead to the formation of not only hydroceles, but hernias as well. Although physicians typically think of hydroceles occurring in males, on rare occasions, they do occur in females because of this defect. They are often mistaken for incarcerated hernias, making ultrasound an excellent tool to distinguish between them and guide further treatment.

Case Report

We report a rare case of a 46-year-old female with the chief complaint of a painful groin mass. A diagnosis of a hydrocele was made by point of care ultrasonography in the emergency department after being misdiagnosed by computed tomography scan on two previous occasions. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a valuable tool for emergency physicians and can lead to quick diagnoses and appropriate management of the patient. Using ultrasound in conjunction with other imaging modalities can improve diagnostic accuracy. POCUS is portable and a powerful tool for immediate answers, and continues to prove its utility for clinical decision making.

### Multimodality imaging features of canal-of-nuck hydrocele in adults [^3243e6c9]. Clinical Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Canal of Nuck abnormalities are common in pediatric population but may rarely present in adults. Hydrocele of the Canal of Nuck is the most common presentation in adult population. These may be symptomatic or found incidentally on imaging. We review the embryology and present imaging features of Canal of Nuck hydroceles in this case-based review article, and highlight the features on various imaging modalities, such as ultrasound, CT (Computed Tomography), MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography). Radiologists should be aware of these findings in their practice and be able to recognize these congenital abnormalities.

### Hydrocele of the canal of nuck: value of radiological diagnosis [^b755cf0b]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck (cyst of the canal of Nuck) is the female homologue of hydrocele of the spermatic cord in males and is a rarely encountered entity, mostly diagnosed on the operating table at the time of suspected inguinal hernia surgery, as the clinical presentation usually is subtle and inconclusive. Diagnosis is mainly by ultrasound and has shown varied presentation of the same over the years. We discuss the sonographic findings of a case of hydrocele of the canal of Nuck.

### Canal of nuck hernia: a multimodality imaging review [^22dbc30f]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Canal of Nuck abnormalities are a rare but important cause of morbidity in girls, most often those younger than 5 years of age. The canal of Nuck, which is the female equivalent of the male processus vaginalis, is a protrusion of parietal peritoneum that extends through the inguinal canal and terminates in the labia majora. The canal typically obliterates early in life, but in some cases the canal can partially or completely fail to close, potentially resulting in a hydrocele or hernia of pelvic contents. Recognition of this entity is especially important in cases of ovarian hernia due to the risk of incarceration and torsion. We aim to increase awareness of this condition by reviewing the embryology, anatomy and diagnosis of canal of Nuck disorders with imaging findings on US, CT and MRI using several cases from a single institution.

### Hydrocele in the canal of nuck-CT appearance of a developmental groin anomaly [^e030d6b6]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Hydrocele in the Canal of Nuck is a condition of female fetal development. The Canal of Nuck is a patent tubular peritoneal fold that travels with the round ligament to its attachment on the labia major. Failure of complete obliteration of the Canal of Nuck during fetal development predisposes females to development of a hydrocele or an inguinal hernia during post-pubertal or adult stages. We present a case of a 21 year old female with a tender reducible labial mass diagnosed as a Hydrocele in the Canal of Nuck.

### Rare encounter: hydrocoele of canal of nuck in a Scottish rural hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic [^88b8f473]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We report the case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with reducible indirect inguinal hernia and a challenging constellation of symptoms, signs and radiographic findings. Surgical approach superseded conservative management when the patient's abdomen became acute, with a rising lactate and haemodynamic instability. Specifically, the presence of a fluid collection was concerning for sinister acute pathology. Our patient was rediagnosed intraoperatively with hydrocoele of canal of Nuck. This so-called 'female hydrocoele' is an eponymous anatomical rarity in general surgery, presenting as an inguinolabial swelling with variable clinical profile. Hydrocoele of canal of Nuck takes origin from failure of transitory reproductive anlagen to regress and is thus analogous to patent processus vaginalis. Its true incidence is speculative, with just several hundred cases globally. We aim to provide insights into surgical patient management for a rare entity during the COVID-19 outbreak, from the unique perspective of a small rural hospital in Scotland.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Sonographic appearance of canal of nuck hydrocele [^b9d9e81e]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

We present a case of a relatively uncommon entity in a 17-year-old girl who presented to the emergency department with right inguinal pain and discomfort. On sonography, she was thought to have a hydrocele of a patent processus vaginalis, although differentials could not be excluded. The hydrocele was subsequently confirmed at surgery. Because this is an uncommonly reported condition, a high index of suspicion must be maintained in the appropriate clinical setting. We present various sonographic appearances and techniques that have been proposed in the literature.

### Hydrocele of the canal of nuck presenting as a sausage-shaped mass [^491eba20]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old woman presented with a painless vulval swelling. On physical examination, a soft fluctuant sausage-shaped mass was found, measuring approximately 4cm, extending from the right inguinal region to the labia majora. Ultrasound revealed a well-defined hypoechoic elongated mass, septated, extending from the superficial inguinal canal to labia majora. Sonographic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. Surgical exploration revealed an elongated cystic lesion with a total length of 13cm, mucous component and internal septations. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the suspected diagnosis.

### Canal of nuck abnormalities in pediatric female patients [^dd01b42f]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

A groin lump is not an uncommon condition in girls and female infants, and US plays a fundamental role in its exploration. The main pathologic conditions are related to the failure of obliteration of the canal of Nuck. Radiologists should gain a full understanding of the embryology and US anatomy of the inguinal canal before assessing this entity for the first time. An optimal age-adjusted US technique-including examinations at rest and during straining-is essential to help assess the canal of Nuck, diagnose a hernia, and analyze its content. The radiologist must be aware of the various types of hernial content depending on the patient's age, including intestinal, omental, ovarian, or tubouterine hernia, and the US features of each. Incarcerated hernias are common in girls and mostly contain an ovary. In such cases, it is crucial to screen for US signs suggestive of ovarian ischemic damage, thereby calling for urgent surgery. US can also depict a cyst or hydrocele of the canal of Nuck and its complications. Moreover, other rare pathologic conditions involving the inguinal area may be depicted at US, which helps guide appropriate treatment. US is the ideal modality for evaluating an inguinal lump in girls and female infants. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2022.

### A cautionary approach to adult female groin swelling: hydrocoele of the canal of nuck with a review of the literature [^e2b07652]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Hydrocoele of the canal of Nuck in an adult female is a rare entity and analogous to hydrocoele in males. Its usual presentation is in children, and its occurrence in adults is very uncommon, more so of the hour-glass variety. We report a case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with a right inguinal swelling of 3-month duration. On physical examination, the swelling was non-tender, cystic and irreducible. There was no cough impulse. Ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT revealed a cystic swelling with clear contents in the right inguinal region. Surgery was performed with excision of the cyst. The histopathology report suggested flat mesothelium cells, confirming the diagnosis.

### Uterus and ovary hernia of the canal of nuck [^32ec7dd7]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Hernia of the canal of Nuck is a rare condition occurring in female infants. The canal of Nuck is a portion of the processus vaginalis of the peritoneum within the inguinal canal. The processus vaginalis is an evagination of parietal peritoneum of the embryonic lower anterior abdominal wall that passes into the inguinal canal. Normally, it loses its connection with the peritoneal cavity, but when it fails to close a hydrocele or hernia may result. We present a 2-month-old girl with a palpable movable mass in the right inguinal region. Ultrasonography revealed a hernia containing uterus and ovary. Ultrasonography is the examination of choice in female infants with a pathological mass in the groin. Its availability and accuracy facilitate diagnosis and proper surgical treatment.

### Hydrocele and endometriosis of the canal of nuck in two adults: a look at the imaging features [^a341266f]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We present a report of two adult females who presented to the surgery clinic at different time frames in our hospital with a swelling in the inguinal region. The swelling was painful for one of our patients. The first patient was evaluated with a contrast-enhanced CT and an MRI, while the second patient underwent a ultrasonography and an MRI. Imaging revealed the structure to be cystic in nature and confirmed the diagnosis as a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck in both patients. Our second patient was also found to have concomitant endometriosis, with internal septations seen in the hydrocele. Aspiration revealed altered blood with haemosiderin deposition, which established a diagnosis of endometriosis of the canal of Nuck. The first patient underwent excision, while the second patient refused a surgical approach and opted for medical management for endometriosis.

### The challenging sonographic inguinal canal evaluation in neonates and children: an update of differential diagnoses [^f3cfc9a4]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Bulging of the inguinal region is a frequent complaint in the pediatric population and sonographic findings can be challenging for radiologists. In this review we update the sonographic findings of the most common disorders that affect the inguinal canal in neonates and children, with a focus on the processus vaginalis abnormalities such as congenital hydroceles, indirect inguinal hernias and cryptorchidism, illustrated with cases collected at a quaternary hospital during a 7-year period. We emphasize the importance of correctly classifying different types of congenital hydrocele and inguinal hernia to allow for early surgical intervention when necessary. We have systematically organized and illustrated all types of congenital hydrocele and inguinal hernias based on embryological, anatomical and pathophysiological findings to assist readers in the diagnosis of even complex cases of inguinal canal ultrasound evaluation in neonates and children. We also present rare diagnoses such as the abdominoscrotal hydrocele and the herniation of uterus and ovaries into the canal of Nuck.

### Anatomy and pathology of the canal of nuck [^82b5c274]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The canal of Nuck is the female equivalent of the processus vaginalis in the male but is less well known than its male counterpart. It is a rare entity not commonly encountered by radiologists, particularly in the adult population. Knowledge of the embryology and anatomy of the canal of Nuck is essential for identification of the various pathologic conditions that may occur in this location. Moreover, radiologists should be familiar with this entity to compose an appropriate and thorough differential diagnosis of a labial mass/swelling. In this review, we discuss both the anatomy and the more common pathology that can be encountered within it.

### What is inside the hernia sac? [^5811ecfd]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Hernias are a common problem in general surgery and about 75% of them occur in the inguinal region.

An indirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia, irrespective of the gender, and strangulation is its most dreadful complication, occurring in 1–3% of the cases, especially in the extremes of age.

However, every once in a while, surgeons are surprised by the intraoperatory findings when performing a common procedure such as an inguinal hernia repair.

Case presentation

An 89-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain and a lump in her inguinal left region, since that morning. She had no symptom of bowel movements changes or fever.

The patient had recently been discharged from the internal medicine ward after a urinary tract infection and a perianal abscess treated after a 1-week antibiotic course.

She also suffered from chronic renal disease, chronic anaemia, high-blood pressure, cerebral vascular disease (with left hemiparesis after an ischaemic vascular accident) and dyslipidaemia.

Physical examination revealed a calm, awaked but disoriented patient. She was slightly dehydrated, haemodynamically well and afebrile. Her abdomen was diffusely painful, with rebound tenderness, especially in the lower quadrants. In the left inguinal region, a painful tense mass, of nearly 5 cm was documented. No inflammatory signs were visible and no external genitalia anomalies were found. Laboratory results were within normal ranges.

An incarcerated inguinal/femoral hernia was the initial hypothesis and so a pelvic ultrasound (US) was requested.

Investigations

The attending radiologist performed an US scan and complemented it with a pelvic CT scan (figures 1–3). On the left femoral duct, a well-defined, fine-walled, non-pure cystic formation was identified; admitting the continuity with the intestinal segment, the possibility of an incarcerated femoral hernia was considered. The same formation also appeared to be in continuity with the round ligament, suggesting the presence of canal of Nuck cyst.

### Cyst of the canal of nuck: an atypical course with cyclic changing of size [^7391821b]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

As the canal of Nuck normally obliterates before birth, a patent canal is a rare anatomic variant in adult women analogue to the patent processus vaginalis in men. In a patent canal of Nuck, pathologies such as hernias and cyst can build within time. Such cysts themselves are so uncommon that they are mostly described in case reports. Normally, cysts of the canal of Nuck present as a consistent, inguinal swelling with or without pain. Interestingly, in our case, the painful swelling was cyclic changing from the size of a plum to being clinically undetectable within the course of a day. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of such an unusual course. The cyst was removed operatively via an open approach. The spasms declined shortly after the operation. At 1 year postoperatively, the patient was still asymptomatic.

### Incidental findings in female pelvis MRI performed for gynaecological malignancies [^334420a9]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Nuck cyst

The canal of Nuck (CN) is an extension of the parietal peritoneum that follows the inguinal canal alongside the round ligament of the uterus, extending into the labia majora. Normally, the CN undergoes complete obliteration within the first year of life. However, when the canal remains patent, abnormalities can arise. The most common abnormality in adults is the encysted hydrocele, which results from partial closure of the CN at its proximal and distal ends, leaving a patent central portion.

On MRI, Nuck cysts appear as fluid-filled structures with thin walls and variable shape (round, elongated, comma-shaped, cyst-in-cyst appearance) showing high SI on T2-WI (Fig. 2).

Surgical excision with ligation of the processus vaginalis neck at the deep inguinal ring represents the treatment of choice for symptomatic Nuck cysts, while conservative treatment may be an option for asymptomatic patients.

Urachal carcinoma

Malignant urachal carcinomas are rare, with an incidence of 0.18 per 100,000 individuals annually. They represent approximately 0.2% of bladder cancers, with men being affected twice as often as women. Adenocarcinoma accounts for more than 80% of these tumours.

Urachal carcinomas originate from urachal remnants and are typically located in the juxtavesical portion of the urachus. These lesions tend to invade the bladder dome but exhibit more prominent extravesical growth compared to non-urachal bladder cancers. Urachal carcinoma is usually clinically silent in early stages; when symptomatic, haematuria — due to bladder wall invasion — and a palpable pelvic mass are the most common clinical findings.

On MRI, urachal carcinomas appear as large, heterogeneous masses, with irregular margins, and an avidly enhancing solid component. Areas of high SI on T2-WI can be found due to mucin content. Peripheral calcifications, found in up to 70% of cases, are considered pathognomonic.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management… [^6b07e0bd]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Management In 2018, various international societies reviewed the literature and created guidelines for the management of groin hernias. The group received direct financial support from hernia mesh manufacturers Bard and Johnson & Johnson. The HerniaSurge group classifies management into two major categories: conservative and surgical. 18, 19. CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men if the patient's usual activities are not limited by pain and discomfort and there is no difficulty reducing the hernia. 20 Surgical intervention should be initiated if pain develops. Watchful waiting is not recommended in nonpregnant women because of the higher likelihood of femoral hernias, which are associated with a higher risk of strangulation. 21 Watchful waiting is also not recommended for symptomatic hernias because of a higher risk of incarceration.
19.

Abdominal contents becoming trapped within the hernial sac, leading to incarceration, is a risk of watchful waiting. Over time, this can impede the blood flow in the incarcerated hernial contents. Richter hernia, a rare complication with a high mortality rate, occurs when part of the intestinal circumference is entrapped and strangulated in the hernial sac. 22 The HerniaSurge guideline recommends that physicians counsel patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias about the expected natural course of the condition and the risks of emergency surgery. 19 Family physicians may choose to refer patients to or work closely with a surgeon during the conservative management timeframe, which includes regular follow-up to monitor for development of symptoms and to continue surveillance for underlying diagnoses that may have contributed to the hernia. The best interval for follow-up during watchful waiting is unclear.

Watchful waiting is also commonly used in pregnant patients because groin swelling can be caused by self-limited round ligament varicosities. 23 Color flow Doppler imaging can be used to distinguish between a true hernia and round ligament varicosities. In a 2017 cohort study of 20, 714 pregnant patients, only 25 had inguinal hernias and none underwent elective or emergency hernia repair during pregnancy. In 10 patients, the groin bulge disappeared spontaneously after delivery. 24 For reducible inguinal hernias in pregnant patients, it seems safe and cost-effective to wait until after delivery to attempt repair. SURGICAL MANAGEMENT The choice of surgical technique for repairing an inguinal hernia depends on factors such as anesthesia accessibility, the surgeon's preference and training, patient preference, cost, availability of mesh, and other logistics.

Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Surgical interventions can be categorized as open anterior repair, open posterior repair, tension-free mesh repair, and laparoscopic repair. Although nonmesh techniques have fallen out of favor in the United States, they are still acceptable internationally. Mesh techniques are strongly recommended because of lower recurrence rates compared with nonmesh techniques. 19 If mesh is unavailable, a 2009 European guideline suggests that an open anterior nonmesh technique is most favorable. 19, 25. The use of laparoscopic techniques has been shown to be superior to tension-free mesh repair for postoperative pain outcomes. 19 Common laparoscopic techniques include the total extraperitoneal approach and transabdominal preperitoneal approach.

### A review of classification, diagnosis, and management of hydrocele [^53a013fd]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This article summarizes and updates a number of issues related to hydrocele including anatomy, embryology, classification, etiology, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and management. Hydrocele is an abnormal collection of serous fluid between the parietal and visceral layers arising from the mesothelial lining of the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testis and spermatic cord directly. Hydroceles result from an imbalance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid from the tunica vaginalis. Hydroceles can be divided into two types as primary and secondary. The diagnosis should be based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and imaging studies. Understanding the causes and types of hydroceles is useful for accurately diagnosing and treatment strategy. Hydroceles can be managed by conservative treatment, fluid aspiration, or hydrocelectomy.

### A comparative study of smooth muscle cell characteristics and myofibroblasts in processus vaginalis of pediatric inguinal hernia, hydrocele and undescended testis [^bc7615d5]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inguinal hernia, undescended testis (UDT) and hydrocele are common conditions that need pediatric surgical consultation during childhood. The overall incidence of inguinal hernias is 5% for males. Inguinal hernia is 5 to 10 times more common in males than females. Bilateral inguinal hernias are seen in 10% of patients. Undescended testis occurs in approximately 3% of term male infants but in preterm, the incidence rises to 33–45%. Most testes descend within the first 6–12 months and the incidence of undescended testis decreases to 1% at one year. Congenital hydrocele typically resolves by two years of age, so surgery is not recommended in the first 2 years of life unless the hydrocele is communicating. Hydroceles that persist beyond 2 years of age require operation.

Congenital inguinal hernia and hydrocele are associated with patent processus vaginalis. Although the processus vaginalis is also patent in children with undescended testis, clinical inguinal hernia is rare and is encountered in approximately 10–15% of cases. The processus vaginalis is an evagination of the peritoneum through the deep inguinal ring. It can first be identified during the third month of gestation. The intra-abdominal testis passes through the processus vaginalis during the inguinoscrotal phase of testicular descent in the seventh to ninth months of gestation. Following this, the portion of processus vaginalis lying above the testicle obliterates, thereby closing the internal inguinal ring. In females, the canal of Nuck corresponds to the processus vaginalis and it communicates with the labia majora. The canal of Nuck closes approximately at the seventh month of gestation.

### Sonography of female genital hernias presenting as labia majora masses [^0aecd99c]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Inguinal herniation of the ovary or uterus presenting as a labia majora mass is a rare congenital condition that may be complicated by strangulation, torsion, and infertility. A labial mass in a prepubertal female patient can represent an inguinal hernia, a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, a congenital labial cyst, leiomyoma, an abscess, lipoma, or lymphangioma. With a large differential diagnosis and an often limited physical examination, imaging plays an importance diagnostic role. We present 3 cases in which a labial mass contained an ovary alone and both ovaries and the uterus. We demonstrate sonographic findings and discuss the utility of sonography in the diagnosis of genital hernias and in detecting potential complications.

Methods

Clinical data

This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the participating hospitals. All surgeries were performed either by attending physicians or residents under the supervision of senior surgeons. Between January 2017 and December 2020, a total of 5244 PIH repairs were performed using the SPLPEC technique at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Second Hospital Hebei Medical University. Among these cases, 30 experienced postoperative recurrence and were assigned to the SPLPEC group. From January 2015 to December 2020, 6054 PIH surgeries were performed using the TPLIS technique at Capital Center for Children's Health, Capital Medical University. Of these, 35 cases developed postoperative recurrence and were assigned to the TPLIS group (figure 1). Clinical data from all participating hospitals were collected for retrospective analysis.

Hospital C: Capital Center for Children's Health, Capital Medical University. MIS, minimally invasive surgery; PIH, pediatric inguinal hernia; SPLPEC, single-port laparoscopic percutaneous extraperitoneal closure; TPLIS, two-port laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing.

Inclusion criteria were pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of inguinal hernia, including unilateral, bilateral or incarcerated cases. Exclusion criteria were hydrocele of the canal of Nuck, indirect inguinal hernia associated with undescended testis, direct inguinal hernia or femoral hernia.

The postoperative follow-up period was 2 years. In the first postoperative week, patients were advised to avoid strenuous activities. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 1 month, 3 months and 2 years, either via telephone or during outpatient visits. Children with suspected recurrence underwent further diagnostic evaluation and extended follow-up.

Recurrence was defined as the reappearance of a mass in the inguinal region or scrotum (including communicating hydrocele), demonstrating bowel, omental, ovary or fluid within the mass confirmed by ultrasonography.

Urinary stones

Urinary stones affect up to 12% of the population, predominantly males. Patients are usually symptomatic, experiencing severe pain migrating from the flank region to the lower back, pelvis and genital region. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever and haematuria. The detection is usually achieved through a CT scan. As an incidental finding on MRI, urinary calculi appear as signal voids on T1-WI and T2-WI, or as filling defects in a dilated ureter (Fig. 2). Ureteric wall thickening with associated contrast enhancement and surrounding fat stranding may be observed in the case of associated inflammation.

### Cleft and craniofacial coding in ICD-10 [^f2229b68]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

With the gradual replacement of the ICD-9 coding system by the newer ICD-10 system, there is a need to critically evaluate how the system improves-or fails to improve-the coding of specific cleft and craniofacial anomalies. The following review examines the new system and the key components for practitioners who treat patients with such anomalies.

Conclusions

While seemingly beneficial in certain respects, the newer ICD-10 system remains far from ideal for cleft and craniofacial anomalies. With future iterations of the system, a more concerted effort to precisely code such anomalies is warranted, which will likely require input from key practitioners.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Ectopic pregnancy developing in a cyst of the canal of nuck [^67fee428]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A cyst of the canal of Nuck is a rare cause of inguinal swelling in adult women. Ectopic pregnancies that implant to rare regions are sometimes challenging to diagnose.

Case

A 45-year-old woman presented with painful swelling in her right groin with a positive urine pregnancy test. Ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and the histopathologic result of dilation and curettage suggested ectopic pregnancy in the right inguinal canal. Exploratory laparotomy, extraction of the right inguinal mass lesion, and closure of the deep inguinal ring were performed. The mass lesion measured 4×3 cm, and the histopathologic finding revealed an unusual ectopic pregnancy in the cyst of the canal of Nuck.

Conclusion

In women of reproductive age presenting with painful swelling of the groin, ectopic pregnancy in a cyst of the canal of Nuck should be ruled out.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fe44757]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A pediatric hydrocele is a pathologic sac filled with serous fluid beneath the scrotal layer which can develop into both sides of the scrotum, called bilateral hydrocele. Although this type of pathology affects males of all ages, it is also commonly seen in children. Besides, the PH can develop spontaneously in adulthood.

There are two types of hydrocele regarding the pathogenesis process; communicating and non-communicating. In the communicating type, the hydrocele is directly in contact with abdominal fluids through the non-closed canal of spermatic cord; besides, the scrotum appears larger or swollen over time. Although the abdominoscrotal passage is blocked naturally in the non-communicating type of hydrocele in infants, some excess abdominal fluid remains in the scrotum surrounding testes. These types of hydroceles could be present at birth or develop for no apparent reason in the future. Non-communicating hydrocele usually remains in the same size or grows slowly over the time. Obstetric testicular edema is usually present at birth and diagnosed in 5% of cases. Premature newborns (≥ 3 weeks) represent a higher risk of hydrocele.

Risk factors of PH in children include scrotal damage, inflammation, and infection (such as sexually transmitted infection). The main symptom of PH is swelling on one or both sides of scrotum. Generally, the hydrocele is not often lethal along with no side-effects on fertility. However, the PH in children reflects an underlying serious disease such as acute infection or the presence of tumors in testis and inguinal canal, the associated treatment completely depends on the type and severity of disease. Although medicinal check-ups are necessary, no special treatments are advised in many cases (spontaneous disease disappearance).

In PH cases with severe swelling or an underlying disease (such as a hernia), surgical treatment may be required. Also, in cases with persistent hydroceles, further medical examinations are strictly needed. Since the PH can induce reproductive-associated pathologies, comprehensive health-based planning seems necessary to accelerate early diagnosis and reduce un-detected hydrocele. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis study was designed to determine the global prevalence of PH in infants and children.

### Hydrocele in a case of atypical Kawasaki disease: case report and review of diagnostic criteria [^4f6f9513]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there are well recognized clinical features associated with classic Kawasaki Disease, there have been increasing numbers of atypical clinical presentations with increased dependence on the American Heart Association diagnostic algorithm for incomplete Kawasaki Disease. Timely diagnosis of Kawasaki Disease can reduce cardiovascular morbidity, thus it is important to consider this diagnosis in a child with prolonged fever and unexplainable inflammatory symptoms. We recommend that for any child with prolonged unexplained fever, Kawasaki Disease should be considered, even if an infective process or cause of the fever has already been identified. Acute hydrocele can also be a clinical feature of Kawasaki Disease, and is possibly related to the underlying systemic inflammatory processes, thus clinicians dealing with diagnostic dilemmas involving inflammatory processes should always consider Kawasaki Disease as a potential differential diagnosis.

### Inguinal hernias: diagnosis and management [^1367a279]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Groin hernias are caused by a defect of the abdominal wall in the groin area and comprise inguinal and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias are more common in men. Although groin hernias are easily diagnosed on physical examination in men, ultrasonography is often needed in women. Ultrasonography is also helpful when a recurrent hernia, surgical complication after repair, or other cause of groin pain (e.g., groin mass, hydrocele) is suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging has higher sensitivity and specificity than ultrasonography and is useful for diagnosing occult hernias if clinical suspicion is high despite negative ultrasound findings. Herniography, which involves injecting contrast media into the hernial sac, may be used in selected patients. Becoming familiar with the common types of surgical interventions can help family physicians facilitate postoperative care and assess for complications, including recurrence. Laparoscopic repair is associated with shorter recovery time, earlier resumption of activities of daily living, less pain, and lower recurrence rates than open repair. Watchful waiting is a reasonable and safe option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Watchful waiting is not recommended in patients with symptomatic hernias or in nonpregnant women.

Results

Admitting Diagnosis Protocol Overlap

We analyzed the overlap of admitting diagnosis ICD-10 codes within MRI exams of two selected body regions, brain/head and spine, as MRI is frequently used for various use cases for these body regions. We only incorporated protocols that were performed more than five times within our dataset.

The average number of admitting diagnosis ICD-10 codes per exam is low for both spine (1.1) and brain/head (1.2), and single code occurrence ranges from 1 to 182 for spine and to 42 for brain/head exams, respectively (Table 2).

Table 2
Data properties of the evaluated MRI exams for the selected body regions

Legend: Label cardinality: average number of admitting diagnosis ICD-10 codes per exam; Label density: cardinality divided by the number of unique codes; Label diversity: number of distinct code sets

Since the frequency of the protocols varies widely within the dataset (ranging from 6 to 341), we computed the overlap coefficient to assess the similarity of admitting diagnosis and protocol mapping.

Figures 2 and 3 visualize the overlap coefficients for the set of admitting diagnosis codes associated with the different brain/head and spine MRI protocols, respectively. As the overlap coefficient is symmetric, i.e. so is the heatmap. Note thatandcomprise here the set of admitting diagnosis code combinations for two different MRI protocols. Thus, an element within these sets can consist of single or multiple ICD-10 codes.

### Utilising international statistical classification of diseases and related health conditions (ICD)-10 Australian modification classifications of "Health conditions" to achieve population health surveillance in an Australian spinal cord injury cohort [^4679ec01]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Traumatic aetiologies

In terms of traumatic cases, an APC subset of 202 (39%) cases had ICD-10-AM codes referencing the key terms "injury" and "spinal cord". These terms were taken to indicate a definitive diagnosis of a traumatic SCI or a spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. In rank order, cervical cases were the most prevalent cause of SCI (135 [32%]) followed by thoracic (51 [10.1%]), and lumbar cases (16 [3.2%]). Table 2 presents the distribution and frequency of those traumatic cases identified and subsequently quantitated by ICD-10-AM code.

Non-traumatic aetiologies

ICD-10-AM codes identifying SCD epochs of care accounted for 115 [23%] of the 504 cases. Of these "vascular myelopathies", and "intraspinal abscess and granuloma" 28 [8.7%] were most frequently recorded. In terms of omissions, ethical constraints precluded the reporting of rare spinal or spinal cord aetiologies with < 5 recorded cases. Due to these constraints the cohort selected for analysis excluded ICD-10 codes for: (i) "Benign neoplasm of meninges: Spinal meninges"; and (ii) "Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of central nervous system: Spinal cord."

Table 2 also presents ICD-10 codes for "Guillain-Barré syndrome" (22 cases). Of note, GB is a forme fruste diagnosis, and as such new index cases are; first, admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in our facility and secondly, consented to participate and recorded in the ASCIR. For the purpose of this study GB cases were retained for analysis.

Vertebral column injuries

The NLM descriptors/ search terms "fracture" and "neck", or "cervical spine", "thoracic spine" or "lumbar spine" and "fracture" were used in this study to define an epoch of inpatient care due to accidental (low or high impact trauma) or pathological fracture (data not shown). However, from these descriptors it is not reasonable to infer a sine qua non diagnosis of SCI/D. Radiological evidence of spinal canal compromise with concomitant spinal cord compression, together with an ISNCSCI physical examination would be necessary to be confident of sine qua non. These filters were rejected in the construction of the CONSORT framework (Fig. 1) but may inform future attempts to construct a spinal disorders registry.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3a2a800a]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

In order to collect eligible and extractable data representing the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, a systematic searching was applied in 6 databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar using main keywords of " Prevalence ", " hydrocele ", " Infant ", and " Children ". Also, no time restrictions were applied for paper searching (by September 1, 2024). Citation Management Software of EndNote was used for reference arrangement. The references of collected papers were also screened manually to cover the maximum collection of eligible studies. Finally, the searching process was updated on September 16, 2024. Keywords were extracted using the MeSH concept. The search strategy (in each database) was determined using Advanced Searching Mode using (AND) and (OR) operators to reach the maximum combination. For example, the searching strategy in the PubMed database was determined as follows; (((((((Prevalence[Title/Abstract]) AND (hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Testicular Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Scrotal Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) OR (Vaginal Hydrocele[Title/Abstract])) AND (Infant[Title/Abstract])) OR (Infants[Title/Abstract])) AND (Children[Title/Abstract]))))))).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were all studies reporting the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele in infants and children, with available full-text, sufficient extractable data, and papers designed in English Language. Besides, all case reports, case series, intervention studies, reviews, and papers with insufficient or unextractable data were excluded.

Study selection

The PRISMA guidelines were totally followed for selection of eligible studies. This protocol was conducted through exclusion of duplicate studies and the selection of eligible investigations based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. During paper searching, the citations were imported into the Citation Management Software (EndNote). Duplicate papers were selected and merged. During the primary screening, the Title and Abstract of the papers were assessed and irrelevant investigations were excluded. In the secondary screening process, full texts of studies were provided and re-evaluated. Eligible papers with extractable data were considered in this regard. In order to prevent the probable bias, all stages were carried out by two independent researchers. Any potential disagreements regarding the paper's selection were re-evaluated by the corresponding author.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

Prenatal hydrocolpos is characterized by fluid distension of the vagina. Hydrocolpos can be caused by multiple underlying etiologies and often demonstrates overlapping imaging features compared to other cystic abdominal and pelvic lesions. The purpose of the current pictorial essay is to provide a systematic prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach to differentiating the primary etiologies leading to hydrocolpos. After discussing the fundamental embryological processes involved in vaginal development, the current essay discusses the most common causes of hydrocolpos with their associated prenatal and postnatal imaging features. An approach to distinguishing the more common differential diagnoses is provided. Given the implications of parental counseling and postnatal management, this essay provides an important approach for narrowing differential diagnoses based on prenatal imaging.

### Global prevalence of hydrocele in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b5493e84]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric hydrocele (PH) is a curable pathology which can lead to early treatment and complete removal of complications following on-time diagnosis by an experienced delivery team. Untreated hydrocele can eventually lead to infertility. Currently, there are no single global statistics available regarding the prevalence of pediatric hydrocele; thus, it seems that presentation of a valid report in this regard causes the awareness of medical staff and health policymakers. This study was designed to present the global prevalence of PH in two groups of infants and children. The results of this meta-analysis study (statistical population of 349,558 cases) showed that the global prevalence of this disease in infants and children is 1 per 1000 and 3.4 per 1000, respectively. The findings showed that by the age (from infancy to childhood), the rate of pediatric hydrocele increases. This finding represented late or no diagnosis of PH pathology during labor or a few days post-labor. It is also suggested that multiple environmental factors can lead to the occurrence of PH in the post-infant period.

Provision of health solutions for early diagnosis of PH pathology seems a critical approach. Hydrocele in infants is a benign condition commonly disappears with no treatment. However, in persistent cases beyond infancy, careful screening is essential to determine the need for surgical intervention. The exact report of hydrocele's prevalence and ongoing management strategies emphasizes the importance of pediatric surveillance in early childhood health care. The studies conducted by Osifo and Osaigbovo and Imaizumi et al. provided important insights regarding the prevalence and special characteristics of hydrocele in infants, albeit from different geographical and clinical contexts. Osifo and Osaigbovo in a study entitled "Congenital hydrocele: prevalence and outcome among male children who underwent neonatal circumcision in Benin City, Nigeria" found that among 2,715 male neonates circumcised, 4.7% were diagnosed with hydrocele. This study highlighted that 83.4% of the diagnosed cases resolved spontaneously by the age of 18 months, with peak resolution occurring between 4–6 months.

### The treatment of abdominoscrotal hydrocele: is there a role for nonoperative management? [^f31fd23f]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is an uncommon entity. Until now, the recommended treatment has been surgical. There is only one successful case of nonoperative management reported in literature. We report the largest series of children with ASH, and provide evidence in support of an initial nonoperative approach.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of patients treated from 1994 to 2015 with ASH at a single institution.

Results

Thirty patients were identified with ASH, with 29 included in the analysis. Nine patients (30%) had operative management with an 80% complication rate. Twenty out of 29 patients (70%) were initially managed expectantly. Sixteen (80%) had resolution of their abdominal component, twelve (60%) of which went on to have full resolution of ASH. Four patients (20%) in this group required operative management of ASH.

Conclusions

ASH should be included in the differential diagnosis of pediatric scrotal swelling. The "Springing Back Ball Sign" should be used as a screening tool. If it is positive, a dynamic ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. We recommend observation as the first step in the management of uncomplicated ASH. It can result in avoidance of operation or at least lower the complication risk significantly if operation is required.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics," crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one," and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^a36ea6dd]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Aspiration and sclerotherapy: a minimally invasive treatment for hydroceles and spermatoceles [^2817c52e]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe our contemporary experience with aspiration and sclerotherapy (AS) as a non-surgical alternative for patients with symptomatic hydrocele and spermatocele who prefer non-surgical treatment.

Materials and Methods

Patients were identified by billing diagnosis code for hydrocele or spermatocele from 2015 to 2019. Patients underwent AS with doxycycline (200–400 mg). Physical examination, ultrasound and aspirate microscopy were used to differentiate hydrocele from spermatocele. Baseline and follow-up data were recorded.

Results

In total, 65 patients underwent AS, 54/65 (83%) for hydrocele and 11/65 (17%) for spermatocele with mean aspirate volumes 307 mL (SD 238 mL) and 138 mL (SD 112 mL), respectively. Follow-up data was available for 38/54 (70%) hydroceles and 8/11 (73%) spermatoceles with median follow-up 28 (IQR 23–41) and 22 (IQR 18.5–30.5) months respectively. Relief of patient reported bother associated with scrotal size occurred in 29/38 (77%) hydroceles and 8/9 (89%) spermatoceles. 2/54 (4%) hydrocele patients developed hematoma managed with in-office aspiration. Immediate post-procedural pain occurred in 2/56 (4%) hydroceles and 2/10 (20%) spermatocele. Post-procedural pain requiring more than 5 tablets of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5mg/325mg occurred in 2/57 (3%) hydroceles and 2/10 (20%) spermatoceles. Surgical repair was ultimately pursued in 3/38 (8%) and 1/9 (11%) patients with persistent hydrocele and spermatocele respectively.

Conclusion

AS is a safe and effective treatment alternative for hydrocele and spermatocele for patients wishing to avoid surgery.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — coding and documentation: Women who meet the criteria for rUTI should have this diagnosis added to their problem list to help alert other providers and ensure best practices, and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is important for correct classification; the ICD-10 code of "positive urine culture" can be used instead of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when a urine culture is positive but the clinical criteria are not met for a UTI.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity," and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity." Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice." New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness," and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs." To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service," exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms."

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Validation of an international classification of diseases, ninth revision code algorithm for identifying Chiari malformation type 1 surgery in adults [^2b03f1fc]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The use of administrative billing data may enable large-scale assessments of treatment outcomes for Chiari Malformation type I (CM-1). However, to utilize such data sets, validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9-CM) code algorithms for identifying CM-1 surgery are needed.

Objective

To validate 2 ICD-9-CM code algorithms identifying patients undergoing CM-1 decompression surgery.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the validity of 2 ICD-9-CM code algorithms for identifying adult CM-1 decompression surgery performed at 2 academic medical centers between 2001 and 2013. Algorithm 1 included any discharge diagnosis code of 348.4 (CM-1), as well as a procedure code of 01.24 (cranial decompression) or 03.09 (spinal decompression, or laminectomy). Algorithm 2 restricted this group to patients with a primary diagnosis of 348.4. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of each algorithm were calculated.

Results

Among 340 first-time admissions identified by Algorithm 1, the overall PPV for CM-1 decompression was 65%. Among the 214 admissions identified by Algorithm 2, the overall PPV was 99.5%. The PPV for Algorithm 1 was lower in the Vanderbilt (59%) cohort, males (40%), and patients treated between 2009 and 2013 (57%), whereas the PPV of Algorithm 2 remained high (≥ 99%) across subgroups. The sensitivity of Algorithms 1 (86%) and 2 (83%) were above 75% in all subgroups.

Conclusion

ICD-9-CM code Algorithm 2 has excellent PPV and good sensitivity to identify adult CM-1 decompression surgery. These results lay the foundation for studying CM-1 treatment outcomes by using large administrative databases.

### Meeting tomorrow's needs: a single-centre study in geriatric neurosurgery [^a3fa8676]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Change in top five procedures by age group. Legend: This figure shows how the top 5 most common surgeries in the entire geriatric population (≥ 65) treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Haukeland University Hospital, between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2023, changes in different age groups. Code ABC56 defines decompression of lumbar spinal canal and nerve roots. Code ABC36 defines decompression of lumbar nerve roots. Code AAD10 defines evacuation of subdural hematoma. Code AAF05 defines ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Finally, code ABC16 defines excision of lumbar intervertebral disc displacement

Table 2 presents the ten most frequent neurosurgical diagnoses in the geriatric population using ICD-10 codes. Spinal stenosis (M48.0) was the most common diagnosis in the entire geriatric population with a prevalence of 14.43%, followed by lumbar and other disc disorders with myelopathy (M51.1) and traumatic subdural haemorrhage (S06.50), with prevalences of 9.38% and 7.61%, respectively. We found that spinal stenosis (M48.0) was the most prevalent diagnosis in the 65–69 (12.48%), peaking in the 75–79 and 80–84 groups (16.28%). Notably, S06.50 steadily increased in prevalence with advancing age, becoming the most common diagnosis in the 85–89 and ≥ 90 groups, with prevalences of 20.25% and 56.25% respectively. We also observed treatment for malignant neoplasms in the cerebrum (C71.0) decreased with age, while nontraumatic subdural haemorrhage (I62.0), and communicating (G91.0), obstructive (G91.1) and normal-pressure hydrocephalus (G91.3) increased with age. In comparison, the three most prevalent diagnoses in the 18–64 cohort was lumbar and other intervertebral disc disorders with radiculopathy (M51.1) with a prevalence of 27.20%, cervical disc disorder with myelopathy (M50.1) at 14.04%, and C71.0 at 5.18%.

"Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field;" if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters." For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality;" if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available." A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)."

### Incarceration rates in pediatric inguinal hernia: do not trust the coding [^6a4dfc40]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although recent reports have suggested optimal wait times for inguinal hernia repair to prevent incarceration, these may not apply to all patients or be feasible in the context of limited resources. We evaluated our experience to determine if patient age and interval to operation increased the risk of incarceration.

Methods

A retrospective review of children younger than 2 years old undergoing inguinal hernia repair from 2004 to 2007 was performed. Patients were divided based on age at diagnosis (A, 0–28 days; B, 4–26 weeks; C, 27–52 weeks; and D, 53–104 weeks). We evaluated incarceration rates in each group, defined as the need for sedation to achieve reduction, and compared these to International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10), coding. Wait times were evaluated, and the rate and daily risk of incarceration were calculated for each age group.

Results

Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included in our analysis, with an overall mean wait time of 43 ± 50 days between diagnosis and surgery. Forty-five patients were labeled as incarcerated by ICD-10 coding, although 23 patients (51%) were reduced without sedation, leaving a true incarceration rate of 8% (22/268). Of these 22 patients, 18 were incarcerated at index presentation. There was no difference in incarceration rates between groups (A, 5.3%; B, 8.0%; C, 11.5%; and D, 8.8%), although older patients had significantly longer wait times.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that ICD-10 coding of incarceration is an inaccurate parameter of actual irreducibility. Hernia incarceration in children awaiting repair represented a minority of overall incarcerations in our cohort, suggesting strict wait times may not alter incarceration risk.

### Noonan syndrome: improving recognition and diagnosis [^eaaa8ed0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

In the fetus

Prenatal features are frequent in fetuses with NS, including increased nuchal translucency, persistent nuchal fold, distended jugular lymphatic sacs, cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, pleural or pericardial effusion, polyhydramnios, cardiac and renal anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features. In prospective genetic studies, mutations of genes implicated in NS have been reported in up to 16% of fetuses with an increased nuchal translucency and a normal karyotype. Prenatal genetic testing is offered in some countries. However, antenatal diagnosis is not systematically proposed even when ultrasound features are found, considering the impossibility of predicting phenotypical expression precisely and the fact that most individuals with NS have a quite favourable prognosis. Ultrasonographers and obstetricians are well placed to recognise these characteristics, but it is currently unknown what proportion of fetuses with NS actually show prenatal anomalies.

In the neonatal period

The perinatal period is a particularly important time for NS diagnosis, but the condition is not always easy to recognise. Neonatologists should keep in mind the suggestive prenatal history (see above) and the distinctive facial features of NS (figure 3). Other features that may be present at that age include heart defects (especially pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cryptorchidism in boysand feeding difficulties/failure to thrive. Lymphatic dysplasia may manifest with congenital chylothorax or hydrops.

Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^f1ee71f0]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Abdominoscrotal hydrocele in an infant boy [^7703ef29]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Abdominoscrotal hydrocele (ASH) is the rarest type of hydrocele. This condition is characterised by a large abdominal and scrotal component connected by an isthmus within the inguinal canal. The incidence among the paediatric population is reported to be less than 3%, although it might be underdiagnosed. Several theories have been proposed in the literature but the aetiology of ASH remains unknown. Diagnosis can be made clinically and confirmed by ultrasound. Spontaneous resolution is rare and long-standing ASH may lead to complications, thus early surgical intervention is recommended. Different techniques have been described, but dissection remains challenging due to the tunica vaginalis adherence to the testis and the distal cord. We present a male infant with ASH who underwent inguinal repair. The procedure was facilitated by needle decompression of the mass. Identification and preservation of the vessels and vas deferens was done successfully without compromising the testis.

### Diagnosis, management, and treatment of female genital mutilation or cutting in girls [^7e8e902f]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) — documentation and surgical referral recommendations specify that the management of FGM/C should include complete documentation of clinical findings and the use of ICD-10 coding. Health care providers should recommend defibulation for all girls and teenagers with type III FGM/C, particularly when complications are currently present, and in all cases in which defibulation is recommended, an experienced pediatric gynecologist (for young children), gynecologist (for older children and teenagers), urologist, or urogynecologist should be identified to perform the procedure. Standardized training related to the identification, treatment, management, and culturally appropriate communication approaches needs to be developed and provided to health care providers who care for FGM/C-affected communities.

### Trends in severe maternal morbidity in the US across the transition to ICD-10-CM / PCS from 2012–2019 [^d3864f58]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Between 2012 and 2019, SMM rates increased from 69.5 to 79.7 per 10 000 delivery hospitalizations (RD, 10.2; 95% CI, 5.8 to 14.6) without a statistically significant change across the ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, −3.2; 95% CI, −6.9 to 0.6) (Figure 1; Table 3). When restricted to the same set of years as a prior study (2012 to 2017), there was also no significant change associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, 0; 95% CI, −4.1 to 4.1). Compared with 2012, annual SMM rates were only significantly higher for 2018 and 2019. In-hospital mortality per 100 000 delivery hospitalizations did not increase significantly over the study period (RD, 1.7; 95% CI, −0.5 to 4.0), and there was no change associated with ICD-10-CM/PCS transition (RD, 1.5; 95% CI, −0.9 to 3.9).

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^877fbe29]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Imperforate hymen — neonatal and pubertal presentations and initial management are described as follows: the imperforate hymen may present in the neonatal period as a hydrocolpos or mucocolpos with a bulging, translucent, or yellow mass at the introitus, and surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients with intervention usually deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. At puberty, typical findings include a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos that distends further with the Valsalva maneuver; pain may be pelvic or abdominal, cyclic or acute, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Chiari malformation type I surgery in pediatric patients. part 1: validation of an ICD-9-CM code search algorithm [^61ff9c68]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Administrative billing data may facilitate large-scale assessments of treatment outcomes for pediatric Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I). Validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code algorithms for identifying CM-I surgery are critical prerequisites for such studies but are currently only available for adults. The objective of this study was to validate two ICD-9-CM code algorithms using hospital billing data to identify pediatric patients undergoing CM-I decompression surgery. METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed the validity of two ICD-9-CM code algorithms for identifying pediatric CM-I decompression surgery performed at 3 academic medical centers between 2001 and 2013. Algorithm 1 included any discharge diagnosis code of 348.4 (CM-I), as well as a procedure code of 01.24 (cranial decompression) or 03.09 (spinal decompression or laminectomy). Algorithm 2 restricted this group to the subset of patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of 348.4. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of each algorithm were calculated. RESULTS Among 625 first-time admissions identified by Algorithm 1, the overall PPV for CM-I decompression was 92%. Among the 581 admissions identified by Algorithm 2, the PPV was 97%. The PPV for Algorithm 1 was lower in one center (84%) compared with the other centers (93%-94%), whereas the PPV of Algorithm 2 remained high (96%-98%) across all subgroups. The sensitivity of Algorithms 1 (91%) and 2 (89%) was very good and remained so across subgroups (82%-97%). CONCLUSIONS An ICD-9-CM algorithm requiring a primary diagnosis of CM-I has excellent PPV and very good sensitivity for identifying CM-I decompression surgery in pediatric patients. These results establish a basis for utilizing administrative billing data to assess pediatric CM-I treatment outcomes.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^adc96316]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies — symptoms — The most common symptom associated with obstruction is pain, and in a patient who presents with pain, the presence of menstruation does not rule out obstruction. Pain may occur in a cyclic manner or may be continuous, although in patients who are amenorrheic, a pattern may be more challenging to identify. Other associated symptoms include urinary frequency
