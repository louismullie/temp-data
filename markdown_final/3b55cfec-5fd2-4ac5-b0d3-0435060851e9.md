## Question

Candida affecting gut health

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Candida affects gut health. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Candida's baseline role as a commensal in the gut. Then, I should verify the conditions that tip commensalism toward pathogenicity. Next, I will examine the mechanisms of gut colonization, expansion, and translocation. After that, I should review disease associations and immune modulation. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, diagnostics, and therapeutic strategies, including antifungal stewardship and microbiome-based interventions [^115qN5p3] [^117ETQSG].

> Let me first confirm the baseline biology. Candida albicans is a common commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract, present in roughly 50–60% of healthy adults, and typically coexists without causing disease under homeostatic conditions, reflecting a dynamic balance with the host immune system and the bacterial microbiota [^113y8tmM] [^115m1rpu]. Hold on, I should verify the concept of colonization resistance; yes, the indigenous microbiota and intact mucosal barriers provide colonization resistance that constrains Candida expansion, and this balance can be perturbed by antibiotics, diet, or host factors [^113y8tmM] [^115m1rpu].

> I need to check the tipping points from commensalism to pathogenicity. Immunosuppression, antibacterial therapy, epithelial barrier injury, and metabolic dysregulation (e.g., diabetes) are key drivers that allow Candida to overgrow and, in some cases, disseminate systemically, with invasive candidiasis carrying high mortality in vulnerable hosts [^113y8tmM] [^1177F7az]. Wait, let me verify the role of the gut as a reservoir; indeed, the gastrointestinal tract is the predominant source of Candida bloodstream infections in many hospitalized patients, underscoring the clinical importance of gut colonization dynamics [^114SkRHu].

> Next, I should review the mechanisms of colonization and expansion. Candida adapts to the gut niche through morphological plasticity, including yeast, hyphae, and specialized commensal forms such as the GUT phenotype, which downregulates virulence and optimizes nutrient acquisition in the intestine [^112KXEkm] [^115C5Kjm]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about hyphae being uniformly detrimental in the gut; recent data show that hyphal morphotypes and candidalysin can confer a competitive advantage in multi-kingdom communities, even though adaptive immunity later selects against hyphae to maintain homeostasis, illustrating a nuanced trade-off between colonization fitness and pathogenic potential [^113ubv7B] [^113wBa9M]. I should also confirm metabolic drivers; Candida exploits N-acetylglucosamine as a gut signal that balances commensalism and virulence, linking nutrient sensing to morphogenesis and immune engagement [^116ADiE4] [^111M8FGP].

> I will now examine translocation and dissemination. Candida can breach the intestinal barrier via hyphal invasion, epithelial damage, and tight junction disruption, with systemic spread facilitated by immunosuppression and impaired mucosal defenses; TLR2 signaling appears protective against colonization and dissemination in experimental models, highlighting innate immune checkpoints [^111AYSY5] [^115VwVgz]. Wait, I should double-check the clinical correlate; invasive candidiasis in ICU patients frequently follows gut colonization, and the Candida colonization index is used to stratify risk for candidemia in high-risk populations [^112Z1eDW].

> Let me consider disease associations. High gastrointestinal Candida colonization correlates with worse outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease, and specific C. albicans strains with high immune-cell-damaging capacity have been shown to aggravate colitis via IL-1β–dependent mechanisms, supporting a causal role in a subset of patients [^111TuFUa] [^112SwF9i]. But wait, what if Candida is protective in some contexts? Indeed, Candida colonization can prime protective Th17 responses and even confer heterologous protection against other pathogens, illustrating the dualistic nature of host–fungal interactions [^111WJn6f]. I should also review metabolic and systemic links; altered mycobiome signatures, including Candida expansion, have been associated with metabolic diseases and may modulate host metabolism via bacterial–fungal–host crosstalk [^112k5Jrh] [^111dWRgx].

> Next, I should review immune modulation. Candida engages both innate and adaptive immunity, with C-type lectin receptors and Th17 responses central to control, while IgA selectively targets hyphal adhesins to suppress virulence while permitting commensal carriage, thereby uncoupling colonization from pathogenesis [^111WJn6f] [^113wBa9M]. Hold on, I should verify the cross-reactivity concern; gut-primed antifungal T cells can cross-react with airborne fungi such as Aspergillus, potentially amplifying inflammatory lung disease, which underscores the gut–lung axis and the need for immune tuning rather than wholesale fungal eradication [^112hsMxP] [^111WJn6f].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are precise. In ICU and oncology cohorts, Candida gut colonization is common and a recognized risk factor for invasive candidiasis; antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for select high-risk groups, but stewardship is essential to mitigate resistance and ecological disruption [^111QXTCt] [^115qN5p3]. Let me reconsider diagnostics; blood cultures remain the diagnostic mainstay, while β-D-glucan is an adjunct with limited specificity, and emerging molecular tools may improve early detection, though they are not yet standard of care [^111QXTCt]. I should confirm that Candida auris remains a critical threat requiring stringent infection control and surveillance due to its multidrug resistance and environmental persistence [^1173R931].

> Now, I should evaluate therapeutic and preventive strategies. Antibacterial stewardship and minimizing mucosal injury reduce Candida overgrowth risk by preserving colonization resistance, and targeted antifungal therapy is indicated for documented overgrowth or infection, balancing efficacy with ecological consequences [^113y8tmM] [^111QXTCt]. Wait, let me verify the role of diet; evidence in humans is mixed, with some studies showing minimal direct effects of carbohydrate supplementation on Candida colonization under homeostatic conditions, whereas dysbiotic states may render diet more influential, and refined diets in mice can impair colonization resistance, suggesting that diet–microbiome interactions warrant individualized consideration in high-risk patients [^116RFrTe] [^116Ps3Ch]. I should also review microbiome-based therapies; fecal microbiota transplantation outcomes in C. difficile are modulated by the mycobiome, with Candida dominance linked to reduced efficacy, and donor-derived fungal taxa may promote engraftment, highlighting the need to consider fungi in donor selection and post-FMT monitoring [^114XKTfq] [^117ETQSG]. Probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus spp. show promise in preclinical models for limiting Candida colonization and supporting barrier integrity, but human data remain limited and heterogeneous, so I should be cautious in overgeneralizing [^113S1BES] [^11729ZX7].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaways. Candida's impact on gut health is fundamentally contextual: in a stable host–microbiome setting, it is a tolerated commensal that can even train protective immunity, but in dysbiosis or immunosuppression, it can expand, damage mucosa, and seed systemic infection, necessitating vigilant risk assessment and targeted interventions rather than reflexive antifungal use [^112yskUF] [^115qN5p3]. I should double-check that our approach aligns with current guidance; yes, prevention hinges on preserving colonization resistance, early recognition of high-risk states, and judicious antifungal therapy, with ongoing research into microbiome-based and immune-modulatory strategies to rebalance rather than eradicate gut fungi [^111QXTCt] [^113y8tmM].

Candida is a common gut commensal [^112bRZZz] that supports immune maturation [^111WJn6f] and barrier integrity, but **dysbiosis or immunosuppression** can drive overgrowth and translocation, worsening IBD [^111TuFUa], IBS [^111BvzH2], and metabolic disease [^112k5Jrh]. Antibiotics, high-sugar or high-fat diets, and impaired immunity increase risk [^113y8tmM]; restoring bacterial diversity, correcting diet, and targeting antifungals or probiotics can rebalance the mycobiome and improve gut health [^113S1BES] [^114XKTfq].

---

## Normal role of Candida in gut health

- **Commensal organism**: Candida albicans is a common gut commensal in healthy individuals, aiding immune maturation [^111WJn6f] and barrier function [^notfound].

- **Immune modulation**: Candida helps train innate and adaptive immunity, promoting tolerance and protecting against pathogens [^111WJn6f] [^113wBa9M].

- **Metabolic contributions**: Candida participates in carbohydrate metabolism and produces short-chain fatty acids that support colonocyte health [^116aUZRm].

---

## Conditions associated with Candida overgrowth

- **Antibiotic use**: Antibiotics disrupt bacterial communities, reducing colonization resistance and allowing Candida expansion [^113y8tmM] [^1153Nnn3].

- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, and immunosuppressive drugs increase Candida overgrowth and invasive risk [^113xMpan] [^111QXTCt].

- **Dietary factors**: High-sugar and high-fat diets promote Candida proliferation and dysbiosis [^116Ps3Ch].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: IBD patients show altered mycobiomes with higher Candida abundance, worsening inflammation [^111TuFUa] [^112SwF9i].

---

## Mechanisms of Candida-mediated gut dysfunction

- **Barrier disruption**: Candida hyphae and candidalysin damage epithelium, increasing permeability and translocation [^11288Jzp] [^116TuGXr].

- **Immune activation**: Candida drives pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and Th17 responses, aggravating inflammation [^111TuFUa] [^111dcpHi].

- **Microbial dysbiosis**: Candida overgrowth alters bacterial communities, reducing diversity and promoting pathogens [^1167v6Yu] [^111kGRK3].

---

## Clinical implications and health outcomes

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Overgrowth causes bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption [^notfound].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Candida exacerbates IBD severity and relapse via barrier damage and immune activation [^111TuFUa] [^113wBa9M].

- **Irritable bowel syndrome**: Candida dysbiosis correlates with IBS symptoms and severity [^111BvzH2].

- **Metabolic syndrome**: Candida overgrowth is linked to insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia [^112k5Jrh] [^111879vA].

- **Systemic infections**: Overgrowth increases risk of invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised patients [^1177F7az] [^113y8tmM].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Culture-based methods**: Traditional cultures identify Candida but may miss low-abundance or non-culturable species [^notfound].

- **Molecular techniques**: ITS sequencing and qPCR enable sensitive detection and quantification of Candida [^112k5Jrh] [^117DgMti].

- **Clinical correlation**: Diagnosis should integrate symptoms, risk factors, and lab results due to colonization vs pathogenicity overlap [^notfound].

---

## Therapeutic interventions

- **Antifungal therapy**: Fluconazole, echinocandins, and nystatin reduce Candida burden; stewardship prevents resistance [^1177F7az] [^111eyduT].

- **Probiotics**: Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces boulardii restore bacterial diversity and suppress Candida [^113S1BES] [^11729ZX7].

- **Dietary modifications**: Reducing sugar/fat and increasing fiber rebalance the microbiome and limit Candida [^notfound].

- **Fecal microbiota transplantation**: FMT restores bacterial diversity and reduces Candida, improving dysbiosis-related symptoms [^114XKTfq] [^114iMpuQ].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventive strategies emphasize **antibiotic stewardship** to minimize disruption of bacterial communities and reduce Candida overgrowth risk [^113y8tmM] [^111QXTCt]. Dietary management with a balanced, low-sugar, fiber-rich diet supports microbiome stability and limits Candida proliferation [^notfound]. Immune support — optimizing nutrition, sleep, and stress — helps maintain immune defenses and prevent overgrowth [^notfound]. Regular monitoring of high-risk patients enables early detection and intervention for Candida overgrowth [^112Z1eDW].

---

Candida is a **key gut commensal** that supports immune and metabolic health; overgrowth under dysbiosis or immunosuppression drives inflammation, barrier injury, and systemic risk. Management centers on **restoring bacterial diversity**, correcting diet, and targeted antifungals or probiotics to rebalance the mycobiome and improve gut health.

### The gut, the bad and the harmless: Candida albicans as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen in the intestine [^116TuGXr]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Candida albicans is a regular member of the intestinal microbiota in the majority of the human population. This underscores C. albicans' adaptation to life in the intestine without inducing competitive interactions with other microbes, or immune responses detrimental to its survival. However, specific conditions such as a dysbalanced microbiome, a suppression of the immune system, and an impaired intestinal barrier can predispose for invasive, mostly nosocomial, C. albicans infections. Colonization of the intestine and translocation through the intestinal barrier are fundamental aspects of the processes preceding life-threatening systemic candidiasis. Insights into C. albicans' commensal lifestyle and translocation can thus help us to understand how patients develop candidiasis, and may provide leads for therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing infection. In this review, we discuss the commensal lifestyle of C. albicans in the intestine, the role of morphology for commensalism, the influence of diet, and the interactions with bacteria of the microbiota.

### The human gut mycobiome and the specific role of Candida albicans: where do we stand, as clinicians? [^116rv93c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The so-called 'mycobiome' has progressively acquired interest and increased the complexity of our understanding of the human gut microbiota. Several questions are arising concerning the role of fungi (and in particular of Candida albicans), the so-called 'mycobiome', that has been neglected for a long time and only recently gained interest within the scientific community. There is no consensus on mycobiome normobiosis because of its instability and variability. This review aims to raise awareness about this interesting topic and provide a framework to guide physicians faced with such questions.

Objectives

To summarize current knowledge and discuss current and potential implications of the mycobiome in clinical practice.

Sources

We performed a review of the existing literature in Medline Pubmed.

Content

This review identifies several studies showing associations between specific mycobiome profiles and health. Fungi represent a significant biomass within the microbiota and several factors, such as diet, sex, age, co-morbidities, medications, immune status and inter-kingdom interactions, can influence its structure and population. The human gut mycobiota is indeed a key factor for several physiological processes (e.g. training of the immune system against infections) and pathological processes (e.g. immunological/inflammatory disorders, inflammatory bowel diseases, metabolic syndromes). Moreover, the mycobiome (and C. albicans in particular) could influence an even broader spectrum of conditions such as psychiatric diseases (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) or chronic viral infections (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus); moreover, it could be implicated in tumorigenesis.

Implications

Candida albicans is a well-known opportunistic pathogen and a major component of the mycobiome but its role in the gastrointestinal tract is still poorly understood. From a potential screening biomarker to a key factor for several pathological processes, its presence could influence or even modify our clinical practice.

### Candida albicans dwelling in the mammalian gut [^112bRZZz]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The yeast Candida albicans inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of most healthy adults, seemingly living there as a harmless commensal. The fungus on occasion disseminates from the gut to other internal organs causing life-threatening infections. Here, I review some of the most exciting advances in the study of gut colonization by C. albicans in the last few years. These developments highlight the close interplay between C. albicans and cohabiting microbes, the responses that commensal fungi elicit from the mammalian host, and the genetic determinants that allow the fungus to thrive in such a crowded and demanding ecosystem.

### Inflammation and gastrointestinal Candida colonization [^111dcpHi]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Candida organisms commonly colonize the human gastrointestinal tract as a component of the resident microbiota. Their presence is generally benign. Recent studies, however, show that high level Candida colonization is associated with several diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. Further, results from animal models argue that Candida colonization delays healing of inflammatory lesions and that inflammation promotes colonization. These effects may create a vicious cycle in which low-level inflammation promotes fungal colonization and fungal colonization promotes further inflammation. Both inflammatory bowel disease and gastrointestinal Candida colonization are associated with elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17. Therefore, effects on IL-17 levels may underlie the ability of Candida colonization to enhance inflammation. Because Candida is a frequent colonizer, these effects have the potential to impact many people.

### The intestinal mycobiome as a determinant of host immune and metabolic health [^116JGrfe]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The inclusion of fungi in recent human and animal microbiome studies has revealed that microbiome features associated with health or disease are not exclusively bacterial. Factors known to impact bacterial microbiome development, such as gestational age at birth, breast feeding status and antibiotics also impact the mycobiome. Strong inter-kingdom interactions take place in the luminal gut, and while the mycobiome exhibits increased inter-individual variability, certain fungi are stable colonizers. Here, we review recent studies showing that the gut mycobiome also plays an important role in disease states related to host immunity and energy metabolism. Some persistent species, such as Candida sp., as well as other less stable colonizers have been shown to play an important role in host-mycobiome immune cross talk. Mechanisms by which gut fungi interact with immune development have begun to be elucidated yet the majority remain elusive. Further investigation into these immune and metabolic mechanisms hold great potential for novel discoveries and will provided a much needed multi-kingdom understanding of the microbiome's influence on host health.

### The microbial and host factors that govern Candida gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination [^111AYSY5]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Candida species are among the most prevalent and abundant members of the gut mycobiota, with Candida albicans (CA) being the most prominent member. CA colonizes numerous mucosal surfaces, most notably the gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary tracts. In a healthy host, CA is a pathobiont that exists as a commensal but can become pathogenic if the host's immune system becomes suppressed. The microbial and/or host factors that dictate CA's ability to colonize mucosal surfaces and its ability to disseminate remain of great interest. Here, we review the recent advances and insights regarding Candida colonization and dissemination of the mammalian GI tract.

### Cell biology of Candida albicans-host interactions [^112F4DVv]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Collectively, these observations suggest that gut commensalism of Candida is related to both intrinsic factors (fungal gene regulation, cell morphology, adaptation, fungal burden) and extrinsic factors (competitive microbiome, diet, host immune status). We know less about the factors affecting colonisation at other body sites although it is likely that a similar complex array of factors sustain the commensal state in these host niches.

### The impact of the host microbiota on Candida albicans infection [^113QjK5S]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The human microbiota is a complex microbial ecosystem populated by bacteria, fungi, viruses, protists, and archaea. The coexistence of fungi alongside with many billions of bacteria, especially in the gut, involves complex interactions, ranging from antagonistic to beneficial, between the members of these two kingdoms. Bacteria can impact fungi through various means, such as physical interactions, secretion of metabolites, or alteration of the host immune response, thereby affecting fungal growth and virulence. This review summarizes recent progress in this field, delving into the latest understandings of bacterial-fungal-immune interactions and innovative therapeutic approaches addressing the challenges of treating fungal infections associated with microbiota imbalances.

### Mycobiome and inflammatory bowel disease: role in disease pathogenesis, current approaches and novel nutritional-based therapies [^112AH5hg]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a disorder characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and a range of adverse health effects including diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stools, affects nearly 3.1 million genetically susceptible adults in the United States today. Although the etiology of IBD remains unclear, genetics, stress, diet, and gut microbiota dysbiosis- especially in immunocompromised individuals- have been identified as possible causes of disease. Although previous research has largely focused on the role of bacteria in IBD pathogenesis, recently observed alterations of fungal load and biodiversity in the GI tract of afflicted individuals suggest interkingdom interactions amongst different gut microbial communities, particularly between bacteria and fungi. These discoveries point to the potential utilization of treatment approaches such as antibiotics, antifungals, probiotics, and postbiotics that target both bacteria and fungi in managing IBD. In this review, we discuss the impact of specific fungi on disease pathogenesis, with a focus on the highly virulent genus Candida and how the presence of certain co-enzymes impacts its virulence. In addition, we evaluate current gut microbiome-based therapeutic approaches with the intention of better understanding the mechanisms behind novel therapies.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^113y8tmM]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

While Candida albicans is a common, commensal yeast colonizing 50%-60% of humans, it has the potential to expand in the gastrointestinal tract and enter the blood stream resulting in invasive candidiasis. Invasive candidiasis carries a mortality approaching 50%, especially in the most vulnerable, immunocompromised population. Antibacterial use causes an increase in C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization, indicating that the colonic microbiota plays a major role in preventing an uncontrolled expansion, a phenomenon known as colonization resistance. Antibacterials, medications, diet, and co-morbid conditions can all alter the microbiome, creating an altered environment known as dysbiosis. Our understanding of the microbiome continues to advance, and there is increasing evidence that the interactions that the microbiome has on the host are vital in maintaining colonization resistance to pathogens including C. albicans. This review will focus on colonization resistance to C. albicans within the gastrointestinal tract. The scope includes the benefits and consequences of C. albicans colonization, interkingdom interactions of the microbiome on C. albicans, microbiome-host interactions and how these modulate C. albicans colonization, and the impact of medications and diet on colonization resistance.

### A developmental program for Candida commensalism [^112KXEkm]. Nature Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

Candida albicans is a frequent pathogen of immunologically compromised individuals, but it is an even more common commensal of healthy humans, where it resides in the gut in a benign state. A new study shows that a specific commensal form of the fungus is induced in the gut through a developmental program that downregulates virulence factors and induces metabolic functions, enabling it to thrive on the nutrients that are available in the large intestine without damaging its host.

### Mycobiota in gastrointestinal diseases [^112SwF9i]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

New insights gained through the use of state-of-the-art technologies, including next-generation sequencing, are starting to reveal that the association between the gastrointestinal tract and the resident mycobiota (fungal community) is complex and multifaceted, in which fungi are active participants influencing health and disease. Characterizing the human mycobiome (the fungi and their genome) in healthy individuals showed that the gastrointestinal tract contains 66 fungal genera and 184 fungal species, with Candida as the dominant fungal genera. Although fungi have been associated with a number of gastrointestinal diseases, characterization of the mycobiome has mainly been focused on patients with IBD and graft-versus-host disease. In this Review, we summarize the findings from studies investigating the relationship between the gut mycobiota and gastrointestinal diseases, which indicate that fungi contribute to the aggravation of the inflammatory response, leading to increased disease severity. A model explaining the mechanisms underlying the role of the mycobiota in gastrointestinal diseases is also presented. Our understanding of the contribution of the mycobiota to health and disease is still in its infancy and leaves a number of questions to be addressed. Answering these questions might lead to novel approaches to prevent and/or manage acute as well as chronic gastrointestinal disease.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^1141AHZM]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

As C. albicans is a common commensal of humans, it is vital to understand the factors involved in the maintenance of colonization resistance due to the gastrointestinal tract serving as a reservoir for invasive disease. While there remain many unanswered questions, microbiota-host interactions seem necessary for maintaining colonization resistance, and future studies should focus on identifying these as potential targets for novel therapeutics.

As these studies demonstrate, the interactions between the host, the microbiota, and C. albicans are complex. During health, C. albicans can be a vital component of the mycobiota, but during disease, pharmaceutical administration, or potentially even with diet changes or in the context of certain genetic changes, C. albicans can become a pathogen. Together, a healthy microbiota and intestinal epithelium are major barriers for the development of invasive candidiasis, but if these components and their interactions go wrong, the gastrointestinal tract is also the site of C. albicans bloom prior to the development of invasive disease. It is vital that we gain an understanding of the factors involved in host-microbiota- C. albicans interactions to better understand the factors contributing to maintaining colonization resistance. Through this understanding, we can identify how signaling changes when colonization resistance fails. These signaling changes between the host and microbiota during the failure of colonization resistance will provide promising targets for novel therapeutics in the future.

### Effect of intrapartum azithromycin on early childhood gut mycobiota development: post hoc analysis of a double-blind randomized trial [^1114JY37]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our study shows similar gut mycobiota development pattern as what has previously been reported by other studies from West Africa, exhibiting high Candida abundance in the first few months and a stable alpha diversity over the first 3 years of life. In addition, our study also revealed a significant influence of season and parity on the gut mycobiota, with birth during the wet season being associated with increased Candida abundance and multiparity with increased fungal alpha diversity. Overall, intrapartum azithromycin showed mild effects on gut mycobiota development, which did not vary by sex of the child. The observed seasonal and parity-specific variations in its impact highlight the complexity of these effects. The increase of C. orthopsilosis observed in the first 4 months of life in the azithromycin arm during the wet season is an important finding for implementation of this intervention. Combined with the potential for antibiotic-induced gut barrier impairment, this raises - questions about the potential for increased risk of Candida infections among children exposed to this intervention during the wet season. Moreover, the association between young maternal age and increased abundance of C. orthopsilosis indicates a potentially higher vulnerability in infants of young mothers. This understanding on how maternal factors interact with azithromycin exposure to influence gut mycobiota and infection risk is vital for tailoring the intervention. Given the known variations in gut mycobiota dynamics across populations, it is essential to investigate the impact of intrapartum azithromycin in diverse populations. Such data is crucial for informed decision-making about large-scale implementation of the intervention in regions where maternal and neonatal health burdens are highest.

### Cell biology of Candida albicans-host interactions [^115agfRL]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Candida albicans is the commonest serious fungal pathogen of humans, variously reported as causing between 250 000 and 400 000 deaths per annum worldwide as well as extensive morbidity of around 100 million episodes of recurrent vaginitis. This fungus is a classical opportunistic pathogen residing harmlessly as a commensal in approximately 50% of individuals, kept in check by our immune system and a protective bacterial microbiome of the gut and other mucosal surfaces. In this review we survey latest advances in the cell biology of C. albicans that underpins its ecology as an organism exploring the interface between commensalism and pathogenesis.

### Global analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth in mucin [^117UBLeU]. G3 (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human gut microbiome is a vast community of microorganisms that are involved in the homeostasis of our gut physiology, metabolism and nutrient uptake, immune system functionality, and pathogenesis. Although mainly focusing on bacteria, the development of high-throughput sequencing-based metagenomics has led to research on the fungal community (i.e. mycobiome) within the gut. Currently, and unlike the bacteriome, there is no consensus on a core mycobiome, but recent studies have aimed at determining what fungal species healthy and diseased individuals possess in the gut. However, most metagenomic studies lack culture-dependent analyses and cannot differentiate between live fungi residing in the gut or dead fungal remnants from diet and the environment as the source for detection.

Identifying gut fungal residents is crucial as they are believed to have an important role in human health. In a 2017 review of gut microbiome publications, only 15 fungal species were reported in five or more studies. The most commonly reported were the closely related Candida spp. and Saccharomyces spp. Candida albicans is the most frequently studied fungus regarding the impact of the mycobiome on human health due to its virulent ability in immunocompromised individuals. Despite being one of the most common dietary fungi, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is often overlooked during discussions of microbial impact within the human gut. For example, while research has been conducted on the subspecies Saccharomyces boulardii as a probiotic additive in the food industry, as well as a medical treatment for diarrhea, pathogenic infection, and inflammatory bowel disease, very little is known about the impact S. cerevisiae has on human health. S. cerevisiae is known to reduce symptoms of colitis and even overturn viral infection by immunological stimulation in mice and humans. Conversely, S. cerevisiae was shown to increase intestinal damage and permeability when inoculated in germ-free mice, due to the enhancement of host purine metabolism and induction of uric acid synthesis.

### Candida expansion in the gut of lung cancer patients associates with an ecological signature that supports growth under dysbiotic conditions [^1168DPdb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Candida species, predominantly C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis, are among the most common causes of fungal bloodstream infections. These infections result in high rates of mortality for patients in intensive care units, or having a dysfunctional epithelial barrier or compromised immunity. Although the pathogenicity of different Candida species has been extensively studied –, few studies focused on understanding the commensal lifestyle of the fungus in the human gut. Candida, and some other yeast species, are commensal in the healthy human gut and may support the host function by supporting the digestion of food or influencing gut bacteria. We recently performed a systematic evaluation of the interactions between human gut bacteria and C. albicans using genome-scale modelling and pairwise growth simulations. We showed that 81% of C. albicans interactions with approximately 900 gut bacteria species were mutualistic (positive growth effects for both C. albicans and bacteria) or antagonistic (negative growth effect on C. albicans, positive growth effect on bacteria), with only a few examples of parasitism, in which C. albicans exerted adverse effects on gut bacteria. Therefore, our findings supported the hypothesis that the colonisation success of C. albicans is the result of adapting to life in the intestine and avoiding competitive interactions with other gut microbes.

### Immune interactions with pathogenic and commensal fungi: a two-way street [^115hoGVn]. Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

We are exposed to a wide spectrum of fungi including innocuous environmental organisms, opportunistic pathogens, commensal organisms, and fungi that can actively and explicitly cause disease. Much less is understood about effective host immunity to fungi than is generally known about immunity to bacterial and viral pathogens. Innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are required for effective host defense against Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and others, with specific elements of the host response regulating specific types of fungal infections (e.g., mucocutaneous versus systemic). Here we will review themes and controversies that are currently shaping investigation of antifungal immunity (primarily to Candida and Aspergillus) and will also examine the emerging field of the role of fungi in the gut microbiome.

### Roles of the gut virome and mycobiome in faecal microbiota transplantation [^117ETQSG]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an innovative approach to treat diseases that are associated with gut dysbiosis, by transferring a healthy stool microbiota to a recipient with disease. Beyond the bacteriome, the human gut also harbours diverse communities of viruses and fungi, collectively known as the virome and the mycobiome. The effect of the virome and the mycobiome on the success of FMT therapy has not been appreciated until recently. In this Review, we summarise the current literature on the effects of the gut virome and mycobiome on the treatment of various diseases with FMT. We discuss the beneficial effects and health concerns of viral and fungal transfer during FMT, and highlight the roles of bacteriophages and Candida species in FMT efficacy. We also summarise the intricate relationships between the gut virome, mycobiome, bacteriome, and host immunity underlying FMT effectiveness. Future efforts should be devoted to understanding the versatile roles and the therapeutic mechanisms of viral and fungal lineages, and their combinations, in different diseases. Harnessing the gut virome, mycobiome, and bacteriome in combination is a promising prospect for the future of FMT and microbiota-based therapies.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^115m1rpu]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Despite fungi comprising only 0.1% of the microbes within the gastrointestinal microbiota, the importance of the mycobiome is increasingly recognized across several diseases beyond infections ranging from cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Candida albicans is a yeast that colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract in 50%–60% of adults. Under homeostatic conditions, it acts as a commensal opportunistic pathogen that can provide benefits to the host, including protection against Clostridioides difficile and other bacterial pathogens along with positive interactions in the immune system. Despite potential benefits to the host, there are many complications. C. albicans colonization is associated with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease and serves as a reservoir for candidemia (Candida spp. in the bloodstream) in heavily immunocompromised patients, such as hematologic malignancy. Candidemia and invasive candidiasis carry a mortality approaching 50%, demonstrating the severity of this infection and importance of understanding the factors involved with C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization. For these reasons, in 2022, the World Health Organization designated C. albicans as a critical priority pathogen. Antibacterial use is a known risk factor for gastrointestinal colonization and expansion of C. albicans, arguing that the gastrointestinal microbiota serves a major function in protecting against colonization, a phenomenon known as colonization resistance. However, as more information related to the microbiome is discovered, it is becoming clearer that the interactions within the microbiome, metabolites produced by the microbiota, and host-microbiome interactions often play a larger role than the individual species of the microbiota. In this review, we will briefly explore the benefits and consequences of C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization followed by an in-depth review regarding gastrointestinal C. albicans colonization resistance with a focus on microbiota-host- C. albicans interactions and common external factors such as antimicrobials and diet.

### Landscape of the gut mycobiome dynamics during pregnancy and its relationship with host metabolism and pregnancy health [^117ExN1q]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have indicated host remodelling of the gut microbiome and metabolic changes during pregnancy, which may potentially impact maternal and infant health. The majority of these studies have primarily focused on gut or vaginal bacteria and metabolites, while very few studies investigated the gut fungi during pregnancy based on a prospective cohort study. Here we present evidence that the interaction between the Saccharomyces -dominant enterotype, gut microbial functionality and host metabolism may be particularly significant. The network analysis demonstrated that the Saccharomyces -dominant enterotype was associated with more gut microbial functionalities compared with other fungal enterotypes. A previous study reported that the enterotype dominated by Candida conferred an increased risk of multiple diseases, but we could not correlate the Candida -dominant enterotypes with pregnancy complications or adverse birth outcomes among pregnant women. Nevertheless, we found some specific core fungal genera, which were risk factors for pregnancy complications. The abundances of Mucor and Wallemia during early pregnancy were positively associated with the risk of GDM and PIH, respectively. We also validated the reported adverse effects of both GDM and PIH on birth outcomes, such as macrosomia, preterm birth and low birth weight. Moreover, the abundance of Mucor during early pregnancy was also directly associated with the risk of macrosomia, which was independent of GDM. These findings collectively highlight that Mucor and Wallemia may serve as examples that support the vital role of gut fungi in impacting pregnancy health.

### Development of gut mycobiome in infants and young children: a prospective cohort study [^1162Kvxf]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The composition of the gut fungal microbiome, mycobiome, is likely associated with human health. Yet, the development of gut mycobiome is poorly understood in infants and children. Here we investigate how perinatal events influence the development of gut mycobiome.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study of 140 infants, we used ITS gene sequencing of fecal samples from birth to the age of 18 months. We compared gut mycobiome composition according to delivery mode and exposure to intrapartum antibiotics during vaginal delivery.

Results

At birth, gut mycobiome were dominated by the genus Candida, at 6-month stool samples by Malassezia and Cystofilobasidium, and the 18-month stool samples by Trichosporon and unidentified fungi. Perinatal factors altered mycobiome. At 18 months, gut mycobiome of infants born vaginally consisted mostly of Trichosporon (32%) and unidentified fungi (31%), while those born via Cesarean section delivery samples had mycobiome dominated by Saccharomyces (50%). At the age of 18 months, those exposed to intrapartum antibiotics had mycobiome dominated by Trichosporon (66%) not seen in those unexposed to antibiotics.

Conclusions

Delivery mode and exposure to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis were markedly associated with gut mycobiome composition from birth to 18 months of age.

Impact

The composition of the gut mycobiome is likely associated with human health. Yet, the development of gut mycobiome is poorly understood in infants and children. In this prospective cohort study, delivery mode and exposure to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis were markedly associated with gut mycobiome composition from birth to 18 months of age. The impact of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis on fungal microbiome in vaginally born infants, previously shown to influence gut bacteriome composition, may be explained by the interaction between bacteria and fungi. Gut mycobiome composition likely deserves further investigation in relation to gut microbiome and health in children.

### The mycobiome: role in health and disease, and as a potential probiotic target in gastrointestinal disease [^113bd9Y2]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is home to trillions of microorganisms, some beneficial and others potentially harmful. Recent advances in science have allowed us to identify the multitude of organisms inhabiting the GI tract and parse out those that play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Unfortunately, most research has focused on studying only the bacteria while, overlooking a key player, fungus. In order to address this issue, we have focused our efforts on studying the fungal community in the GI tract known as the mycobiome. We found that patients with Crohn's disease (CD) tend to have much higher levels of the fungus Candida tropicalis compared to their healthy family members, as well as two bacteria, Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Furthermore, we showed that these three organisms worked together to form robust biofilms capable of exacerbating intestinal inflammation. Herein, we discuss the role of the mycobiome in health and disease, and highlight the importance of maintaining balance of the GI microbiota. Additionally, taking into consideration recent next generation sequencing data, we provide insight into potentially new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of IBD through the use of antifungals and/or probiotics aimed at establishing and maintaining a healthy balance of the GI total microbial community including fungi and bacteria.

### Gut mycobiome dysbiosis after sepsis and trauma [^114ovzZG]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis and trauma are known to disrupt gut bacterial microbiome communities, but the impacts and perturbations in the fungal (mycobiome) community after severe infection or injury, particularly in patients experiencing chronic critical illness (CCI), remain unstudied.

Methods

We assess persistence of the gut mycobiome perturbation (dysbiosis) in patients experiencing CCI following sepsis or trauma for up to two-to-three weeks after intensive care unit hospitalization.

Results

We show that the dysbiotic mycobiome arrays shift toward a pathobiome state, which is more susceptible to infection, in CCI patients compared to age-matched healthy subjects. The fungal community in CCI patients is largely dominated by Candida spp; while, the commensal fungal species are depleted. Additionally, these myco-pathobiome arrays correlate with alterations in micro-ecological niche involving specific gut bacteria and gut-blood metabolites.

Conclusions

The findings reveal the persistence of mycobiome dysbiosis in both sepsis and trauma settings, even up to two weeks post-sepsis and trauma, highlighting the need to assess and address the increased risk of fungal infections in CCI patients.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^116RFrTe]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

IMPACT OF DIET ON C. ALBICANS COLONIZATION

Diet can have profound effects on colonization resistance to pathogens. Lee et al. demonstrated that a high-fat diet combined with antibacterials led to higher colonization with E. coli and a longer period of susceptibility to E. coli colonization compared to mice receiving antibacterials and a low-fat diet, supporting the impact of diet on colonization resistance. Others have investigated dietary changes on C. albicans colonization, indicating that this may be a modifiable factor when considering colonization resistance. Given that C. albicans prefers to utilize glucose when available, Weig et al. previously investigated the impact of carbohydrate supplementation in the diet on C. albicans colonization in healthy humans. However, their group did not find that carbohydrate supplementation altered C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization. Because the subjects of this study were healthy, they likely had an intact microbiota that could ferment excess carbohydrates not absorbed in the small intestine, potentially explaining their negative results. Another group looked at C. albicans in a cohort of healthy adults and only found that snacking seemed to correlate with increased C. albicans colonization and that high salt reduced it. While there has not been a substantial impact on C. albicans colonization in humans based on diet, it is worth emphasizing that these studies were done under homeostatic conditions where colonization resistance is high. Patients with conditions that may reduce colonization resistance, such as diabetes or renal disease, are more likely to be placed on an altered diet, so gaining a better understanding of the impact of diet on the expansion of opportunistic organisms may improve the safety and quality of life for many who live with these diseases.

### Commensal yeast promotes Salmonella typhimurium virulence [^1167v6Yu]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Decades of research have illuminated the central role of the gut microbiome for human health. Among a multitude of functions, gut microorganisms provide colonization resistance to pathogens –, train the immune system, aid in digestionand modulate distal organ functions via microbial products –. Gut bacteria are the most abundant members of the gut microbiome and have been the focus of mechanistic research. Conversely, our knowledge on the roles of other members of the gut microbiome, such as viruses and fungi, is still lacking. Abundance and composition of the fungal microbiome (mycobiome) is greatly altered in multiple gastrointestinal diseases –. However, it is largely unknown how fungi metabolically integrate into the gastrointestinal environment and interact with commensal and pathogenic bacteria.

Some of the best-studied enteric pathogens are non-typhoidal Salmonella, which infect an estimated 100 million individuals per year globally. In healthy individuals, non-typhoidal Salmonella, such as Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella or STm), cause a localized infection of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in inflammatory diarrhoea. In immunocompromised individuals, Salmonella can disseminate to peripheral organs causing potentially fatal disease. To establish gut colonization, Salmonella must compete with resident microorganisms. Even though commensal fungi are found in all tested mammalian species, studies have predominantly focused on the role of gut-resident bacteria. The role of the mycobiome during infection with enteric pathogens has been largely unexplored.

One of the most prominent fungal colonizers of human mucosal surfaces is C. albicans. Recent studies have determined C. albicans to be present in the gut of more than 60% of healthy humans. Although usually a commensal, C. albicans can become pathogenic, particularly in immunocompromised patients. An important virulence mechanism of C. albicans is the ability to switch morphology from rapidly growing yeast to epithelium-penetrating hyphae. C. albicans is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn's disease. Although C. albicans cannot induce gut inflammation, it has been shown to exacerbate it. Salmonella and C. albicans therefore both thrive under inflammatory conditions in the gut, and both have high pathogenic potential. C. albicans represents an important human gut mycobiome member and is potentially present in the gut of a substantial number of patients when they become infected with Salmonella.

Our investigation on mechanistic interactions between Salmonella and C. albicans supports an important role for C. albicans carriage in the pathogenesis of Salmonella infection and delineates intricate fungal–bacterial–host crosstalk in the gut.

### Impact of diet and host genetics on the murine intestinal mycobiome [^111cz3e3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fungal-bacterial interactions within the total microbial gut community influence fungal composition and specific traits in AIL mice. It has already been shown that bacteria and fungi can form "consortia" in which they coexist. These interactions can play a role, especially during infections, when fungi like Candida are accompanied or challenged by bacteria or vice versa –. Within this study, comparing QTL for fungal and bacterial traits in AIL mice, no overlap between QTL of the two kingdoms was found. However, the identified correlations between fungal and bacterial taxa suggest the existence of putative key drivers within the gut ecosystem that are involved in the homeostasis regulation. Interestingly, four of the five identified key fungi genera, that were found to interact with most of the bacterial species in the gut, specifically Claviceps, Alternaria, Davidella, and Wallemia, were also significantly modulated by diet, suggesting that diet has a detrimental role on regulating microbe-microbe interactions in the gut, and is only one of the many potential mechanisms of how diet may modulate hosts' immune system.

Fungi are known to calibrate immunological responsiveness in humans that may improve the outcome of inflammatory disorders or infections. More recent reports have even implicated mycobiota in the pathogenesis of cancer in humans, and demonstrated that ablation of the commensal gut mycobiome by fluconazole treatment protected mice from developing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus, dissecting the interplay between host genetics and diet on shaping the gut mycobiome composition for the first time in a mammal, may have profound implications on human health and disease. Here, we demonstrated that host genetics not only modulates the composition of bacteria but also of commensal fungi in the gut and explains the largest proportion (28/51 Add QTL) of the phenotypic variation in fungal composition. Interestingly, interaction of host genetics with diet reveals novel associations (IntDiet QTL) and explains ~33% (17/51 IntDiet QTL) of the phenotypic variation in fungi composition in the gut. The remaining 12% of the phenotypic variation, are attributed to sex (IntSex QTL) and are consistent with previous reports showing a shift in intestinal mycobiome composition in a gender-dependent manner. These findings add to our understanding of how host genetics and diet shape the collective intestinal microbiome and warrant inclusion of diet and sex as covariates in human host–microbiome genome-wide association studies (mGWAS), as well as in experimental setups aiming at understanding the role of fungi in preclinical mouse models.

### Crossing kingdoms: how the mycobiota and fungal-bacterial interactions impact host health and disease [^116LaCwg]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Bacterial-fungal interactions in the gastrointestinal tract.

Recent studies have suggested that the mycobiota plays roles in maintaining homeostasis of the bacterial microbiota and influencing overall gut health. One study found that the administration of antifungal drugs to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated mice exacerbates colitis and induces changes in the microbiome. Here, the microbiome undergoes an expansion of the bacterial genera Hallella, Barnesiella, Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Lactobacillus and a reduction of Clostridium XIVa and Anaerostipes. Another group found that the ingestion of the pathogenic fungusby mice induced changes in the microbiota, notably with an increase in the genus Bacteroides and a decrease in Akkermansia. Another study demonstrated thataffects the recolonization of the cecum by the microbiota in mice treated with antibiotics. The presence of the fungus increased the recovery of bacterial diversity, specifically the return of Bacteroides species. However, it also allowed colonization by the pathobiontand reduced colonization of probiotic Lactobacillus strains (Fig. 2). The mechanism of howinfluences bacterial colonization is still unclear. A follow-up study revealed that antibiotic-treated-colonized mice showed reduced expression of specific immune genes but no visible changes in inflammation. These changes in expression could be limiting the host's ability to maintain microbial homeostasis, but there is still a possibility thatdirectly interacts with bacteria. A study that investigated differences in the microbiome between Japanese and Indian individuals proposed an interesting diet-fungal-bacterial interaction. The microbiome of the Indian participants showed a higher abundance of Candida and Prevotella. Since plants make up a major part of Indian diets, Pareek and colleagues went on to show that arabinoxylan, a plant polysaccharide, can be used as a growth factor by various Candida species. Finally, they showed that Candida supernatant enhances the growth ofand that prior colonization byis required for the colonization of germ-free mice by P. copri. These studies indicate that interactions between fungi and bacterial species influence gut homeostasis and are relevant to human health.

### Impact of microbiome-based interventions on gastrointestinal pathogen colonization in the intensive care unit [^112Z1eDW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications of gastrointestinal pathogen colonization

Around 4–11% of all patients in the ICU have guts that are colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), VRE, or MDR Gram-negative bacteria at the time of ICU admission; – among patients who are free of MDROs on admission, an additional 12–14% become colonized during their ICU stay. Gastrointestinal colonization with MDROs increases risk for subsequent clinical infection with the colonizing organisms as much as 10-fold.– Subsequent mortality rates are high with MDR infection causing up to 9 deaths for every 100 patients admitted to the ICU.

Colonization by Candida species is also very common and can occur in up to 80% of critically ill patients after 1 week in the ICU. Common species include C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis. Colonization is a well-established risk factor for subsequent Candida infection, leading to the development of the Candida colonization index as an early warning tool for invasive candidiasis. Although the proportion of colonized ICU patients who later develop invasive candidiasis is low, associated mortality from invasive infection ranges from 5% to 71%. –

Gastrointestinal colonization can also increase risk for extra-intestinal infections. When patients shed gastrointestinal bacteria into the ICU environment via feces, subsequent inoculation back into the patient via contaminated intravenous or urinary catheter insertion can occur. Other more direct routes of infection can also occur, such as aspiration of gastric contents or bacterial translocation across edematous bowel. While it is unknown how frequently such events happen, an increasingly large number of studies support the idea that most new healthcare-associated infections do not come from other patients but instead from colonizing bacteria present within the patient's own gut at the time of hospital admission.

Interventions aimed at the prevention or eradication of gastrointestinal pathogens therefore have the potential to prevent clinical infection.

### T cell antifungal immunity and the role of C-type lectin receptors [^111WJn6f]. Trends in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Mycobiome

Fungi colonize various ecological niches including mammalian oral, urogenital, placental, skin, airway, and gut mucosae, and their interactions with the host significantly impact on health and disease. Although not fully understood, recent studies suggest that fungal colonization during early life impacts on the development and maturation of the host immune system and subsequent protection or susceptibility to disease. For instance, colonization with fungal species such as Candida, Rhodotorula, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Alternaria correlates with the risk of developing childhood atopy and asthma driven by Th2 immunity. By contrast, Cladosporium exposure can protect against the development of allergy. Of relevance, alterations of the human gut mycobiota caused by antimicrobial use can contribute to the development of fungus-induced allergy, IBD, and systemic fungal infections (Figure 3). For instance, antibiotic-dependent intestinal expansion of the commensal fungus Wallemia mellicola enhances the severity of allergic airway disease in mice. Furthermore, in mice, treatment with antibiotics can lead to overgrowth of C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract and increase allergic airway responses following intranasal inoculation with A. fumigatus. Supporting these data, during pulmonary A. fumigatus infection, oral antibiotic treatment was shown to reduce Th17 functional responses, while increasing Th2 responses in the mouse lung, relative to untreated mice.

Recent developments have linked gut fungal Th1/Th17 immune responses with protection to systemic infections. For instance, intestinal colonization by C. albicans in mice can protect the host not only from distal fungus-associated infections such as disseminated C. albicans and pulmonary A. fumigatus but also from other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In humans, protective Th17 cells are predominantly driven by gut C. albicans which contribute to preventing pathogenesis by these opportunistic commensal fungi. As previously discussed, crossreactive Candida -specific Th17 cells can be triggered to expand by other fungi such as airborne Aspergillus spores, resulting in detrimental lung inflammation in humans and mice. These findings highlight the fine line between the protective and pathogenic potential of T helper cells and their association with gut microbes. Nevertheless, induction of cellular systemic immunity through modulation of the mucosal mycobiome is an attractive approach to tackling infection. To fully explore this, however, it will be necessary to understand the mechanisms that modulate antifungal T cell maintenance and memory development, as well as the regulatory mechanisms involved.

### Mapping the human gut mycobiome in middle-aged and elderly adults: multiomics insights and implications for host metabolic health [^111dWRgx]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The human gut fungal community, known as the mycobiome, plays a fundamental role in the gut ecosystem and health. Here we aimed to investigate the determinants and long-term stability of gut mycobiome among middle-aged and elderly adults. We further explored the interplay between gut fungi and bacteria on metabolic health.

Design

The present study included 1244 participants from the Guangzhou Nutrition and Health Study. We characterised the long-term stability and determinants of the human gut mycobiome, especially long-term habitual dietary consumption. The comprehensive multiomics analyses were performed to investigate the ecological links between gut bacteria, fungi and faecal metabolome. Finally, we examined whether the interaction between gut bacteria and fungi could modulate the metabolic risk.

Results

The gut fungal composition was temporally stable and mainly determined by age, long-term habitual diet and host physiological states. Specifically, compared with middle-aged individuals, Blastobotrys and Agaricomycetes spp were depleted, while Malassezia was enriched in the elderly. Dairy consumption was positively associated with Saccharomyces but inversely associated with Candida. Notably, Saccharomycetales spp interacted with gut bacterial diversity to influence insulin resistance. Bidirectional mediation analyses indicated that bacterial function or faecal histidine might causally mediate an impact of Pichia on blood cholesterol.

Conclusion

We depict the sociodemographic and dietary determinants of human gut mycobiome in middle-aged and elderly individuals, and further reveal that the gut mycobiome may be closely associated with the host metabolic health through regulating gut bacterial functions and metabolites.

### Multi-kingdom ecological drivers of microbiota assembly in preterm infants [^111kGRK3]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

The gut microbiota of preterm infants develops predictably 1–7, with pioneer species colonizing the gut after birth, followed by an ordered succession of microorganisms. The gut microbiota is vital to the health of preterm infants 8,9, but the forces that shape these predictable dynamics of microbiome assembly are unknown. The environment, the host and interactions between microorganisms all potentially shape the dynamics of the microbiota, but in such a complex ecosystem, identifying the specific role of any individual factor is challenging 10–14. Here we use multi-kingdom absolute abundance quantification, ecological modelling and experimental validation to address this challenge. We quantify the absolute dynamics of bacteria, fungi and archaea in a longitudinal cohort of 178 preterm infants. We uncover microbial blooms and extinctions, and show that there is an inverse correlation between bacterial and fungal loads in the infant gut. We infer computationally and demonstrate experimentally in vitro and in vivo that predictable assembly dynamics may be driven by directed, context-dependent interactions between specific microorganisms. Mirroring the dynamics of macroscopic ecosystems 15–17, a late-arriving member of the microbiome, Klebsiella, exploits the pioneer microorganism, Staphylococcus, to gain a foothold within the gut. Notably, we find that interactions between different kingdoms can influence assembly, with a single fungal species-Candida albicans-inhibiting multiple dominant genera of gut bacteria. Our work reveals the centrality of simple microbe-microbe interactions in shaping host-associated microbiota, which is critical both for our understanding of microbiota ecology and for targeted microbiota interventions.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^112pWWdm]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

While there are potential benefits to C. albicans colonization within the gastrointestinal tract, the consequences of a gastrointestinal expansion of C. albicans in immunocompromised patients are clearly problematic, considering the potential for invasive candidiasis. Although low C. albicans colonization in healthy patients is potentially beneficial, antibacterial use and concurrent microbiota disruption set the stage for C. albicans colonization and expansion with many potential consequences. Unfortunately, the limitation of antimicrobials is often not feasible in those who are heavily immunocompromised, where antimicrobial prophylaxis not only reduces infections but also improves mortality. Additionally, despite antifungal prophylaxis, there are cases of breakthrough invasive candidiasis through drug resistance and host factors. The collective work on colonization resistance (Fig. 1) demonstrates several microbiota-host interactions that are lost by antibacterials. Future studies should be completed to investigate how to replace these microbiota-host interactions with medications in environments where the microbiota is inevitably going to be altered by antibacterials and replacement of the microbiota may not be effective or safe.

It is worth emphasizing the limitation of this review focusing on C. albicans. This is mostly due to prior studies focusing on C. albicans, although there was a recent study looking at differences in colonization across several species of Candida, demonstrating the importance of consideration of different species for the future. Additionally, while C. albicans remains the most common species of invasive candidiasis, there are increasing rates of non- albicans infections. Lastly, many of the studies reviewed in this study used different strains of C. albicans. While SC5314 is considered the standard laboratory strain, there have been differences in colonization across different strains, including human-derived strains. Another limitation to note is that this review focuses on gastrointestinal colonization resistance only. C. albicans can colonize the skin, oral cavity, and genitourinary tract as well, each of which has its own accompanying microbiota.

### The role of gut mycobiome in health and diseases [^116pYJ38]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mode of feeding. Breast milk is considered the most ideal nutrition for infants offering protection from neonatal sepsis and facilitating infant growth and development. Several studies have shown that the mode of feeding impact on the gut bacterial microbiome. Boix-Amorós et al. characterized mycobiome composition in breast milk from healthy mothers and showed that the fungal composition of human breast milk was dominated by Malassezia (44%), followed by Candida (19%) and Saccharomyces (12%). The most abundant viable fungi detected were R. mucilaginosa and C. parapsilosis (Figure 2). Azevedo et al. suggested that the feeding mode of the infant (formula-fed or breast-fed infants) did not result in a difference in their oral yeast carriage. In contrast, Ward et al. suggested that feeding mode might affect the infant oral mycobiota. Currently, the relationship between infant and maternal gut mycobiome and whether breast milk leads to transmission of mycobiome from mother to infant remain controversial and require future studies. Future studies should focus on longitudinal tracking of the early-life mycobiota using mother–baby pairs while monitoring health outcomes during the first year of life. In addition, given the known interactions between the bacteria and fungi, future studies should also focus on the analysis of both bacteria and fungi to better characterize their structural and functional relationships, as well as their combined effects on health outcomes.

### The role of gut mycobiome in health and diseases [^113S1BES]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diet could be one of the major driving force influencing gut fungal mycobiota structure. A high-fat diet changed the gut fungal communities in murine models. It was reported that the abundances of the Alternaria, Saccharomyces, Septoriella, and Tilletiopsis genera were higher in mice administrated with normal chow compared with those fed with high-fat diet. Moreover, diet rich in plant-derived carbohydrate can support Candida in the gut of Indian subjects, while saturated fatty acid and coconut oil–rich diet negatively correlated with the load of Candida in the gut. – In addition, dietary short-chain fatty acids correlated with decreased colonization of Aspergillus spp.

Probiotics and prebiotics have been designed to provide health benefit. Multiple studies have identified several bacteria species with antifungal effects in vitro experiments, like Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. – In mice models, oral heat-killed Lactobacillus acidophilus (HKLA) and heat killed Lactobacillus casei could decrease the colonization of viable C. albicans in the tract. Colitis would induce overgrowth of opportunistic yeast pathogen C. glabrata in murine gut. Mice with colitis treated with β-glucans presented a decreased level of C. glabrata in the gut compared the colitis mice. Mycobiota regulation with probiotics and prebiotics in human study is rare, increasing evidences provide the possibility that the antagonistic relationships between bacterial and fungal species may decrease the perturbations and enhance the cross-talks in the gut to establish a balanced microbial community.

Other than bacteria, fungal probiotics could also confer beneficial effects to support human health. S. cerevisiae and S. boulardii are the most common yeast. S. boulardii has shown the potential abilities to alleviate gastrointestinal disorder caused by Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella, and Clostridium difficile. – In the gut of patients with IBD, the environment may favor fungi over bacteria, leading to both fungal and bacterial microbiome dysbiosis. Guslandi has demonstrated that S. boulardii could be used to treat IBD effectively, modulating the microbial composition in the gut. However, whether S. boulardii was involved in the restoration of mycobiome composition in the gut remains unknown. Understanding how probiotics interplay with fungal community to maintain or restore a stable ecosystem and improve human health remains a challenge for future work.

In another context, the fungal cell wall component BDG has not only been shown to be elevated in serum from patients living with chronic HIV, advanced liver cirrhosis, and other conditions associated with microbial translocation but has also been identified as marker of immune activation and thereby a driver of persistent inflammation, which correlates with clinical outcomes. Of note, serum BDG concentrations have been shown to correlate with Candida overgrowth and dysbiosis of the gut mycobiome. These observations may intuitively offer two potential ways for countering BDG translocation, namely either by reducing Candida overgrowth in the gut with oral nonabsorbable antifungals, as shown in mouse models by Yang and colleagues, or via early efficient treatment of the underlying diseases that result in the gut becoming less leaky, as shown for early initiation of ART in HIV infection, which prevented further increase in BDG levels. Another thoroughly examined interplay is the gut microbiota brain axis and its role in various neurological diseases.

The importance of taking a look at the bigger picture by including all microbiota is impressively demonstrated by the results reported by Feys et al. The fungal part has historically been a matter of second look and underappreciation, which has, however, not been paralleled by subordinate importance. Embracing our unknowing is the second step to real insight.

### Commensalism and pathogenesis of Candida albicans at the mucosal interface [^112yskUF]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Fungi are important and often underestimated human pathogens. Infections with fungi mostly originate from the environment, from soil or airborne spores. By contrast, Candida albicans, one of the most common and clinically important fungal pathogens, permanently exists in the vast majority of healthy individuals as a member of the human mucosal microbiota. Only under certain circumstances will these commensals cause infections. However, although the pathogenic behaviour and disease manifestation of C. albicans have been at the centre of research for many years, its asymptomatic colonization of mucosal surfaces remains surprisingly understudied. In this Review, we discuss the interplay of the fungus, the host and the microbiome on the dualism of commensal and pathogenic life of C. albicans, and how commensal growth is controlled and permitted. We explore hypotheses that could explain how the mucosal environment shapes C. albicans adaptations to its commensal lifestyle, while still maintaining or even increasing its pathogenic potential.

Analysis of the Human Microbiome Project data determined Saccharomyces, Malassezia, Candida, and Cyberlindnera as the four most abundant genera present in the human gut (Fig. 1). However, researchers found very high mycobiome variability between individuals and within individuals over time. Compared to the bacterial gut microbiome, the gut mycobiome thus seems to be less consistent and stable over time. The high fluctuation might in part be explained by fungi being introduced in the gastrointestinal lumen via diet intake and environment. Indeed, a standard human diet contains high levels of live fungi and fungal DNA, and some fungal genera identified in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract are thought to lack the ability to grow at the temperature, pH, and low oxygen present in the gut environment. Saccharomyces is ubiquitously present in the human diet, while Malassezia is the most abundant fungus colonizing the human skin. Cyberlindnera is a food additive and most likely acquired through the diet, while Candida is the most identified fungus in the oral cavity. Indeed, a small-scale study showed that presence of Saccharomyces in human feces was directly dependent on diet intake, while, as previously mentioned, was associated with oral hygiene.

Current data thus suggest that some fungi in the human gastrointestinal tract can be classified as transient. However, evidence for true colonizers can also be found., and others have been shown to bloom in the gut under inflammatory conditions. This is particularly highlighted in patients affected with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whereincreases in abundance during inflammation. However, it is not yet clear ifcreates the inflammatory environment or if its increase in abundance is a consequence of inflammation. A unique phylum of resident fungi can be found in some herbivores but is not detected humans or mice. Neocallimastigomycota are strictly anaerobic fungi that are present in all foregut fermenters (e.g. cows) and some hindgut fermenters (e.g. elephants), where they aid in the digestion of lignocellulose. Despite being an anaerobic environment, the human gut does not seem to support the colonization of strictly anaerobic fungi.

### Candida expansion in the gut of lung cancer patients associates with an ecological signature that supports growth under dysbiotic conditions [^113dTS6r]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Candida species overgrowth in the human gut is considered a prerequisite for invasive candidiasis, but our understanding of gut bacteria promoting or restricting this overgrowth is still limited. By integrating cross-sectional mycobiome and shotgun metagenomics data from the stool of 75 male and female cancer patients at risk but without systemic candidiasis, bacterial communities in high Candida samples display higher metabolic flexibility yet lower contributional diversity than those in low Candida samples. We develop machine learning models that use only bacterial taxa or functional relative abundances to predict the levels of Candida genus and species in an external validation cohort with an AUC of 78.6–81.1%. We propose a mechanism for intestinal Candida overgrowth based on an increase in lactate-producing bacteria, which coincides with a decrease in bacteria that regulate short chain fatty acid and oxygen levels. Under these conditions, the ability of Candida to harness lactate as a nutrient source may enable Candida to outcompete other fungi in the gut.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^111cx9Tj]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

While there is not enough data currently to support a specific diet when considering C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization, it likely warrants increased investigation given the murine studies and limitations of the human studies as discussed above. In particular, dietary factors that promote C. albicans colonization may also support colonization of other infectious organisms with similar metabolisms, such as other species of Candida or other opportunistic bacteria. Additionally, as patients with hematologic malignancy have a high risk of invasive candidiasis, it is important to note that these patients often receive an altered diet known as a neutropenic diet. The use of the neutropenic diet is controversial, as multiple meta-analyses concluded that there is no data to support the implementation of a neutropenic diet to prevent infections in the hematologic malignancy population. Given evidence suggesting that there can be increased gastrointestinal colonization of C. albicans with different diets, future studies should consider investigating if the neutropenic diet has any impact on C. albicans colonization.

### Adaptive immunity induces mutualism between commensal eukaryotes [^113wBa9M]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Pathogenic fungi reside in the intestinal microbiota but rarely cause disease. Little is known about the interactions between fungi and the immune system that promote commensalism. Here we investigate the role of adaptive immunity in promoting mutual interactions between fungi and host. We find that potentially pathogenic Candida species induce and are targeted by intestinal immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses. Focused studies on Candida albicans reveal that the pathogenic hyphal morphotype, which is specialized for adhesion and invasion, is preferentially targeted and suppressed by intestinal IgA responses. IgA from mice and humans directly targets hyphal-enriched cell-surface adhesins. Although typically required for pathogenesis, C. albicans hyphae are less fit for gut colonization 1,2 and we show that immune selection against hyphae improves the competitive fitness of C. albicans. C. albicans exacerbates intestinal colitis 3 and we demonstrate that hyphae and an IgA-targeted adhesin exacerbate intestinal damage. Finally, using a clinically relevant vaccine to induce an adhesin-specific immune response protects mice from C. albicans-associated damage during colitis. Together, our findings show that adaptive immunity suppresses harmful fungal effectors, with benefits to both C. albicans and its host. Thus, IgA uniquely uncouples colonization from pathogenesis in commensal fungi to promote homeostasis.

### The neglected gut microbiome: fungi, protozoa, and bacteriophages in inflammatory bowel disease [^115JzSRC]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Are gut fungi pathogenic or protective?

Fungi are found on every skin and mucosal surface of the human body, with the skin, vagina, oral cavity, small intestine, and large intestine harboring the highest abundance and diversity of fungal species. Most of these species are yeasts such as Candida, Malassezia, and Saccharomyces, and these species have been associated with IBD. Elevated levels of anti- S. cerevisiae antibodies have been found in IBD patients, and these antibodies have been associated with an early risk for surgery in CD patients, and used to help differentiateand predict the development of CD and UC. Higher abundances of Candida species, particularly C. albicans, have been found in CD patients and their first-degree relatives, and in a mouse model of colitis. This has sparked the hypothesis that intestinal inflammation leads to a compromised mucosal barrier that allows C. albicans and potentially other opportunistic bacteria and fungi to proliferate and/or penetrate the mucosal barrier, thus driving interaction with the host immune system. Additionally, this fungal-induced inflammation may be exacerbated in IBD patients with inherited genetic mutations in antifungal immune genes (eg, DECTIN -1, Card9).

However, there is also evidence that Candida and Saccharomyces are not exclusively pathogenic. For example, the presence of Candida species had an alleviating effect in a mouse model of acute colitisand S. cerevisiae has been shown to have an attenuating effect on Escherichia coli –induced mouse colitis, suggesting that fungi may have a protective effect against IBD. Another species, S. boulardii, also had an attenuating effect in mice with carcinogenic colitis, a condition that can develop from IBD. The protective effect of S. boulardii has been trialed in CD patients with mixed success rates. Thus, there is evidence that some fungi may be beneficial in IBD, but inconsistent findings exemplify the complexity of fungi-host interactions. Fungal species may have a spectrum of effects that depend on multiple factors related to an individual's physiology and microbiome. These complexities cannot be gleaned from single-species interrogations, and instead, methods examining the whole microbial community are now being favored.

### Fungal infections and the fungal microbiome in hepatobiliary disorders [^115yaeF3]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver and biliary diseases affect more than a billion people worldwide, with high associated morbidity and mortality. The impact of the intestinal bacterial microbiome on liver diseases has been well established. However, the fungal microbiome, or mycobiome, has been overlooked for a long time. Recently, several studies have shed light on the role of the mycobiome in the development and progression of hepatobiliary diseases. In particular, the fungal genus Candida has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple hepatobiliary conditions. Herein, we compare colonisation and infection, describe mycobiome findings in the healthy state and across the various hepatobiliary conditions, and point toward communalities. We detail how quantitation of immune responses to fungal antigens can be employed to predict disease severity, e.g. using antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae or specific anti-Candida albicans antibodies. We also show how fungal products (e.g. beta-glucans, candidalysin) activate the host's immune system to exacerbate liver and biliary diseases. Finally, we describe how the gut mycobiome can be modulated to ameliorate hepatobiliary conditions.

Gut mycobiome in metabolic diseases

Animal and human studies support a role of gut fungi in metabolic disease. In a mouse model, Heisel et al. investigated the effects of obesogenic diet on fungal composition by ITS2 sequencing and found that S. cerevisiae in the gut was significantly more abundant in lean mice than in mice fed with a high-fat diet. In an obese subject (body weight index = 48.9), a higher fecal fungal diversity was observed compared with healthy lean individuals. Furthermore, by using parallel aerobic culture-dependent approach on 24 subjects and ITS-based sequencing on 52 subjects, impaired fungal communities were reported in the gut of obese individuals, characterized by an increased presence of the phylum Ascomycota, the class Saccharomycetes, and the families Dipodascaceae and Saccharomycetaceae as compared with nonobese individuals. These findings suggest that obese subjects had altered gut fungi composition compared with their lean counterparts.

Mycobiome dysbiosis has also been reported in the gut of patients with diabetes mellitus. – A higher diversity in fecal fungal species was found to distinguish children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) from healthy controls. Moreover, a significantly increase in Candida colonization was found in the fecal samples of patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes compared with controls, which was verified by quantitative real-time PCR and medium cultures. In contrast, a separate study reported that C. albicans was significantly less prevalent in individuals with T1DM (62% of all strains identified) compared to control subjects (85% of all strains identified) based on medium cultures. Moreover, the fungal species isolated in this study were shown to be more resistant to antifungal drugs. Overall, the role of Candida in the pathogenesis of T1DM requires further confirmation. Using fungal ITS1 metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples from 10 healthy controls, 14 newly diagnosed T2DM, and 16 long-standing patients with T2DM, Bhute et al. found that opportunistic fungal pathogens such as Aspergillus and Candida were more abundant in newly diagnosed subjects compared with other groups. Jayasudha et al. used metagenomic sequencing to characterize fungal structure in fecal samples from 21 individuals with T2DM and 30 healthy controls. They found that patients with T2DM had increased fungal richness and evenness in the gut compared to healthy controls. An increase in the abundance of known human pathogens (genus Candida, Kodamaea, and Meyerozyma) and a decrease in the phylum Mucoromycota were noted in the gut of T2DM subjects.

### Morphogenetic transitions in the adaptation of Candida albicans to the mammalian gut [^115V26Ss]. Microbes and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Candida albicans is a pathobiont in humans that forms part of the mycobiota in healthy individuals and can cause different pathologies upon alterations of the host defenses. The mammalian gut is clinically relevant as this niche is the most common pool for bloodstream-derived infections. The ability of C. albicans to switch from yeast to hypha has been related to the commensal-to-pathogen transition and is, therefore, considered relevant in virulence. Recently, filaments have been implicated in the humoral response in the gut. C. albicans exhibits other morphologies that play different roles in pathogenicity and commensalism. This review focuses on the role of these morphological transitions in C. albicans proliferation and its establishment as a commensal in the mammalian gut, paying special attention to the transcription factors involved in their regulation.

An of ﬁ cial American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115qN5p3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In the ICU, the prescription of antifungals to prevent or treat IC requires consideration of risks associated with widespread antifungal administration. For the individual patient, antifungals may be associated with adverse effects and drug interactions. The panel was unable to assess adverse effects in this guideline iteration because of inconsistent reporting, but, reassuringly, echinocandins and fluconazole are generally better tolerated than mold-active azoles and AmB formulations. Increasingly, the influence of the gut mycobiome on maintenance of various aspects of human health and disease, particularly the gut bacterial microbiome assembly, is being appreciated and is likely perturbed by antifungal use. The sequelae of prophylactic and empiric antifungals on the gut mycobiome has not been studied. Beyond the individual, the epidemiology of Candida in ICUs is changing. Both the patient and the environment can be reservoirs of resistance, but it is not yet clear whether antifungal use is, at least in part, driving this change. In the United States, two-thirds of Candida isolates are non- albicans, with increasing incidence of Candida glabrata with increased minimum inhibitory concentrations to a triazole. The global threat of Candida auris, which is often resistant to all available antifungals, persists on environmental surfaces and is resilient to decontamination and requires close surveillance. Close surveillance of antifungal use, species causing IC, and fungal epidemiology within ICUs is required for early detection of associations and trends.

GASTROINTESTINAL METABOLITE PROFILE CHANGES AND C. ALBICANS COLONIZATION

Studies in this area are limited, but an examination of metabolite changes seen with antimicrobial therapy and diet alterations, two factors linked to C. albicans expansion, may provide clues about metabolite changes associated with C. albicans susceptibility. As antibacterials are a major risk factor for C. albicans colonization, it is important to consider the impact of antibacterials on the metabolite profile in the gastrointestinal tract. Antibacterials in mice reduce Clostridia with a corresponding increase in availability of carbohydrates, mainly sugar alcohols such as sorbitol. Others have also demonstrated that antibacterials in mice profoundly impact the intestinal metabolome, including an increase in carbohydrates. This decrease in Clostridia does cause a decrease in microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids, resulting in an increase in colonic epithelial oxygenation, as discussed above. However, it also raises the question of the consequence of having increased carbon sources in the colon for potential pathogens, including C. albicans, to utilize. C. albicans readily uses glucose at sites of dissemination (blood, liver, and brain) where glucose is plentiful, but glucose is limited in the colon during homeostasis. We demonstrated that C. albicans predominantly reduces carbohydrates, including sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, when colonizing germ-free mice with C. albicans and comparing colonic metabolite profiles of germ-free mice or gnotobiotic mice colonized with C. albicans. While this work suggests that metabolite availability could impact colonization resistance, more work is needed to better understand the impact of antibacterial use, carbohydrate availability, and oxygen availability on C. albicans gastrointestinal colonization.

### Gut fungal dysbiosis correlates with reduced efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in Clostridium difficile infection [^114XKTfq]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The past decade has witnessed an increasing use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a promising treatment option for several diseases –, yet success rates are variable with a cure rate of 85–90% in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) –, and a response rate of 30–50% in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) –. Such variations may be related to disease traits, recipient factors or donor characteristics. The mechanisms underlying a successful FMT and its relationship with gut microbial profiles in donor–recipient pairs remain elusive. To date, the efficacy of FMT has been mostly ascribed to the restoration of a normal bacterial microbiota composition and function, and a sustained coexistence of donor and recipient bacterial strains –. Recently, bacteriophages have been shown to be altered in CDI after FMT and these changes were associated with treatment outcome –. The human gastrointestinal tract is also colonized by a large population of fungi, collectively referred to as the mycobiota, which play an important role in human health. Our gut mycobiota contributes to normal human physiology and in some cases can recapitulate the benefit of intestinal bacteria via regulating host immunity and maintaining intestinal homeostasis –. Whether donor-derived mycobiota can colonize a recipient host, the fate of donor and recipient mycobiota after FMT and their relationship with treatment outcomes are unknown.

Here, we study the gut mycobiota of FMT-treated subjects with CDI to explore the effects of FMT on the gut mycobiome in association with treatment outcome. We show enteric mycobiota dysbiosis in CDI subjects, and that cure after FMT is more frequently observed when donor-derived fungal taxa predominate in the recipient mycobiota. The gut mycobiome of FMT nonresponders and antibiotic-treated CDI subjects displays a dominant presence of Candida and Candida albicans after treatment. Hence, C. albicans abundance is associated with unfavorable FMT outcome in humans. Furthermore, we show that C. albicans compromises FMT efficacy in a mouse model of CDI.

### Infant fungal communities: current knowledge and research opportunities [^117CMSU8]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The beneficial role of microbial colonization to human health is becoming increasingly clear. Recent efforts to define a healthy microbiota show that the microbial communities inhabiting our bodies are diverse and complex, and that colonization dynamics during early life may have lasting impacts on adult health. The term "microbiome" describes the community of microbes living on and within an organism using genetic analysis, usually within a particular niche or body site. Most literature discussing the microbiome, however, pertains only to the bacterial microbiota. Although bacteria constitute the majority of the non-host biomass of humans, they are not the only microorganisms contributing to the microbial ecosystem of the host. For example, human-associated fungi have been largely overlooked. On a cellular basis, approximately 0.1% of the microbes in the adult intestine are fungi, and these fungi are estimated to represent approximately 60 unique species. Although fungi can be human pathogens, especially in association with underlying immunodeficiencies, many fungi are benign commensal inhabitants of human body niches and some have been shown to confer health benefits. For example, previous culture-based and targeted PCR approaches for characterizing the mycobiota have shown humans to be colonized with commensal fungi across multiple body sites. Some species, such as Saccharomyces boulardii, have been shown to be effective at preventing and treating human gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (e.g. diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome). Importantly, overgrowth of fungi leading to infections is more common in infants than adults and can result in significant morbidity and mortality in at-risk infants such as those born prematurely. Thus, knowing what a healthy fungal microbiota (mycobiota) is composed of and what factors affect its establishment and maturation during infancy is important if we are to learn how early-life microbial communities affect pediatric and adult health.

### The hyphal-specific toxin candidalysin promotes fungal gut commensalism [^113ubv7B]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

The fungus Candida albicans frequently colonizes the human gastrointestinal tract, from which it can disseminate to cause systemic disease. This polymorphic species can transition between growing as single-celled yeast and as multicellular hyphae to adapt to its environment. The current dogma of C. albicans commensalism is that the yeast form is optimal for gut colonization, whereas hyphal cells are detrimental to colonization but critical for virulence 1–3. Here, we reveal that this paradigm does not apply to multi-kingdom communities in which a complex interplay between fungal morphology and bacteria dictates C. albicans fitness. Thus, whereas yeast-locked cells outcompete wild-type cells when gut bacteria are absent or depleted by antibiotics, hyphae-competent wild-type cells outcompete yeast-locked cells in hosts with replete bacterial populations. This increased fitness of wild-type cells involves the production of hyphal-specific factors including the toxin candidalysin 4,5, which promotes the establishment of colonization. At later time points, adaptive immunity is engaged, and intestinal immunoglobulin A preferentially selects against hyphal cells 1,6. Hyphal morphotypes are thus under both positive and negative selective pressures in the gut. Our study further shows that candidalysin has a direct inhibitory effect on bacterial species, including limiting their metabolic output. We therefore propose that C. albicans has evolved hyphal-specific factors, including candidalysin, to better compete with bacterial species in the intestinal niche.

### Development of gut mycobiome in infants and young children: a prospective cohort study [^111CXdRT]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Given that exposure to antibiotics at birth has previously been shown to influence the development of the gut bacteriome, we found that intrapartum antibacterial antibiotics, without having any direct effect on fungi, significantly affected the gut mycobiome of vaginally born newborns for at least 18 months after birth. Exposure to antibacterial agents has previously been shown to have a long-term influence on the human gut mycobiome in a cohort of 14 healthy adults, possibly by influencing bacterial-fungal interactions, including disruption and resilience of fungal community compositions. Our analogous finding was that antibiotic exposure at birth altered the development of the gut mycobiome at least up to 18 months of age, most likely by influencing bacterial–fungal interactions.

There are still limited data available on the role of the mycobiome in the human gut microbiome because most existing observations have been focused on the bacteriome. This is understandable, since the human gut microbiome has been estimated to consist of 99% bacteria. The role of other microbes may also be important, however, either through direct host–microbe interactions, or alternatively, through microbe–microbe interactions. This has been demonstrated by specifically a gut commensal Candida albicans, which has been shown to interact with gut bacteria and cause both bacterial and fungal dysbiosis. Environmental effects such as diet and the use of antibiotics have already been observed to affect the mycobiome and bacteriome alike, which may be partly caused by the mutualistic relationship between fungi and bacteria. –

### Development of gut mycobiome in infants and young children: a prospective cohort study [^111BvzH2]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The gut microbiome consists of bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and protozoa, but while the human gut microbiome has been studied extensively, there are limited data available that extend beyond the bacterial microbiome, also known as the bacteriome. It is only recently that the number of studies of the gut mycobiome, i.e. fungi in the gut, has started to increase regarding both animals – and humans.–

The composition of the gut mycobiome has been shown to be associated with human health. Decreased biodiversity and a higher prevalence of the genera Candida and Malassezia, as well as strong bacteria-fungi associations, have been linked with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the gut mycobiome has been associated with obesity, particularly with fungi related to lipid and glucose metabolism. The presence of Candida in the gut microbiome has been thought to contribute to glucose metabolism disorders, and shifts in the gut mycobiome have also been associated with diseases, such as colorectal cancer, chronic liver diseases, atopic dermatitis, and multiple sclerosis. Fungal colonization of the gut likely starts at birth, at least partially through vertical transmission from mother to child. Willis et al. studied the presence of fungi in the feces of newborn infants and found a low biomass mycobiome. In preterm infants, mycobiome dominated by the genus Candida has been observed. There are limited data on early-life factors affecting gut mycobiome composition. We have shown previously that exposure to antibiotics at birth markedly changes the composition of the gut bacteriomeand its main source shift from mother to other sources.

We set out here to characterize the development of the gut mycobiome in a prospective cohort study of 140 newborn infants from birth to 18 months of age.

Early life gut mycobiota

Early life fungal colonization has an impact on health outcomes of infants by training their immune system. Gut mycobiome in early life and factors that influence their development are shown in Figure 2. Infant fecal mycobiome was characterized by a low relative abundance of fungi composition and richness. Mother and infant fecal mycobiome were profiled in 15 mother–infant pairs in the first year of life by 18s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota, with the genus Saccharomyces and the class Exobasidiomycetes, were the most represented fungal component found in meconium. In another study, fecal samples from 298 mother–offspring pairs were analyzed by ITS1 amplicon sequencing. S. cerevisiae was the most abundant species in the gut of infants from 1 year of age onwards. Besides, Debaryomyces hansenii prevailed up to 3 months in the infant's feces. The 10-day, 1-year, and 2-year fecal samples from infants were richer in R. mucilaginosa, whereas the 3-month samples showed a high colonizer of C. parapsilosis. To further investigate early fungal community establishment, Ward et al. assessed the skin, oral, and anal mycobiomes of 16 infants over the first month of life and the anal and vaginal mycobiomes of 17 mothers using ITS2 amplicon sequencing. Infant mycobiomes varied by three body sites; skin mycobiome were dominated by C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, and C. orthopsilosis; oral mycobiome was enriched with C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, S. cerevisiae, C. orthopsilosis, C. albicans, and Cladosporium velox; and anal mycobiome were colonized with C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, C. orthopsilosis, and Cryptococcus pseudolongus, respectively. However, the infant's mycobiome did not show a trajectory toward maturity within first 30 days of life, and this could be in part explained by the use of a relatively consistent food source of either breast milk or infant formula. Moreover, Kasper has demonstrated that mycobiota could be transferred from mothers to their offspring. In the study, five infants shared D. hansenii and S. cerevisiae observed in their mothers. Notably, the mother-to-child bacterial transmission patterns have been well profiled at strain level, whereas limited studies on mother-to-child vertical fungal transmission were reported. Overall, these studies all demonstrated that fungi could colonize in the neonatal gut at very early stage; nevertheless, how the mycobiome is shaped and how the succession occurs in the gut of neonates remained to be elucidated in the future.

### Candida expansion in the gut of lung cancer patients associates with an ecological signature that supports growth under dysbiotic conditions [^114UC6sx]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Colonisation resistance towards pathogenic microbes is a crucial function of the gut microbiota in infectious disease. In addition to protecting the host from external pathogens, local microbiota also prevent expansion and invasion of intestinal pathobionts. Microbial resistance in gastrointestinal infections have both direct and indirect mechanisms. Infections can be, for example, limited directly via metabolic by-products (bacteriocins, acids, peptides) of the gut microbiota, or by outcompeting pathogens for space, metabolites, and nutrients. Intestinal pathogens can also be inhibited indirectly when the local microbiota calibrate host immune responses to themor induce the formation of a protective mucin layer that covers the gut epithelium. Perturbation of the resident microbiota is thus a risk for infection by a pathobiont infection that is ordinarily held at bay by these mechanisms. Candida species are gut symbionts that can become aggressive pathogens under specific circumstances. While most Candida species have been reported to cause candidemia in clinics, approximately half of Candida infections are caused by C. albicans alone. C. albicans can grow in vastly different environments in contrast to other Candida species, and its virulence is associated with a morphological switch from yeast to hyphae. In contrast, C. glabrata does not form hyphae. While blood infections with C. sake have been reported, the incidence is low and little information exists regarding its pathogenicity mechanisms. Despite Candida species being the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infectionsthe number of human studies investigating their interplay with the gut microbiota is surprisingly low compared to studies on bacterial pathogens such as Clostridium, Enterococcus, Salmonella and Enterobacteriaceae species.

### Effect of intrapartum azithromycin on early childhood gut mycobiota development: post hoc analysis of a double-blind randomized trial [^112YMRG3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Our research contributes to the critical knowledge gap regarding gut mycobiota development in West African infants while assessing the impact of intrapartum azithromycin on this development. In the child gut mycobiota, alpha diversity was mainly influenced by age, season and parity, while community composition was stable during the first 4 months of age and the profiles predominantly represented by Candida species. In addition, intrapartum azithromycin had mild effects on alpha diversity of the child gut mycobiota that lasted for at least 4 months and varied again by season and parity. The intervention, however, did not have any effect on gut mycobiota community composition except at year 3.

Gut fungal alpha diversity in the normal Gambian population, as shown in the placebo arm, remained generally stable from birth to the age of 3 years but varied by season and parity. This stability in alpha diversity aligns with previous findings from children under five in Ghana and Mali. The increase in alpha diversity during the wet season compared to the dry season likely reflects higher environmental fungal abundance due to favorable warm and humid conditions. For instance, seasonal variations in Candida abundance suggest environmental conditions influence fungal reservoirs, with warm temperatures and high humidity favoring growth in environmental sources. The unvarying effect of sex between the trial arms imply that intrapartum azithromycin shows similar potential impact on the gut mycobiota of male and female children alike. Among children in the azithromycin arm, a rapid increase in Shannon diversity in the first week of life during the dry season is in agreement with reports of increased gut fungal alpha diversity shortly after antibiotic treatment, and may be due to the low density of Candida species in the gut mycobiota during this period. This is further supported by the later impact of azithromycin in the wet season where higher initial abundance of both C. albicans and C. orthopsilosis were associated with lower Shannon diversity at day 28. Mechanisms through which antibiotics influence gut mycobiota are yet to be fully elucidated, but reports suggest possible influence through metabolic changes due to impact on the bacterial community. In a recent study, Delavy et al. showed that the impact of two types of cephalosporins on C. albicans abundance in the gut was inversely correlated with the level of ß-lactamase activity in the gut microbiota. Candida, a known early gut colonizer, is more abundant in vaginally delivered infants, suggesting the maternal vaginal mycobiota as the primary source, with environmental contributions playing a secondary role. The inverse correlation of abundance of C. orthopsilosis with maternal age suggests that babies of young mothers are likely to carry more of this fungi compared to other children, with potential further promotion by azithromycin. As high abundance of Candida in the gut is associated with gut inflammation, this suggests that the risk of Candida infections in neonates born to young mothers who receive intrapartum azithromycin needs to be further investigated.

### Mapping the human gut mycobiome in middle-aged and elderly adults: multiomics insights and implications for host metabolic health [^115eX61v]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

The influence of diet on human gut mycobiome composition, and in association with the bacterial microbiome, appears likely, extensive and complex, especially for specific food categories. Previous work has shown that long-term habitual dairy consumption is associated with a higher bacterial α-diversity. Interestingly, dairy consumption made the largest contribution to the variation of fungal community among the 16 food categories in our study. Moreover, dairy consumption was positively associated with Saccharomyces but inversely associated with Candida. Previous studies reveal anti-inflammatory effects of Saccharomyces, which were negatively associated with the Framingham 10-year risk score. However, some species of Candida can infect humans, such as Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis. We found that bacterial α-diversity was positively associated with Saccharomyces and negatively associated with Candida. Whether coherent with this or not, gut bacterial α-diversity seems to be a good indicator of a 'healthy gut'. Perhaps dairy consumption contributes to a healthier diet in terms of gut ecohealth by modulating gut microbial relationships.

We have comprehensively analysed the ecological connections between gut fungi and bacteria. There are broad associations between gut fungi and bacterial taxa, gene functions and functional products, that is, metabolites, to be found in our study. Specifically, the human gut mycobiome is closely related to various metabolic pathways and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria. Moreover, since fungal signalling may be via volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognition and diagnosis of such phenomena may be more successful with exhaled breath than with faecal tests. Saccharomyces was positively associated with decanoic acid (capric acid). This metabolite is a VOC fatty acid which can be produced by S. boulardii. It exemplifies many ecological interactions involving fungi mediated by VOCs. Decanoic acid can, in turn, modulate fatty acid biosynthesis by bacteria. Given the likely underestimation of gut microbial VOC physiology, its pursuance should be worthwhile.

### Population-level configurations of gut mycobiome across 6 ethnicities in urban and rural China [^111879vA]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Beyond bacteria, the human gastrointestinal tract is host to a vast diversity of fungi, collectively known as the gut mycobiome. Little is known of the impact of geography, ethnicity, and urbanization on the gut mycobiome at a large population level. We aim to delineate the variation of human gut mycobiome and its association with host factors, environmental factors, and diets.

Methods

Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we profiled and compared the fecal mycobiome of 942 healthy individuals across different geographic regions in China (Hong Kong and Yunnan), spanning 6 ethnicities: Han, Zang, Bai, Hani, Dai, and Miao (including both urban and rural residents of each ethnicity). In parallel to fecal sampling, we collected participant metadata (environmental exposure, bowel habits, anthropometrics, and medication), diet, and clinical blood measurement results (a total of 118 variables) and investigated their impact on the gut mycobiome variation in humans.

Results

The human gut mycobiome was highly variable across populations. Urbanization-related factors had the strongest impact on gut mycobiome variation, followed by geography, dietary habit, and ethnicity. The Hong Kong population (highly urbanized) had a significantly lower fungal richness compared with Yunnan population. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was highly enriched in urban compared with rural populations and showed significant inverse correlations with liver pathology-associated blood parameters, including aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and direct bilirubin. Candida dubliniensis, which was decreased in urban relative to rural populations, showed correlations with host metabolism-related parameters in blood, including a positive correlation with fasting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and a negative correlation with fasting glucose levels. The fungal-blood parameter correlations were highly geography- and ethnicity-specific. Food choices had differential influences on gut mycobiome and bacterial microbiome, where taxa from the same genus tended to be coregulated by food and thereby cobloom. Ethnicity-specific fungal signatures were associated with distinct habitual foods in each ethnic group.

Conclusions

Our data highlight, for the first time to our knowledge, that geography, urbanization, ethnicity, and habitual diet play an important role in shaping the gut mycobiome composition. Gut fungal configurations in combination with population characteristics (such as residing region, ethnicity, diet, lifestyle) influence host metabolism and health.

### Intestinal Candida parapsilosis isolates from Rett syndrome subjects bear potential virulent traits and capacity to persist within the host [^116eKgEn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The gut mycobiota is emerging as a key player in maintaining the overall microbial community structure of the human gut, and main actor in host physiopathology. Previous observations from our team indicated the presence of a subclinical inflammatory status, cytokine dysregulation and intestinal dysbiosis contributing to gastrointestinal symptoms in Rett syndrome. In the present manuscript, we moved our analysis to the strain level, investigating whether fungal isolates from RTT subjects may favour the sub-inflammatory status triggered by MeCP2 deficiency. Our results discovered C. parapsilosis, but not C. albicans, as the most abundant and potentially pro-inflammatory yeast species in the gut of RTT subjects. We propose that intestinal dysbiosis and the presence of pro-inflammatory C. parapsilosis strains could have a role in RTT's gastrointestinal abnormalities laying the basis for the design of novel therapeutic strategies that, by targeting specific components of the gut microbiota, would restore eubiosis and intestinal physiology in RTT.

### TLR2 modulates gut colonization and dissemination of Candida albicans in a murine model [^115VwVgz]. Microbes and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis often arises from translocation of endogenous yeasts from the gastrointestinal tract to the bloodstream. Here we describe that both wild type and TLR2-/- mice strains, orally administered with Candida albicans yeasts, display similar sustained high level of gut colonization when oral antibacterial treatment is present, while removal of antibiotic treatment causes a progressive clearance of yeasts in control but not in TLR2-/- mice. Fungal invasion of internal organs, following immunosuppression of colonized mice, was increased in TLR2-/- mice. These results point out to a role of TLR2 in gut protection against colonization and endogenous invasion by C. albicans.

### Gastrointestinal colonization resistance: a host-microbiome balancing act [^116Ps3Ch]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Animal studies have also been performed to investigate this question. Yamaguchi et al. investigated the impact of a standard commercial mouse chow or a refined diet and showed that the refined diet eliminated colonization resistance, allowing for long-term colonization of C. albicans. This appeared to be due to a decrease in anaerobes and Lactobacillus spp. through an unclear mechanism. Future studies would need to be completed to determine which component of the refined diet was leading to an alteration in the microbiota that promoted C. albicans colonization, as this may be something to avoid in those at highest risk of invasive candidiasis. This finding has been supported by another group demonstrating how different standard mouse chows can alter the microbiota, including changes in Clostridia, further suggesting how diet impacts potential colonization resistance, but C. albicans was not studied. Another group demonstrated that a diet high in coconut oil had lower gastrointestinal C. albicans colonization. It was hypothesized that this may be due to fungicidal activity from medium-chain fatty acid production from coconut oil and by reducing long-chain fatty acids in the colon that C. albicans can use as a nutrient source. Additional studies are needed to determine what, if any, direct effects coconut oil supplementation has on the microbiota, along with evaluating if coconut oil supplementation reduces C. albicans in the gastrointestinal tract enough to reduce dissemination in an immunosuppressed model. Lastly, Fajstova et al. showed that mice treated with a high sugar diet in a dextran sodium sulfate colitis model had an unexpected colonization of C. albicans. However, it is unclear how much of this is due to a high sugar diet itself or brought on by inflammation, as the dextran sodium sulfate colitis model increases oxygen availability which can allow for expansion of E. coli.

### The role of gut mycobiome in health and diseases [^114LDnsw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
The gut mycobiome through life and the influencing factors in early life. Infants receive mycobiota colonization in the gut at birth, and fungal community increased with age in infancy but decreased when they grow up to young adults. 10 days after birth, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Debaryomyces hansenii predominated in the gut of infants, while Candida parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, C. orthopsilosis, and Cryptococcus pseudolongus enriched in the anus of infants in the first month. In the adult stage, C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. deforans, and Aspergillus glaucus occupy the gut. In later years, Penicillium, Candida, Aspergillus, and Saccharomyces were dominant in the gut of elders. The major factors contributing to neonatal gut fungal communities were mode of feeding and mode of delivery. Compared with neonates by cesarean section, a higher level of Candida and Pleosporales, decreased level of Malassezia were shown in the gut of infants born via vaginal delivery. Moreover, infants could directly acquire mycobiota from breast milk feeding by their mothers, which contains abundant R. mucilaginosa and C. parapsilosis.

### Mechanisms underpinning the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in treating gastrointestinal disease [^114iMpuQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mycobiota alterations

From a fungal perspective, it has been suggested that patients with CDI who responded to FMT experienced colonisation with particular donor-derived fungal taxa (in particular, members of Saccharomyces and Aspergillus genera), whereas non-response was associated with a dominant presence of Candida within donor stool. Individuals not responding to FMT and/or patients treated for rCDI with antimicrobials alone retained overgrowth of Candida. In a mouse model of CDI, the presence of Candida albicans was associated with reduced efficacy of FMT, while use of antifungal therapy helped restore efficacy. Utilising internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing, it was demonstrated that the fungal microbiota is skewed in IBD, with an increased Basidiomycota/Ascomycota ratio, a decreased proportion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an increased proportion of C. albicans compared with healthy controls. In samples from a large randomised controlled study utilising FMT for ulcerative colitis (UC) it was found that high Candida abundance pre-FMT was associated with a clinical response, whereas decreased Candida abundance post-FMT was indicative of ameliorated disease severity. The authors suggested that high Candida abundance in the recipient might promote the engraftment of donor's bacteria by freeing ecological niches, and that FMT may reduce Candida which culminates in the success of FMT. These potential mechanisms need further exploration while acknowledging caveats associated with fungal infections in the presence of immunosuppression.

Importantly, trans-kingdom-fungi–bacteria interactions have good evidence in many ecosystems and are beginning to be further understood in the gut. While the perturbation of gut fungal profiles and their influence upon FMT outcomes are of interest, their significance as potentially contributing to the efficacy of FMT remains unclear. In view of the established relationship between antimicrobial treatment and overgrowth of Candida within the gut, any changes in gut mycobiota profiles may only possibly be proxies of gut bacterial alterations. As such, the specific contribution of bacteriophages and fungi to the efficacy of FMT remains undefined.

### Anti-fungal T cell responses in the lung and modulation by the gut-lung axis [^112hsMxP]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The lung is a central organ for immune-environmental interactions ranging from tolerance against harmless substances to protection against pathogens, which are particularly sensitive to regulation by the intestinal microbiota. Airborne fungi, can cause variety of diseases, including allergies and inflammatory disorders, as well as life-threatening invasive infections. Remarkable differences exist between ubiquitous fungal species with regard to protective immune mechanisms. Recent data have surprisingly identified Aspergillus-specific regulatory T cells as an essential tolerance checkpoint and provided mechanistic insight for the loss of tolerance in the course of immune pathologies. Furthermore, pathogenic Th17 cells in Aspergillus-associated inflammatory disease seem to be induced by cross-reactivity to the intestinal commensal Candida albicans. Here we review and discuss what is known about fungus-specific T cell responses in the lung how they are modulated by the gut-lung axis and in particular discussing the modulation of adaptive immune responses by cross-reactivity to the microbiota.

### Passage through the mammalian gut triggers a phenotypic switch that promotes Candida albicans commensalism [^115C5Kjm]. Nature Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

Among ∼5,000,000 fungal species, C. albicans is exceptional in its lifelong association with humans, either within the gastrointestinal microbiome or as an invasive pathogen. Opportunistic infections are generally ascribed to defective host immunity but may require specific microbial programs. Here we report that exposure of C. albicans to the mammalian gut triggers a developmental switch, driven by the Wor1 transcription factor, to a commensal cell type. Wor1 expression was previously observed only in rare genetic backgrounds, where it controls a white-opaque switch in mating. We show that passage of wild-type cells through the mouse gastrointestinal tract triggers WOR1 expression and a novel phenotypic switch. The resulting GUT (gastrointestinally induced transition) cells differ morphologically and functionally from previously defined cell types, including opaque cells, and express a transcriptome that is optimized for the digestive tract. The white-GUT switch illuminates how a microorganism can use distinct genetic programs to transition between commensalism and invasive pathogenesis.

### Candida albicans natural diversity: a resource to dissect fungal commensalism and pathogenesis [^116UADkR]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Candida albicans is a ubiquitous fungus of humans. It is not only a component of the oral and intestinal microbiota of most healthy adults but also a major cause of mucosal disorders and life-threatening disseminated infections. Until recently, research on the biology and pathogenesis of the fungus was largely based on a single clinical isolate. We review investigations that have started to dissect a diverse set of C. albicans strains. Using different approaches to leverage the species' phenotypic and/or genetic diversity, these studies illuminate the wide range of interactions between fungus and host. While connecting genetic variants to phenotypes of interest remains challenging, research on C. albicans' natural diversity is central to understand fungal commensalism and pathogenesis.

### Temporal changes in gastrointestinal fungi and the risk of autoimmunity during early childhood: the TEDDY study [^114NpxT4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fungal infections are a major health problem that often begin in the gastrointestinal tract. Gut microbe interactions in early childhood are critical for proper immune responses, yet there is little known about the development of the fungal population from infancy into childhood. Here, as part of the TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) study, we examine stool samples of 888 children from 3 to 48 months and find considerable differences between fungi and bacteria. The metagenomic relative abundance of fungi was extremely low but increased while weaning from milk and formula. Overall fungal diversity remained constant over time, in contrast with the increase in bacterial diversity. Fungal profiles had high temporal variation, but there was less variation from month-to-month in an individual than among different children of the same age. Fungal composition varied with geography, diet, and the use of probiotics. Multiple Candida spp. were at higher relative abundance in children than adults, while Malassezia and certain food-associated fungi were lower in children. There were only subtle fungal differences associated with the subset of children that developed islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes. Having proper fungal exposures may be crucial for children to establish appropriate responses to fungi and limit the risk of infection: the data here suggests those gastrointestinal exposures are limited and variable.

### Immune regulation by fungal strain diversity in inflammatory bowel disease [^111TuFUa]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The fungal microbiota (mycobiota) is an integral part of the complex multikingdom microbial community colonizing the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and has an important role in immune regulation 1–6. Although aberrant changes in the mycobiota have been linked to several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease 3–9, it is currently unknown whether fungal species captured by deep sequencing represent living organisms and whether specific fungi have functional consequences for disease development in affected individuals. Here we developed a translational platform for the functional analysis of the mycobiome at the fungal-strain- and patient-specific level. Combining high-resolution mycobiota sequencing, fungal culturomics and genomics, a CRISPR-Cas9-based fungal strain editing system, in vitro functional immunoreactivity assays and in vivo models, this platform enables the examination of host-fungal crosstalk in the human gut. We discovered a rich genetic diversity of opportunistic Candida albicans strains that dominate the colonic mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Among these human-gut-derived isolates, strains with high immune-cell-damaging capacity (HD strains) reflect the disease features of individual patients with ulcerative colitis and aggravated intestinal inflammation in vivo through IL-1β-dependent mechanisms. Niche-specific inflammatory immunity and interleukin-17A-producing T helper cell (T H 17 cell) antifungal responses by HD strains in the gut were dependent on the C. albicans-secreted peptide toxin candidalysin during the transition from a benign commensal to a pathobiont state. These findings reveal the strain-specific nature of host-fungal interactions in the human gut and highlight new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for diseases of inflammatory origin.

### Candida expansion in the gut of lung cancer patients associates with an ecological signature that supports growth under dysbiotic conditions [^112Xz4jD]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Recently, an analysis of a small cohort of allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation patients that included 8 candidiasis patients and 7 controls indicated that an expansion of Candida species in the gut occurs before bloodstream infection. However, gut mycobiome analyses of both healthy individualsand individuals with a variety of diseases, revealed that Candida species can also be the dominant fungi of the mycobiome without the host showing any signs of systemic infection. Therefore, progression from overgrowth to systemic infection may require additional, independent processes. Elucidating the role of Candida species as commensals and revealing the intestinal ecological context that leads to their expansion in the human gut is critical to designing prophylactic strategies for life-threatening systemic candidiasis. Therefore, we performed an integrative analysis of the mycobiome, bacteriome, and virome of 75 lung cancer patients to determine an intestinal ecological signature associated with Candida species overgrowth (Fig. 1a), which we confirmed in an independent cohort of 11 cancer patients. We further provided experimental evidence for a competitive advantage of Candida over Saccharomyces species, the other main fungal residents in the human gut, while exploring alternative carbon sources under dysbiotic conditions characterised by increased oxygen availability.

### Candida albicans cell-type switching and functional plasticity in the mammalian host [^116dAGDW]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Candida albicans is a ubiquitous commensal of the mammalian microbiome and the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans. A cell-type transition between yeast and hyphal morphologies in C. albicans was thought to underlie much of the variation in virulence observed in different host tissues. However, novel yeast-like cell morphotypes, including opaque(a/α), grey and gastrointestinally induced transition (GUT) cell types, were recently reported that exhibit marked differences in vitro and in animal models of commensalism and disease. In this Review, we explore the characteristics of the classic cell types - yeast, hyphae, pseudohyphae and chlamydospores - as well as the newly identified yeast-like morphotypes. We highlight emerging knowledge about the associations of these different morphotypes with different host niches and virulence potential, as well as the environmental cues and signalling pathways that are involved in the morphological transitions.

### Fungal dysbiosis: immunity and interactions at mucosal barriers [^111bbb78]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fungi and mammals share a co-evolutionary history and are involved in a complex web of interactions. Studies focused on commensal bacteria suggest that pathological changes in the microbiota, historically known as dysbiosis, are at the root of many inflammatory diseases of non-infectious origin. However, the importance of dysbiosis in the fungal community - the mycobiota - was only recently acknowledged to have a pathological role, as novel findings have suggested that mycobiota disruption can have detrimental effects on host immunity. Fungal dysbiosis and homeostasis are dynamic processes that are probably more common than actual fungal infections, and therefore constantly shape the immune response. In this Review, we summarize specific mycobiota patterns that are associated with fungal dysbiosis, and discuss how mucosal immunity has evolved to distinguish fungal infections from dysbiosis and how it responds to these different conditions. We propose that gut microbiota dysbiosis is a collective feature of complex interactions between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities that can affect immunity and that can influence health and disease.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1177F7az]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is an important health-care-associated fungal infection that can be caused by several Candida spp.; the most common species is Candida albicans, but the prevalence of these organisms varies considerably depending on geographical location. The spectrum of disease of invasive candidiasis ranges from minimally symptomatic candidaemia to fulminant sepsis with an associated mortality exceeding 70%. Candida spp. are common commensal organisms in the skin and gut microbiota, and disruptions in the cutaneous and gastrointestinal barriers (for example, owing to gastrointestinal perforation) promote invasive disease. A deeper understanding of specific Candida spp. virulence factors, host immune response and host susceptibility at the genetic level has led to key insights into the development of early intervention strategies and vaccine candidates. The early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is challenging but key to the effective management, and the development of rapid molecular diagnostics could improve the ability to intervene rapidly and potentially reduce mortality. First-line drugs, including echinocandins and azoles, are effective, but the emergence of antifungal resistance, especially among Candida glabrata, is a matter of concern and underscores the need to administer antifungal medications in a judicious manner, avoiding overuse when possible. A newly described pathogen, Candida auris, is an emerging multidrug-resistant organism that poses a global threat.

### Systems biology of host-Candida interactions: understanding how we shape each other [^115hxdtF]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Candida albicans is both a member of the human mucosal microbiota and a common agent of invasive fungal disease. Systems biology approaches allow for analysis of the interactions between this fungus and its mammalian host. Framing these studies by considering how C. albicans and its host construct the niche the other occupies provides insight into how these interactions shape the ecosystems, behavior, and evolution of each organism. Here, we discuss recent work on multiscale systems biology approaches for examining C. albicans in relation to the host ecosystem to identify the emergent properties of the interactions and new variables that can be targeted for development of therapeutic strategies.

### The role of gastrointestinal pathogens in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review [^116JNk8F]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fungi

Technologic advancements have enabled deeper characterization of previously overlooked members of the gut microbiome that might also play a critical role in IBD pathogenesis and its disease course. Fungi fall into this category, but the same issues of causality and innocent bystander remain. Recent studies using advanced sequencing approaches demonstrate that fungal diversity is altered in ileal and colonic biopsies from patients with CD compared with healthy controls. Specifically, multiple studies have demonstrated varying proportions of gastrointestinal pathogenic Candida species, Malassezia species, Aspergillus species, and Cryptococcus neoformans. – While studies on UC have been somewhat inconsistent, altered fungal diversity has still been reported. While the complex interplay and directionality between the gut mycobiome, fungal pathogens, and mucosal inflammation remain poorly understood, these findings do suggest specific fungi might be relevant in disease pathogenesis. Further studies are required, including studies of genetic and other susceptibility determinants.

### Infant fungal communities: current knowledge and research opportunities [^111eyduT]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gestational age at delivery

Gestational age at delivery has been shown to impact the bacterial microbiota, including initial community differences and the pace of bacterial community maturation, but differences are often resolved by 2 years of age, when the bacterial community has reached an adult-like state. For infants born at an early gestational age, the health impact of intestinal fungi is particularly significant, as the incidence of invasive, systemic candidiasis in these infants is approximately 10%, with an associated mortality rate of approximately 20%. Susceptibility to invasive infection has been correlated with relative overgrowth of fungi, especially within the GI tract, as well as the presence of several predisposing clinical factors including a naïve immune system, bacterial dysbiosis due to antibiotic exposure, and use of parenteral nutrition, among other factors (Fig. 2). In an attempt to reduce rates of invasive candidiasis in this vulnerable population, prophylactic antifungals, such as nystatin and fluconazole, are often used in neonatal intensive care units. In particular, fluconazole has been shown to reduce Candida overgrowth at several body sites, including skin, the respiratory tract, and the GI tract, and its use has been associated with a decreased rate of invasive candidiasis in extremely low birth weight infants. Recently, the enteral administration of bacterial and fungal probiotics, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bidiobacterium longum, B. bifidum, B. lactis, and S. boulardii, have also been used to reduce invasive candidiasis; however, their efficacy remains unclear and their primary site of action is limited to the GI tract. Despite the administration of antifungals, fungal colonization still occurs in some infants, as demonstrated in a study of 11 extremely low birth weight infants, all of whom received an enteral anti-fungal treatment, nystatin, as well as antibacterial antibiotics. Of these 11 infants, 7 produced ITS amplicons from their stool, with Saccharomycetales being the most abundant order, as well as Candida and Cryptococcus species. Thus, despite efforts to prevent fungal colonization, fungi maintain the ability to persist in the infant GI tract. In infants born at early gestational ages, beneficial fungi, such as S. boulardii, may help to regulate the growth of opportunistic fungal colonizers such as Candida. Additionally, given the association of bacterial dysbiosis with systemic candidiasis in infants born at an early gestational age, a robust bacterial community may play an important role in mycobiota regulation, as discussed below.

### Candida albicans exploits N-acetylglucosamine as a gut signal to establish the balance between commensalism and pathogenesis [^116ADiE4]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Candida albicans is a benign member of gut microbiota, but also causes life-threatening disseminated infections, suggesting that this fungus commensalism has evolved with retention of virulence traits. Here we reveal that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) enables C. albicans to balance between commensalism and pathogenesis. Although GlcNAc catabolism is beneficial for commensal growth of C. albicans, deleting GlcNAc sensor-transducer Ngs1 confers enhanced fitness, indicating that GlcNAc signaling is detrimental to commensalism. Interestingly, addition of GlcNAc attenuates commensal fitness of gut-evolved C. albicans but retains its disease-causing potential. We further demonstrate that GlcNAc is a major inducer of hypha-associated transcription in the gut, which represents the key determinant for commensal-pathogenic equilibrium. In addition to yeast-to-hypha morphogenesis, we also identify other factors, including Sod5 and Ofi1, that contribute to the balance. Thus, C. albicans uses GlcNAc to build up a tradeoff between fungal programs supporting commensalism and virulence, which may explain its success as a commensal and pathogen.

### The gut microbiome: an under-recognised contributor to the COVID-19 pandemic? [^111om7zM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A further study from the same group explored the alterations in the faecal fungal microbiome in patients with COVID-19. In this study, deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis was performed on faecal samples from 30 patients with COVID-19 and compared with 9 subjects with community acquired bacterial pneumonia and 30 HC. The same definitions were used as in the previous study. It was noted that patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their faecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candida albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Furthermore, researchers found that samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris and Aspergillus flavus, compared with controls. Importantly, there are likely confounders to this study, with the authors correctly identifying that determining whether these changes are a cause or an effect of COVID-19 needs to be explored further.

As such, overall, while data profiling the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection to date are limited, they support the possibility of several routes of potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2, the gut microbiome, intestinal ACE-2 expression, and gut inflammation.

Importantly, some of these associations have also been noted in critical illness and, hence, further studies are needed to explore changes in the gut microbiome and compare this with those with COVID-19.

### Minority report: the intestinal mycobiota in systemic infections [^114SkRHu]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Compared to bacteria, fungi often exhibit a lower abundance and a higher temporal volatility in the intestinal microbiota. Analysis of fungi in the microbiota (mycobiota) faces technical limitations with tools that were originally developed for analyzing bacteria. Dysbiotic states of the intestinal mycobiota, often associated with disruption of the healthy bacterial microbiota, are characterized by overgrowth (domination) of specific fungal taxa and loss of diversity. Intestinal domination by Candida species has been shown to be a major source of Candida bloodstream infections. Fungal dysbiosis is also linked to the development and treatment response in non-fungal infections, for example Clostridioides difficile colitis and HIV. Further research is needed to define the contribution of intestinal mycobiota to human fungal and non-fungal infections.

### Mapping the human gut mycobiome in middle-aged and elderly adults: multiomics insights and implications for host metabolic health [^117DgMti]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Long-term stability of the gut mycobiome was determined in follow-up after ~3.2 years in 184 participants (online supplemental table S6) with ITS2 fungal data that showed non-significant alterations over time in 11 genera of the Ascomycota (eg, Pichia, Alternaria and Wickerhamiella) (figure 1D and online supplemental table S7), which indicates that the relative abundances of these genera were temporally stable. Saccharomyces, Candida and Aspergillus were abundant at baseline and remained the most prevalent taxa at the follow-up visit (online supplemental figure S3A, B). There were seven core fungal genera repeatedly detected in the same individual at both time points in over 40% of the participants (online supplemental figure S3C). For the dominant fungal phyla, this probability was over 85%. However, eight genera had a significant increased change in relative abundance, Penicillium and Candida being examples, while 5 out of 26 genera showed a decreased abundance (paired Wilcoxon test, q < 0.05) (online supplemental table S7). These changes may be partly attributable or contribute to increasing age, as in a metagenomic study with age-associated alterations in the gut mycobiome, particularly Aspergillus and Penicillium.

Compared with gut bacteria, the gut mycobiome has sparser characteristics. Gut bacterial composition was profiled using the 16S rRNA sequencing for 1244 participants. The gut bacteria had a larger α-diversity than gut fungi (online supplemental figure S4A), which was similar to other microbiomic reports in healthy individuals. However, gut mycobiome composition varied greatly between individuals (online supplemental figure S4B), suggesting that gut fungi may be more personalised.

### Candida albicans exploits N-acetylglucosamine as a gut signal to establish the balance between commensalism and pathogenesis [^1158DQA7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The yeast Candida albicans is a component of the human orogastrointestinal and genital microbiota where it can exist in a commensal state without causing pathological infection. The fungus lives and coevolves in these complex environments of the human body. Nonetheless, it is the most common fungal pathogen of humans, responsible for diseases ranging from superficial infections of the skin and mucous membranes to highly morbid, invasive infections of internal organs –, which suggests that C. albicans commensalism has evolved with retention of fungal virulence traits. Among these, the transition from yeast to hyphal cell morphology is central to C. albicans ' pathogenic potential, as strains defective in hyphal formation are attenuated in causing invasive infections in mice –. In contrast to its crucial role in pathogenicity, the hypha-associated transcription was recently shown to inhibit commensal fitness. In this situation, fungal programs supporting commensalism and virulence seem to antagonize each other. While most studies focused on the identification of fungal factors involved in commensalism and pathogenicity, little is known about the host factor(s) that determine this antagonistic relationship.

N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is a major structural component on the cell surface of a wide range of cells. It is a component of the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls and the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans of animal cells. Because mammals digest and absorb dietary starch and oligosaccharides in the proximal small bowel, glucose is relatively depleted more distally, while gut bacteria can release GlcNAc during cell wall recycling. GlcNAc is proposed to be a major carbon source to support the growth of C. albicans in humans. In addition to supporting growth as an energy source, GlcNAc is a powerful inducer of morphological transitions, including hyphal development and phenotypic switching, which is linked to its virulence, infection of distinct host niches and immune evasion. The GlcNAc-sensor and transducer Ngs1 is the master regulator of GlcNAc signaling. It controls GlcNAc-induced expression of genes for GlcNAc catabolism, uptake, scavenging and pathogenesis. As the focus of recent research has been on understanding how GlcNAc promotes C. albicans pathogenicity, we know little about the exact role of this sugar on the regulation of commensalism within the healthy human host.

### Critical illness and sex hormones: response and impact of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis [^112abXXj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Sex hormones and gut microbiota interactions

Sepsis, as a critical condition, triggers significant shifts in both the gut microbiota and sex hormone levels. During sepsis, the intestinal microbiota undergoes a collapse, transitioning from commensal to pathogenic species. This dysbiosis is marked by reduced diversity and structural alterations, with a notable increase in Candida and a decrease in beneficial fungal groups. These microbiota changes are associated with worsened outcomes. Notably, the interactions between sex hormones and gut microbiota could play a critical role in the pathophysiology of sepsis.

The impact of sex hormones on gastrointestinal microbiota is worth paying attention to. First, estradiol demonstrates complex, contrasting effects on inflammation. On the one hand, β-estradiol conducts the generation of IL-12 and IFN-γ in dendritic cells, activating pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways in the process. It also prolongs B-cell survival and stimulates polyclonal B cells, increasing intestinal permeability and facilitating gut microbiota migration to the lamina propria, thereby intensifying inflammatory processes. On the other hand, estrogen, or compounds with similarities, can instigate an upsurge in targeted intestinal alkaline phosphatase levels, causing a reduction in LPS production and decreased intestinal permeability, thereby reducing metabolic endotoxemia and systemic chronic inflammation. These opposing effects highlight the dual role of estradiol in modulating inflammatory responses. Moreover, studies suggest that supplementing small quantities of estrogen and progesterone to the brain can ameliorate menopause symptoms by reducing serum FSH levels and maintaining diversity within gut microbial communities in rats. Second, the influence of androgens on gut microbiota is just as significant as that of estrogen. The gut microbiota in juvenile mice is generally indistinguishable between sexes. However, in adult females, the gut microbiota mirrors that of their juvenile counterparts. This suggests a significant influence of androgens on gut microbiota composition, hinting that changes in androgen levels could trigger subsequent shifts in gut microbiota. For instance, male mice display increased susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1DM). To counter this, modifications in the gut microbiota of mature male mice enhance their resistance against T1DM. In addition, the correlation between variations in androgens and conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome further underscores the significance of the interplay between sex hormones and gut microbiota.

### The role of bacterial translocation in sepsis: a new target for therapy [^111wmhqt]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

External factors impacting the gut microbiome

i. Various environmental insults alter the gut microbiome. Age, ethnicity, the immune system, and diet also regulate the intestinal microbiota. Mortality due to sepsis is linked to weak immune defense systems and an artificial environment associated with mechanical ventilation and the use of tubes, drains, intravascular lines, artificial nutrition, and extensive synthetic chemical drugs. These factors can reduce or eliminate the gut microbiota, impair immune function, increase systemic inflammation, and contribute to poor outcomes.
ii. The 'gut-origin sepsis' hypothesis evolves from the notion that under stress, such as sepsis, trauma, burn, or shock, infectious complications originate from the gut microbiota. Following surgical trauma, dysregulated metabolic reactions and infections can occur, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, and muscle protein breakdown, and these changes can become self-destructive, leading to further metabolic damage. In survivors of significant burns, the number of beneficial bacteria, such as obligate anaerobes and Bifidobacterium, initially decreased but increased as their condition improved. In contrast, in non-survivors, these bacteria decreased as gut failure and sepsis progressed. Several pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fungi, such as Candida, increased only in non-survivors, whereas short-chain fatty acids, such as propionic and butyric acids, decreased. Intestinal surgery in children disrupts the normal intestinal microbiota and barrier function, predisposing them to SIRS.
iii. Dietary patterns, including diets containing high fructose and high fat, and nutritional deficiencies affect intestinal permeability. A western-style diet contributes to endotoxemia by causing changes in the intestinal barrier and altering the composition of the microbiota. Approximately, 75% of the food consumed in Western diets does not benefit the microbiota of the lower gut. Much of the Western diet include refined carbohydrates, which are absorbed in the upper part of the GI tract. Food that reaches the large intestine is of limited value and contains fewer minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients essential for maintaining the microbiota. Such a diet can lead to a microbiome of reduced size and diversit.

### Mapping the human gut mycobiome in middle-aged and elderly adults: multiomics insights and implications for host metabolic health [^112CoThh]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This work depicts the gut mycobiome in a broad microbiomic context, for an ethnogeographically defined cohort defined by age, long-term habitual diet and physiological status. Ascomycetes were the dominant group of gut fungi and temporally stable even after 3.2 years. Interactions were identified between the gut mycobiota and bacterial α-diversity in relation to metabolic health, which could be replicated in an independent cohort. Of indicative and metabolic interest, Pichia may influence LDL cholesterol through specific bacterial functions.

Previous research has shown that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are two dominant phyla in the GI tract, which is consistent with our findings. The present study identified 26 core fungal taxa, 8 of which have been listed as the most commonly detected fungi in gut mycobiomic studies, including Candida, Saccharomyces, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Malassezia, Cladosporium, Debaryomyces and Trichosporon. Notably, we found through literature review that these gut fungal genera have various environmental counterparts which indicate the potential origins or sources of the fungi and reflect that human health may be inherently affected by the environments that we traverse. Many fungal taxa displayed long-term stability even after 3.2 years in 184 participants, indicative of a core mycobiome, within its total. A fundamental question is which fungi are truly colonising the human gut? In 2018, a study in 100 healthy individuals argued that fungi do not routinely colonised the GI tracts of healthy adults. However, core fungal taxa were identified in the present study and could be observed at both time points in the discovery and replication cohort over 3 years apart. We also found some fungi were temporally stable in the same individual. It seems that the gut mycobiome may play a role in the long-term stability of the gut ecosystem. To our knowledge, the present study is the first investigation into the difference in gut mycobiome between the elderly and younger individuals. We not only found that Blastobotrys was decreased from baseline to follow-up longitudinally, but also revealed that this genus had a depletion in the elderly compared with the middle-aged individuals cross-sectionally. Blastobotrys adeninivorans can assimilate a wide spectrum of carbon and nitrogen sources, which makes it a dominant yeast in the fermentation of Pu-erh tea. Further studies are needed for a more comprehensive profiling of mycobial alterations through the full human life cycle.

### Gut mycobiome dysbiosis after sepsis and trauma [^1167PsYS]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our findings for the first time unveil the persistence and signatures of the gut mycobiome dysbiosis shifting toward an infection-susceptible pathobiome state two weeks after sepsis or trauma. Like any study of this nature, our study has limitations. We were able to collect samples at a single timepoint, because of which we could not investigate the trajectory of major fungal taxa over time and the duration of hospitalization. Although there were no differences among groups in terms of ethnicity, most of the participants were Caucasian. Additionally, we failed to control for other factors that might possibly affect the mycobiome, including the type of enteral nutrition and anesthesia. Nevertheless, the study was adequately powered for each group, revealing the persistence of mycobiome dysbiosis in both sepsis and trauma settings, even up to two weeks post-sepsis and trauma. The tenacity of these perturbations in patients with delayed or complicated clinical trajectories strongly suggests that targeting this dysbiosis could be a viable focus for therapeutic regimens aimed at reducing the risk of subsequent fungal infections. Such regimens might employ anti- Candida microbiome rehabilitation strategies such as S. cerevisiae administration or pro/pre/postbiotic pharmacological activation of the innate immune defense system against colonization by opportunistic pathogenic fungi. The findings call for and should facilitate future studies to explore novel approaches to minimize the incidence of fungal infection and develop therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing dysbiosis and restoring gut micro-ecological homeostasis for improved health outcomes and quality-of-life following recovery from hospitalization and critical illness.

### Microbial dysregulation of the gut-lung axis in bronchiectasis [^113Q9Qiu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The gut microbiome is thought to influence respiratory disease through a gut-lung axis; however, this lacks study in bronchiectasis. Our present work begins to address this important knowledge gap by prospectively evaluating patients with bronchiectasis undergoing concurrent gut and lung sampling during disease stability. This approach controls for temporal variation and allows for integrative analysis between organs. Here, we report greater bacterial diversity in the gut compared with lung, in line with prior literature and likely because of the existence of airway disease in these patients. Minimal difference in fungal diversity between compartments is observed. The overall low percentage of bacterial versus fungal overlap between the gut and lung does suggest that direct microbial interaction between sites is less likely and that indirect means of interaction, including the secretion of microbial metabolites (e.g. short chain fatty acids) and/or modulation of host immunity — neither assessed in this study — are viable. It is important that, in this work, we illustrate the potential clinical utility of concurrently profiling gut and lung microbiomes in bronchiectasis, including the importance of integrated analytics. The integration of bacteriomes and mycobiomes (i.e. multibiomes), using methods capable of capturing complex interactions from two distinct anatomical sites, revealed patient stratification into high and low gut-lung interaction groups underpinned by clear differences in their gut-lung interactions. Evaluation of gut and lung multibiomes as separate organ systems notably precludes such strong clinical stratification and demonstrates the importance of the gut-lung axis. Of note, however, some clinical association is evident when only gut multibiomes are considered, underscoring an important and previously unrecognized role for gut microbiota in stratifying bronchiectasis. The high gut-lung interaction bronchiectasis patient cluster was characterized by lung Pseudomonas, gut Bacteroides, and gut Saccharomyces and was associated with increased exacerbations and with greater radiological and overall bronchiectasis severity, whereas the low gut-lung interaction cluster demonstrates an overrepresentation of lung commensals, including Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas, with gut Candida. This latter group adds further to the increasing body of microbiome literature, indicating that the predominance of upper airway commensals is associated with more favorable clinical outcomes in respiratory disease. Microbial commensals are established determinants of the host-immune relationship, demonstrating effector functions reaching far beyond their local environments. Although the assessment of conventional microbiome-related metrics such as relative abundance (i.e. microbial identity) and diversity indices did show some variation between patient clusters in our study, our integrated gut-lung interactomes reveal additional insight into microbial interrelationships, a key feature of our novel approach that remains unappreciated if assessing microbial identity alone.

### Therapeutic potential of the gut microbiota in the management of sepsis [^11729ZX7]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Modulation of the Microbiota as Potential Therapeutic Immunonutrition

Probiotics are considered as living microorganisms, which, in adequate amounts, can induce health benefits to the human host. Among them, the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the most widely used. Probiotics have been increasingly applied and studied in different clinical applications. Probiotics have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of disease through competition for binding locus and nutrients with pathogens, producing bacteriocins to kill pathogens, synthesizing IgA to support immune responses and reducing inflammation. Prebiotics are defined as a non-digestible food ingredient that beneficially impacts the host by stimulating the growth and/or activity of a limited number of bacterial species in the gut. Synbiotics are composed of probiotics and prebiotics.

In the context of sepsis models and ICU patients, probiotics have been studied and evaluated in terms of sepsis evolution and subsequent outcome. A study by Chen and coauthors reported that prophylactic administration of a probiotic bacterial species in a septic mouse model effectively reduced mortality. More recently, a study conducted on a model of septic mice specifically demonstrated that after the onset of sepsis, there was an appearance of opportunistic gut pathogens such as Staphylococcaceae and Enterococcaceae and a disappearance of beneficial Prevotellaceae. Relative abundance of potentially pathogenic commensals was associated with more severe immune responses during sepsis, demonstrated by higher peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, gut epithelial cell apoptosis, and disruption of tight junctions. Interestingly, in animals pre-treated with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, opportunistic pathogens decreased or even disappeared, while beneficial bacteria, such as Verrucomicrobiaceae, increased, promoting inhibition of gut epithelial cell apoptosis and tight junction formation. Moreover, in a novel in vitro gut model to study Candida pathogenicity, the introduction of a microbiota of antagonistic lactobacilli emerged as a significant factor for protection against C. albicans -induced necrotic damage, with a time-, dose-, and species-dependent protective effect of probiotics against C. albicans -induced cytotoxicity.

### Candida albicans exploits N-acetylglucosamine as a gut signal to establish the balance between commensalism and pathogenesis [^111M8FGP]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

As a natural inhabitant of the human GI tract, C. albicans lives and coevolves in this complex niche. Why GlcNAc stands out from numerous known factors that trigger yeast-to-hypha morphogenesis in the gut? This could be attributed to its exceptional ability to induce hyphal formation under conditions without inoculation. While many environmental cues favor hyphal growth when saturated cells are diluted into fresh medium at 37 °C, only GlcNAc, serum and neutral pH were identified to date to trigger hyphal development in log phase cells. Given that serum is usually absent from mammalian GI tract where pH is fluctuated, GlcNAc, an abundant sugar in this niche, should be a suitable gut signaling molecule to control hypha-associated program in C. albicans during colonization. In addition to morphological program, other factors regulated by Ngs1, such as Ofi1, might also contribute to attenuated fitness induced by GlcNAc. It was recently reported that C. albicans specifically modulates human Th17 responses, leading to heterologous immunity and protecting against other invading pathogens –. Commensal Th17 immunity primed by C. albicans is regulated via oscillating UME6 expressionand relies on the peptide toxin Candidalysin. Given the fact that GlcNAc is a major inducer of hypha-associated transcription in the gut, we suggest that GlcNAc may represent a major evolutionary driving force for C. albicans to trigger systemic Th17 responses. Another more recent study revealed that a subset of immune cells detects C. albicans in the GI tract and leads to production of antifungal immunoglobulin G (IgG). GlcNAc-mediated expression of virulence traits may also contribute to this process. It will be interesting to test directly whether GlcNAc is important for this pathobiont to build up immunity against other pathogens.

### Candida albicans exploits N-acetylglucosamine as a gut signal to establish the balance between commensalism and pathogenesis [^115YqxtR]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

C. albicans is the most prominent fungus residing in the human gut, but also remains a deadly pathogen and a leading cause of bloodstream infections worldwide. In order to develop successful approaches against candidiasis, it is necessary to understand how the balance between commensalism and virulence is established in the context of the complex host environment. In this study, we demonstrate that GlcNAc, an abundant carbon source in the GI tract, enables C. albicans to balance between commensalism and virulence (Fig. 5f). It represents a major inducer for the expression of hypha-associated genes, as well as other transcription programs in the mammalian gut (Fig. 5f), which allows C. albicans commensalism evolved with retention of virulence traits. Our work provides new insights into how a host-associated factor regulates the lifestyle of a commensal-pathogenic fungus.

GlcNAc is thought to be the primary carbon source of C. albicans, as it is used by the fungus as a signal for nutrient availability. The ability to utilize GlcNAc as energy source is important for some bacteria to persist in mammalian gut. We demonstrate that this is also the case for C. albicans. Ngs1 is the master regulator of GlcNAc signaling. To our surprise, deleting NGS1, confers a fitness advantage over wild-type strain (Fig. 1f), although the ngs1 mutant is unable to catabolize GlcNAc, indicating that GlcNAc signaling exerts inhibitory effect on commensalism, which is dominant over its beneficial influence as a carbon source to support commensal growth. As such, Ngs1 functions as an inhibitor of commensalism, although it is essential for GlcNAc catabolism. Through serial passage in the GI tract of antibiotic-treated mice, C. albicans adapted to be hyper-fit as a gut commensal but decreased fitness upon blood-borne infection. These gut-evolved variants display defects in hyphae formation. Using a similar experimental evolution approach, we showed that addition of GlcNAc in the gut could reshape this evolution process, in which the fitness advantage of gut-evolved strains was attenuated, but the virulence traits, such as the ability to form hyphae, were retained by blocking mutations in FLO8 (Figs. 2 and 3d). This indicates that although GlcNAc is disadvantageous for commensalism, it represents an evolutionary pressure to maintain key pathogenic attributes of C. albicans such that this commensal can cause diseases if host or environmental factors are permissive.

### Systemic antibody responses to gut commensal bacteria during chronic HIV-1 infection [^11471CJc]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Human systemic antibody responses to commensal microbiota are not well characterised during health and disease. Of particular interest is the analysis of their potential modulation caused by chronic HIV-1 infection which is associated with sustained enteropathy and systemic B cell disturbances reflected by impaired B cell responses and chronic B cell hyperactivity. The mechanisms underlying B cell hyperactivation and the specificities of the resulting hypergammaglobulinaemia are only poorly understood.

Methods

By a technique referred to as live bacterial FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), the present study investigated systemic antibody responses to several gut and skin commensal bacteria as well as Candida albicans in longitudinal plasma and serum samples from healthy donors, chronic HIV-1-infected individuals with or without diarrhoea and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Results

The data show that systemic antibody responses to the commensal microbiota were abundantly present in humans and remained remarkably stable over years. Overall systemic antibody responses to gut commensal bacteria were not affected during chronic HIV-1 infection, with titres decreasing when normalised to elevated plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels found in patients with HIV. In contrast, increases in the titres of high affinity antimicrobiota antibodies were detected in patients with IBD, demonstrating that conditions with known increased intestinal permeability and aberrant mutualism can induce changes in antibody titres observed in these assays.

Conclusion

Neither HIV-associated enteropathy nor B cell dysfunction impact on the high-affinity systemic antibody responses to gut commensal bacteria. HIV-associated hypergammaglobulinaemia is therefore unlikely to be driven by induction of antimicrobiota antibodies.

### The role of the gut microbiota in the onset and progression of heart failure: insights into epigenetic mechanisms and aging [^116ZrVXe]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Gut microbiota and heart failure: a bidirectional relationship

Several studies have reported differences in the composition and function of GM between HF patients and healthy subjects. A recent study based on culture-dependent methods found that adult patients with chronic HF had intestinal overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (such as Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Candida) and increased intestinal permeability respect to healthy adults. Additionally, the development rate of Candida, Campylobacter, and Shigella species correlated with HF severity. Similarly, other studies observed significant differences in the composition of fecal microbes between severe chronic HF adult patients and healthy controls: the significantly reduced α-diversity, a major indicator to describe the diversity of the GM, observed in HF patients suggested a notable loss of gut flora biodiversity associated with the disease. More specifically, this disruption in microbial diversity was characterized by a marked Gut pathogen overgrowth such as those from the Proteobacteria phylum, and a concurrent decline in "beneficial" gut microbes such as Bifidobacterium or those from the Firmicutes phylum (including Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, and Dorea), all of which have anti-inflammatory effects. Table 1 summarizes studies on GM in patients with HF.

Table 1
Key studies highlighting changes in GM composition in HF patients

Supporting the involvement of the GM in the pathophysiology of HF, several studies in animal models reported the positive impact of probiotics and prebiotics administration and of targeted microbiome manipulation on cardiac remodeling by potentially affecting inflammatory pathways and metabolic processes linked to cardiovascular health. Lam et al. first provided evidence that probiotics supplementation may offer cardioprotective benefits in animal models: they reported a reduction in infarct size and improved left ventricular function in ischemic rats treated with the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 24 h before coronary artery ligation. Accordingly, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 or Lactobacillus johnsonii treatment of rats subjected to coronary artery occlusion significantly attenuated left ventricular hypertrophy and improved hemodynamic parameters. Also, Lactobacillus vaginalis improved cardiac function and decreased cardiac infarct size in mice.

Prophylactic administration of Lactobacillus reuteri, its metabolite GABA, Bifidobacterium infantis, or its metabolite inosine mitigated macrophage‐mediated cardiac inflammation, thereby alleviating cardiac dysfunction and heart injury in animals subjected to acute ischemic cardiac injury. Additionally, long-term kefir treatment was shown to reduce blood pressure through reduction of cardiac hypertrophy, improvement of cardiac contractility and calcium-handling proteins, and a decrease in central nervous system regulation of sympathetic activity.

### Candidalysin: discovery and function in Candida albicans infections [^11288Jzp]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Another conceptual aspect is whether candidalysin also acts as a commensal factor. C. albicans is adapted to life in the host, which is typified by asymptomatic commensal carriage. Indeed, gene expression analysis directly from patient samples indicated that both yeast and hyphal morphologies are present during asymptomatic colonisation of human mucosal surfaces. Intriguingly, in a murine gastrointestinal colonisation model, competitive infection experiments revealed that commensal fitness may inversely correlate with the gene network associated with morphogenesis. This apparent antagonism between commensalism and hyphal growth is supported by the observation that serial passage of C. albicans through the murine gastrointestinal tract resulted in the loss of hypha-forming ability in the absence of a competitive microbiota. Furthermore, gut-evolved C. albicans strains that lost the ability to form hyphae exhibited reduced virulence in vitro and in vivo. Given this, it may be unsurprising that commensal fitness inversely correlates with morphogenesis, since hypha formation will lead to candidalysin secretion, damage and immune activation, which will ultimately lead to fungal clearance or immunopathology. Therefore, it may not be in the fungus' interests to secrete high levels of candidalysin when colonising host surfaces. This is supported by data showing that a threshold level of candidalysin activity is required to damage epithelial cells and drive immune responses. Hence, the commensal lifestyle of C. albicans may be promoted by reduced hypha formation accompanied by low levels of candidalysin secretion, which may function to acquire nutrients from intracellular sources (through non-damaging pore formation) or by promoting colonisation through direct antimicrobial activity on the local microbiota. On the other hand, a pathogenic lifestyle may be promoted when C. albicans hyphal burdens increase accompanied by high levels of candidalysin secretion, or in immunocompromised individuals that exhibit defective anti- Candida immunity. These conceptual aspects for a role of candidalysin in C. albicans infections will no doubt be addressed more fully in the coming years.

### Candidiasis basics… [^112YyPWM]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the yeast Candida.
- Many types of Candidalive naturally in parts of the body and only cause symptoms if too much grows.
- Invasive candidiasis can occur in hospitalized patients if Candidainfects the bloodstream, organs, or bones. Overview Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida, a yeast. Everyone has Candida on their skin and in parts of their body. Candida only causes symptoms and infections if it grows out of control. Vaginal candidiasis are one of the most common fungal infections. Candida can also overgrow in the mouth or throat or in the esophagus.

Invasive candidiasis occurs among hospitalized patients when Candida infects the internal organs like the kidney or brain or the bloodstream. The symptoms and severity of infection are very different compared to the more common candidiasis of the vagina, mouth, throat, and esophagus. Generally, healthy people are not at risk for invasive candidiasis. Symptoms Symptoms of candidiasis depend on the part of the body that is infected. Some examples of types of infection and symptoms include: V aginal candidiasis -vaginal itching, soreness, and discharge. Candidiasis in the mouth and throat
- white patches, redness or soreness. Candidiasis in the esophagus- pain and difficulty swallowing. Invasive candidiasis- fever and chills are common. Treatment and recovery Candidiasis can be treated with different types of antifungal medications.

Antifungal medications come in different forms: topical, pills, or intravenous solutions. The type, dose, and length of antifungal treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and underlying health conditions. Keep Reading: Treatment of Candidiasis.

### Risk factors for candidiasis… [^113xMpan]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Having a weakened immune system or taking antibiotics increases overall risk for candidiasis.
- Pregnancy and hormone changes increase vaginal candidiasis risk.
- Babies < 1 month and people with HIV/AIDS have a higher risk for candidiasis in the mouth, throat, or esophagus.
- Invasive candidiasis generally only poses a risk to hospitalized patients. What increases risk Overall risk for different types of candidiasis Vaginal candidiasis is somewhat common among women, including those who are generally considered healthy. Overall, among healthy adults, candidiasis of the mouth or throat is much less common. Candidiasis of the esophagus is rare among healthy adults. Typically, only people who are hospitalized or were recently hospitalized are potentially at risk for invasive candidiasis. Some examples of invasive candidiasis include candidiasis of internal organs, bones, joints, and the bloodstream.

Risk factors by infection type Vaginal candidiasis Some factors that increase the risk for vaginal candidiasis include:

- Pregnancy
- Use of hormonal contraceptives
- Diabetes
- Weakened immune system
- Current or recent antibiotic use. Candidiasis of the mouth or throat Candidiasis of the mouth and throat are uncommon for healthy adults. The risk is highest among babies under 1 month of age. Health conditions that increase risk for candidiasis in the mouth or throat include:

- Diabetes
- HIV/AIDS
- **Cancer Additional risk factors for candidiasis of the mouth and throat**:

- Dentures
- Antibiotics
- Corticosteroids, especially in inhalers for conditions like asthma
- Medications and conditions that cause dry mouth
- Smoking. Candidiasis in the esophagus Most people who get candidiasis of the esophagus also have mouth and throat infections.

Candidiasis in the esophagus is one of the most common infections in people living with HIV/AIDS. Other conditions that increase risk include blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. People who inject drugs are also at risk for invasive candidiasis, especially for bloodstream infections, heart valve infections, and bone and joint infections. Candidiasis does not spread between people but healthcare professionals and caregivers should wash their hands frequently and follow infection control practices for invasive medical devices and surgical wounds.

### Clinical overview of invasive candidiasis… [^111QXTCt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of invasive candidiasis are non-specific but often include fever and chills.
- Blood cultures are used to diagnose invasive candidiasis.
- Candidemia is the most common type of bloodstream infection in the U. S.
- **Other forms of infection include**: endocarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endophthalmitis.
- Echinocandin antifungals are the most common treatment; antifungal susceptibility testing may be necessary. Etiology Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei are most common. Species distribution varies by patient population and geographic region. Reservoir Candida is a commensal organism of the gastrointestinal tract and skin. Clinical features Signs and symptoms of invasive candidiasis are often non-specific and include fever and chills that do not respond to antibacterial treatment.

While Candidemia is most common, other forms include endocarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endophthalmitis. Candida auris has emerged globally since 2009, including in the United States from mid-2015, and is very concerning because it is highly antimicrobial resistant, causes invasive infections associated with high mortality, and spreads easily between patients in healthcare settings. Prevention In healthcare settings, these measures are important to prevent invasive candidiasis:

- Adhering to hand hygiene recommendations
- Following recommendations for placement and maintenance of central venous catheters
- Practicing antimicrobial stewardship Some groups of patients may benefit from antifungal prophylaxis:

- Some solid organ transplant recipients
- High-risk ICU patients
- Patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia
- Stem cell transplant recipients with neutropenia. Diagnosis Invasive candidiasis is primarily diagnosed with blood culture.

Newer culture-independent diagnostic methods are promising but are not yet widely used. The Beta-D-glucan assay is approved as an adjunctive diagnostic tool but is not a very specific test for Candida. Determining the species of Candida causing the infection is important to guide appropriate antifungal treatment. Transitional treatment The infectious Diseases Society of America recommends retesting patients every day or every other day. Once blood cultures clear transition to fluconazole if susceptible to azoles.

### Tracking C. auris | Candida auris (C. auris)… [^1173R931]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance C. aurisreported to CDC have continued to increase since it was first reported in 2016. However, since 2022 the year-to-year increase has lessened compared to previous years. Overview There were 4, 514 new clinical cases of C. auris in the United States in 2023. The number of clinical cases has continued to increase since the first U. S. case was reported in 2016. The year-to-year changes vary for different states. Healthcare facilities can help prevent outbreaks through early detection of cases, patient screening, and high adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices. Reported clinical case counts In 2023, the number of reported clinical cases of C. auris increased nationally. Both the number of cases and how they change over time varies by state. Some geographic areas continue to experience ongoing transmission, and it has spread into some new areas.

However, recommended infection prevention and control strategies have been successful in preventing spread in some areas, especially when implemented before or at the first detection of. About the data State and local health departments submit clinical case count data to CDC. Cases are reported using case definitions determined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. Clinical cases are those in patients with C. auris identified in a sample tested to find out the cause of an infection. The sample can be taken from either an invasive body site, such as blood or spinal fluid, or a non-invasive body site, like urine or wounds. Screening cases are those in patients who receive a positive C. auris result from a swab collected to test for colonization. Keep ReadingScreening for C. auris. Public health partners CDC collaborates with public health departments, healthcare facilities, and diagnostic laboratories.

CDC's Antimicrobial Resistance Lab Network can assist with C. auris identification and screening nationwide. Laboratories that identify C. auris should notify their state or local public health departments. State and local public health authorities should email CandidaAuris@cdc. gov for assistance with:
