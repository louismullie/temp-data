## Question

typical doses for vyvanse in adults

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the typical doses of Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and whether "typical" refers to ADHD, binge-eating disorder, or both. Then, I should verify the recommended starting dose, titration increments, and maximum dose for each indication. Next, I will review the clinical trial designs that shaped these recommendations to ensure the dosing strategy aligns with efficacy and safety. Finally, I should consider special populations, administration details, and a concise summary that distinguishes ADHD from BED dosing patterns.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indications and scope. Vyvanse is indicated for ADHD in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older, and for moderate-to-severe binge-eating disorder in adults, so "typical doses" must be framed separately for ADHD and BED because the target doses and titration differ by indication [^a18fda74] [^8c14ddac].

> For adult ADHD, I need to check the starting dose and titration. The FDA recommends starting at 30 mg once daily in the morning, with dose adjustments in increments of 10 mg or 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals based on response and tolerability, up to a maximum of 70 mg once daily. This is supported by randomized trials in adults where patients were initiated at 30 mg and titrated by 20 mg weekly to 50 mg or 70 mg, demonstrating efficacy across 30–70 mg with onset within the first week [^8c14ddac] [^96a4f544] [^3c73ead2].

> Wait, let me verify the "typical" maintenance range for ADHD. While the label allows 30–70 mg, many adults stabilize around 50–70 mg, and the pivotal adult trial explicitly titrated to 30, 50, or 70 mg with all active doses outperforming placebo; thus, a "typical" adult maintenance dose commonly falls between 50 and 70 mg, though some respond adequately at 30 mg and should remain at the lowest effective dose [^96a4f544] [^3c73ead2] [^8c14ddac].

> For adult binge-eating disorder, I should confirm the labeled titration pathway. The FDA recommends starting at 30 mg once daily and titrating by 20 mg increments at weekly intervals to a target dose of 50–70 mg once daily, with a maximum of 70 mg; importantly, 30 mg is not an effective maintenance dose for BED, as shown in phase 2 where only 50 and 70 mg were superior to placebo, and in phase 3 dose-optimization studies that used 30 mg as a starter and optimized to 50 or 70 mg [^8c14ddac] [^b4ed842a] [^3b33a39b].

> Hold on, I should verify the time course and durability in BED to contextualize "typical". In the phase 3 trials, significant reductions in binge-eating days emerged by Week 1 and were maintained through Week 12, and a randomized withdrawal study showed continued lisdexamfetamine markedly reduced relapse versus placebo over 26 weeks, supporting maintenance at 50–70 mg in responders [^509eb376] [^03c29133].

> Next, I should review administration and formulation considerations that affect dosing. Vyvanse should be taken once daily in the morning to minimize insomnia; capsules can be swallowed whole or opened and mixed with yogurt, water, or orange juice and consumed immediately, and chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly. Food delays Tmax by about 1 hour but does not meaningfully change overall exposure, so dose timing can be flexible with respect to meals [^8c14ddac] [^186d8170] [^4b82dfa8].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and dose limits. In severe renal impairment (GFR 15–30 mL/min), the maximum recommended dose is 50 mg once daily, and in end-stage renal disease (GFR < 15 mL/min), the maximum is 30 mg once daily; no dose adjustment is needed for hepatic impairment, and the same 70 mg/day ceiling applies across indications in adults without renal limitations [^1f717c61] [^7cfea6aa] [^17572d52].

> Let me reconsider the core question and synthesize. Typical adult dosing is indication-specific: for ADHD, start 30 mg once daily and titrate by 10–20 mg weekly to a usual maintenance range of 50–70 mg, not exceeding 70 mg; for BED, start 30 mg once daily and escalate to a target of 50–70 mg, as 30 mg is insufficient for maintenance, again not exceeding 70 mg. Both strategies align with FDA labeling and pivotal trials that used 30 mg as a starting dose and established efficacy at 50–70 mg in adults [^8c14ddac] [^96a4f544] [^b4ed842a] [^3b33a39b].

---

Typical adult Vyvanse doses are **30 mg once daily** to start, titrated by 10–20 mg weekly to a **maximum of 70 mg** [^8c14ddac] based on response and tolerability [^9e7e1f8f]. For ADHD, the usual effective range is **30–70 mg** [^96a4f544]; for binge eating disorder, the effective range is **50–70 mg** [^b4ed842a] [^ce7c387c]. Doses are taken in the morning to limit insomnia, and the maximum recommended dose is 70 mg/day [^8c14ddac].

---

## Indications and dosing guidelines

Vyvanse is indicated for **ADHD in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older** [^a18fda74] and for **moderate-to-severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults** [^b4ed842a].

---

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

- **Initial dose**: 30 mg once daily in the morning [^8c14ddac].
- **Titration**: Increase by 10 mg or 20 mg at weekly intervals based on response and tolerability [^8c14ddac].
- **Maximum dose**: 70 mg once daily [^8c14ddac].

---

### Binge eating disorder (BED)

- **Initial dose**: 30 mg once daily in the morning [^8c14ddac].
- **Titration**: Increase by 20 mg at weekly intervals to a target dose of 50–70 mg/day [^8c14ddac].
- **Maximum dose**: 70 mg once daily [^8c14ddac].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing recommendations

### ADHD

In adults with ADHD, randomized controlled trials show that **30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg** [^96a4f544] all significantly improve symptoms versus placebo, with onset within the first week [^3c73ead2]. Maintenance of efficacy is supported by a randomized withdrawal study in which relapse rates were significantly lower with continued Vyvanse than with placebo [^e348844f].

---

### Binge eating disorder (BED)

In adults with BED, **50 mg and 70 mg** [^b4ed842a] significantly reduce binge-eating days and increase the likelihood of 4-week binge cessation versus placebo, whereas 30 mg is not statistically superior to placebo [^ce7c387c]. Maintenance of efficacy is supported by a randomized withdrawal study showing a lower relapse risk with continued Vyvanse than with placebo [^03c29133].

---

## Factors influencing dosing decisions

Several factors influence **individualized dosing**:

- **Age**: Older adults may require lower doses due to increased sensitivity and slower metabolism.
- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or psychiatric disorders may necessitate cautious dosing and close monitoring [^98998027].
- **Concurrent medications**: CYP2D6 inhibitors and serotonergic drugs can interact with Vyvanse, requiring dose adjustments and monitoring for serotonin syndrome [^1ab3f816].
- **Patient response**: Dose adjustments are based on clinical response, tolerability, and patient preference [^8c14ddac].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with typical doses

| **Indication** | **Typical dose range** | **Clinical outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| ADHD | 30–70 mg/day | - Significant improvement in attention <br/> - Reduced hyperactivity <br/> - Improved executive function [^96a4f544] [^a5ca9ed9] |
| BED | 50–70 mg/day | - Significant reduction in binge-eating days <br/> - Increased likelihood of binge cessation <br/> - Weight loss [^b4ed842a] [^ce7c387c] |

---

## Safety and tolerability considerations

Common adverse effects include **decreased appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, anxiety, irritability, and headache** [^bbd1cccf]. Cardiovascular effects include modest increases in blood pressure and heart rate; monitor at baseline and periodically during treatment [^98998027]. Vyvanse has abuse and dependence potential; assess risk before prescribing and monitor during therapy [^98998027].

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

- **Renal impairment**: Maximum dose 50 mg/day if GFR 15–30 mL/min; 30 mg/day if GFR < 15 mL/min [^1f717c61] [^7cfea6aa].
- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment required [^17572d52].
- **Elderly**: Use caution and consider lower starting doses due to increased sensitivity.

---

## Summary of typical adult Vyvanse doses

- **Initial dose**: 30 mg once daily in the morning for both ADHD and BED [^8c14ddac].
- **Titration**: Increase by 10–20 mg at weekly intervals based on response and tolerability [^8c14ddac].
- **Typical effective dose range**: 30–70 mg/day for ADHD; 50–70 mg/day for BED [^96a4f544] [^b4ed842a].
- **Maximum dose**: 70 mg once daily [^8c14ddac].

---

Typical adult Vyvanse dosing starts at **30 mg once daily**, with titration by 10–20 mg weekly to a **maximum of 70 mg** [^8c14ddac] based on response and tolerability. Effective ranges are 30–70 mg for ADHD and 50–70 mg for BED, with morning dosing to limit insomnia [^8c14ddac].

2 METHOD

2.1 Study design and treatment

Detailed descriptions of study designs and participants have been reported (McElroy et al. 2015a). In brief, two randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, multicenter studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01718483 [referred to hereafter as Study 1] andidentifier: NCT01718509 [referred to hereafter as Study 2]) were conducted. Study protocols were approved by ethics committees, and both studies were conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants provided written informed consent before entering the studies.

Each study included a 2‐week screening phase, a 12‐week double‐blind phase (4 weeks of dose optimization followed by 8 weeks of dose maintenance), and a follow‐up visit. After screening, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 12 weeks of dose‐optimized LDX or matching placebo. For blinding, both treatments were identical in appearance. Treatment was initiated with 30 mg LDX during Week 1 and titrated to 50 mg LDX at the start of Week 2. During Week 3, dose increases to 70 mg LDX could be made based on tolerability and clinical need. After the LDX dose was increased to 70 mg, a single down‐titration to 50 mg was allowed during Week 3 if tolerability to 70 mg LDX was poor. If a dose reduction occurred, no further changes were allowed. During Weeks 4 to 12, the optimized LDX dosage (50 or 70 mg) was maintained. Because no dose changes were permitted beyond Week 3, participants requiring a dose reduction during the maintenance phase were discontinued. A follow‐up visit occurred 1 week after the final treatment visit (Week 12 or ET) to assess any ongoing or new safety and tolerability issues.

Pediatric Patients Ages 13 to 17 Years with ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 4) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years (N = 314) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to a daily morning dose of VYVANSE (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day or 70 mg/day) or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving VYVANSE were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All VYVANSE dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 4 in Table 6).

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 17 Years: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled parallel-group, dose-optimization study (Study 5) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years (n = 336) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this eight-week study, patients were randomized to a daily morning dose of VYVANSE (30, 50 or 70 mg/day), an active control, or placebo (1:1:1). The study consisted of a Screening and Washout Period (up to 42 days), a 7-week Double-blind Evaluation Period (consisting of a 4-week Dose-Optimization Period followed by a 3-week Dose-Maintenance Period), and a 1-week Washout and Follow-up Period. During the Dose Optimization Period, subjects were titrated until an optimal dose, based on tolerability and investigator's judgment, was reached. VYVANSE showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean reduction from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score was 18.6. Subjects on VYVANSE also showed greater improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) rating scale compared to subjects on placebo (Study 5 in Table 6).

Adults: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 7) was conducted in adults ages 18 to 55 (N = 420) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of VYVANSE or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving VYVANSE were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All VYVANSE dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 7 in Table 6).

The second study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, modified analog classroom study (Study 8) of VYVANSE to simulate a workplace environment in 142 adults ages 18 to 55 who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD. There was a 4-week open-label, dose optimization phase with VYVANSE (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day, or 70 mg/day in the morning). Patients were then randomized to one of two treatment sequences: 1) VYVANSE (optimized dose) followed by placebo, each for one week, or 2) placebo followed by VYVANSE, each for one week. Efficacy assessments occurred at the end of each week, using the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP), a skill-adjusted math test that measures attention in ADHD. PERMP total score results from the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly. VYVANSE treatment, compared to placebo, resulted in a statistically significant improvement in attention across all post-dose time points, as measured by average PERMP total scores over the course of one assessment day, as well as at each time point measured. The PERMP assessments were administered at pre-dose (-0.5 hours) and at 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14 hours post-dose (Study 8 in Table 6, Figure 6).

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 12 Years with ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N = 290) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (either the combined type or the hyperactive-impulsive type). Patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of VYVANSE or placebo once daily in the morning for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving VYVANSE were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), an 18-item questionnaire with a score range of 0–54 points that measures the core symptoms of ADHD which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All VYVANSE dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome. Mean effects at all doses were similar; however, the highest dose (70 mg/day) was numerically superior to both lower doses (Study 1 in Table 6). The effects were maintained throughout the day based on parent ratings (Conners' Parent Rating Scale) in the morning (approximately 10 am), afternoon (approximately 2 pm), and early evening (approximately 6 pm).

### Clinical characteristics and treatment response to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate versus placebo in adults with binge eating disorder: analysis by gender and age [^e03beac4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe clinical characteristics and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) treatment effects, based on gender and age, in adults diagnosed with moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED).

Methods

Adults diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision-defined BED of moderate to severe severity were randomized to 12 weeks of dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg) or placebo in 2 studies (conducted from November 26, 2012, to September 25, 2013 [study 1] and from November 26, 2012, to September 20, 2013 [study 2]). These post hoc analyses pooled data by gender (men vs women) and age (< 40 vs ≥ 40 years) across studies; reported P values are nominal (descriptive and unadjusted).

Results

The pooled safety analysis and full analysis sets included 745 and 724 participants, respectively (men, n = 105 and n = 97; women, n = 640 and n = 627; < 40 years, n = 398 and n = 386; ≥ 40 years, n = 347 and n = 338). Across subgroups, most participants had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² (63.0%-75.5%). The mean baseline number of binge eating days/wk was comparable across gender (4.6–4.7) and age (4.6–4.9), as was Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total score (gender, 20.42–21.70; age, 21.40–21.63). Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences nominally favored LDX in all subgroups (all P < .001) for changes from baseline in binge eating days/wk at weeks 11–12 and in Y-BOCS-BE total score at week 12; no interactions by gender or age were reported. Consistent with the overall profile of LDX, across all subgroups LDX was associated with higher frequencies of treatment-emergent adverse events than placebo and with increases in blood pressure and pulse.

Conclusions

Across gender and age, participants exhibited comparable clinical characteristics and responses to dose-optimized LDX compared with placebo.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01718483 and NCT01718509.

14.2 Binge Eating Disorder (BED)

A phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of VYVANSE 30, 50 and 70 mg/day compared to placebo in reducing the number of binge days/week in adults with at least moderate to severe BED. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose titration study (Study 10) consisted of an 11-week double-blind treatment period (3 weeks of forced-dose titration followed by 8 weeks of dose maintenance). VYVANSE 30 mg/day was not statistically different from placebo on the primary endpoint. The 50 and 70 mg/day doses were statistically superior to placebo on the primary endpoint.

The efficacy of VYVANSE in the treatment of BED was demonstrated in two 12-week randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization studies (Study 11 and Study 12) in adults aged 18–55 years (Study 11: N = 374, Study 12: N = 350) with moderate to severe BED. A diagnosis of BED was confirmed using DSM-IV criteria for BED. Severity of BED was determined based on having at least 3 binge days per week for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and on having a Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥ 4 at the baseline visit. For both studies, a binge day was defined as a day with at least 1 binge episode, as determined from the subject's daily binge diary.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) [^3b33a39b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Both 12-week studies consisted of a 4-week dose-optimization period and an 8-week dose-maintenance period. During dose-optimization, subjects assigned to VYVANSE began treatment at the titration dose of 30 mg/day and, after 1 week of treatment, were subsequently titrated to 50 mg/day. Additional increases to 70 mg/day were made as tolerated and clinically indicated. Following the dose-optimization period, subjects continued on their optimized dose for the duration of the dose-maintenance period.

The primary efficacy outcome for the two studies was defined as the change from baseline at Week 12 in the number of binge days per week. Baseline is defined as the weekly average of the number of binge days per week for the 14 days prior to the baseline visit. Subjects from both studies on VYVANSE had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline in mean number of binge days per week at Week 12. In addition, subjects on VYVANSE showed greater improvement as compared to placebo across key secondary outcomes with higher proportion of subjects rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale, higher proportion of subjects with 4-week binge cessation, and greater reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total score.

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 17 Years: Maintenance Treatment in ADHD

Maintenance of Efficacy Study (Study 6) – A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years (N = 276) who met the diagnosis of ADHD (DSM-IV criteria). A total of 276 patients were enrolled into the study, 236 patients participated in Study 5 and 40 subjects directly enrolled. Subjects were treated with open-label VYVANSE for at least 26 weeks prior to being assessed for entry into the randomized withdrawal period. Eligible patients had to demonstrate treatment response as defined by CGI-S < 3 and Total Score on the ADHD-RS ≤ 22. Patients that maintained treatment response for 2 weeks at the end of the open label treatment period were eligible to be randomized to ongoing treatment with the same dose of VYVANSE (N = 78) or switched to placebo (N = 79) during the double-blind phase. Patients were observed for relapse (treatment failure) during the 6 week double blind phase. A significantly lower proportion of treatment failures occurred among VYVANSE subjects (15.8%) compared to placebo (67.5%) at endpoint of the randomized withdrawal period. The endpoint measurement was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week at which a valid ADHD-RS Total Score and CGI-S were observed. Treatment failure was defined as a ≥ 50% increase (worsening) in the ADHD-RS Total Score and a ≥ 2-point increase in the CGI-S score compared to scores at entry into the double-blind randomized withdrawal phase. Subjects who withdrew from the randomized withdrawal period and who did not provide efficacy data at their last on-treatment visit were classified as treatment failures (Study 6, Figure 5).

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Vyvanse) [^5c57078a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized withdrawal design study (Study 13) was conducted to evaluate maintenance of efficacy based on time to relapse between VYVANSE and placebo in adults aged 18 to 55 (N = 267) with moderate to severe BED. In this longer-term study patients who had responded to VYVANSE in the preceding 12-week open-label treatment phase were randomized to continuation of VYVANSE or placebo for up to 26 weeks of observation for relapse. Response in the open-label phase was defined as 1 or fewer binge days each week for four consecutive weeks prior to the last visit at the end of the 12-week open-label phase and a CGI-S score of 2 or less at the same visit. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as having 2 or more binge days each week for two consecutive weeks (14 days) prior to any visit and having an increase in CGI-S score of 2 or more points compared to the randomized-withdrawal baseline. Maintenance of efficacy for patients who had an initial response during the open-label period and then continued on VYVANSE during the 26-week double-blind randomized-withdrawal phase was demonstrated with VYVANSE being superior over placebo as measured by time to relapse.

Adults: Maintenance Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal design study (Study 9) was conducted in adults ages 18 to 55 (N = 123) who had a documented diagnosis of ADHD or met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. At study entry, patients must have had documentation of treatment with VYVANSE for a minimum of 6 months and had to demonstrate treatment response as defined by Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) ≤ 3 and Total Score on the ADHD-RS < 22. ADHD-RS Total Score is a measure of core symptoms of ADHD. The CGI-S score assesses the clinician's impression of the patient's current illness state and ranges from 1 (not at all ill) to 7 (extremely ill). Patients that maintained treatment response at Week 3 of the open label treatment phase (N = 116) were eligible to be randomized to ongoing treatment with the same dose of VYVANSE (N = 56) or switched to placebo (N = 60) during the double-blind phase. Patients were observed for relapse (treatment failure) during the 6-week double-blind phase. The efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment failure during the double-blind phase. Treatment failure was defined as a ≥ 50% increase (worsening) in the ADHD-RS Total Score and ≥ 2-point increase in the CGI-S score compared to scores at entry into the double-blind phase. Maintenance of efficacy for patients treated with VYVANSE was demonstrated by the significantly lower proportion of patients with treatment failure (9%) compared to patients receiving placebo (75%) at endpoint during the double-blind phase (Study 9, Figure 7).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^a640ce2e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated dose-response relationships of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate when used as augmentation for major depressive disorder in individuals exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.

Methods

Eligible adults (18–65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparisons procedures with modeling.

Results

For Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p > 0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were -1.4 (-3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (-2.5, 2.7), -0.7 (-3.4, 2.0), and -0.9 (-3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant dose-responses for all candidate dose-response curves (all p < 0.10), with increases observed as lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose increased; a linear relationship provided the best fit. Mean ± standard deviation changes from augmentation baseline for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse at week 16/early termination were -0.7 ± 9.90 and -0.3 ± 7.24 mm Hg and 0.2 ± 10.57 bpm with placebo and were 1.9 ± 9.47 and 0.8 ± 7.40 mm Hg and 3.6 ± 9.74 bpm with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (all doses combined). The safety and tolerability profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was consistent with previous studies.

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation did not provide benefit over placebo in adults with inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy based on the assessed efficacy measures.

### Efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine for treatment of adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^ce7c387c]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Binge-eating disorder (BED), a public health problem associated with psychopathological symptoms and obesity and possibly with metabolic syndrome, lacks approved pharmacotherapies.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a dextroamphetamine prodrug, to treat moderate to severe BED.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We performed a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, forced dose titration, placebo-controlled clinical trial at 30 sites from May 10, 2011, through January 30, 2012. Safety and intention-to-treat analyses included 259 and 255 adults with BED, respectively.

Interventions

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate at dosages of 30, 50, or 70 mg/d or placebo were provided to study participants (1:1:1:1). Dosages were titrated across 3 weeks and maintained for 8 weeks. We followed up participants for a mean (SD) of 7 (2) days after the last dose.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We assessed the change in binge-eating (BE) behaviors measured as days per week (baseline to week 11) with a mixed-effects model using transformed log (BE days per week)+1. Secondary measures included BE cessation for 4 weeks. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, and change in weight.

Results

At week 11, log-transformed BE days per week decreased with the 50-mg/d (least squares [LS] mean [SE] change, -1.49 [0.066]; P = 0.008) and 70-mg/d (LS mean [SE] change, -1.57 [0.067]; P < .001) treatment groups but not the 30-mg/d treatment group (LS mean [SE] change, -1.24 [0.067]; P = 0.88) compared with the placebo group. Nontransformed mean (SD) days per week decreased for placebo and the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg/d treatment groups by -3.3 (2.04), -3.5 (1.95), -4.1 (1.52), and -4.1 (1.57), respectively. The percentage of participants achieving 4-week BE cessation was lower with the placebo group (21.3%) compared with the 50-mg/d (42.2% [P = 0.01]) and 70-mg/d (50.0% [P < .001]) treatment groups. The incidence of any treatment-emergent adverse events was 58.7% for the placebo group and 84.7% for the combined treatment group. In the treatment groups, 1.5% of participants had serious treatment-emergent adverse effects. Events with a frequency of at least 5% and changes in heart rate were generally consistent with the known safety profile. The mean (SD) change in body weight was -0.1 (3.09), -3.1 (3.64), -4.9 (4.43), -4.9 (3.93), and -4.3 (4.09) kg for the placebo group, the 30-, 50-, and 70-mg/d treatment groups, and the combined treatment groups, respectively (P < .001 for each dose vs placebo group comparison in post hoc analysis).

Conclusions and Relevance

The 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups demonstrated efficacy compared with the placebo group in decreased BE days, BE cessation, and global improvement. The safety profile was generally consistent with previous findings in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Further investigation of lisdexamfetamine in BED is ongoing.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for adults with major depressive disorder and inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy: results from 2 phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies [^2c7aaa26]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) from two phase 3 studies are reported.

Methods

Across study 1 (placebo, n = 201; LDX, n = 201) and study 2 (placebo, n = 213; LDX, n = 211), most participants (placebo and LDX) in the safety analysis set were female (study 1: 66.2% and 64.2%; study 2: 67.1% and 66.8%); mean ± SD ages were 41.8 ± 12.04 with placebo and 42.2 ± 12.32 with LDX in study 1 and 42.6 ± 11.41 with placebo and 42.0 ± 11.63 with LDX in study 2. Participants (18–65 y) had DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed MDD and lead-in baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores ≥ 24. Eight-week antidepressant lead-in phases prospectively assessed antidepressant response. Then, 8 weeks of randomized (1:1), double-blind treatment with dose-optimized LDX (20-70mg) or placebo in participants exhibiting inadequate antidepressant monotherapy responses (augmentation baseline MADRS total scores ≥ 18 and < 50% MADRS total score reductions from lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline) was initiated. The primary endpoint was MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline to week 16. Safety and tolerability measures included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Results

Least squares mean (95% CI) treatment differences (LDX-placebo) for MADRS total score changes from augmentation baseline to week 16 were not statistically significant in study 1 (0.1 [-1.7, 2.0], P = 0.883) or study 2 (-0.5 [-2.3, 1.3], P = 0.583). The only TEAE reported by > 5% of LDX participants at twice the placebo rate in both studies was dry mouth.

Limitations

Limitations include the exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidities/active medical disorders, the inability to assess specific MDD symptom domains (eg, anhedonia, cognition) or subtypes, the use of telephone-based depression assessments, and the potential influence of placebo response.

Conclusion

Contrary to expectations, LDX augmentation was not superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is approved for use in adults with moderate to severe binge‐eating disorder (BED) in the United States (Vyvanse ®, 2015). In two large, identically designed, 12‐week, dose‐optimized, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, Phase 3 studies in adults with protocol‐defined moderate to severe BED, dose‐optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg/day) produced statistically superior and clinically meaningful reductions in binge eating days/week at weeks 11–12 (primary efficacy endpoint) versus placebo (McElroy et al. 2015a). In these Phase 3 trials, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements on secondary efficacy endpoints were also observed for LDX versus placebo at Week 12/early termination (ET) for including Clinical Global Impressions — Improvement (CGI‐I) and 4‐week binge eating cessation and at Week 12 for Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y‐BOCS‐BE) and percentage change in body weight (McElroy et al. 2015a). In a Phase 2, fixed‐dose, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial, LDX (50 and 70 mg but not 30 mg) was also superior to placebo in decreasing binge eating days/week in adults with BED at Week 11 (McElroy et al. 2015b). In these short‐term studies (McElroy et al. 2015a, 2015b), the safety and tolerability of LDX were generally similar to its established profile for LDX treatment of attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Vyvanse ®, 2015).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^3e317bd0]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Background:

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated dose-response relationships of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate when used as augmentation for major depressive disorder in individuals exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy.

Methods:

Eligible adults (18–65 years) were assigned to antidepressant monotherapy (escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release) plus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate-matching placebo during an eight-week single-blind lead-in phase. Participants meeting randomization criteria were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to eight weeks of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (10, 30, 50, or 70 mg) or placebo while maintaining antidepressant therapy. Dose-responses for changes from augmentation baseline to week 16/early termination for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score (primary efficacy endpoint) and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse) were assessed using multiple comparisons procedures with modeling.

Results:

For Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change, no significant dose-responses were observed for any candidate dose-response curve (all p > 0.10). In the dose-response evaluable population, least squares mean (90% confidence interval) treatment differences versus placebo for Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score change at week 16 were −1.4 (−3.9, 1.2), 0.1 (−2.5, 2.7), −0.7 (−3.4, 2.0), and −0.9 (−3.5, 1.6) with 10, 30, 50, and 70 mg lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, respectively. For all vital sign parameters, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate exhibited significant dose-responses for all candidate dose-response curves (all p < 0.10), with increases observed as lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose increased; a linear relationship provided the best fit. Mean ± standard deviation changes from augmentation baseline for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse at week 16/early termination were −0.7 ± 9.90 and −0.3 ± 7.24 mm Hg and 0.2 ± 10.57 bpm with placebo and were 1.9 ± 9.47 and 0.8 ± 7.40 mm Hg and 3.6 ± 9.74 bpm with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (all doses combined). The safety and tolerability profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was consistent with previous studies.

Conclusions:

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation did not provide benefit over placebo in adults with inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy based on the assessed efficacy measures.

4 DISCUSSION

The key findings of this report are that the treatment effects of LDX versus placebo were observed as early as the first week of treatment across multiple endpoints (binge eating days/week, binge eating episodes/week, 1‐week binge eating response, dichotomized improvement on the CGI‐I, and percentage change in body weight from baseline) and at Week 4 on Y‐BOCS‐BE total and domain scores (the first time point assessed). Furthermore, improvements were maintained for the duration of the 12‐week studies. These results support the relatively rapid efficacy of LDX in reducing both binge eating behavior and binge eating‐related psychopathology in two studies (McElroy et al. 2015a) in which 12 weeks of dose‐optimized LDX was shown to produce significantly greater improvement than placebo at the end of the study on several of these same measures. Consistent with the results of the Phase 2 study (McElroy et al. 2015b), this post hoc analysis revealed a possible treatment effect at Week 1, when 30 mg LDX was being taken by study participants. This finding is difficult to explain because 30 mg LDX was not statistically superior to placebo in reducing log‐transformed binge eating days/week at the Week 11 (the primary endpoint) in the Phase 2 study (McElroy et al. 2015b). Although 30 mg LDX is a recommended starting titration dose for the treatment of BED (Vyvanse ®, 2015), it was not studied as a target treatment dose based largely on the Phase 3 pivotal studies in which 30 mg LDX was used only as an initial titration dose and not studied as a target dose (McElroy et al. 2015a). Additional research with a study design focused on this research question would be needed to draw firmer conclusions.

Introduction

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is the most common specific eating disorder, and the estimated lifetime global prevalence is between 0.9–2.2.%. In 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) (Vyvanse ®, Takeda) as the first and, to date, only drug for the treatment of BED. This approval was based on the results of two phase-III, 12-week randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation studies in adults with BED. In both studies, 50 and 70 mg LDX reduced binge-eating episodes and weight as compared to placebo. Since then, evidence has accumulated to suggest that LDX is an effective treatment for BED. There is also evidence that LDX reduces food intake in preclinical models of binge eating in rodents.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of both clinical and preclinical studies on the effects of LDX on binge eating found a poverty of studies examining the neural and cognitive processes that underpin LDX's effects in ameliorating BED symptoms. Schneider et al. proposed that LDX may reduce binge eating by a combination of effects on appetite/satiety, reward, and cognitive processes that are mediated by actions of LDX on catecholaminergic and serotoninergic transmission. There is considerable potential to use the power of experimental medicine to explore the mechanism of action of LDX in treating BED. Only a single pilot fMRI study with LDX in BED has been conducted to date, and this study did not include a placebo control group. LDX is a stimulant drug and classified as a Schedule II controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). An improved understanding of the neuropsychological processes impacted by LDX could aid in the development of novel medications to treat BED, with improved efficacy and fewer side effects that are not schedule controlled by the DEA.

2.4 Data presentation and statistical analyses

Statistically significant findings for the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in binge eating days/week at Weeks 11–12) and key secondary endpoints (improvement on the dichotomized CGI‐I at Week 12/ET, 4‐week binge cessation at Week 12/ET, percentage body weight change from baseline at Week 12, and Y‐BOCS‐BE total score change from baseline at Week 12) have previously been reported (McElroy et al. 2015a). Time course assessments of efficacy‐related endpoints are described in this report.

Statistical assessments were conducted in the full analysis set (participants taking ≥ 1 study drug dose and having ≥ 1 postbaseline primary efficacy assessment). The time course analyses presented in the current report are analyzed with the same procedures previously described for the prespecified endpoints (McElroy et al. 2015a). Mixed‐effects models for repeated measures analysis over all postbaseline visits, using an unstructured covariance matrix with treatment, visit, and the treatment × visit interaction included as factors and baseline score as a covariate and its interaction with visit also included in the model, were used to determine least squares (LS) mean treatment differences (LDX — placebo) in the change from baseline for binge eating days/week, binge‐eating episodes/week, percentage body weight change, and Y‐BOCS‐BE total and domain scores; effects size (ES) size was determined based on the estimated standard deviation from the unstructured covariance matrix. Degrees of freedom were calculated using the Kenward‐Roger approximation method. Treatment comparisons between LDX and placebo in the percentage of participants categorized as improved on the dichotomized CGI‐I were analyzed using χ 2 tests; odds ratios (ORs) were calculated as LDX/placebo. For 1‐week binge eating response (percentage reductions in binge eating episodes/week), differences in the distribution of responses between LDX and placebo were compared using a covariate‐adjusted Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel method, with baseline binge eating episodes/week included as the covariate. Cramer's V was calculated using a 2 × 4 contingency table at each visit to assess the association between the treatment group and binge eating response; values range from 0 (no association) to 1 (complete association).

Weight Loss and Slowing Growth Rate in Pediatric Patients with ADHD

In a controlled trial of VYVANSE in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (Study 1), mean weight loss from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy was -0.9, -1.9, and -2.5 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 1 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss with 4 weeks of treatment. Careful follow-up for weight in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years who received VYVANSE over 12 months suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a slowing in growth rate, measured by body weight as demonstrated by an age- and sex-normalized mean change from baseline in percentile, of -13.4 over 1 year (average percentiles at baseline and 12 months were 60.9 and 47.2, respectively). In a 4-week controlled trial of VYVANSE in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight loss from baseline to endpoint was -2.7, -4.3, and -4.8 lbs., respectively, for patients receiving 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, compared to a 2.0 pound weight gain for patients receiving placebo.

14.2 Binge Eating Disorder (BED)

A phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules 30, 50 and 70 mg/day compared to placebo in reducing the number of binge days/week in adults with at least moderate to severe BED. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, forced-dose titration study (Study 10) consisted of an 11-week double-blind treatment period (3 weeks of forced-dose titration followed by 8 weeks of dose maintenance). Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules 30 mg/day was not statistically different from placebo on the primary endpoint. The 50 and 70 mg/day doses were statistically superior to placebo on the primary endpoint.

The efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules in the treatment of BED was demonstrated in two 12-week randomized, double-blind, multi-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization studies (Study 11 and Study 12) in adults aged 18–55 years (Study 11: N = 374, Study 12: N = 350) with moderate to severe BED. A diagnosis of BED was confirmed using DSM-IV criteria for BED. Severity of BED was determined based on having at least 3 binge days per week for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and on having a Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) score of ≥ 4 at the baseline visit. For both studies, a binge day was defined as a day with at least 1 binge episode, as determined from the subject's daily binge diary.

### Lisdexamfetamine (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) [^7febe402]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Both 12-week studies consisted of a 4-week dose-optimization period and an 8-week dose-maintenance period. During dose-optimization, subjects assigned to lisdexamfetamine dimesylate began treatment at the titration dose of 30 mg/day and, after 1 week of treatment, were subsequently titrated to 50 mg/day. Additional increases to 70 mg/day were made as tolerated and clinically indicated. Following the dose-optimization period, subjects continued on their optimized dose for the duration of the dose-maintenance period.

The primary efficacy outcome for the two studies was defined as the change from baseline at Week 12 in the number of binge days per week. Baseline is defined as the weekly average of the number of binge days per week for the 14 days prior to the baseline visit. Subjects from both studies on lisdexamfetamine dimesylate had a statistically significantly greater reduction from baseline in mean number of binge days per week at Week 12. In addition, subjects on lisdexamfetamine dimesylate showed greater improvement as compared to placebo across key secondary outcomes with higher proportion of subjects rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale, higher proportion of subjects with 4-week binge cessation, and greater reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total score.

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with VYVANSE, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating VYVANSE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

2.2 General Administration Information

Take VYVANSE orally in the morning with or without food; avoid afternoon doses because of the potential for insomnia. VYVANSE may be administered in one of the following ways:

Information for VYVANSE capsules:

Swallow VYVANSE capsules whole, or
Open capsules, empty and mix the entire contents with yogurt, water, or orange juice. If the contents of the capsule include any compacted powder, a spoon may be used to break apart the powder. The contents should be mixed until completely dispersed. Consume the entire mixture immediately. It should not be stored. The active ingredient dissolves completely once dispersed; however, a film containing the inactive ingredients may remain in the glass or container once the mixture is consumed.

Information for VYVANSE chewable tablets:

VYVANSE chewable tablets must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing.

VYVANSE capsules can be substituted with VYVANSE chewable tablets on a unit per unit/mg per mg basis (for example, 30 mg capsules for 30 mg chewable tablet) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Do not take anything less than one capsule or chewable tablet per day. A single dose should not be divided.

2.3 Dosage for Treatment of ADHD

The recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older is 30 mg once daily in the morning. Dosage may be adjusted in increments of 10 mg or 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals up to maximum recommended dosage of 70 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

2.4 Dosage for Treatment of Moderate to Severe BED in Adults

The recommended starting dosage in adults is 30 mg once daily to be titrated in increments of 20 mg at approximately weekly intervals to achieve the recommended target dose of 50 mg to 70 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dosage is 70 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Discontinue VYVANSE if binge eating does not improve.

Careful follow-up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated pediatric patients over 36 months (to the ages of 10 to 13 years), suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients ages 7 to 13 years (i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have a temporary slowing in growth rate (on average, a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2.7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years), without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development. In a controlled trial of amphetamine (d- to l-enantiomer ratio of 3:1) in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years, mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was -1.1 pounds and -2.8 pounds, respectively, for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg of amphetamine. Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Weight Loss in Adults with ADHD

In the controlled adult trial (Study 7), mean weight loss after 4 weeks of therapy was 2.8 pounds, 3.1 pounds, and 4.3 pounds, for patients receiving final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg of VYVANSE, respectively, compared to a mean weight gain of 0.5 pounds for patients receiving placebo.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine. Amphetamines are non-catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity. The exact mode of therapeutic action in ADHD and BED is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. The parent drug, lisdexamfetamine, does not bind to the sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate have been conducted in healthy adult (capsule and chewable tablet formulations) and pediatric (6 to 12 years) patients with ADHD (capsule formulation). After single dose administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, pharmacokinetics of dextroamphetamine was found to be linear between 30 mg and 70 mg in a pediatric study (6 to 12 years), and between 50 mg and 250 mg in an adult study. Dextroamphetamine pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults exhibited low inter-subject (< 25%) and intra-subject (< 8%) variability. There is no accumulation of lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine at steady state in healthy adults.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

VYVANSE has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of VYVANSE exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. VYVANSE can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including VYVANSE, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing VYVANSE, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store VYVANSE in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give VYVANSE to anyone else. Throughout VYVANSE treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid VYVANSE use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.

5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Some patients may have larger increases.

Monitor all VYVANSE-treated patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension.

Elimination

Plasma concentrations of unconverted lisdexamfetamine are low and transient, generally becoming non-quantifiable by 8 hours after administration. The plasma elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine typically averaged less than one hour in volunteers ages 6 years and older. The plasma elimination half-life of dextroamphetamine was approximately 8.6 to 9.5 hours in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years and 10 to 11.3 hours in healthy adults.

Metabolism

Lisdexamfetamine is converted to dextroamphetamine and l-lysine primarily in blood due to the hydrolytic activity of red blood cells after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. In vitro data demonstrated that red blood cells have a high capacity for metabolism of lisdexamfetamine; substantial hydrolysis occurred even at low hematocrit levels (33% of normal). Lisdexamfetamine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Excretion

Following oral administration of a 70 mg dose of radiolabeled lisdexamfetamine dimesylate to 6 healthy subjects, approximately 96% of the oral dose radioactivity was recovered in the urine and only 0.3% recovered in the feces over a period of 120 hours. Of the radioactivity recovered in the urine, 42% of the dose was related to amphetamine, 25% to hippuric acid, and 2% to intact lisdexamfetamine.

Specific Populations

Exposures of dextroamphetamine in specific populations are summarized in Figure 1.

### Lisdexamfetamine for treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^9cc92231]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of the prodrug lisdexamfetamine for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and describe its potential place in therapy.

Data Sources

Primary literature published between January 1, 1990, and August 1, 2008, was selected from PubMed using the search key words lisdexamfetamine, Vyvanse, and NRP104. References of selected publications were also reviewed. Posters and abstracts of research presented at national meetings were reviewed when available. The product labeling for Vyvanse was also used.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Preference was given to published, randomized, and controlled research describing the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of lisdexamfetamine. Noncontrolled studies, postmarketing reports, and poster presentations were considered secondly. All published studies were included.

Data Synthesis

Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of dextroamphetamine covalently bound to l-lysine, which is activated during first-pass metabolism. The unique pharmacokinetic profile owing to lisdexamfetamine's prodrug design and rate-limited enzymatic biotransformation allows for once-daily dosing with a duration of activity of approximately 12 hours. Lisdexamfetamine has been proven to reduce the symptoms of ADHD both in children aged 6–12 years and adults aged 18–55 years, decreasing ADHD rating scale scores by approximately 27 and 19 points, respectively. Adverse effects with an incidence greater than 10% during preclinical trials included appetite suppression, insomnia, and headache. Lisdexamfetamine's unique pharmacokinetic properties may provide additional safety with regard to reducing abuse potential. As with other central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, concerns regarding sudden cardiac death and adverse effects on growth also apply to lisdexamfetamine.

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine provides another amphetamine-based CNS stimulant option for treatment of children and adults with ADHD. However, its use may be limited by a lack of significant differentiation when compared with currently used stimulants and a lack of evidence to support its use in adolescents.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^509eb376]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

This study examined the time course of efficacy-related endpoints for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) versus placebo in adults with protocol-defined moderate to severe binge-eating disorder (BED).

Methods

In two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, adults meeting DSM-IV-TR BED criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg). Analyses across visits used mixed-effects models for repeated measures (binge eating days/week, binge eating episodes/week, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating [Y-BOCS-BE] scores, percentage body weight change) and chi-square tests (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement [CGI-I; from the perspective of BED symptoms] scale dichotomized as improved or not improved). These analyses were not part of the prespecified testing strategy, so reported p values are nominal (unadjusted and descriptive only).

Results

Least squares mean treatment differences for change from baseline in both studies favored LDX over placebo (all nominal p values < .001) starting at Week 1 for binge eating days/week, binge-eating episodes/week, and percentage weight change and at the first posttreatment assessment (Week 4) for Y-BOCS-BE total and domain scores. On the CGI-I, more participants on LDX than placebo were categorized as improved starting at Week 1 in both studies (both nominal p values < .001). Across these efficacy-related endpoints, the superiority of LDX over placebo was maintained at each posttreatment assessment in both studies (all nominal p values < .001).

Discussion

In adults with BED, LDX treatment appeared to be associated with improvement on efficacy measures as early as 1 week, which was maintained throughout the 12-week studies.

During the forced-dose titration portion of double-blind treatment, doses were increased for participants randomized to LDX, and participants in the placebo group continued treatment as in the antidepressant lead-in phase. Participants randomized to 10 or 30 mg LDX started at 10 or 30 mg LDX, respectively, at week 8 and maintained these doses during weeks 9 and 10. Participants randomized to 50 mg LDX started at 30 mg at week 8 and increased to 50 mg during week 9. Participants randomized to 70 mg LDX started at 30 mg at week 8 and increased to 50 mg and 70 mg LDX during weeks 9 and 10, respectively. During the dose-maintenance portion of double-blind treatment, participants continued to receive the target doses being taken during week 10. Regardless of treatment group or treatment phase, LDX or placebo was taken once daily (at approximately 07:00 ± 2 h) in conjunction with their assigned antidepressant.

One down-titration was permitted during double-blind treatment to manage increases in blood pressure or pulse; assessments of vital signs, AEs, MADRS scores, and C-SSRS responses were made in conjunction with any down-titration. Participants whose doses were decreased were permitted to continue the study at the lower dose; those requiring > 1 dose reduction were discontinued from the study.

During the follow-up visit, which occurred 7–9 days after the last dose of study drug, participants returned to the study site for a final evaluation.

This study was conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by ethics committees and institutional review boards at each study site before study initiation.

Materials and methods

Participants

Eligible participants were men or nonpregnant/nonnursing women (18–65 years) with a primary diagnosis of nonpsychotic MDD, as defined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders–Clinical Trial version (SCID-CT), that had lasted for at least eight weeks before screening and who had a lead-in baseline MADRS total score ⩾24. All eligible participants also had to be able to provide written informed consent before completing any study-related procedures and be willing and able to fully comply with study procedures.

Key exclusion criteria included nonresponse (⩾6 weeks of treatment at the maximum tolerated adult dose approved for MDD) to the current MDD episode with two or more antidepressant monotherapies or to an approved augmentation treatment; and a lifetime history of treatment-resistant depression, defined as having not responded to adequate treatment (⩾8 weeks of treatment at the maximum tolerated dose within the dose range approved for adults with MDD) with two or more treatment regimens, including distinct classes of approved antidepressant monotherapies and augmentation treatments. Participants were excluded if they had a history of treatment-resistant depression because the objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of LDX as augmentation therapy in participants with a minimal history of previous failed antidepressant treatments, and not to assess LDX as a possible therapy for treatment-resistant depression. As such, the inclusion of individuals with treatment-resistant depression was considered to have an unfavorable risk-benefit balance.

Study design and treatment

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, forced-dose titration, dose-finding study (identifier: NCT01435759) was conducted at 76 sites across five countries (USA, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the UK) between 31 May 2011–17 January 2014. The study included a screening and washout phase (1–4 weeks), an eight-week single-blind antidepressant lead-in phase, an eight-week double-blind treatment phase (three weeks of forced-dose titration followed by five weeks of dose maintenance), and a one-week follow-up phase (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Study timeline and dose adjustment schedule for (a) randomized and (b) nonrandomized participants.

LDX: lisdexamfetamine dimesylate; V: visit; Wk: week.

During the lead-in antidepressant phase, which was designed to prospectively identify inadequate responders, investigators assigned unblinded antidepressant therapy (ESC or venlafaxine extended-release (VXR)) along with single-blind LDX-matching placebo to participants. Antidepressant treatment, which was based on investigator assessment of clinical factors (including prior antidepressant use, response, and tolerability), was initiated at the lowest dose allowed on the morning following the lead-in baseline visit if the participant was not already receiving the assigned antidepressant. If the participant was already taking one of the two background antidepressants (ESC or VXR) at study entry, the treatment regimen was maintained. Treatment assignment was monitored to ensure an adequate representation of each type of antidepressant in the overall study population. Participants already taking the assigned antidepressant started this phase at their current dose. Doses were subsequently titrated to the maximum tolerated dose over four weeks, after which time dose adjustments were not permitted. If a participant required a dose decrease or needed to be discontinued from treatment, the dose was tapered according to labeled guidelines. Assessments of vital signs, adverse events (AEs), and C-SSRS responses were made in conjunction with dose decreases.

Abstract

Objective

This study examined the time course of efficacy‐related endpoints for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) versus placebo in adults with protocol‐defined moderate to severe binge‐eating disorder (BED).

Methods

In two 12‐week, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled studies, adults meeting DSM‐IV‐TR BED criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or dose‐optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg). Analyses across visits used mixed‐effects models for repeated measures (binge eating days/week, binge eating episodes/week, Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating [Y‐BOCS‐BE] scores, percentage body weight change) and chi‐square tests (Clinical Global Impressions — Improvement [CGI‐I; from the perspective of BED symptoms] scale dichotomized as improved or not improved). These analyses were not part of the prespecified testing strategy, so reported p values are nominal (unadjusted and descriptive only).

Results

Least squares mean treatment differences for change from baseline in both studies favored LDX over placebo (all nominal p values < .001) starting at Week 1 for binge eating days/week, binge‐eating episodes/week, and percentage weight change and at the first posttreatment assessment (Week 4) for Y‐BOCS‐BE total and domain scores. On the CGI‐I, more participants on LDX than placebo were categorized as improved starting at Week 1 in both studies (both nominal p values < .001). Across these efficacy‐related endpoints, the superiority of LDX over placebo was maintained at each posttreatment assessment in both studies (all nominal p values < .001).

Discussion

In adults with BED, LDX treatment appeared to be associated with improvement on efficacy measures as early as 1 week, which was maintained throughout the 12‐week studies.

5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Exacerbation of Pre-existing Psychosis

CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder

CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode. Prior to initiating VYVANSE treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression).

New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms

CNS stimulants, at the recommended dosage, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing VYVANSE.

5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients.

In a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of VYVANSE in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years old with ADHD, there was a dose-related decrease in weight in the VYVANSE groups compared to weight gain in the placebo group. Additionally, in studies of another stimulant, there was slowing of the increase in height [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in VYVANSE-treated pediatric patients. Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. VYVANSE is not approved for use in pediatric patients below 6 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

14.1 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 12 Years with ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 1) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N = 290) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (either the combined type or the hyperactive-impulsive type). Patients were randomized to receive final doses of 30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules or placebo once daily in the morning for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), an 18-item questionnaire with a score range of 0–54 points that measures the core symptoms of ADHD which includes both hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive subscales. Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome. Mean effects at all doses were similar; however, the highest dose (70 mg/day) was numerically superior to both lower doses (Study 1 in Table 6). The effects were maintained throughout the day based on parent ratings (Conners' Parent Rating Scale) in the morning (approximately 10 am), afternoon (approximately 2 pm), and early evening (approximately 6 pm).

### Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^3c73ead2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 30, 50, and 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine dimesylate compared with placebo in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Following a 7- to 28-day washout, 420 adults aged 18 to 55 years with moderate to severe ADHD (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were treated with 30, 50, or 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine or placebo, respectively, for 4 weeks (N = 119, 117, 122, and 62, respectively). The 50- and 70- mg/day groups underwent forced-dose titration. The primary efficacy measure was the clinician-determined ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) total score. The study was conducted from May 2006 to November 2006.

Results

Treatment groups were well matched at baseline, including in ADHD-RS scores. At endpoint, changes in ADHD-RS scores were significantly greater for each lisdexamfetamine dose than for placebo (placebo = -8.2, 30 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -16.2, 50 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -17.4, 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = -18.6; all p < .0001 vs. placebo), with no differences between doses. Significant differences relative to placebo were observed in each lisdexamfetamine group, beginning at week 1 and for each week throughout. The percentage of subjects who improved (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale rating ≤ 2) was significantly greater for each lisdexamfetamine dose than for placebo at each week and at endpoint (placebo = 29%, 30 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 57%, 50 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 62%, 70 mg/day lisdexamfetamine = 61%; all p < .01). Adverse events were generally mild and included dry mouth, decreased appetite, and insomnia.

Conclusion

All 3 lisdexamfetamine doses were significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD, with improvements noted within 1 week. Lisdexamfetamine was generally well tolerated by these patients.

### Maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: randomized withdrawal design [^33247fbf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Adults (aged 18–55 years) who had ADHD meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria, baseline ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) with adult prompts total scores of < 22, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) ratings of 1, 2, or 3 were enrolled. After previously receiving commercially available lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) for ≥ 6 months with acceptable tolerability and maintaining response during a 3-week open-label phase at a stable lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose, the participants entered a 6-week double-blind randomized withdrawal phase on treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (same dose) or placebo. Data were collected from April 2009 to July 2010. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having symptom relapse (≥ 50% increase in ADHD-RS-IV score and ≥ 2 rating-point increase in CGI-S score).

Results

A total of 116 participants were randomized (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate n = 56; placebo n = 60). At the randomized withdrawal phase baseline, mean (SD) ADHD-RS-IV scores for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo were 10.6 (4.96) and 10.6 (4.82), respectively. At endpoint, 8.9% (5/56) of adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and 75.0% (45/60) taking placebo (P < .0001) showed symptom relapse; most showed relapse after 1 and 2 weeks of the randomized withdrawal phase (4 and 0 adults taking lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 26 and 10 taking placebo, respectively). During the randomized withdrawal phase, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 48.2% and 30.0% of participants in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events with incidence ≥ 5% in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and placebo groups were headache (14.3% and 5.0%), insomnia (5.4% and 5.0%), and upper respiratory tract infection (8.9% and 0%).

Conclusions

In adults with ADHD on medium- to long-term treatment, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate demonstrated maintenance of efficacy vs placebo upon randomized withdrawal. A majority of patients given placebo showed symptom relapse by 2 weeks. The safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was generally consistent with previous lisdexamfetamine dimesylate studies.

### Time course of the effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults with binge-eating disorder [^3e1fbdde]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Although medications other than LDX have been investigated for potential use as BED pharmacotherapy in double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials, LDX is the only medication currently approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe BED (Vyvanse ®, 2015). To our knowledge, this is the first publication describing time course analyses of treatment effects by week for the efficacy of a pharmacotherapy in individuals with BED. Based on available data from short‐term studies for other potential BED therapies, numerically greater reductions in binge eating frequency and body weight for active treatment versus placebo are generally observed within 1–4 weeks of starting treatment (Appolinario et al. 2003; Guerdjikova et al. 2012; Hudson et al. 1998; McElroy et al. 2003, 2000, 2007; Wilfley et al. 2008). In one study that reported statistical analysis of treatment effects prior to the end of the study, significantly greater reductions in binge eating days/week and weight for sibutramine versus placebo were reported at treatment Weeks 2 and 4, respectively (Appolinario et al. 2003).

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 17 Years: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled parallel-group, dose-optimization study (Study 5) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years (n = 336) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this eight-week study, patients were randomized to a daily morning dose of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules (30, 50 or 70 mg/day), an active control, or placebo (1:1:1). The study consisted of a Screening and Washout Period (up to 42 days), a 7-week Double-blind Evaluation Period (consisting of a 4-week Dose-Optimization Period followed by a 3-week Dose-Maintenance Period), and a 1-week Washout and Follow-up Period. During the Dose Optimization Period, subjects were titrated until an optimal dose, based on tolerability and investigator's judgment, was reached. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean reduction from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score was 18.6. Subjects on lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules also showed greater improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) rating scale compared to subjects on placebo (Study 5 in Table 6).

Absorption

Capsule formulation

Following single-dose oral administration of VYVANSE capsule (30 mg, 50 mg, or 70 mg) in patients ages 6 to 12 years with ADHD under fasted conditions, Tmaxof lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 3.5 hours post dose, respectively. Weight/Dose normalized AUC and Cmaxvalues were the same in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years as the adults following single doses of 30 mg to 70 mg VYVANSE capsule.

Effect of food on capsule formulation

Neither food (a high fat meal or yogurt) nor orange juice affects the observed AUC and Cmaxof dextroamphetamine in healthy adults after single-dose oral administration of 70 mg of VYVANSE capsules. Food prolongs Tmaxby approximately 1 hour (from 3.8 hours at fasted state to 4.7 hours after a high fat meal or to 4.2 hours with yogurt). After an 8-hour fast, the AUC for dextroamphetamine following oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in solution and as intact capsules were equivalent.

Chewable Tablet formulation

After a single dose administration of 60 mg VYVANSE chewable tablet in healthy subjects under fasted conditions, Tmaxof lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine was reached at approximately 1 hour and 4.4 hours post dose, respectively. Compared to 60 mg VYVANSE capsule, exposure (Cmaxand AUC) to lisdexamfetamine was about 15% lower. The exposure (Cmaxand AUCinf) of dextroamphetamine is similar between VYVANSE chewable tablet and VYVANSE capsule.

Effect of food on tablet formulation

Administration of 60 mg VYVANSE chewable tablet with food (a high-fat meal) decreases the exposure (Cmaxand AUCinf) of dextroamphetamine by about 5% to 7%, and prolongs mean Tmaxby approximately 1 hour (from 3.9 hours at fasted state to 4.9 hours).

Drug exposure

Final ESC or VXR doses at the end of the lead-in antidepressant phase in each treatment group are summarized in Table 1. All participants randomized to 10 and 30 mg LDX received those doses as the maximum dose during double-blind treatment. Four participants randomized to 50 mg LDX were down-titrated to 30 mg LDX; among participants randomized to 70 mg LDX, five were down-titrated to 50 mg LDX, and four were down-titrated to 30 mg LDX. The mean ± SD daily LDX dose was 9.7 ± 1.37 for 10 mg LDX, 29.4 ± 2.72 for 30 mg LDX, 42.9 ± 8.58 for 50 mg LDX, and 57.3 ± 12.19 for 70 mg LDX. The mean ± SD duration of exposure (in days) was 53.5 ± 10.30 for placebo, 53.8 ± 10.04 for 10 mg LDX, 52.2 ± 11.86 for 30 mg LDX, 53.9 ± 10.47 for 50 mg LDX, and 52.5 ± 11.14 for 70 mg LDX.

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and researchprograms/pregnancyregistry/adhd-medications/.

Risk Summary

The limited available data from published literature and postmarketing reports on use of VYVANSE in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature delivery and low birth weight, have been seen in infants born to mothers dependent on amphetamines [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (a prodrug of d-amphetamine) had no effects on embryo-fetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis. Pre- and postnatal studies were not conducted with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. However, amphetamine (d- to l- ratio of 3:1) administration to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation caused a decrease in pup survival and a decrease in pup body weight that correlated with a delay in developmental landmarks at clinically relevant doses of amphetamine. In addition, adverse effects on reproductive performance were observed in pups whose mothers were treated with amphetamine. Long-term neurochemical and behavioral effects have also been reported in animal developmental studies using clinically relevant doses of amphetamine [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Amphetamines, such as VYVANSE, cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion. In addition, amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions increasing the risk of premature delivery. Infants born to amphetamine-dependent mothers have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight.

Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal such as feeding difficulties, irritability, agitation, and excessive drowsiness.

### Human pharmacology of intravenous lisdexamfetamine dimesylate: abuse liability in adult stimulant abusers [^26249fb7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and abuse liability of single intravenous (i.v.) doses of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) and immediate-release d-amphetamine sulphate in adult stimulant abusers compared with placebo. Adult substance abusers were enrolled in this phase I, randomized, single-centre, double-blind study. An initial cohort of three subjects was enrolled to assess safety followed by a primary cohort that consisted of nine subjects. Single i.v. doses of LDX (25 or 50 mg), immediate-release d-amphetamine sulphate (10 or 20 mg) or placebo were administered at a minimum of 48-h intervals in a single-dose, three-way crossover design. 20 mg of d-amphetamine showed significantly increased abuse-related liking scores compared with placebo (P < 0.05), whereas the liking effects of 50 mg LDX did not significantly differ from placebo. The mean C(max) of d-amphetamine was 38.9 ± 8.1 and 105 ± 91.4 ng/ml after the administration of 50 mg LDX and 20 mg d-amphetamine respectively. The mean T(max) of d-amphetamine was 2.51 h after the administration of 50 mg LDX and 0.82 h after the administration of 20 mg d-amphetamine. LDX was well tolerated in this population. In contrast to d-amphetamine, LDX administered intravenously did not produce significant subjective abuse-related liking scores at assessed doses.

### Efficacy of lisdexamfetamine in adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder: a randomized clinical trial [^03c29133]. JAMA Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The ability of pharmacotherapies to prevent relapse and maintain efficacy with long-term treatment in psychiatric conditions is important.

Objective

To assess lisdexamfetamine dimesylate maintenance of efficacy in adults with moderate to severe binge-eating disorder.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multinational, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study including 418 participants was conducted at 49 clinical research study sites from January 27, 2014, to April 8, 2015. Eligible adults met DSM-IV-R binge-eating disorder criteria and had moderate to severe binge eating disorder (≥ 3 binge-eating days per week for 14 days before open-label baseline; Clinical Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] scores ≥ 4 [moderate severity] at screening and open-label baseline). Following a 12-week, open-label phase (dose optimization, 4 weeks [lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, 50 or 70 mg]; dose maintenance, 8 weeks), lisdexamfetamine responders (≤ 1 binge eating day per week for 4 consecutive weeks and CGI-S scores ≤ 2 at week 12) were randomized to placebo or continued lisdexamfetamine during a 26-week, double-blind, randomized withdrawal phase.

Interventions

Lisdexamfetamine administration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome variable, time to relapse (≥ 2 binge-eating days per week for 2 consecutive weeks and ≥ 2-point CGI-S score increases from randomized withdrawal baseline), was analyzed using a log-rank test (primary analysis); the analysis was stratified for dichotomized 4-week cessation status. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events.

Results

Of the 418 participants enrolled in the open-label phase of the study, 411 (358 [87.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 38.3 [10.4] years) were included in the safety analysis set. Of 275 randomized lisdexamfetamine responders (placebo, n = 138; lisdexamfetamine, n = 137), the observed proportions of participants meeting relapse criteria were 3.7% (5 of 136) for lisdexamfetamine and 32.1% (42 of 131) for placebo. Lisdexamfetamine demonstrated superiority over placebo on the log-rank test (χ21, 40.37; P < .001) for time to relapse; the hazard ratio, based on a Cox proportional hazards model for lisdexamfetamine vs placebo, was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.04–0.23). The treatment-emergent adverse events observed were generally consistent with the known profile of lisdexamfetamine.

Conclusions and Relevance

Risk of binge-eating relapse over 6 months was lower in participants continuing lisdexamfetamine than in those randomized to placebo. The hazard for relapse was lower with lisdexamfetamine than placebo.

3.2.1 Binge eating days/week and binge‐eating episodes/week

The baseline mean ± SD numbers of binge eating days/week and binge‐eating episodes/week, respectively, were 4.60 ± 1.210 and 5.96 ± 2.551 with placebo and 4.79 ± 1.271 and 6.42 ± 2.962 with LDX in Study 1 and 4.82 ± 1.422 and 6.62 ± 3.797 with placebo and 4.66 ± 1.273 and 6.40 ± 3.463 with LDX in Study 2. The mean ± SD numbers of binge eating days/week (Figure 1 A, B) and binge eating episodes/week (Figure 1 C, D) decreased with placebo and LDX from Week 1 through Weeks 11–12 in both studies. For binge eating days/week, LS mean (95% CI) treatment differences favored LDX from Week 1 through Weeks 9–10 (all nominal p values < .001; all ES ≥ .57) and at Weeks 11–12 (both p values < .001; both ES ≥ .83) in both studies (Supporting Information Table 1).

### The efficacy and safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, a prodrug of D-amphetamine, for the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adults [^3b84ba44]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a once-daily medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (aged 6–12 years) and adults.

Objective

This article reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of LDX.

Methods

Studies, abstracts, reviews, and consensus statements published in English were identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1977-August 2008) using search headings lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, NRP 104, NRP104-201, NRP104-301, NRP104-302, NRP104-303, and stimulant. Selected information provided by the manufacturer of LDX was included, as were all pertinent clinical trials. The reference lists of identified articles were also searched for pertinent information. Relevant abstracts presented at annual professional meetings were included as well.

Results

Several studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of LDX in pediatric patients (6–12 years of age) and healthy adults with ADHD. LDX, a prodrug that is therapeutically inactive until metabolized in the body to dextroamphetamine (d-amphetamine), follows linear pharmacokinetics at therapeutic doses (30–70 mg). The efficacy of LDX in the treatment of ADHD was established on the basis of 1 long-term and 2 short-term controlled clinical trials in children who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, criteria for ADHD (either the combined or the hyperactive-impulsive subtype) and in 1 clinical trial with adults with ADHD. The efficacy trials in children found significant improvements in scores on the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham deportment sub-scales, the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (Attempted and Correct), and the ADHD Rating Scale Version IV (ADHD-RS-IV) compared with placebo (all, P < 0.001). In the clinical studies designed to measure duration of effect, LDX, compared with placebo, provided efficacy for a full treatment day, up through and including 6 PM, based on parent ratings (Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Short Form) in the morning, afternoon, and early evening (all, P < 0.001). Data from a long-term, open-label extension study that assessed the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LDX for up to 12 months found LDX treatment resulted in significant improvement (> 60%) from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV at end point (P < 0.001), with good tolerability. The trial in adults found significant improvements in ADHD-RS scores at end point in patients receiving LDX (30,50, and 70 mg) (P < 0.001 for all active doses); significant improvements in ADHD-RS (using adult prompts) scores were observed at each postbaseline weekly assessment, with improvements noted within the first week in all active treatment arms. Results from human abuse liability studies noted that LDX had lower abuse-related drug-liking scores compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine at equivalent doses. The most common adverse events reported with LDX were typical of amphetamine products and included decreased appetite, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, headache, irritability, weight loss, and nausea.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the efficacy and tolerability of LDX as a treatment option for the management of children (aged 6–12 years) and adults with ADHD. As such, LDX may be an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that can include other measures such as psychological, educational, and social interventions.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^449146ad]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Stimulants have long been considered possible treatment options for MDD, in part because of the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of depression and its associated symptoms, such as anhedonia and lethargy. Methylphenidate was first investigated for the treatment of MDD as early as the 1950s. In addition, meta-analyses identified multiple trials from 2003 onward that investigated stimulants or modafinil as adjuncts for antidepressants.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), a d-amphetamine pro-drug, is approved in the USA and in other countries for use in individuals aged six years and older with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder in the USA and Canada (Vyvanse ® Product Monograph; Vyvanse ® Product Monograph). The effects of LDX augmentation therapy on depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD have been examined in two small phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept studies and in two large phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In the first phase 2 study, LDX augmentation of escitalopram oxalate (ESC) monotherapy met predefined signal-detection criteria (prespecified critical α = 0.10) for significant reductions in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score versus placebo in patients whose depression had not remitted with escitalopram monotherapy. The second phase 2 study focused on executive dysfunction in participants with partially to fully remitted MDD (MADRS total score ≤ 18) and found that LDX augmentation of SSRI monotherapy produced significant MADRS total score reductions versus placebo. In contrast, LDX augmentation was not superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD exhibiting inadequate responses to antidepressant monotherapy in either of the phase 3 studies.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^02601c49]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The null hypothesis was that the mean LDX response at each dose was the same as the placebo response. Dose-response curves were tested using appropriate contrast t statistics. If at least one candidate dose-response relationship reached a two-sided significance value of 0.10, proof of an LDX dose-response would be considered to have been established. Dose-response models included sex and antidepressant type as explanatory categorical variables; augmentation baseline MADRS total score or vital signs were included as explanatory continuous variables for their respective analyses.

Sample size was determined based on estimates of a 40% screening failure rate, 25% withdrawal from the antidepressant lead-in phase, 50% attrition due to participants not meeting randomization criteria, and 20% withdrawal of randomized participants during double-blind augmentation. Therefore, an estimated 1890 screened individuals were expected to yield 1134 enrolled participants, of which 425 (85 per treatment arm) would be randomized and 340 (68 per treatment arm) would complete the study. Assuming a mean ± standard deviation (SD) maximum effect of 3.0 ± 8.1 for MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline for each candidate dose-response curve, 68 participants per treatment arm would provide 80% power. Similarly, assuming mean ± SD peak responses of 7 ± 10 mm Hg, 5 ± 10 mm Hg, and 10 ± 10 bpm for SBP, DBP, and pulse, respectively, the power for identifying a dose-response relationships was approximately > 95% for SBP and pulse and 62% for DBP. Due to a lower than anticipated drop-out rate, the number of randomized participants needed to obtain the necessary number of study completers was lower than expected. As a result, adequate statistical power was maintained when a lower number of participants were randomized.

Pediatric Patients Ages 6 to 17 Years: Short-Term Treatment in ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled parallel-group, dose-optimization study (Study 5) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years (n = 336) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this eight-week study, patients were randomized to a daily morning dose of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30, 50 or 70 mg/day), an active control, or placebo (1:1:1). The study consisted of a Screening and Washout Period (up to 42 days), a 7-week Double-blind Evaluation Period (consisting of a 4-week Dose-Optimization Period followed by a 3-week Dose-Maintenance Period), and a 1-week Washout and Follow-up Period. During the Dose Optimization Period, subjects were titrated until an optimal dose, based on tolerability and investigator's judgment, was reached. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate showed significantly greater efficacy than placebo. The placebo-adjusted mean reduction from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score was 18.6. Subjects on lisdexamfetamine dimesylate also showed greater improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) rating scale compared to subjects on placebo (Study 5 in Table 6).

### Pharmacokinetics of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and its active metabolite, D-amphetamine, with increasing oral doses of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, crossover study [^a1194a35]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is a long-acting oral prodrug stimulant indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children 6 to 12 years old and in adults. Information on the pharmacokinetic profile of LDX in children with ADHD is lacking.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of d-amphetamine delivery from LDX, and intact LDX with increasing doses of LDX administered in children with ADHD.

Methods

This single-dose, randomized, open-label, 3-period crossover study was conducted in children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD symptoms that adversely affected school performance and required a medication switch. Eligible patients had prior stimulant experience, with good tolerability. Patients were administered a single oral dose of LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg in a randomized sequence. Each study period was separated by a 6-day washout. The pharmacokinetic properties of d-amphetamine and intact LDX were calculated over 48 hours. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed using physical examination, including vital sign measurements, and ECG.

Results

The study enrolled 18 children (mean [SD] age, 9.6 [1.9] years [range, 6–12 years]; 56% boys; weight, 36.0 [7.6] kg; 44% white, 44% black). Mean (%CV) C(max) values of d-amphetamine postdose were 53.2 (18.1), 93.3 (19.5), and 134.0 (19.4) ng/mL with LDX 30, 50, and 70 mg, respectively (T(max), approximately 3.5 hours). These findings suggest that the overall AUC for d-amphetamine was dose proportional. The intact LDX AUC was 10% to 20% higher in girls than in boys, and for d-amphetamine was < 10% higher. The most commonly reported AEs, of 17 total cases, with 30-, 50-, and 70-mg LDX were anorexia (4 [22%], 7 [41%], and 8 [47%], respectively), elevated blood pressure (2 [11%], 1 [6%], and 3 [18%]), and abdominal pain (2 [11%], 2 [12%], and 2 [12%]). All AEs were mild or moderate. No serious AEs were reported. One child was withdrawn from the analysis because of pharyngitis considered to be unrelated to LDX use.

Conclusion

The findings from this study in a small, select population of children with ADHD suggest that the concentrations of d-amphetamine, the active metabolite of LDX, after single-dose administration of LDX at increasing doses appeared to be dose proportional and had low interpatient variability.

### Prediction of placebo response in 2 clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for the treatment of ADHD [^8b20b396]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To search for predictors of placebo response in clinical trials of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for the treatment of DSM-IV-TR-defined attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults.

Method

We used data from 2 clinical trials: (1) a 4-week, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, forced-dose, parallel-group study of children aged 6 to 12 years with ADHD (n = 290) and (2) a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, forced-dose titration study in adult subjects, aged 18–55 years with ADHD (n = 420). Response and remission were defined using the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale.

Results

Symptom remission was inversely correlated with baseline severity in both children and adults (P < .001), with less robust effects seen for response. The time to response and remission was delayed in adult subjects prescribed placebo versus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, while response time in children was also significantly slower with placebo versus lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (P < .01). We found little evidence that demographic factors, prior pharmacotherapy, the emergence of adverse events during the trial, or changes in ADHD symptoms from the screening to baseline assessments predicted placebo response. Certain comorbid medical symptoms reduced the response and remission rates to placebo in children (P < .001) and adults (P < .001).

Conclusions

In both children and adults, baseline symptom severity was the most consistent predictor of remission with placebo while the temporal profile of response reliably differentiated placebo from medication responders. Placebo effects are most likely to be minimized in shorter trials enrolling more severely impaired subjects. The impact of medical and psychiatric comorbidities on placebo response merits further investigation.

### Short-term effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate on cardiovascular parameters in a 4-week clinical trial in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^6a2c95f5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the short-term impact of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate on cardiovascular parameters in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Medically healthy adults (18–55 years of age) with DSM-IV-TR-defined ADHD were randomly assigned to placebo or 30, 50, or 70 mg/d of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for 4 weeks between May and November 2006. Electrocardiograms, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse were assessed pretreatment and weekly thereafter.

Results

There were no significant differences for mean systolic or diastolic blood pressure in any lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose group versus placebo. Changes in pulse from baseline to endpoint were 0.0, 2.8, 4.2, and 5.2 bpm in the placebo and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate 30, 50, and 70 mg/d groups, respectively (P < .05, all lisdexamfetamine dimesylate groups vs placebo). Post hoc pulse outliers (pulse ≥ 100 bpm; any 1 event) ranged from 3.3% to 8.5% of subjects in the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate groups, and no subjects in the placebo group were pulse outliers (P < .05 for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate 50 mg vs placebo only). There were no clinically meaningful electrocardiogram abnormalities. Overall, 8.3% (35/420; safety population) of subjects had treatment-emergent cardiovascular adverse events, and 1.7% (7/420) withdrew from the study because of cardiovascular complaints. Cardiovascular adverse events with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in these medically healthy adults were generally mild to moderate in severity.

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate had limited short-term effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram parameters that were of minimal clinical concern. These findings support the relative safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. However, considering the potential of outliers, it is advisable to monitor cardiovascular parameters in stimulant-treated patients. Interpretation of these findings is limited to patients with no preexisting cardiac conditions who are taking their medication as prescribed.

3.2.1.1.1 1‐Week binge eating response (percentage reductions in binge‐eating episodes/week)

The 1‐week binge eating response distributions differed between LDX and placebo in both studies from Week 1 through Week 12 (all χ 2 statistics ≥ 16.66 based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests; degrees of freedom = 1; all nominal p values < .001; all Cramer's Vs ≥ .28) and at Week 12/ET (both χ 2 statistics ≥ 43.82 based on Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests; degrees of freedom = 1; both nominal p values < .001; both Cramer's Vs ≥ .40). The percentages of participants exhibiting binge eating episode reductions of 100% and 99% to 75% in the last 7 days were numerically greater with LDX than placebo from Week 1 to Week 12 in both studies (Figure 3 A, B).

### Lisdexamfetamine (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) [^ff482a33]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A second double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover design, analog classroom study (Study 3) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N = 129) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD (either the combined type or the hyperactive-impulsive type). Following a 4-week open-label dose optimization with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg), patients were randomly assigned to continue their optimized dose of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate or placebo once daily in the morning for 1 week each treatment. A significant difference in patient behavior, based upon the average of investigator ratings on the SKAMP-Deportment scores across all 7 assessments conducted at 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.0, and 13.0 hours post-dose, were observed between patients when they received lisdexamfetamine dimesylate compared to patients when they received placebo (Study 3 in Table 6, Figure 4).

Pediatric Patients Ages 13 to 17 Years with ADHD

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (Study 4) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 13 to 17 years (N = 314) who met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. In this study, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to a daily morning dose of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30 mg/day, 50 mg/day or 70 mg/day) or placebo for a total of four weeks of treatment. All patients receiving lisdexamfetamine dimesylate were initiated on 30 mg for the first week of treatment. Patients assigned to the 50 mg and 70 mg dose groups were titrated by 20 mg per week until they achieved their assigned dose. The primary efficacy outcome was change in Total Score from baseline to endpoint in investigator ratings on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). Endpoint was defined as the last post-randomization treatment week (i.e. Weeks 1 through 4) for which a valid score was obtained. All lisdexamfetamine dimesylate dose groups were superior to placebo in the primary efficacy outcome (Study 4 in Table 6).

MCP-Mod vital signs analyses

Statistically significant dose-response relationships between LDX dose and change from augmentation baseline in SBP, DBP, and pulse were observed (Table 2, Figure 4). All three vital sign parameters tended to increase as LDX dose increased; a linear relationship provided the best fit of the data.

Descriptive safety and tolerability analyses

Greater percentages of participants randomized to LDX than to placebo reported TEAEs (Table 4); most TEAEs in each treatment group were mild or moderate in severity. The most frequently reported TEAEs with LDX (reported by ⩾5% of participants and at twice the rate of placebo for any one LDX dose) are summarized in Table 4.

Table 4.
Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), safety analysis set.

Severe TEAEs were reported in 18 participants randomized to LDX, with the frequency of severe TEAEs being higher with 70 mg LDX than all other LDX doses. There was no apparent dose response observed for any specific severe TEAE. Severe TEAEs reported by ⩾2 participants were insomnia (n = 4; one for each LDX dose), anxiety (n = 1 each with 30 and 50 mg), and lethargy and nephrolithiasis (n = 1 each with 50 and 70 mg LDX). TEAEs led to discontinuation in five participants randomized to LDX (vomiting, n = 1 with 30 mg LDX; blood pressure increased, n = 1 each with 50 and 70 mg LDX; suicidal ideation and tachyphrenia (i.e. racing thoughts), n = 1 each with 70 mg). There were no deaths during the trial. One serious treatment-emergent AE was reported. A case of cholecystitis was reported by a participant in the 70 mg LDX group. It occurred on day 29 of the double-blind augmentation phase (onset dose, 70 mg), resolved three days after onset, and was considered by the investigator not to be related to the study medication.

Discussion

In this phase 2 dose-ranging study, LDX augmentation of ESC or VXR was not statistically superior to placebo augmentation in adults with MDD who exhibited inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy, and no dose-response relationship for efficacy was identified. In contrast, changes in SBP, DBP, and pulse from augmentation baseline to week 16/ET exhibited significant dose-response relationships across the dose range studied. All vital sign endpoints tended to increase as LDX dose increased, with a linear relationship providing the best fit.

The lack of efficacy in the current study is consistent with the published literature describing the effects of stimulant augmentation for MDD in general and with the phase 3 studies of LDX augmentation for MDD. Although individual studies provided some support for the efficacy of stimulant augmentation versus placebo for some aspects of depressive symptomatology, the weight of evidence based on meta-analyses suggests there is limited evidence for additional clinical benefit with stimulant augmentation of antidepressant monotherapy. Although these results are not consistent with previously reported findings of the phase 2 clinical trials of LDX augmentation in adults with MDD, it is important to note that these studies differed in important ways. This phase 2 study, and the published phase 3 studies, required that participants have MADRS total scores ⩾18 at augmentation baseline and MADRS total score reductions < 50% from the antidepressant lead-in baseline to augmentation baseline. In contrast, the previously published phase 2 studies had different inclusion criteria, using participants with 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores ⩾4 or with executive dysfunction and MADRS total scores ≤ 18. Additionally, one of the phase 2 studies used predefined signal-detection criteria with a critical α of 0.10. The aforementioned two studies were also small proof-of-concept studies, which makes comparisons to the present larger dose-finding study difficult. It has been suggested that using small, underpowered proof-of-concept studies in the design of larger, randomized clinical trials may be problematic because small studies may provide inaccurate effect size estimates.

Mean ECG changes from augmentation baseline were generally small, except for the RR interval, which decreased more with LDX (10 mg, −27.2 ± 97.80 ms; 30 mg, −56.6 ± 92.22 ms; 50 mg, −65.1 ± 92.76 ms; 70 mg, −56.6 ± 130.13 ms) than with placebo (−6.7 ± 117.88 ms). No participant in any treatment group had a shift from a normal ECG at augmentation baseline to a clinically significant ECG at week 16/ET. Mean changes from augmentation baseline week 16/ET for clinical laboratory parameters were generally small in magnitude, similar between placebo and LDX, and not considered clinically meaningful.

During double-blind augmentation, ⩾1 positive suicidal ideation occurred in 11 (14.1%) participants in the placebo group and 30 (9.6%) participants across LDX groups (10 mg, seven (9.1%); 30 mg, six (7.9%); 50 mg, eight (10.3%); 70 mg, nine (11.3%)). No suicidal attempts were reported with placebo during double-blind augmentation; one (0.3%) suicide attempt was reported in a participant from the 70 mg LDX treatment group.

TEAEs of special interest (defined as aggression and violent behavior; psychosis/mania; suicidal ideation and behavior; and weight-related, clinical laboratory, or vital sign AEs) were reported by seven participants (9.0%) randomized to placebo and 77 (24.8%) randomized to LDX. TEAEs of special interest showed a dose-response relationship for LDX, with the frequency being lower with 10 mg LDX (15 (19.5%)) and 30 mg LDX (13 (17.1%)) than with 50 mg LDX (19 (24.4%)) and 70 mg LDX (30 (37.5%)). There were no instances of psychosis/mania. There was one suicidal ideation (nonlethal) in a male participant (onset at 10 mg LDX; considered related to study drug) and one instance of aggression event in a female participant (onset at 30 mg; not considered related to study drug); both participants had been randomized to 70 mg LDX. Non-psychiatric TEAEs of special interest for which an apparent dose response was observed were increased blood pressure (10 mg, one (1.3%); 30 mg, none; 50 mg, three (3.8%); 70 mg, four (5.0%)) and decreased weight (10 mg, none; 30 mg, none; 50 mg, one (1.3%); 70 mg, three (3.8%)).

Table 5 summarizes vital sign and physical examination changes from augmentation baseline at week 16/ET for the safety analysis population. At week 16/ET, mean increases in SBP and DBP were observed with all LDX doses except the 30 mg dose, whereas decreases were observed with placebo; mean pulse increased more with all LDX doses than with placebo.

2.2 Participants

Participant inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously (McElroy et al. 2015a). Eligible adults (aged 18–55 years) met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM‐IV‐TR) criteria for BED and had protocol‐defined moderate to severe BED (defined as having ≥ 3 binge eating days/week for 14 days before baseline and Clinical Global Impressions — Severity scores [from the perspective of binge eating symptoms] at screening and baseline of ≥ 4). Key exclusion criteria included current anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa; comorbid current psychiatric disorders either controlled with prohibited medications or uncontrolled and associated with significant symptoms or any condition that could confound study assessments; lifetime history of psychosis, mania, hypomania, dementia, or ADHD; a Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score ≥ 18 at screening; psychotherapy or weight loss support for BED within 3 months of screening; being considered a suicide risk in the opinion of the investigator, having a previous suicide attempt, or currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation; history of cardiovascular disorders or moderate or severe hypertension; and lifetime history of stimulant abuse, recent history of substance abuse or dependence, or known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to LDX or related compounds.

Statistical methods and sample size

Dose-response relationships for the primary efficacy endpoint (change in MADRS total score from augmentation baseline to week 16/ET) and for vital signs (SBP, DBP, and pulse) were assessed using the multiple comparisons procedure with modeling (MCP-Mod) approach. Briefly, the MCP-Mod technique starts with a set of pre-specified candidate dose-response curves and uses a multiple-comparisons technique to test whether any of these curves fit the data significantly better than does a flat line (indicative of no dose response). If at least one of the pre-specified candidate models is significant, then this is indicative of a dose response. Any significant curves are then used to develop inferences on adequate treatment doses and for estimating the minimum effective dose. This method has been adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency as an efficient statistical methodology for the analysis of phase 2 dose-finding studies under dose-response uncertainty. The pre-specified dose-response curves tested for MADRS total score change (Emax, logistic, linear, and betaMod) are depicted in Figure 2; dose-response curves tested for vital signs were Emax, exponential, linear, logistic 1, logistic 2. Placebo was considered 0 mg LDX.

Figure 2.
Prespecified candidate dose-response curves used for multiple comparisons procedure with modeling (MCP-Mod) assessment of Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score.

The MADRS dose-response was assessed in the dose-response evaluable set (DRES), which included all randomized participants having ⩾1 primary efficacy assessment during the dose-maintenance portion of double-blind treatment (i.e. after the three-week forced-titration phase). The most recent MADRS score was carried forward for missing scores during the dose-maintenance phase. As such, a last observation carried forward analysis was effectively performed for the primary analysis. The results of the primary analysis, which used the dose-response evaluable set, were verified in the full analysis set using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) as a sensitivity analysis. Vital sign dose-responses were assessed based on the average of the three repeated vital sign measurements per visit in the vital signs evaluable set, which included all randomized participants having ⩾1 vital sign measurement during the dose-maintenance portion of double-blind treatment.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder who report clinically significant impairment in executive function: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^a5ca9ed9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Behavioral rating scales that assess impairments in executive function commonly associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may offer advantages over neuropsychological testing. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for executive function deficits in adults with ADHD and clinically significant executive function impairment using self-reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version (BRIEF-A) assessments.

Method

This randomized double-blind study, conducted between May 2010 and November 2010, screened at least 1 participant at 35 of 39 registered US clinical research sites. Adults (aged 18–55 years) with a primary ADHD diagnosis (meeting full DSM-IV-TR criteria) and executive function deficits (assessed by baseline BRIEF-A Global Executive Composite [GEC] T-scores of at least 65) were randomized to treatment with optimized lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (30 mg/d, 50 mg/d, or 70 mg/d; n = 80) or placebo (n = 81) during a 10-week double-blind treatment period. Outcome measures included the BRIEF-A scales (GEC, index, and clinical subscales).

Results

At week 10 or at early termination, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was associated with significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean BRIEF-A GEC T-scores than placebo (effect size, 0.74; P < .0001) and significantly greater reductions from baseline in mean T-scores for both BRIEF-A index scales (Behavioral Regulation Index and Metacognition Index) and all 9 clinical subscales (P ≤ .0056 for all). At week 10 or at early termination, mean T-scores for BRIEF-A indexes and clinical subscales were below levels of clinically significant executive function deficits (ie, < 65) with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment. The mean (SD) GEC T-score was 57.2 (14.11) for the lisdexamfetamine dimesylate group and 68.3 (17.12) for the placebo group. The safety profile of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was consistent with other long-acting psychostimulants.

Conclusion

Among adults with ADHD and clinically significant executive function deficits, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was associated with significant improvements in self-reported executive function ratings.

### Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) [^aefecbf2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effect of food on capsule formulation

Neither food (a high fat meal or yogurt) nor orange juice affects the observed AUC and Cmaxof dextroamphetamine in healthy adults after single-dose oral administration of 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules. Food prolongs Tmaxby approximately 1 hour (from 3.8 hours at fasted state to 4.7 hours after a high fat meal or to 4.2 hours with yogurt). After an 8-hour fast, the AUC for dextroamphetamine following oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in solution and as intact capsules were equivalent.

Elimination

Plasma concentrations of unconverted lisdexamfetamine are low and transient, generally becoming non-quantifiable by 8 hours after administration. The plasma elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine typically averaged less than one hour in volunteers ages 6 years and older. The plasma elimination half-life of dextroamphetamine was approximately 8.6 to 9.5 hours in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years and 10 to 11.3 hours in healthy adults.

Metabolism

Lisdexamfetamine is converted to dextroamphetamine and l-lysine primarily in blood due to the hydrolytic activity of red blood cells after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. In vitro data demonstrated that red blood cells have a high capacity for metabolism of lisdexamfetamine; substantial hydrolysis occurred even at low hematocrit levels (33% of normal). Lisdexamfetamine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

### Use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in treatment of executive functioning deficits and chronic fatigue syndrome: a double blind, placebo-controlled study [^e772f212]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) for the treatment of executive functioning deficits in adults (ages 18–60) with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The study's primary outcome measure was the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult (BRIEF-A). Secondary outcome measures were standardized assessments of fatigue, pain and global functioning. Twenty-six adults who met criteria for CFS and had clinically significant executive functioning deficits were randomly assigned to a flexible morning dose (30, 50, 70 mg/day) of either placebo or LDX for a 6-week trial. The data were analyzed with standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures. Participants in the LDX group showed significantly more positive change in BRIEF-A scores (Mchange = 21.38, SD = 15.85) than those in the placebo group (Mchange = 3.36, SD = 7.26). Participants in the active group also reported significantly less fatigue and generalized pain relative to the placebo group. Although future studies with LDX should examine whether these benefits generalize to larger, more diverse samples of patients, these results suggest that LDX could be a safe and efficacious treatment for the executive functioning deficits often associated with CFS. The possibility that dopaminergic medications could play an important role addressing the symptoms of CFS is also discussed.

In addition to MCP-Mod analyses, inferential and descriptive analyses were conducted. MADRS total score change from augmentation baseline was analyzed in the DRES and the full-analysis set (FAS; all participants who took ⩾1 randomized study drug dose, had ⩾1 postaugmentation safety assessment, and had ⩾1 valid postaugmentation MADRS total score assessment) with MMRM using both double-blind augmentation phases. All MADRS data from the double-blind augmentation phase, including those taken after LDX down-titration, were included in the FAS analysis; DRES analyses did not include MADRS data collected after down-titration. Analyses were performed with treatment group, sex, antidepressant type, visit, and the interaction between treatment group and visit as fixed factors and augmentation baseline MADRS total score as a covariate; analyses also adjusted for the interaction between augmentation baseline score and visit. Least squares (LS) mean changes from augmentation baseline on the MADRS total score were calculated for each treatment group at each visit during the double-blind augmentation phase; treatment differences were estimated with two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

Safety and tolerability endpoints were assessed using descriptive statistics in the safety analysis set (all participants who took ⩾1 randomized study drug dose and had ⩾1 postaugmentation safety assessment).

### Abuse liability and safety of oral lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in individuals with a history of stimulant abuse [^3054327c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is the first prodrug stimulant and is indicated for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study evaluated the abuse potential of single oral doses of 50, 100 (equivalent to 40 mg d-amphetamine), and 150 mg LDX, 40 mg d-amphetamine and 200 mg diethylpropion in 36 individuals with a history of stimulant abuse. On the primary abuse liability measure, maximum change of the Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject Liking Scale compared with placebo, d-amphetamine and diethylpropion showed significant differences of 4.5 and 4.0 units, respectively (P < 0.001 for both vs placebo). LDX, administered at 50, 100 and 150 mg, showed nonsignificant differences of 2.0 and 2.1 units, respectively, at the two lower doses but a significant (P < 0.001 vs placebo) difference of 6.1 units at the highest dose. Subjects significantly favoured d-amphetamine 40 mg versus LDX 100 mg (2.4 units difference; P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in liking scores between d-amphetamine 40 mg and LDX 150 mg. Drug Rating Questionnaire-Subject Feel-Drug-Effect score was significantly lower for 100 mg LDX than for 40 mg d-amphetamine. There were no statistically significant differences between LDX and diethylpropion hydrochloride, a Schedule IV amphetamine-like stimulant, on abuse-related liking scores. Cardiovascular responses of LDX and d-amphetamine were similar at equivalent doses. In conclusion, at an equivalent amount of amphetamine base taken orally, LDX 100 mg had attenuated responses on measures of abuse liability compared with immediate-release d-amphetamine 40 mg. Abuse-related liking scores of LDX at a dose corresponding to a 50% higher amphetamine base (LDX 150 mg) were similar to d-amphetamine 40 mg.

Efficacy

The primary efficacy endpoint was change in MADRS total score from augmentation baseline at week 16 or early termination (ET), with assessments determined by central raters who were experienced clinicians and who were blinded to study visit and entry criteria. The central raters were trained on administration of the MADRS and were continuously calibrated to maintain the fidelity of ratings.

Exploratory efficacy endpoints included the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a validated measure of functional impairments in work, family, and social life, and the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), a validated measure of general health and quality of life. On the SDS (assessed at lead-in and augmentation baseline and weeks 10, 12, 14, and 16/ET in randomized participants), participants rated the impact of their illness on work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities using an 11-point scale (0 (no impairment) to 10 (most severe)); total scores range from 0–30. On EQ-5D-5L (assessed at lead-in and augmentation baseline and week 16/ET in randomized participants), participants designated their overall health status on a visual analog scale from 0 ("worst imaginable health status") to 100 ("best imaginable health status").

### A feasibility study evaluating lisdexamfetamine dimesylate for the treatment of adults with bulimia nervosa [^1254bf27]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study examined the feasibility, safety, and potential efficacy of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) as a treatment for adults with bulimia nervosa (BN).

Method

An open-label 8-week feasibility study was conducted in participants with BN. Enrollment rate, dropout rate, safety outcomes, and eating disorder symptom change were examined.

Results

Eighteen of 23 participants completed the study per protocol. There was no participant-initiated dropout due to adverse drug reactions and no severe and unexpected adverse drug reactions. An average increase in heart rate of 12.1 beats/min was observed. There was a mean weight reduction of 2.1 kg and one participant was withdrawn for clinically significant weight loss. In the intent-to-treat sample, there were reductions in objective binge episodes and compensatory behaviors from Baseline to Post/End-of-Treatment (mean difference = -29.83, 95% confidence interval: -43.38 to -16.27; and mean difference = -33.78, 95% confidence interval: -48.74 to -18.82, respectively).

Discussion

Results of this study indicate that a randomized controlled trial would be feasible with close monitoring of certain safety parameters (especially over a longer time period as long-term safety is unknown). However, the results should not be used as evidence for clinicians to prescribe LDX to individuals with BN before its efficacy and safety are properly tested.

Trial Registration Number

### Maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: randomized-withdrawal study design [^b950d054]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

In this phase 3 extension study, the long-term maintenance of efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was evaluated using a randomized-withdrawal study design.

Method

European and US patients (6–17 years; N = 276) with ADHD were entered into a 26-week open-label trial of LDX treatment. Those who completed the open-label period (n = 157) were randomized 1:1 to their optimized dose of LDX (30, 50, or 70 mg per day) or placebo for a 6-week randomized-withdrawal period (RWP). The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients meeting treatment failure criteria (≥ 50% increase in ADHD Rating Scale IV total score and ≥ 2-point increase in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness [CGI-S] score, compared with RWP start point). Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

Results

During the RWP (LDX, n = 78; placebo, n = 79), significantly fewer patients receiving LDX met treatment failure criteria (15.8%) compared with those receiving placebo (67.5%; difference = -51.7%; 95% confidence interval = -65.0, -38.5; p < .001). Most treatment failures occurred at or before the week 2 visit after randomization. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 39.7% and 25.3% of patients receiving LDX and placebo, respectively, during the RWP.

Conclusions

These data demonstrate the maintenance of efficacy of LDX during long-term treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. The rapid return of symptoms on LDX withdrawal demonstrates the need for continuing treatment. The safety profile of LDX was consistent with that of other stimulants.

Effect of food on capsule formulation

Neither food (a high fat meal or yogurt) nor orange juice affects the observed AUC and Cmaxof dextroamphetamine in healthy adults after single-dose oral administration of 70 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules. Food prolongs Tmax by approximately 1 hour (from 3.8 hours at fasted state to 4.7 hours after a high fat meal or to 4.2 hours with yogurt). After an 8-hour fast, the AUC for dextroamphetamine following oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in solution and as intact capsules were equivalent.

Elimination

Plasma concentrations of unconverted lisdexamfetamine are low and transient, generally becoming non-quantifiable by 8 hours after administration. The plasma elimination half-life of lisdexamfetamine typically averaged less than one hour in volunteers ages 6 years and older. The plasma elimination half-life of dextroamphetamine was approximately 8.6 to 9.5 hours in pediatric patients 6 to 12 years and 10 to 11.3 hours in healthy adults.

Metabolism

Lisdexamfetamine is converted to dextroamphetamine and l-lysine primarily in blood due to the hydrolytic activity of red blood cells after oral administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. In vitro data demonstrated that red blood cells have a high capacity for metabolism of lisdexamfetamine; substantial hydrolysis occurred even at low hematocrit levels (33% of normal). Lisdexamfetamine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

### The effects of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate on eating behaviour and homeostatic, reward and cognitive processes in women with binge-eating symptoms: an experimental medicine study [^8d918b19]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is the only drug currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Binge-Eating Disorder (BED), but little is known about the behavioural mechanisms that underpin the efficacy of LDX in treating BED. We examined the behavioural and neural effects of an acute dose of LDX (50mg) in 22 women with binge-eating symptomatology using a randomised, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled experimental medicine design. LDX reduced self-reported appetite ratings and intake of both a pasta meal and a palatable cookie snack. LDX also decreased the eating rate of pasta but not of cookies and reduced self-reported liking ratings for pasta at the end of the meal. When viewing food pictures during an fMRI scan, LDX reduced activity bilaterally in the thalamus. LDX enhanced sustained attention and reduced impulsive responding in a continuous performance task but had no effect on emotional bias or working memory. These results suggest the observed effects of LDX on food intake (and by implication the efficacy of LDX in treating BED) may be related to the actions of the drug to enhance satiety, reduce food-related reward responding when full and/or increase cognitive control. Novel pharmacotherapies for BED might be most effective if they have a broad spectrum of effects on appetite, reward and cognition.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^2a27b8b4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

As the published LDX studies of augmentation therapy for MDD used flexible-dose designs, analyses of dose-response relationships for efficacy, safety, or tolerability were not performed. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy dose-response relationship of LDX when used as augmentation therapy for MDD in individuals who exhibited inadequate MADRS total score responses to an eight-week course of antidepressant monotherapy. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of LDX dose-response relationships on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse, and the assessment of the safety and tolerability of LDX based on the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), responses to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.

Mood

There were no baseline differences in mood. LDX increased post-dose ratings of arousal (t (21) = 3.11, p = 0.01, d = 0.46) and physical effects (t (21) = 3.11, p = 0.01, d = 0.28) and reduced appetite (t (21) = −6.62, p < 0.01, d = 1.18) relative to placebo. LDX had no effect on thirst (t (21) = 1.41, p = 0.17, d = 0.27) and the effect of LDX to increase negative effects approached significance (t (21) = 2.07, p = 0.05, d = 0.38) (Fig. 3).

5.7 Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening reaction, may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The co-administration with cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) inhibitors may also increase the risk with increased exposure to the active metabolite of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (dextroamphetamine). In these situations, consider an alternative non-serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

Concomitant use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Discontinue treatment with lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is clinically warranted, initiate lisdexamfetamine dimesylate with lower doses, monitor patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration, and inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome.

### Efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^fbed8873]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) efficacy and safety versus placebo in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Adolescents (13 through 17) with at least moderately symptomatic ADHD (ADHD Rating Scale IV: Clinician Version [ADHD-RS-IV] score ≥ 28) were randomized to placebo or LDX (30, 50, or 70 mg/d) in a 4-week, forced-dose titration, double-blind study. Primary and secondary efficacy measures were the ADHD-RS-IV, Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I), and Youth QOL-Research Version (YQOL-R). Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, laboratory findings, physical examinations, and ECG.

Results

Overall, 314 participants were randomized; 309 were in efficacy analyses and 49 withdrew (11 due to TEAEs). Least squares mean (SE) change from baseline at endpoint in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were -18.3 (1.25), -21.1 (1.28), -20.7 (1.25) for 30, 50, and 70 mg/d LDX, respectively; -12.8 (1.25) for placebo (p ≤ .0056 versus placebo for each). Differences in ADHD-RS-IV total scores favored all LDX doses versus placebo at all weeks (p ≤ .0076). On the CGI-I, 69.1% of participants were rated very much/much improved at endpoint with LDX all doses versus placebo (39.5%) (p < .0001). YQOL-R changes at endpoint scores for LDX groups versus placebo were not significant. Commonly reported LDX (all doses combined) TEAEs (≥ 5%) were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, decreased weight, and irritability. Small mean increases in pulse and blood pressure and no clinically meaningful trends in ECG changes were noted with LDX.

Conclusions

LDX at all doses was effective versus placebo in treating adolescent ADHD and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous LDX studies.
