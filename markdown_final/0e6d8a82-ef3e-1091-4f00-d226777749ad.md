## Question

Management of close angle glaucoma in ESRD patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing angle-closure glaucoma in patients with end-stage renal disease, including how dialysis affects intraocular pressure, what medications to avoid, and how to adapt standard acute and chronic management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of angle-closure disease and how ESRD and hemodialysis modify risk. Then, I should verify the standard-of-care algorithm for acute angle-closure crisis and identify where ESRD forces modifications. Next, I will examine medication safety in renal failure, including carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and osmotic agents. After that, I should consider dialysis-specific strategies and peri-dialysis IOP management. Finally, I will outline chronic care, fellow-eye prophylaxis, and a practical checklist, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak and noting uncertainties that require clinical judgment.

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and why ESRD matters. Angle-closure disease spans primary angle-closure suspect, primary angle closure, primary angle-closure glaucoma, and acute angle-closure crisis, with pupillary block as the dominant mechanism in most cases; anatomic risk factors include hyperopia, shallow anterior chamber, thick lens, and shorter axial length, and the disease is often bilateral, so the fellow eye warrants prophylaxis after an attack [^9f9cd6a8] [^783aa1fa]. Hold on, I should verify the ESRD-specific risk: dialysis can acutely alter plasma osmolality and ocular perfusion pressure, and observational data suggest IOP may spike during dialysis in susceptible eyes, particularly with narrow angles or neovascular glaucoma, though findings are heterogeneous and some studies show minimal change; nonetheless, the balance of evidence supports vigilance for intradialytic IOP fluctuations in glaucoma patients on HD [^6207e7b1] [^1e7794c3] [^d8da36b8] [^ebe8ba19].

> Next, I should review the standard acute management algorithm and then adapt it for ESRD. The preferred practice pattern is medical therapy first to break the attack and clear corneal edema, followed promptly by laser peripheral iridotomy to relieve pupillary block; if the cornea is too edematous to visualize, use topical glycerin, compression, or paracentesis to improve the view, and consider iridoplasty as a bridge if needed [^c2363321] [^ef83575f]. Wait, let me verify the sequence: yes, medical control precedes definitive laser, and compression gonioscopy can both diagnose and temporize in the acute setting, which is especially relevant when the view is compromised [^c2363321] [^ef83575f].

> Now, I need to check medication safety in ESRD because this is where errors commonly occur. Oral acetazolamide is contraindicated in severe renal disease due to risk of metabolic acidosis and electrolyte disturbances; if a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is needed, topical formulations are preferred, though even these warrant caution and monitoring in dialysis patients, and some clinicians avoid them altogether in advanced CKD when alternatives exist [^2a5ebd4b] [^ddd99788]. I should double-check osmotic agents: intravenous mannitol can cause volume shifts and electrolyte disturbances and is generally avoided in ESRD; instead, case-based reports suggest intravenous hypertonic glucose (for example, 20% glucose at 100 mL/h during dialysis) can mitigate intradialytic IOP spikes in neovascular glaucoma, but this is low-certainty evidence and should be individualized with nephrology input and glucose monitoring in diabetics [^ddd99788] [^3ad97448] [^7a46640a]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: oral glycerol is sometimes used outside dialysis, but in ESRD it can precipitate hyperosmolar complications and should be avoided; thus, if an osmotic is necessary, IV glucose is the more defensible, albeit off-label, option in the dialysis unit with close supervision [^ddd99788] [^3ad97448].

> Let me consider dialysis-specific strategies and peri-dialysis IOP management. I should confirm that neovascular glaucoma is a special case: IOP spikes during HD are well described in NVG and relate to impaired outflow from angle neovascularization; pan-retinal photocoagulation to reduce ischemic drive and intradialytic hypertonic glucose have case-level evidence for preventing symptomatic IOP rises, though this remains low-quality and should be reserved for refractory cases after optimizing topical therapy and coordinating with nephrology [^ddd99788] [^3ad97448] [^7a46640a]. But wait, what if the patient has primary angle closure without neovascularization? In that scenario, the dialysis-associated risk is less predictable, so I would prioritize standard acute therapy and consider scheduling HD at a time that allows prompt ophthalmic intervention, while monitoring for symptomatic IOP changes during or after dialysis sessions [^c2363321] [^d8da36b8].

> I will now examine chronic management after the acute episode is controlled. After iridotomy, persistent IOP elevation is managed like open-angle glaucoma with topical therapy, laser trabeculoplasty if the angle is sufficiently open, and incisional surgery if medical therapy fails; cataract extraction can also lower IOP meaningfully in angle-closure disease and may be considered earlier in the disease course in selected patients [^b71cd28d] [^188265b3]. Hold on, I should verify the role of lens extraction: the EAGLE randomized trial supports clear-lens extraction as a first-line alternative to laser iridotomy in certain angle-closure presentations, which can be particularly relevant when cataract is present or when a more definitive anatomic solution is desired [^188265b3].

> Next, I should review fellow-eye management and prophylaxis. Approximately half of fellow eyes will develop acute angle closure within 5 years if anatomically narrow, so prophylactic laser iridotomy is indicated once the acute eye is stabilized; I need to ensure gonioscopy documents the narrow angle before proceeding and counsel on medication triggers that can precipitate attacks, such as anticholinergics and sympathomimetics [^0383ac8c] [^7ca5cf1e]. Let me reconsider timing: if the patient is systemically unstable from the acute attack, it is reasonable to delay the fellow-eye laser briefly, but not unnecessarily, given the high risk of subsequent AACC [^0383ac8c].

> I should confirm medication choices for chronic IOP control in ESRD. Topical beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, and prostaglandin analogs are generally acceptable with standard precautions; rho-kinase inhibitors are increasingly used and do not have renal-specific contraindications, though cost and availability vary; topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be used cautiously with monitoring, while oral CAIs remain contraindicated in severe renal disease [^a7fb902b] [^2a5ebd4b]. Wait, I need to ensure I am not overstating: some clinicians use oral CAIs in select dialysis patients with close nephrology oversight, but given the risk of severe metabolic acidosis and electrolyte derangements, the default should be avoidance unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and monitoring is assured [^2a5ebd4b].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and double-check it aligns with guidelines. In an ESRD patient with acute angle closure, I would initiate topical beta-blocker, alpha-agonist, and pilocarpine if the cornea is clear enough, avoid oral acetazolamide, and consider IV hypertonic glucose during dialysis only if there is refractory IOP elevation with neovascular features and nephrology agreement; concurrently, I would arrange urgent laser iridotomy once the cornea is sufficiently clear, and if the view remains poor, use glycerin and compression or perform paracentesis to enable laser, with iridoplasty as a bridge if needed [^c2363321] [^ef83575f] [^ddd99788]. For chronic care, I would treat residual IOP with topical therapy, consider SLT if the angle opens adequately, and evaluate for early lens extraction or filtration surgery if pressure remains uncontrolled or damage progresses, while planning prophylactic iridotomy for the fellow eye once stable [^b71cd28d] [^188265b3] [^0383ac8c].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up reflect the unique risks. I would record dialysis schedule, timing of IOP spikes relative to HD, and coordinate with nephrology for any peri-dialytic interventions; I would also counsel on systemic medications that can precipitate angle closure, including anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, and sulfonamide-related agents like hydrochlorothiazide, which can cause idiosyncratic angle closure and should be stopped immediately if implicated [^e1d5f5f1] [^66980815] [^09878833]. Hold on, I should verify that patient education includes warning signs of AACC and a plan for emergent care, given the high stakes of delayed treatment and the potential for rapid visual loss in angle-closure disease [^2a164271].

In ESRD patients with angle-closure glaucoma, **avoid oral acetazolamide** due to metabolic acidosis risk; use topical beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, and prostaglandin analogs with caution, and reserve osmotic agents for emergencies with nephrology input [^2a5ebd4b] [^ef83575f]. Hemodialysis can cause **IOP spikes** from osmotic shifts, so monitor IOP during dialysis and consider intradialytic hypertonic glucose or mannitol for refractory cases [^6207e7b1] [^ddd99788]. Laser peripheral iridotomy is the **definitive therapy** to relieve pupillary block; if IOP remains uncontrolled, consider lens extraction or filtration surgery, and coordinate closely with nephrology for fluid and electrolyte management [^0383ac8c] [^b71cd28d].

---

## Pathophysiological considerations in ESRD

ESRD alters ocular physiology via **fluid and electrolyte shifts** during dialysis, which can acutely change IOP and worsen angle closure [^6207e7b1]. Rapid plasma osmolality drops can increase aqueous production and impair outflow, precipitating acute angle closure [^6207e7b1]. Uremic toxins and anemia may also contribute to optic nerve vulnerability and ischemia, complicating management [^ae5f054c].

---

## Medical management considerations

### Topical medications

- **Beta-blockers**: Timolol, betaxolol, and levobunolol are generally safe in ESRD; monitor for bradycardia and bronchospasm [^notfound].
- **Alpha-agonists**: Brimonidine is preferred; apraclonidine is less suitable due to systemic absorption and cardiovascular effects.
- **Prostaglandin analogs**: Latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost are safe and effective; monitor for ocular surface disease.
- **Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors**: Brinzolamide and dorzolamide are safer than oral agents but still require caution; monitor for metabolic acidosis [^fe95e0c5].

---

### Systemic medications

- **Oral acetazolamide**: Contraindicated in ESRD due to risk of severe metabolic acidosis; avoid [^2a5ebd4b].
- **Osmotic agents**: Glycerin is contraindicated due to fluid overload; mannitol may be used cautiously with nephrology input for refractory IOP spikes during dialysis [^ddd99788].
- **Hypertonic saline**: Intravenous hypertonic glucose (20% at 100 mL/h) during dialysis can reduce IOP spikes in neovascular glaucoma; monitor glucose closely [^ddd99788].

---

## Dialysis-related considerations

Dialysis can cause **IOP fluctuations**, particularly in patients with narrow angles or neovascular glaucoma [^6207e7b1]. Monitor IOP before, during, and after dialysis sessions, and consider intradialytic hypertonic glucose or mannitol for refractory IOP spikes [^ddd99788]. Coordinate with nephrology to adjust fluid removal and avoid rapid osmotic shifts [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management considerations

- **Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI)**: First-line definitive therapy to relieve pupillary block; perform as soon as cornea clears [^0383ac8c].
- **Lens extraction**: Consider clear lens extraction or phacoemulsification with goniosynechialysis for persistent angle closure or cataract [^188265b3].
- **Filtration surgery**: Trabeculectomy or tube shunts may be needed for refractory cases; use antifibrotics cautiously and monitor for hypotony [^563516b8].
- **Cyclophotocoagulation**: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation can be considered for refractory cases, especially with poor visual potential [^d953ec27].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **IOP monitoring** is essential, especially during dialysis sessions [^d8da36b8]. Assess visual fields, optic nerve head, and anterior chamber angle periodically, and coordinate with nephrology for fluid and electrolyte management [^bedad5b1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Management aspect** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|
| Topical medications | - Beta-blockers <br/> - Alpha-agonists <br/> - Prostaglandin analogs <br/> - Topical CAIs (cautiously) |
| Systemic medications | - Avoid oral acetazolamide <br/> - Use mannitol cautiously <br/> - Consider intradialytic hypertonic glucose |
| Dialysis-related management | - Monitor IOP during dialysis <br/> - Coordinate with nephrology <br/> - Use osmotic agents selectively |
| Surgical management | - Laser peripheral iridotomy <br/> - Lens extraction <br/> - Filtration surgery <br/> - Cyclophotocoagulation |
| Monitoring | - Regular IOP checks <br/> - Visual fields <br/> - Optic nerve head assessment <br/> - Coordination with nephrology |

---

Managing angle-closure glaucoma in ESRD requires **careful selection of medications**, close coordination with nephrology, and vigilant monitoring of IOP, especially during dialysis. Laser peripheral iridotomy remains the cornerstone of definitive therapy, with surgical options reserved for refractory cases.

### Ocular changes during hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease [^6207e7b1]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Early researchers believed that after HD, the ACD would either decline or would not change. In our study, the ACD significantly declined after HD. With the reductions in body fluid volume and osmotic pressure caused by HD, the amount of aqueous humor declined. Moreover, because this decrease is mainly due to changes in the crystal osmotic pressure rather than the colloid osmotic pressure, the latter increases after HD, and it can result in the aqueous humor flowing into the blood via the anterior chamber angle trabecular meshwork. This mechanism also contributes to reduced intraocular pressure. However, in patients with narrow or obstructive angles, this process is hampered, and due to the decline in the plasma crystal osmotic pressure, body fluid moves along the concentration gradient into the anterior chamber; this process may lead to increased IOP and even acute angle-closure glaucoma. Based on this conclusion, we should consider IOP, gonioscopy, and visual field tests for HD patients. For those with a high risk of anterior chamber obstruction, more detailed follow-ups should be conducted to determine any possible existence of glaucoma. These patients are classified as high risk patients, and preventative measures should be taken in the hemodialysis unit.

### Vision impairment in CKD patients: epidemiology, mechanisms, differential diagnoses, and prevention [^ae5f054c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Eyes and kidneys have numerous structural, developmental, physiologic, and pathogenic pathways in common, suggesting that many kidney and eye diseases may be interlinked. Studies suggest that the prevalence of eye diseases and vision impairment are higher among persons with end-stage kidney disease and earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in those without. Ocular morbidity in persons with CKD and end-stage kidney disease may be due to the following risk factors: (1) underlying conditions and risk factors for CKD such as diabetes or hypertension, (2) metabolic disorders associated with CKD, (3) uremia and anemia, and (4) CKD treatment. Among the chief eye diseases, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration are most consistently associated with CKD. Further research for eye diseases such as glaucoma and cataract is needed to determine their relationships with CKD. Despite the high prevalence and burden of vision impairment among persons with CKD, eye screening in patients with CKD is not currently recommended as standard practice. This review suggests that patients with CKD should be encouraged to undergo a complete eye examination. Furthermore, physicians should be aware that patients undergoing dialysis may develop acute eye problems such as acute glaucoma, and appropriate referral to ophthalmologists should be considered in those with a history of glaucoma or recent ocular surgery. Interdisciplinary collaboration between nephrologists and ophthalmologists will ensure enhanced and appropriate management of patients with CKD.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

This is a prospective study occurring during the course of a single HD treatment session in individuals with and without glaucoma.

Patient Enrollment

The study was approved by the University of Iowa IRB and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Adults provided written informed consent. Patients did not receive a stipend or incentive to participate in the study.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

All patients undergoing HD at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics who met inclusion criteria were approached for this study. Enrollment was restricted to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing chronic HD for at least three months. Exclusion criteria included patients with acute kidney injury and patients who irregularly attended HD sessions.

Subject Recruitment

Adults admitted to the dialysis unit for chronic HD were initially screened by the research team to determine eligibility using the electronic medical record. Patients meeting inclusion criteria were approached before starting treatment or within 5 minutes of the start of the HD session. Patients were only recruited on the HD days of Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday to avoid the influences of the extra weekend day in typical thrice weekly HD schedules (Monday-Wednesday-Friday or Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday).

Patients were divided into two groups based on ocular history: glaucoma and control. To be included in the glaucoma cohort, eyes had to have a diagnosis of open angle glaucoma, angle closure glaucoma (including a history of neovascular glaucoma), ocular hypertension, or be designated a glaucoma suspect. In the case of unilateral disease, only the eye with a diagnosis of glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, or ocular hypertension was included within the analysis. All glaucomatous eyes were included in the analysis regardless of surgical history (including glaucoma and phacoemulsification surgery).

### Bidirectional association between glaucoma and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a1f1b586]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Of note, the pathogenesis of open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma differ. While open-angle glaucoma is related to ganglion cell susceptibility, microcirculatory deficiency at the optic nerve head, or extracellular matrix factors and does not correlate well with elevated IOP, angle-closure glaucoma is defined by IOP elevation, anatomically narrow angles and shallow anterior chamber depths, resulting in iridotrabecular contact. Asian populations are particularly predisposed to angle-closure glaucoma due to the structure of their eyes. Reports of familial tendency towards the disease and ethnicity differences in risk of PACG imply an underlying genetic basis for the development of PACG. Eight susceptibility genetic loci have presently been identified. This may explain why some studies in our analysis found CKD to be associated with PACG but not POAG.

Having demonstrated that CKD is associated with, and may be a risk factor for glaucoma, it is worthwhile for physicians to keep in mind this potential relationship when providing holistic care to their patients. Our findings may provide impetus for the prevention and management of these diseases, such as the recommendation of preventive eye screening for glaucoma in patients with CKD, especially in patients with concomitant diabetes — patients already placed on routine eye screening for diabetic retinopathy may be advised to be adherent to their ophthalmology reviews to facilitate early detection of glaucoma. To this end, future interventional trials are required to investigate the efficacy of eye screening for glaucoma in patients with CKD. It is also worthwhile to assess how the treatment of either glaucoma or CKD affects the morbidity and mortality outcomes of the other.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated increased glaucoma risk within our CKD cohort compared to our frequency-matched non-CKD cohort. The implications of these findings include raising awareness among clinicians about the risk of glaucoma in CKD patients, as well as providing valuable real-world data that may influence the gradual refinement of guidelines regarding the care of CKD patients.

### Glaucoma summary benchmarks – 2024 [^0383ac8c]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Primary angle-closure disease (management plan and indications) — in patients with Primary Angle-Closure Suspect (PACS), iridotomy may be considered to reduce the risk of developing angle closure, and in acute angle-closure crisis (AACC), use medical therapy first to lower the IOP to reduce pain and to clear corneal edema; iridotomy should then be performed as soon as possible. Laser iridotomy is the preferred surgical treatment for AACC because it has a favorable risk-benefit ratio; but patients with PACS who have not had an iridotomy should be warned of potential risk for AACC and certain medicines could cause pupil dilation and induce AAC. The fellow eye should be scheduled for a prophylactic iridotomy if the chamber angle is anatomically narrow, since approximately half of fellow eyes can develop AACC within 5 years. Given the lack of convincing evidence for prophylactic use of iridoplasty in patients with plateau iris, and since iridoplasty can be painful and may cause inflammation, the decision of whether to observe or treat these eyes is left to the judgment of the testing ophthalmologist.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^ef2ba05e]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary angle closure disease (PACD) — treatment rationale and care process state that pupillary block is involved in the pathogenesis of PACD in most cases and is resolved with laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI); patients experiencing acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) should receive medical treatment to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP), and LPI should subsequently be performed in both eyes. Lens extraction has also been shown to be an effective treatment in some patients with primary angle closure and primary angle closure glaucoma. The goals of managing PACD are to reverse or prevent angle closure and to control IOP to prevent glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and dark-room dynamic gonioscopy should be performed to diagnose PACD and verify improvement in angle configuration following treatment; ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography can also aid in the diagnosis of PACD.

Discussion

Novel findings

We showed a significantly increased risk of developing OAG and ACG within the CKD cohort compared to the non-CKD cohort. Notably, this increased glaucoma risk persisted among both the dialytic and non-dialytic CKD cohorts. Our combined multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression and Poisson regression models further demonstrated that all genders, all age groups (≤ 40, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, > 80), and all socioeconomic brackets from the CKD cohort were associated with an increased risk for glaucoma compared to their respective non-CKD comparators. Furthermore, an increased risk of glaucoma was observed irrespective of whether CKD patients had a history of comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stroke, dementia or diabetes.

Clinical implications

Our study significantly contributes to the existing literature by employing rigorous methodology, including long follow-up durations and frequency score matching, to investigate the risk of glaucoma among the CKD cohort. Ours is also one of the largest studies to investigate the association between the risk of developing primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) subtypes within the chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohort in a population-based study. Using a large dataset enables researchers to elucidate better the real-world epidemiology of glaucoma and its predictive factors among CKD patients. When identifying a condition's causes, ideally one can examine relevant data directly from individual medical records. However, such a retrospective chart review is often time-consuming, limiting the number of patients able to be recruited via this method. Therefore, employing multi-institutional electronic records and utilizing electronic diagnostic codes allows researchers to identify cohorts of CKD patients with glaucoma efficiently. This study design can also be modified to recruit subgroups of the disease of interest and conduct subgroup analyses on covariates of interest. This was one of our strengths, as previous studies, such as the one by Ro et al. did not explore the risks of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) subtypes within their CKD group. Furthermore, our study is among the first to analyze glaucoma's associations with dialytic and non-dialytic CKD. Understanding the comorbidities of CKD is important as the effective management of comorbidities among CKD patients has been found to affect their overall clinical outcomes.

### Treatment… [^85b1feb7]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with subacute angle closure may have milder or intermittent symptoms that may resolve upon entrance into a well-lit room or with sleep, both of which induce pupillary miosis. 16 Identification of patients who are at risk of acute angle closure requires examination of the angle of the eye by an ophthalmologist. As with POAG, most patients who have PACG were previously diagnosed with a chronic disease, are asymptomatic, and are unaware of any visual field loss. In addition to the therapies available for POAG, laser peripheral iridotomy or cataract extraction may be offered to patients with PACG to lower their risk of acute angle closure. Certain medications that may cause pupillary dilation can increase the chance that an at-risk patient will have an episode of acute angle closure. 19 Sulfa derivatives and cholinergics may also lead to acute angle closure in at-risk persons.

19 However, most patients with glaucoma in the United States have POAG, which is not significantly affected by occasional use of such medications. Surgery may be indicated in patients who continue to show progressive visual field loss on maximal medical therapy, are intolerant of glaucoma medications, or are poorly adherent to treatment plans. Glaucoma surgeries are outpatient procedures. Many can be performed safely with only topical or local anesthetic, although retrobulbar injection of anesthetic and general anesthesia also may be used. In PACG, laser iridotomy is often performed at initial diagnosis to reduce the risk of acute angle closure. Laser trabeculoplasty for POAG is performed in a clinical setting and increases outflow through conventional aqueous outflow mechanisms. Laser treatment is similarly effective as topical medication and may be a good option for patients with poor medication adherence.

Prognosis Even among patients who receive treatment, nearly one in seven persons with glaucoma will be blind in one eye within two decades. 56, 57 In one study, one out of six patients was bilaterally blind at the most recent ophthalmology visit. 58 Important risk factors for disease progression and blindness include advanced disease at initial presentation and nonadherence with treatment and clinic visits. 57, 59, 60 The mainstay of treatment for glaucoma is the use of topical eye drops. Therefore, primary care physicians should ask patients about use of eye drops and remind them at health maintenance visits to apply the drops as prescribed.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^2a164271]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary angle-closure disease natural history — glaucomatous optic neuropathy can develop rapidly if patients with high intraocular pressure (IOP) from unilateral AACC do not receive treatment, and untreated fellow phakic eyes are at increased risk for developing acute angle closure. Following AACC, the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness increases in the first few days, returns to an average thickness at approximately 1 month, and develops decreased thickness at 3 months. In one study examining patients for 4 to 10 years following an AACC event, 18% of eyes were blind, of which 50% were blind from glaucoma. Fifty-eight percent of eyes had visual acuity worse than 20/40. Thus, AACC (and subsequent PACG) creates significant visual morbidity with progressive vision loss that may result in unilateral and bilateral blindness.

### Conventional and emerging treatments in the management of acute primary angle closure [^d27b5936]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

The management of acute primary angle closure is directed at lowering the intraocular pressure and relieving pupil block. Conventional treatment involves the use of medical treatment and laser peripheral iridotomy, respectively, as a means for achieving these aims. Newer therapeutic strategies have been described that are potentially useful adjuncts or alternatives to conventional treatment. Emerging strategies that lower intraocular pressure include anterior chamber paracentesis, as well as laser procedures such as iridoplasty and pupilloplasty. A possible alternative to relieving pupil block is lens extraction, and may be combined with adjunctive measures such as goniosynechiolysis and viscogoniosynechiolysis. Trabeculectomy has a limited role in the acute setting. This review paper reviews the current evidence regarding conventional and newer treatment modalities for acute primary angle closure.

Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) — initial management and medications: Most patients are treated acutely with medications, and medical therapy is usually initiated first to lower the IOP to reduce pain and to clear corneal edema; iridotomy should then be performed as soon as possible because iridotomy (or iridectomy) allows aqueous to bypass the pupillary block and eliminates the pressure gradient between the posterior and anterior chambers. Medical therapy includes topical beta-adrenergic antagonists, topical alpha2-adrenergic agonists, topical, oral, or intravenous carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, topical parasympathomimetics, and oral or intravenous hyperosmotic agents; agents that suppress aqueous humor formation may be ineffective initially if the ciliary body is ischemic, parasympathomimetics may open the angle but the pupil can be unresponsive to miotic therapy when the IOP is markedly elevated, parasympathomimetic treatment may be ineffective in secondary pupillary block from intraocular gas, oil, vitreous, or a blocking intraocular or crystalline lens (in which case mydriatics may be more effective), systemic hyperosmotic agents may need to be used to achieve a rapid decrease in IOP in AACC, and corneal indentation with a four-mirror gonioscopic lens, cotton-tipped applicator, or the tip of a muscle hook may help break pupillary block.

Primary angle-closure disease (PACD) definition and mechanisms — Primary angle-closure disease (PACD) is appositional or synechial closure of the anterior chamber angle, and pupillary block is described as "a key element in the pathogenesis of most instances of PACD". The document explains that "The pressure in the posterior chamber is higher than in the anterior chamber due to impairment of aqueous humor flow from the posterior chamber at the pupil, causing an anterior bowing of the iris that crowds the angle in predisposed eyes", and notes downstream effects: "Prolonged or repeated contact of the peripheral iris with the trabecular meshwork may lead to functional damage of the trabecular meshwork and the development of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS)". It also states that "Primary angle-closure disease may not initially be associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) or glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and it may occur in either an acute or chronic form", and that "In a minority of cases, this can happen acutely, resulting in acute angle-closure crisis (AACC)".

Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) — algorithm for initial and definitive management specifies the following pathway: begin with "Medical therapy to break attack and prepare patient for laser iridotomy". If the view is not clear, use "Topical glycerin, compression, paracentesis, or iridoplasty to clear the view". Once the view is adequate, determine etiology: for "Evidence for secondary cause of acute IOP elevation (e.g. NVI, intraocular tumor, ICE syndrome, etc.)", proceed to "Treat pathology of secondary acute IOP elevation and lower IOP medically or surgically". For "Definite evidence for PACD mechanism of AACC", perform "Prompt laser iridotomy". After iridotomy, the algorithm bifurcates by pressure status into "IOP controlled", leading to "Follow-up with dark-room gonioscopy to assess adequacy of angle opening", versus "IOP uncontrolled", which directs "Dark-room gonioscopy to assess other mechanisms of angle closure", "Ascertain continued patency of iridotomy", and "Medical and surgical treatment (incisional iridotomy or cataract surgery + goniosynechiolysis or trabeculectomy) to lower IOP".

WARNINGS

Use with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of ﬂuid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

Thiazides may add to or potentiate the action of other antihypertensive drugs.

Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.

The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.

Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

### Acute primary angle closure-treatment strategies, evidences and economical considerations [^6ec25cf4]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute primary angle closure requires emergency management that involves a rapid lowering of the intraocular pressure and resolution of relative pupil block - the most common mechanism of angle closure. Emergency strategies for lowering intraocular pressure include medical treatment and argon laser peripheral iridoplasty. Anterior chamber paracentesis and diode laser transcleral cyclophotocoagulation may be considered in special situations. Relative pupil block can be relieved by peripheral laser iridotomy and primary lens extraction; the latter is a more effective treatment according to the results of clinical trials. However, primary lens extraction can be technically demanding in the acute setting. Peripheral laser iridotomy has a role in relieving pupil block and should also be considered in most cases. Lens extraction may be combined with procedures such as goniosynechialysis, trabeculectomy or endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation. In this review, we aim to discuss the available evidence regarding the different treatment modalities. We also discuss the economic consideration, including cost-effectiveness and life expectancy, in the management of acute primary angle closure.

5.7 Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Irbesartan would be expected to behave similarly. In studies of ACE inhibitors in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in serum creatinine or BUN have been reported. There has been no known use of irbesartan in patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, but a similar effect should be anticipated.

Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.

### Management of intraocular pressure elevation during hemodialysis of neovascular glaucoma: a case report [^c4e91c3e]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Eye complications may occur during or after hemodialysis in patients with end stage renal disease. Ocular hypertension has been reported in subjects without glaucoma and is more accentuated in patients with glaucoma. Reports of intraocular pressure (IOP) rise during dialysis in neovascular glaucoma are extremely limited. It is generally accepted that dialysis may lower plasma osmolality at a faster rate than changes in ocular osmolality. This osmotic difference causes water to migrate from the plasma into the aqueous humor, increasing intraocular pressure. This theory has not however been clearly demonstrated and some studies have indicated that IOP increase is minimal or non existent, probably due to improvement in dialysis techniques. Certain authors have described IOP increase in patients with narrow angles. Here we report a neovascular glaucoma patient who experienced a substantial increase in IOP associated with severe eye pain and blurred vision during sessions of dialysis. The patient had been refractory to several antiglaucoma drugs and improved after intravenous administration of 20% hyperosmotic glucose solution with dialysis and pan-retinal photocoagulation. To our knowledge this is the first report in which intravenous glucose administration and reduction of neovascularization by argon laser pan-retinal photocoagulation successfully managed neovoscalar glaucoma.

Additional treatment after iridotomy for primary angle closure (PAC) or primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) — after alleviating pupillary block — is directed at lowering IOP to prevent or retard pressure-induced optic nerve damage and is similar to primary open-angle glaucoma care; reopening an appositionally closed angle by laser iridoplasty or a synechially closed angle with goniosynechialysis may improve aqueous outflow, especially when performed within 6 to 12 months of an acute angle-closure crisis (AACC). For elevated IOP threatening the optic nerve, management includes chronic topical ocular hypotensive agents, incisional surgery, and, rarely, laser trabeculoplasty if sufficiently open trabecular meshwork exists following LPI to expect a reasonable IOP reduction, and cataract extraction alone may lead to substantial IOP lowering in some PAC and PACG patients and can be considered as an option for treatment.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) from inception till 15 June 2021, using search terms for "glaucoma" such as "primary glaucoma", "open-angle glaucoma" and "close-angle glaucoma" and "chronic kidney disease" such as "end stage renal failure", "permanent kidney damage" and "irreversible kidney dysfunction". The full list of search terms can be found in our Supplemental Methods. We also hand-searched the bibliographies of included articles and relevant reviews, identifying 3 additional records.

Two authors (FYCN and HJJMDS) independently selected eligible articles (based on title and abstract, followed by full-text article), extracted data and evaluated risk of bias in a blinded manner via the online systematic review platform Rayyan. Conflicts were resolved by a third author (BKJT). We included observational articles, published as full-length articles in peer-reviewed journals, that reported on glaucoma or any measure of its estimate (i.e. intra-ocular pressure (IOP) or cup-disc ratio), and CKD or any measure of its estimate (i.e. estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or albuminuria) as either exposure or outcome, among adults aged ≥ 18 years. A bidirectional relationship was explored, where the association of glaucoma in participants with CKD was assessed in relation to participants without CKD, and the association of CKD in participants with glaucoma was assessed in relation to participants without glaucoma. We excluded case reports, reviews, letters, conference abstracts, other non-full-length articles, and non-English language publications. We extracted key data (Supplemental Methods) from each included article. We evaluated articles for risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) at the study level (Supplemental Table S1), assessing bias to be high (< 5 stars), moderate (5–7 stars) or low (≥ 8 stars).

### Management of intraocular pressure elevation during hemodialysis of neovascular glaucoma: a case report [^ddd99788]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Intraocular pressure may increase during hemodialysis, as reported in many patients with and without glaucoma. Many mechanisms have been invoked to explain this phenomenon, the most frequent being that IOP increases due to a rapid fall in plasma osmolality that stimulates increased formation of aqueous humor. This relationship between plasma osmolality and IOP during hemodialysis has been studied since the report of Sitprija et al. Some authors have suggested that decreased aqueous outflow might be the mechanism of intradialytic IOP increase, since most patients who showed IOP elevation during dialysis also had a narrow anterior chamber angle. Rever et al. reported that anterior chamber depth decreased significantly during dialysis. In the present neovascular glaucoma patient, we suggest that raised IOP resulted from an imbalance between aqueous outflow, obstructed by angle closure due to new blood vessels, and production of aqueous humor. The rise in IOP during dialysis sustains this explanation: the drainage system was unable to compensate the increase in aqueous production during dialysis. Argon laser retinal photocoagulation is known to reduce angle neovascularization induced by peripheral retinal ischemia in neovascular glaucoma patients.

Several therapeutic solutions have been recommended to prevent a symptomatic increase in IOP during dialysis sessions. Medical expedients include topical and systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is relatively contraindicated in dialysis patients as it can precipitate severe metabolic acidosis, which might be fatal to patients with end-stage renal disease. Seo et al. used an oral hypertonic solution with glycerol that proved effective for IOP control and safer in glaucoma patients. Other therapeutic approaches were described by Jaeger et al. who administered intravenous mannitol, which reduced IOP but predisposed patients to various side effects. Other solutions include medical therapy with topical Beta blockers, argon laser trabeculoplasty for exfoliative glaucoma, Ahmed valve implant for neovascular glaucoma and trabeculectomy for diabetic retinopathy. In our case, elevated IOP levels during hemodialysis were refractory to topical treatments and the patient's young age and neovascular glaucoma are both well-known risk factors for bleb fibrosis and surgical failure.

Appearance of ONH in right eye

Intraocular pressure was measured five times during hemodialysis for a 1-week period: at the beginning of dialysis, at hourly intervals during dialysis, at the end, and 1 and 2 h after the end of dialysis. Average intraocular pressure in the right eye at the beginning, after 2 h of dialysis, at the end and 2 h later was 15, 30, 27 and 22 mmHg, respectively. Thus intraocular pressure in the right eye increased by 15 mmHg (100%) during hemodialysis. In the left eye it remained normal. Topical instillation of eye drops did not prevent IOP increase in the right eye. Hemodialysis was performed routinely five times a week for 2 h and 40 min using central venous catheter for chronic pyelonephritis using NxStage System One (NSO) artificial kidney. After failure of eye treatment, we administered intravenous glucose (20% glucose at 100 mL/h) during dialysis to prevent IOP rise. We perform argon laser treatment between 60 and 30 days before dialysis. Eye pain and blurred vision resolved. We repeated IOP measurement during dialysis as above and recorded mean values of 15, 16 and 18 mmHg at the beginning, 2 h later and at the end of dialysis, respectively. Differences between IOP before and after i.v. glucose and panretinal photocoagulation treatments are shown in Fig. 3. In the last ophthalmological evaluation on 17 February 2015, BCVA was 2/20 in RE, anterior segment examination showed reduction of iris rubeosis in RE, IOP was 8 mmHg RE and 9 mmHg LE and fundoscopic examination revealed successful argon laser treatment of ischaemic peripheral retinal areas in both eyes. The optic disk appear unchanged and the visual field stable after the two treatments. Alpha 2 -agonist (Alphagan®) and pilocarpine hydrochloride 2% eye drops were discontinued. IOP was 13 mmHg RE and 12 mmHg LE. No pain or blurred vision occurred again.

### Evaluating the risk of new-onset glaucoma in chronic kidney disease patients: a nationwide cohort study [^fe95e0c5]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

However, it should be highlighted that there is currently a lack of mention regarding glaucoma-related complications among CKD patients among current guidelines. This gap underscores the need for further research to understand the associations between glaucoma and CKD better. For example, current guidelines for CKD care from the United States (US) and the United Kingdom prioritize the management of complications such as diabetic-related issues. For example, the 2023 US guidelines recommend ophthalmologic screening only for diabetic retinopathy at the time of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis in CKD patients. Therefore, our findings have implications in terms of raising awareness of glaucoma risk for at-risk CKD patients.

It is also worth noting that a higher proportion of patients in the CKD cohort received oral CAI and topical medications containing CAI (seen in both the topical CAI and the β-blocker-CAI hybrid medication) compared to the non-CKD cohort (p < 0.001). This is interesting as the use of such medications among those with impaired renal function is generally done under extreme caution, as it potentially increases the risk of metabolic acidosis and long-term dialysis. Our findings may also highlight the importance of increased awareness regarding the suitability of specific medications, such as CAIs, for CKD patients.

5.1 Impaired Renal Function

Monitor kidney function periodically. Diuretics can cause hypovolemia which may precipitate acute kidney injury. Patients with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, or volume depletion may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on INZIRQO. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in kidney function while on INZIRQO.

5.2 Electrolyte Abnormalities

INZIRQO can cause potentially symptomatic hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Hypokalemia is dose dependent. Monitor and correct serum electrolytes prior to use and monitor periodically. Discontinue INZIRQO if hypokalemia is associated with clinical symptoms (e.g. ECG changes, muscular weakness).

5.3 Metabolic Disturbances

INZIRQO may increase blood sugar levels, affect diabetes control, and cause changes in the need for diabetes medication.

INZIRQO may raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Monitor blood sugar and lipid levels.

INZIRQO may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients. Increases in serum uric acid are dose related.

INZIRQO decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving INZIRQO.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.

The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.

Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide).

Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

### Patient information: glaucoma… [^a7fb902b]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Chronic angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by slow, progressive obstruction of fluid drainage from the eye. Patients with this type of glaucoma can have periodic visual symptoms, but they are often asymptomatic until the condition worsens, and they develop visual symptoms similar to open-angle glaucoma. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is caused by acute obstruction of fluid drainage from the eye, leading to blurry vision, halos around lights, eye pain, nausea, vomiting, and rapid vision loss. This type of glaucoma requires emergency treatment to decrease intraocular pressure and prevent rapid onset of blindness. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation from 2022 concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for open-angle glaucoma in asymptomatic individuals aged 40 years or older.

However, people at elevated risk for glaucoma, such as those with a family history of this condition, should undergo periodic evaluation by an eye care professional to check for signs of glaucoma. Eye care professionals diagnose glaucoma with several tests, including measurement of intraocular pressure, visual field testing, dilated eye examination to assess the optic nerve, measurement of corneal thickness, and assessment of the angle in the eye between the iris and cornea. Other tests for glaucoma include optical coherence tomography and optic disc photography. Glaucoma is treated with medications or procedures to lower intraocular pressure. The most commonly used topical eye drops for glaucoma are prostaglandin analogues. Other eye drop medications for glaucoma include β-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, α-agonists, and rho kinase inhibitors.

Laser trabeculoplasty, a procedure that helps drain fluid from the eye, is another common treatment for open-angle glaucoma. A different laser procedure is performed for angle-closure glaucoma. Occasionally, patients undergo surgery to prevent worsening of glaucoma. Over a 20-year period, approximately 13% of patients with glaucoma develop blindness in one or both eyes. However, early detection of glaucoma and regular monitoring and treatment of elevated intraocular pressure by an eye care professional reduces the risk of blindness from glaucoma.

Imprecision for some estimates 4 Trials The large LiGHT trial found SLT and medical therapy associated with similar effects on IOP, visual acuity, visual fields, general quality of life, and glaucoma-specific quality of life and function. Medical therapy for ocular hypertension and untreated glaucoma was significantly associated with decreased intraocular pressure and decreased likelihood of glaucoma progression vs placebo, but 1 trial found no differences in visual acuity, quality of life, or function. Selective laser trabeculoplasty and medical therapy had similar outcomes.

For treatment, this article focuses on first-line medical treatments vs placebo, selective laser trabeculoplasty vs first-line medical treatments or no treatment, and recently approved medications vs first-line medications. Mean baseline IOP ranged from 19. 6 to
27. 3 mm Hg. Ten trials evaluated a β-blocker, 5 trials a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, 1 trial a prostaglandin analogue, and 1 trial an α agonist. 97 One trial allowed various topical therapies, with a target IOP of 24 mm Hg or less or 20% or greater IOP reduction. 56 The duration of follow-up ranged from 1. 5 months22, 84 to 120 months48.

The largest study was the good-quality Laser in Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension Trial, which enrolled 718 participants with OAG or ocular hypertension and visual acuity approximately 20/120 or better; mean baseline IOP was

### Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide (Atacand HCT) [^410819ac]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Impaired Renal Function

Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with ATACAND HCT. Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure on ATACAND HCT. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on ATACAND HCT.

Potassium Abnormalities

Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia, which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

In clinical trials of various doses of candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.5% versus 2.1% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% versus 1.0% for placebo. No patient receiving ATACAND HCT 16–12.5 mg or 32–12.5 mg was discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium.

Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

Hypersensitivity Reaction

Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.

### Intraocular pressure during haemodialysis: a review [^1e7794c3]. Eye (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although several works in the past have examined the effect of haemodialysis (HD) on intraocular pressure (IOP), reported findings, theories, and conclusions are very different. The objectives of this article are to resume the reported evidence of IOP changes during HD, to review the proposed hypothesis of HD influence on IOP, and to determine if ophthalmic examination is imperative in HD patients.

Methods

We analysed the peer-reviewed English literature and selected all possible relevant articles.

Results

The influence of HD on IOP is not clear, and even in recent studies opposite findings can be found.

Conclusions

Future studies are needed to clarify the effects of HD on IOP. In patients with glaucoma or with predisposed narrow angles, or eyes with impaired aqueous outflow, the possibility of acute IOP rise during HD could be much more frequent than in normal patients. So in these patients, a more strict ophthalmic scheduled examination seems to be feasible.

### Effect of hemodialysis on glaucoma patients [^ebe8ba19]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting over 10% of the world's population (over 800 million people). In the United States alone, more than 50 million hemodialysis (HD) treatments are performed each year. Due to rapid solute and fluid shifts during HD sessions, the impact of HD on intraocular pressure (IOP) has been a topic of interest among researchers for decades. Several studies have investigated the effect of HD on IOP in the general population with variable results, however the majority of studies demonstrated no significant change in IOP throughout the session. To our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies evaluating changes in IOP during HD sessions in patients with known glaucoma. With individual case reports of significant IOP spikes in glaucomatous patients, we hypothesized that IOP spikes or decreases in ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) may be more common than currently recognized in patients with glaucoma undergoing renal standard replacement therapy, and may be an unrecognized risk factor for glaucomatous progression despite low IOPs in clinic.

### Evaluating the risk of new-onset glaucoma in chronic kidney disease patients: a nationwide cohort study [^62ea07b9]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

We also showed an increased risk of glaucoma among dialytic CKD patients compared to their non-CKD comparators. Interestingly, there is a lack of consensus concerning the association between glaucoma and dialysis. Lim et al. was another retrospective cohort study conducted using a similar electronic health registry. However, the primary difference between their study and ours was that Lim et al. recruited end-stage renal disease patients (ESRD) receiving dialysis and propensity-matched controls without dialysis to investigate their risk for glaucoma. In contrast, our study recruited CKD patients, which encompassed those with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Such a design by our study allows for a more comprehensive investigation into the effects of CKD on glaucoma risk. Another point to note was that Lim et al. demonstrated an increased risk of closed-angle glaucoma (ACG) among dialytic ESRD patients (HR: 1.550, 95% CI: 1.074–2.239). However, contrary to our findings, Lim et al. did not observe an increased risk of OAG among their dialysis patients. One possible reason for their results is the variation in study periods. Lim et al. recruited Taiwanese ESRD patients up to the year 2013, while our study included CKD patients up to 2017. This is an important difference as there has been a steady increase in the prevalence of myopia and high myopia over the years, linked in part to the increasing urbanization of Taiwanese society. Furthermore, myopia and high myopia have been associated with an elevated risk of OAG.

Regarding gender, our study's aHRs and IRRs for glaucoma were higher in males than females. This contrasts with other studies, which identified an increase in glaucoma risk primarily among females. Gender-related factors like ocular axial length may partially explain these findings, as axial length has been found to affect the autoregulatory function of the eye in terms of intraocular pressure.

Regarding income and urbanization, ours aligned with Ro et al. who reported an increased risk among those of lower income and in rural areas. Such findings may be due to lower-income individuals being more likely to maintain a less balanced diet, which could contribute to increased glaucoma risk. Additionally, individuals from higher-income brackets residing in urban areas are more likely to attain higher levels of education, potentially leading to increased eye strain in this subgroup. This, in turn, may contribute to their increased glaucoma risk. Our findings emphasize the need to be aware that CKD patients, regardless of their income level, may be at an increased risk of developing glaucoma.

The index event for the CKD cohort was an encounter diagnosis of CKD. Inclusion in the CKD cohort was based on relevant clinical encounter diagnosis International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. Specifically, patients were recruited into our CKD cohort if their CKD diagnosis was present for at least two medical encounters in an outpatient setting or at least one encounter in an inpatient setting (refer to Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 3). The study period was from January 1st, 2009, to December 31st, 2015.

Furthermore, we identified dialytic CKD within the CKD cohort with a history of receiving dialysis procedures for at least 3 months or more (refer to Supplementary Table 1).

Our exclusion criteria excluded those with a previous history of glaucoma before the index date, as indicated by the corresponding ICD-10 codes (refer to Supplementary Table 1). Our exclusion criteria also excluded those under 18 years old, patients whose index dates were not between 2009 and 2015, patients with missing demographic data, and patients with no follow-ups. A 1:1 ratio of frequency matching was employed to create a 1:1 match between individuals with CKD with those who did not have a history of CKD. Covariates included in the frequency matching encompassed sex, age, and year of index date.

### Trabeculectomy versus stepwise treatment for breaking the attack of acute primary angle closure in patients with long attack duration: study design and protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (LAAAC) [^8a1c1db8]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Abstract:

Introduction

Acute primary angle closure (APAC) is a common ophthalmic emergency for Chinese patients causing potential visual disabilities. According to current guidelines published by developed countries, a stepwise protocol (medication laser or paracentesis surgery) is recommended for emergency management of APAC. However, patients with APAC in China and developed countries differ in disease characteristics as the Chinese have longer attack duration and lower success rate in breaking the attack with solely medication or laser therapy. It has been proved that long attack duration is a risk factor for failed medical or laser therapies in subsiding APAC. Since prompt and effective treatment is pivotal in preserving visual function as well as avoiding APAC-induced blindness, direct trabeculectomy may largely benefit long-attacking patients with APAC in China.

Purpose

The Long-Attacking Acute Angle Closure study aims to compare long-term visual function and safety after different initial treatment strategies: direct surgery (trabeculectomy) or stepwise protocol for patients with APAC with attack duration longer than 72 hours.

Methods and analysis

This is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial targeting Chinese patients with APAC duration longer than 72 hours. Eligible participants will be identified at either emergency department or glaucoma clinics, then randomised into stepped treatment group or trabeculectomy group using a computer central randomisation service. The patients will be followed up for 1 year after initial treatment.

Main outcomes and measures

The primary outcome is logMAR BCVA 1 year post initial treatment. Secondary outcomes consist of complete success rate in breaking the attack, intraocular pressure value, mean deviation on Humphrey visual field testing and vision-related quality of life collected using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (25 items) 1 year post initial treatment.

### Management of intraocular pressure elevation during hemodialysis of neovascular glaucoma: a case report [^3ad97448]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Intravenous glucose administration was recently proposed to manage IOP increase during dialysis. The authors showed that administration of 20% glucose solution (100 mL/h) at each dialysis session prevented increased production of aqueous humor due to relative serum hypo-osmolality. After this change of treatment IOP remained in the normal range. One limitation of high glucose administration could be the overall increase in serum glucose in diabetic patients. The most important side effect to be examined, in patients with chronic kidney failure, is that chronic use of hyperosmotic solutions does not reduce the effectiveness of hemodialysis. Effectiveness of hemodialysis is calculated by artificial kidney's software and it depends on three parameters: BUN values before and after hemodialysis sessions; body weight; time of hemodialysis sessions. In our experience effectiveness of hemodialysis has not changes until now and in literature there aren't studies on chronic use of hyperosmotic solutions in these type of patients. Another important side effect to be examined is the possible establishment of hyperglycemia but also in this case literature has not provided us more information due to poor series but our patient has not had alterations on glycemia values or on glucose intolerance and performs bi-weekly all tests blood needed.

Before attempting surgery we decided to administer intravenous glucose and to perform argon laser treatment of ischemic peripheral retinal areas to reduce neovascularization of the occluded angle. The synergy of the two treatments, one aimed at reducing the production of aqueous humor and the other at improving its outflow, proved effective in controlling IOP during the dialysis session and was safe for our neovascular glaucoma patient with end-stage renal disease.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) intraocular pressure (IOP) management — patients often have untreated IOP consistently within the normal range (i.e., normal tension glaucoma), and lowering pressure in these patients is beneficial; clinical trials have shown that lowering IOP reduces the risk of developing POAG and slows the progression of POAG, effective medical, laser, and incisional surgical approaches exist for lowering IOP, and a reasonable initial treatment goal is to reduce IOP 20% to 30% below baseline and to adjust up or down as indicated by disease course and severity.

3.2.1.3 Re-evaluating Target IOP

If the visual field is worsening at a rate that may threaten Quality of Life during the patient's expected lifetime, then the Target IOP, if previously met, should be lowered; a further 20% reduction has been shown to be effective. If the Target IOP had not previously been met, then additional therapy should be considered, in consultation with the patient, weighing the risks and benefits of the additional intervention (See FC XI) [I, D].

If there are sufficient visual fields to judge the rate of progression, and this rate is sufficiently slow not to impact on the patient's quality of life, then the Target IOP may be revised upward if the Target IOP has not been met or if the patient is on excessive therapy or is experiencing side effects [II, D].

If there are insufficient visual fields to judge the rate of progression and the Target IOP has not been met, then additional therapy should be considered, as above [II, D].

3.3 - Antiglaucoma Drugs

Several prospective randomized multi-centre controlled clinical studies have clearly established the benefits of IOP reduction in managing POAG at various stages of the disease whether of the 'high pressure' or "normal pressure' variety as well as reducing the conversion of OHT to POAG,[I, A].

Most forms of open-angle glaucoma and many types of chronic angle-closure glaucoma are initially treated with topical and occasionally orally administrated agents that act either on the reduction of aqueous humour production or enhancement of the aqueous outflow or on both. An uncommon exception to initiating treatment with medical therapy is for eyes with a very high level of IOP at presentation causing an immediate threat to sight. Additionally many forms of childhood glaucoma are managed with early surgery [I, D].

Although acute angle closure with or without glaucoma needs rapid laser or incisional surgery, medical treatment usually will be initiated as a first step in most cases.

Laser treatment may be a suitable first option for patients with known intolerance or allergy to topical agents or suspected poor compliance [I, A].

When initially selecting medical therapy it is important to consider some relevant patient's characteristics as well as features related to the drug (See FC XII and XIII).

### Management of intraocular pressure elevation during hemodialysis of neovascular glaucoma: a case report [^bfef52cf]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Case presentation

The patient was a 48 year old male with end-stage renal disease secondary to single pelvic Kidney, hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia. Medical history included renal failure in 2007 after kidney transplant, regular hemodialysis in 1989 and home dialysis five times a week since 2014. On 10 0ctober 2014, he was referred to our glaucoma unit because of severe ocular pain and blurred vision during a session of dialysis. The blurred vision resolved spontaneously within 2 h of onset. Nine years prior to this presentation he had undergone cataract removal in both eyes with intraocular lens implant in the right eye (RE) and aphakia in the left eye (LE). He was first diagnosed with neovascular glaucoma in 2013. Combined topical ß-blocker and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (Cosopt®) and prostaglandin analogue (Travatan®) were prescribed for both eyes when intraocular pressure reached 38 and 34 mmHg in the right and left eyes, respectively. On presentation, ophthalmological examination showed 2/20 best correct visual acuity (BCVA) in the right and blindness in the left eye. Anterior segment examination showed iris rubeosis in both eyes (Fig. 1a): gonioscopy revealed neovascularization spreading completely over the iridocorneal angle with peripheral anterior synechiae at trabecular level on the nasal and temporal sides, and OCT showed evidence of "false angle" (Fig. 1b). Intraocular pressure measurements were 22 mmHg RE and 21 mmHg LE. When alpha 2 -agonist (Alphagan®) and pilocarpine hydrochloride 2% eye drops were applied to both eyes, intraocular pressure decreased to 16 mmHg RE and 15 mmHg LE, but blurred vision recurred in the right eye during dialysis. The 30–2 Humphrey visual field test showed a large arcuate scotoma in the upper and lower hemifields. Perimetric defect type and stage were graded as mixed 2 by the Brusini Glaucoma Staging System 2. In the left eye it was impossible to perform visual field examination because of poor visual acuity. Fundoscopic examination revealed ischemic retinopathy with pre-retinal new vessels in the optic disk area of both eyes (Fig. 2). An epiretinal membrane covered the macular area of the right eye and ischemic peripheral retinal areas were observed. Seven years earlier the patient suffered occlusion of the central retinal vein in the left eye, followed in January 2014 by ischaemic optic neuropathy. We began argon laser treatment of ischemic peripheral retinal areas.

### Glaucoma: diagnosis and management [^23610f90]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma is a group of eye disorders characterized by progressive deterioration of the optic nerve that can lead to vision loss. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form in the United States. The risk of POAG increases with age, family history of glaucoma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypotension, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, and myopia. Up to one-half of patients are undiagnosed because a diagnosis often requires monitoring over years to document changes suggesting POAG. These include a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.3 or greater, intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg on tonometry, nerve fiber layer defects identified on optical coherence tomography, and reproducible visual field defects. Topical intraocular pressure-lowering medications and selective laser trabeculoplasty are first-line treatments for POAG. Although POAG screening in the general adult population is not recommended, primary care physicians can help decrease POAG-related vision loss by identifying patients with risk factors and referring them for evaluation by an eye specialist. Medicare covers evaluations in patients at high risk. Primary care physicians should encourage medication adherence and identify barriers to treatment. The other type of glaucoma is angle-closure glaucoma, in which the flow of aqueous humor is obstructed. Angle-closure glaucoma can occur acutely with pupillary dilation and is an ophthalmologic emergency. The goal of treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma is to reduce intraocular pressure quickly with medications or surgery, then prevent the recurrence of the obstruction to aqueous flow by a definitive ophthalmologic procedure.

### Treating patients presenting with advanced glaucoma – should we reconsider current practice? [^07fa1264]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

The management of patients presenting with advanced glaucoma presents a challenge to glaucoma clinicians. Presentation with advanced visual field loss is an important risk factor for progression to blindness in the affected eye(s) during the patients' lifetime. Maximising intraocular pressure (IOP) control in such situations is likely to minimise the risk of further visual field deterioration thus either preventing or slowing progression to blindness. Currently most patients presenting with advanced disease in the UK are managed on an escalating regime of medical treatment. Should this fail glaucoma surgery is usually employed to further lower IOP. Although glaucoma surgery is generally a safe and successful intervention it carries a small risk of severe visual loss and is considered by many clinicians as an intervention only to be used following failure of medical treatment. Recently however the National Institute for Clinical Excellence has suggested in its clinical guidelines for management of ocular hypertension and glaucoma that primary surgery should be offered to patients presenting with advanced glaucomatous visual field loss. This is contrary to the practice of most UK ophthalmologists. In this review the current available evidence underlying the management of presentation with advanced disease is examined.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^783aa1fa]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary angle closure disease (PACD) — classification and diagnostic definitions are specified as follows: primary angle closure suspect is defined as ≥ 180 degrees of iridotrabecular contact (ITC) without intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), or optic nerve damage; an eye with ≥ 180 degrees of ITC and elevated IOP or PAS is categorized as primary angle closure, and the additional presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy indicates primary angle closure glaucoma. Acute angle-closure crisis (AACC) represents a sudden, marked IOP elevation with complete ITC, while plateau iris configuration is defined as a narrow angle due to an anteriorly positioned ciliary body with a deep central anterior chamber, and plateau iris syndrome is persistent ITC after laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI). Although 90% of cases of AACC present unilaterally, PACD is generally bilateral, and risk factors include Asian descent, hyperopia, older age, female gender, short axial length, and thick and anteriorly positioned crystalline lens.

### Bidirectional association between glaucoma and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^38dd99ab]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The strengths of our article lie in our rigorous pre-specified protocol of systematic searching, bias assessment, and quality grading according to international guidelines. None of our 14 included articles had high risk of bias, and we found no outliers or influential cases contributing to the heterogeneity of our data. We extracted and pooled maximally-adjusted effect estimates to account for potential confounders within the limits of existing literature. Heterogeneity was adequately explained by meta-regression, with ethnicity emerging as a significant effect moderator accounting for all reported heterogeneity. Our findings were robust to subgroup, meta-regression, influence, cumulative and small-study analyses. We found no evidence of publication bias.

The results of this article need to be interpreted within the contexts of the following limitations. First, the results of our analysis may possess limited generalizability due to the large proportion of articles originating from Asia. It should also be noted that non-English articles were excluded from our analysis. Further large-scale population-based studies addressing the significance of the association between glaucoma and CKD in Western populations, as well as studies on Japanese, Mongolian, and North Korean populations, should be conducted. Second, not all articles specified the type(s) of glaucoma being investigated. Due to limited data, we were only able to perform subgroup analysis on the association of CKD and primary glaucoma, of which the most common forms were POAG and PACG. The number of patients who had cataract surgery or vitrectomy were not mentioned in the included studies, hence we were unable to account for this in our analysis. Similar, the modalities of treatment of glaucoma were not mentioned in the included studies. Future studies are required to explore if the association between glaucoma and CKD extends to other forms and treatments of glaucoma. In addition, we were unable to proceed with our pre-specified analysis of the association between glaucoma and severity of CKD as stratified by eGFR levels due to insufficient data. Third, a small minority of articles defined glaucoma and CKD according to ICD codes, which are less precise than diagnostic criteria or standardized procedure, such as the ISGEO guidelines or measurement of eGFR of < 60ml/min respectively. There was also a study where the diagnosis of glaucoma and CKD were made based on routine electronic clinical data of general practices, without further clarification of how the diagnoses were made. Fourth, as compared to population-based studies, the healthcare databases we included may have risk of referral bias. CKD patients with an underlying aetiology of diabetes are more likely to be referred to ophthalmology to monitor for complications of diabetic retinopathy, even if they are not known to have glaucoma. Fifth, most of the studies included in our analysis were cross-sectional studies, which are unable to fully explain the temporal relationship between glaucoma and CKD or suggest there might be a cause-and-effect relationship between them. Sixth, the observational nature of the included studies does not permit causal conclusions as residual confounding cannot be excluded. Of note, dialysis is a possible confounder of the relationship that was not sufficiently accounted for. Our meta-regression of ethnicity as an explanatory variable for our heterogeneity, aggregate/ecological bias and confounding cannot be excluded. Lastly, due to limitations in available literature, the overall quality of evidence for the outcome of glaucoma was judged to be low and the outcome of CKD to be very low.

### Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation in refractory acute and chronic angle closure glaucoma [^d953ec27]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Angle closure glaucoma, both acute and chronic, is a major cause of blindness worldwide. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCP) is conventionally undertaken non-urgently in patients with advanced glaucoma and poor visual potential with poor control of intraocular pressure (IOP). We describe a case of a patient with refractory acute angle closure glaucoma and severe pain in whom emergency TSCP was undertaken 12h after presentation, reducing the IOP from 68 to 10mmHg. Further, a patient with chronic angle closure glaucoma underwent TSCP, reducing the IOP from 78 to 14mmHg. Both patients consequently underwent uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with preservation of visual acuity and long-term IOP control. TSCP may achieve prompt IOP control and symptomatic relief in the acute setting in patients with acute and chronic forms of angle closure glaucoma refractory to medical therapy. TSCP may reduce the risk of definitive surgical intervention by temporising phacoemulsification or trabeculectomy surgery until the IOP is well controlled.

### Has the EAGLE landed for the use of clear lens extraction in angle-closure glaucoma? And how should primary angle-closure suspects be treated? [^188265b3]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Angle-closure glaucoma is an aggressive condition that causes millions to become blind worldwide. This review explores the use of prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy (PI) in patients classified as primary angle-closure suspects (PACS), and additionally, the use of clear lens exchange as a primary treatment option in established angle-closure disease with or without glaucoma. As PI has a strong prophylactic effect in fellow eyes of patients who have had an acute attack, its use has been widely adopted in those patients classified as PACS, but with limited evidence to support this. A large randomised trial conducted in China has demonstrated that although PI reduces the risk of incident angle-closure disease, the incidence of disease that would threaten vision was much lower than anticipated. This suggests that the benefit of prophylactic PI is very limited. Health services data shows an association between rising cataract surgical rates and of decreasing rates of acute angle-closure. Age-related growth of the lens is a major component of angle-closure disease. Several studies have shown that clear lens extraction (CLE) effectively lowers IOP in angle-closure. The use of CLE as a primary treatment option has been tested against LPI in the EAGLE study, a large RCT that enroled people with angle-closure and an IOP > 30mmHg, and those with angle-closure glaucoma. The trial showed CLE to be superior to PI both for IOP control and patient reported quality of life. On these grounds, CLE should be considered for first-line treatment of more advanced angle-closure disease.

Implications

Anesthesia may acutely reveal angle-closure glaucoma. This complication is an ophthalmologic emergency. However, symptoms of acute glaucoma may be overlooked or misinterpreted in a sedated or comatose patient, and this may result in delayed treatment. Immediate diagnosis and appropriate treatment should be done to prevent visual loss.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma and increased risk of chronic kidney disease [^3efa0119]. Journal of Glaucoma (2019). Medium credibility.

Precis

The association between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and subsequent development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was investigated using a nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort in South Korea. POAG increases the risk of subsequent CKD development.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of subsequent CKD development in patients with POAG.

Methods

In this nationwide, population-based longitudinal cohort, 1,025,340 beneficiaries in the 2002–2013 Korean National Health Insurance database were included. We identified patients with incident POAG and evaluated the risk of subsequent CKD development using diagnostic codes from the database after 2-year wash-out periods. We applied time-varying covariate Cox regression analyses to determine the effect of POAG on the development of CKD: Model 1 included only POAG as a time-varying covariate; Model 2 included Model 1 and demographic information; and Model 3 included Model 2, comorbidity, comedication, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score.

Results

The fixed cohort included 478,303 eligible subjects, and of these subjects, 1749 suffered incident POAG, and 3157 developed CKD. POAG was associated with an increased risk of CKD development [hazard ratio (HR) = 7.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.89–9.87] in Model 1; HR = 3.54 (95% CI, 2.73–4.58) in Model 2; and HR = 2.90 (95% CI, 2.24–3.76) in Model 3].

Conclusion

POAG increased the risk of subsequent CKD in the general population, suggesting that POAG and CKD might share a common pathogenic mechanism.

### Effect of hemodialysis on glaucoma patients [^d8da36b8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Chronic kidney disease and HD is common, and each HD session may be putting glaucomatous eyes at increased risk of progression by causing both IOP fluctuation and decreases of OPP. Perhaps most concerning is that no patient with IOP spikes (with IOP increases up to 25 mmHg) or drops in OPP experienced any ocular symptoms. With the regularity of HD sessions, these IOP and OPP changes may have a profound and deleterious impact on glaucoma patients undergoing HD. Furthermore, these significant ocular fluctuations occur outside of the clinic setting which potentially could result in chronic undertreatment. Our results suggest HD may be an unrecognized yet significant risk factor for glaucomatous progression. Alongside known non-IOP risk factors in normal tension glaucoma like nocturnal hypotension, Raynaud's phenomenon, and migraine headaches, the impact of HD should be assessed and considered in the evaluation and treatment of glaucoma patients who progress despite having apparently well controlled IOPs during their ophthalmology clinic visits.

### Evaluating the risk of new-onset glaucoma in chronic kidney disease patients: a nationwide cohort study [^84478b0a]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A better understanding of the association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and glaucoma is required to optimize clinical outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with new diagnoses of glaucoma over time from January 2009 to December 2019.

Method

This retrospective propensity-matched cohort study utilizing Taiwanese electronic health records examined the incidence of newly diagnosed glaucoma in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). The exposure variable was the diagnosis of CKD, identified through diagnostic codes. The primary outcome was the incidence of new-onset glaucoma. Subgroup analyses on glaucoma risk included age, gender, comorbidities, glaucoma subtypes, and dialysis status. Statistical analyses included Kaplan–Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, and Poisson regression models, with the associated hazard ratios and confidence intervals reported.

Results

Seven hundred twenty-three thousand two hundred sixteen patients with CKD (42.3% female; mean [SD] age at index, 66.3 [15.6] years) and 723,216 patients without CKD (42.3% female; mean [SD] age at index, 66.3 [15.7]) were recruited. We showed a significantly increased risk of glaucoma irrespective of subtypes in CKD patients compared to those without CKD (HR: 1.29 [CI: 1.26–1.32], p < 0.001). Kaplan–Meier curves revealed a significantly increased glaucoma risk in both the dialytic subtype and non-dialytic CKD patients when compared to their non-CKD counterparts (p < 0.001). We also showed that all genders (aHR 1.17 [CI: 1.13–1.21] for females vs. aHR 1.39 [CI:1.35–1.43] for males), all ages (≤ 49: aHR 1.49 [CI: 1.37–1.62]; 50–59: aHR 1.48 [CI: 1.40–1.56]; 60–69: aHR 1.30 [CI: 1.25–1.6]; 70–79: aHR 1.21 [CI: 1.17–1.26]; > 80: aHR 1.29 [CI: 1.21–1.37]); all income brackets and all urbanization status were associated with significantly increased risk of glaucoma from among the CKD cohort when compared to their respective non-CKD cohort (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Our cohort study spanning 12 years showed an elevated glaucoma risk following a CKD diagnosis compared to a frequency-matched non-CKD cohort. Our findings have relevance for the clinical practice of at-risk CKD patients.

Trial registration

Due to the retrospective nature of the study, no registration was necessary.

### Evaluating the risk of new-onset glaucoma in chronic kidney disease patients: a nationwide cohort study [^97ce04f4]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Another finding was the lower magnitude of aHRs and IRRs associated with the glaucoma development among CKD patients with comorbidities compared to those without such a history. This contrasts with findings from Lim et al. Given that our study is retrospective and relies on diagnostic codes, it is plausible that the clinical severity, duration and history of receiving treatment (e.g. antihypertensives and statins) for the comorbidities studied may have influenced our results obtained.

Limitations

Limitations of our study include the retrospective design and reliance on diagnostic codes that could possibly introduce misclassification bias or the inability to incorporate clinical parameters like proteinuria and eGFR levels. Other unaccounted confounders include ethnicity, renal transplant history, smoking history as well as medication histories like statins and steroids. Future prospective studies that incorporate laboratory and clinical measurements, such as cup-to-disc ratio, proteinuria, and eGFR, as well as additional subgroup analysis of other covariates like renal transplant history, smoking history, and systemic medication history, can better confirm our findings regarding the association between CKD and glaucoma.

### Needle decompression of the eye! emergent management of a vision threatening surgical complication [^01a6c9bf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG) is a medical emergency that can cause permanent visual deficits without prompt recognition. From 2006 to 2011, nearly 12 million visits to emergency departments (ED) in the United States were ophthalmologic in nature, making it crucial for emergency physicians to be familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of ophthalmologic emergencies. AACG can be precipitated by several mechanisms including pupillary block, anticholinergic medications, and sympathomimetic medications. We present a rare case of angle-closure glaucoma status post pneumatic retinopexy with cryotherapy due to migration of an intravitreal gas bubble into the anterior chamber with emphasis on understanding how retinal surgery types lead to significant differences in management.

### Iatrogenic glaucoma secondary to medications [^0ae03419]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with primary and secondary forms. Iatrogenic glaucoma secondary to medications is potentially blinding but preventable. Most drug profiles listing glaucoma as a contraindication or an adverse effect are concerned with inducing acute angle-closure glaucoma. Anticholinergic or adrenergic agents are the most common for inducing "pupillary block" angle-closure glaucoma. Patients with a narrow irido-corneal angle are at high risk. Sulfa drugs induce "non-pupillary block" angle-closure glaucoma as an idiosyncratic reaction to the drug in patients with an open or narrow irido-corneal angle. Steroids and a few antineoplastic agents induce open-angle glaucoma. The risk is higher with topical rather than systemic steroids. The first step in the management is discontinuation of the drug, followed by medical, laser, and, if necessary, surgical intervention.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^88a4e0e5]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma management — goals and treatment modalities focus on control of intraocular pressure (IOP) in the target range, stable optic nerve/retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) status, and stable visual fields; ophthalmologists can lower IOP with medications, laser therapy, or incisional surgery, and randomized controlled trials provide evidence that these treatments reduce IOP and decrease the rate and incidence of progressive primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Additional considerations are that primary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic and usually asymptomatic condition in early stages; medical treatment requires adherence to single or multiple topical medications that can be expensive and may cause local or systemic side effects; laser or incisional surgery may also be indicated; visual field loss is associated with decreased quality of life; the effects of treatment, patient quality of life, comorbidities, and life expectancy are to be considered, and the diagnosis, severity, prognosis, management plan, and likelihood of long-term therapy should be discussed with the patient.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes consist of complete success rate in breaking the attack, IOP, mean deviation on Humphrey VF testing and vision-related QoL collected from the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (25 items) (NEI-VFQ25) 1 year post initial treatment.

Complete success in breaking the attack is defined as IOP < 21 mm Hg without the aid of IOP-lowering medication. If IOP can only be controlled with the assistance of medication, the success should be defined as partial rather than complete.

An NCT will be employed for the measurement of IOP, taking several facts into consideration since many patients with APAC are present in an emergency context and that not all centres allow access to Goldmann tonometry. Three measurements will be taken for each eye by a masked examiner, and the mean values will be used.

VF testing will be performed on Humphrey 24–2 automated perimetry. Reliable VF results are defined as fixation loss < 20%, with both positive and negative false < 33%.

To further evaluate visual outcomes in patients with APAC, we adopted the NEI-VFQ25 questionnaire, which is a vision-specific health profile measure. Since the original questionnaire was designed for English speakers, our study adopted the Chinese version, which had been tested for good reliability and validity.

Ancillary measurements

The data presented in Box 1 will also be recorded.

Box 1
Ancillary information and examinations required

Time from syndrome to presentation, time from presentation to the subsidence of the attack and time from symptoms to cornea restoring transparency.
