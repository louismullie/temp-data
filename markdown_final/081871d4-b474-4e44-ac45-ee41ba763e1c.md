## Question

can you explain the role of simvastatin for treatment of critically ill patients with COVID 19

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of simvastatin in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19, specifically whether it should be used and how the evidence applies in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality randomized evidence in the exact population of interest. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility and whether it translated into clinical benefit. Next, I will review safety signals and drug–drug interactions. After that, I need to check guideline positions and how they interpret the totality of evidence. Finally, I will consider subgroup hypotheses, practical implementation, and synthesize a bottom-line recommendation with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the most direct evidence. The REMAP-CAP platform trial randomized 2,684 critically ill COVID-19 patients who were statin-naïve to simvastatin 80 mg daily versus no statin, using organ support–free days through day 21 as the primary outcome and 90-day survival as a key secondary outcome, and it did not meet prespecified superiority criteria despite a modest Bayesian posterior probability signal, so the formal conclusion was no proven benefit in this population [^116Rm84R] [^113dZekY].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction of the effect to avoid overinterpreting a trend. The median organ support–free days were numerically higher with simvastatin (11 vs 7), with a posterior adjusted odds ratio of 1.15 and a 95.9% posterior probability of superiority, but this did not cross the trial's stringent superiority threshold, and the 90-day survival hazard ratio of 1.12 similarly did not meet statistical significance, so any apparent benefit remains uncertain and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^116Rm84R] [^113dZekY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial; I should review the broader randomized evidence across severities. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of seven RCTs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients found no significant benefit of statins on mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or length of stay, reinforcing that routine statin initiation for COVID-19 is unsupported, although heterogeneity and differing agents/doses complicate interpretation [^113hS42L]. But wait, what if pooled analyses that include larger, more recent RCTs show a signal? A 2025 collaborative meta-analysis of three large RCTs reported a small reduction in 30-day mortality with statins, yet this pooled estimate is driven by different populations and agents and still does not establish benefit specifically for critically ill, statin-naïve patients, so external validity to the ICU setting remains limited [^116k1crF].

> I need to check safety next, because high-dose simvastatin carries known myotoxic and hepatotoxic risks. In REMAP-CAP, serious adverse events including elevated liver enzymes and creatine kinase were more frequent with simvastatin, and given the frequency of drug interactions in the ICU and the potential for rhabdomyolysis, this risk–benefit calculus further argues against routine initiation in critically ill, statin-naïve patients [^116Rm84R].

> Next, I should review mechanistic plausibility to ensure I'm not missing a biologically coherent rationale. Statins have pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and endothelial effects and may modulate lipid rafts relevant to viral entry, which is biologically attractive in COVID-19, but these properties have not consistently translated into improved hard outcomes in RCTs of ARDS or severe COVID-19, tempering enthusiasm for de novo ICU use [^117MLqCX] [^1156VDz4] [^112VGtsH].

> Let me consider subgroup hypotheses carefully. Post hoc and secondary analyses from HARP-2 and other ARDS programs suggest potential benefit in hyperinflammatory phenotypes, and exploratory signals in REMAP-CAP cannot be dismissed, but hold on, I should verify that these are hypothesis-generating only and not practice-changing. Indeed, precision phenotyping is not yet available at the bedside, so we cannot reliably identify who might benefit in real time, and guidelines appropriately caution against acting on unvalidated subgroups [^114vNdbH] [^117EC7q5].

> I should confirm what major guidelines say before making a recommendation. The IDSA COVID-19 guideline does not recommend initiating statins for the treatment of COVID-19, emphasizing the knowledge gap and prioritizing enrollment in trials when considered, and WHO's living guideline has not endorsed statins for severe or critical COVID-19, focusing instead on established therapies like corticosteroids and selective immunomodulators in appropriate patients [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine practical implementation if a clinician is still considering this off-label. If used at all, it should be in a clinical trial or with explicit research governance, using simvastatin 80 mg daily for up to 28 days as studied, with daily monitoring of liver enzymes and creatine kinase, vigilance for drug interactions that raise simvastatin levels, and a low threshold to discontinue if myalgias, weakness, or marked enzyme elevations occur, recognizing that atorvastatin 20–40 mg has been the agent most studied outside trials and may have a more favorable interaction profile in the ICU [^116Rm84R] [^113dZekY].

> But wait, what about patients already on statins prior to admission; should we stop them? I should double-check that guidance consistently supports continuation for cardiovascular indications unless contraindicated, and yes, multiple society statements advise continuing preexisting statins through the hospitalization because of established secondary prevention benefits, with attention to hepatic and muscle safety labs if clinically indicated [^114h8FPs].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. The highest-quality direct evidence in critically ill, statin-naïve COVID-19 patients does not demonstrate statistically significant benefit for simvastatin, safety signals are nontrivial at high dose, and major guidelines do not recommend initiation. Therefore, simvastatin should not be used routinely for critically ill COVID-19 patients outside of a clinical trial, while patients already on statins should generally continue them for cardiovascular reasons with appropriate monitoring [^116Rm84R] [^113hS42L] [^115KY1he] [^114h8FPs].

> Bottom line, with a quick self-check for any overlooked contradictory RCTs: there are no large, definitive RCTs showing benefit of simvastatin in this exact critically ill, statin-naïve population, the best available RCT is neutral for superiority despite a Bayesian trend, and current practice should prioritize guideline-supported therapies. Simvastatin initiation should be limited to trials, and if considered off-protocol, it requires informed consent, interaction screening, and close lab monitoring given dose-related toxicity risks [^116Rm84R] [^115KY1he] [^114h8FPs].

Simvastatin is not recommended for routine treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients [^113hS42L]. The largest RCT in this population (REMAP-CAP) [^116Rm84R] found **no significant benefit** in organ support–free days or 90-day survival, and simvastatin increased **liver enzyme and creatine kinase elevations** [^116Rm84R]. Current guidelines do not endorse statins for COVID-19 treatment [^115KY1he], and simvastatin should be avoided in patients with severe liver disease, renal impairment, or those on interacting drugs [^113dZekY]. If a statin is indicated for cardiovascular reasons, use **atorvastatin or rosuvastatin** instead [^1135Jqsd].

## Clinical evidence for simvastatin in critically ill COVID-19 patients

### REMAP-CAP trial

- **Design**: International, adaptive-platform RCT in critically ill COVID-19 patients not on statins at baseline [^116Rm84R].
- **Intervention**: Simvastatin 80 mg daily vs no statin [^113dZekY].
- **Primary outcome**: Organ support–free days to day 21; median 11 vs 7 days (OR 1.15, 95% CrI 0.98–1.34) — not statistically significant [^116Rm84R].
- **90-day survival**: HR 1.12 (95% CrI 0.95–1.32) — not significant [^116Rm84R].
- **Safety**: More frequent elevations in liver enzymes and creatine kinase with simvastatin [^116Rm84R].

---

### Other randomized trials

INSPIRATION-S (atorvastatin 20 mg) in ICU COVID-19 patients showed **no significant reduction** in thrombosis, ECMO, or 30-day mortality (33% vs 36%; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58–1.21) [^115kVgSP]. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs in hospitalized COVID-19 patients found **no significant benefit** of statins on mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or length of stay [^113hS42L].

---

## Mechanisms of action relevant to COVID-19

Simvastatin has **pleiotropic effects** that could theoretically benefit COVID-19, but clinical translation has been inconsistent:

- **Anti-inflammatory**: Inhibits NF-κB and reduces cytokine storm [^114V25A7].
- **Antithrombotic**: Reduces thrombosis via endothelial stabilization and anticoagulant effects [^112VGtsH].
- **Antiviral**: May disrupt lipid rafts and reduce viral entry/replication [^116LDdrW].

---

## Safety considerations

Simvastatin has a **favorable safety profile** in general use, but high-dose therapy in critically ill patients raises concerns:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevated liver enzymes reported in REMAP-CAP [^116Rm84R].
- **Myopathy**: Increased creatine kinase and risk of rhabdomyolysis, especially with interacting drugs [^116Rm84R].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. azole antifungals, macrolides, protease inhibitors) increase simvastatin levels and toxicity risk [^notfound].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines **do not recommend** simvastatin for COVID-19 treatment:

- **IDSA**: No recommendation for statins in COVID-19 treatment [^notfound].
- **WHO**: No recommendation for statins in COVID-19 treatment [^notfound].
- **Surviving Sepsis Campaign**: No recommendation for statins in COVID-19 treatment [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other statins

| **Statin** | **Clinical evidence in covid-19** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|
| Simvastatin | REMAP-CAP (80 mg daily) | No significant benefit; increased liver enzymes and CK [^116Rm84R] |
| Atorvastatin | INSPIRATION-S (20 mg daily) | No significant benefit; safe [^115kVgSP] |
| Rosuvastatin | Limited RCT data | Potential benefit in some studies; needs confirmation |

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for critically ill COVID-19 patients [^113hS42L].
- **If statin indicated**: Use atorvastatin or rosuvastatin; avoid simvastatin in severe liver disease, renal impairment, or with interacting drugs [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Check liver enzymes and creatine kinase if simvastatin is used [^116Rm84R].

---

Simvastatin is **not recommended** for routine treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients due to lack of benefit and increased adverse effects; if a statin is needed, prefer atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^111Gb5vN]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this study of adults with covid-19 admitted to the ICU, use of atorvastatin 20 mg once daily compared with placebo was not associated with a significantly reduced odds of the primary outcome, a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or all cause mortality. Findings were consistent for several additional outcomes, including mortality and venous thromboembolism, and in study subgroups and sensitivity analyses. The current trial does not support a large 30 day benefit from statin treatment in patients with covid-19 admitted to the ICU. Despite adjustments for sample size estimates midway during the trial, the event rates were ultimately lower than expected and we cannot exclude a smaller treatment effect.

### Vitamin C and COVID-19 treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115qBpzK]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Vitamin C has been used as an anti-oxidant in various diseases including viral illnesses like coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating the role of vitamin C supplementation in COVID-19 was carried out.

Results

Total 6 RCTs including n = 572 patients were included. Vitamin C treatment didn't reduce mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.27; I² = 0%; P = 0.27), ICU length of stay [SMD 0.29, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.63; I² = 0%; P = 0.09), hospital length of stay (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -1.04 to 0.58; I² = 92%; P = 0.57) and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.44; I² = 0%; P = 0.76). Further sub-group analysis based on severity of illness (severe vs. non-severe), route of administration (IV vs. oral) and dose (high vs. low) failed to show any observable benefits.

Conclusion

No significant benefit noted with vitamin C administration in COVID-19. Well-designed RCTs with standardized control group needed on this aspect.

### Adherence of clinical practice guidelines for pharmacologic treatments of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to trustworthy standards: a systematic review [^116E3eyk]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) that report on pharmacologic treatments of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 meet the National Academy of Medicine standards for trustworthiness?

Findings

In this systematic review of 32 CPGs of predominantly low quality, few reported funding sources or conflicts of interest, included a methodologist, described a search strategy or study selection process, or synthesized evidence. Although 14 CPGs (43.8%) made recommendations or suggestions for or against treatments, they infrequently rated the confidence in the quality of the evidence (6 [18.8%]), described potential benefits and harms (6 [18.8%]), or graded the strength of recommendations (5 [15.6%]).

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that few COVID-19 CPGs meet National Academy of Medicine standards for trustworthy guidelines.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113P1VF3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

### Reply to epelbaum: standards and stereotypes in COVID-19 [^115ZEbNT]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Dr. Epelbaum reports that the comparison of our cohort to the PROSEVA (Prone Positioning in Severe ARDS) trial reveals "'unARDS-like' clinical behavior". First, we caution against direct comparison of our entire cohort to PROSEVA. PROSEVA enrolled patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), whereas our cohort included all patients intubated for respiratory failure. If we examine comparable patients from our cohort — those with moderate to severe ARDS who were treated with prone positioning — we see similar physiologic responses. Patients in PROSEVA (Figure S2 from Reference) had a mean PaO₂:FiO₂ ratio of approximately 110 when supine, prior to first proning session, with improvement to 190 at the end of the first prone session (difference, +80). Patients in our cohort improved from a median PaO₂:FiO₂ ratio of 150 when supine to 232 during the first prone session (difference, +82).

Finally, we share Dr. Epelbaum's concern about the use of off-label therapies for ARDS, including statins. Preclinical and observational data published prior to COVID-19 suggested a role for statins for the treatment of viral infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2009 influenza A (H1N1), and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Therefore, at the time of our study, hospital guidelines recommended initiating statins for accepted secondary indications frequently present in patients with COVID-19 and not for ARDS per se. We agree that statin therapy has not shown benefit in unselected patients with ARDS and requires further study. We also agree that off-label therapies should ideally be used in the context of clinical trials.

Frontline experience remains critical to inform real-time patient care and shape future research. We urge the continued rigorous study of these observations to accurately inform the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

### Routine statins use is associated with less adverse outcome in patients above 70 years of age admitted to hospital with COVID-19 [^1157db2F]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in late 2019 and spread rapidly, leading to a global pandemic. The older population has been reported to be at increased risk for serious outcomes in many studies. The newly developed vaccines have led to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality, however, the appearance of the new variants elicited a significant decrease in vaccine efficacy. Statin therapy is common in the older population, especially among those with major illnesses associated with poor disease outcomes. This addition of new therapies designed to contend with an unprecedented milieu emphasizes the importance of examining the association between routine statin use and poor outcome, specifically among older COVID-19 patients. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the association between preadmission statin use and the presentation and clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients older than 70 years of age.

### Using a targeted metabolomics approach to explore differences in ARDS associated with COVID-19 compared to ARDS caused by H1N1 influenza and bacterial pneumonia [^111ECn9u]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

We found that lipid metabolism is important in viral-mediated ARDS, as seen in the heatmap of COVID-19 ARDS and as noted by others for H1N1 and COVID-19. This is an interesting and potentially important finding as there is early evidence that using a PCSK9 inhibitor alters COVID-19 inflammation and outcome. Just how lipid metabolism affects inflammation in COVID-19 is not known, but there is an association between lipid disorders and COVID-19 severity, and several studies involving statin use in COVID-19 have been undertaken.

We also note that aromatic amino acid and lysine metabolism were highlighted in the differentiation of COVID-19 ARDS and COVID-19 pneumonia without ARDS. Our findings agree with others, where arginine metabolism, glycolytic pathway, and one-carbon metabolism were highlighted as the most perturbed metabolic phenotype in COVID-19. Importantly, this may be used to potentially predict those individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia that will develop more severe disease (i.e. ARDS) and, therefore, may need close attention for the need to transfer to the ICU. This may be a marker of COVID-19 severity; however, this will need to be validated in future investigations.

### Statins and SARS-CoV-2 disease: current concepts and possible benefits [^1156VDz4]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Inflammation-mediated tissue injury is the major mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Statins have well-established anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and immuno-modulatory effects. They may also influence viral entry into human cells.

Methods

A literature search was done using PubMed and Google search engines to prepare a narrative review on this topic.

Results

Statins interact with several different signaling pathways to exert their anti-inflammatory and vasculoprotective effects. They also variably affect cholesterol content of cell membranes and interfere with certain coronavirus enzymes involved in receptor-binding. Both these actions may influence SARS-CoV-2 entry into human cells. Statins also upregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors on cell surfaces which may promote viral entry into the cells but at the same time, may minimize tissue injury through production of angiotensin [1–7]. The net impact of these different effects on COVID-19 pathogenesis is not clear. However, the retrospective clinical studies have shown that statin use is potentially associated with lower risk of developing severe illness and mortality and a faster time to recovery in patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions

Early observations suggest beneficial effect of statin use on the clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Prospective randomized studies as well as well-designed laboratory studies are required to confirm these observations and to elucidate the mechanisms of such benefits, if proven.

### Statins in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113hS42L]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the efficacy of statins in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A systematic search was made of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov, without language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on treatment of COVID-19 with statins, compared with placebo or standard of care, were reviewed. Seven RCTs (enrolling 1830 participants) met the inclusion criteria. There was no statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR]: 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75–1.13), length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference: -0.21 days, 95% CI: -1.01 to 0.59 days), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR: 1.84, 95% CI: 0.45–7.55), and mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.70–1.70) between the two groups. Statins failed to reduce mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Statins probably should not be used routinely in COVID-19 patients.

### Association of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases with hospitalization for COVID-19: a nationwide matched population-based cohort study [^112LeCRZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

A better understanding of the determinants associated with COVID‐19 helps to identify vulnerable individuals and to provide satisfactory health care management. Given the absence of a specific treatment for COVID‐19, several existing drugs were thought to be beneficial, in particular those with anti‐inflammatory or immunomodulatory activities such as statins. Besides their well‐known lipid‐lowering effect, statins have been reported to have pleiotropic beneficial actions by regulating numerous biological pathways implicated in anti‐inflammatory, immune‐modulatory, or anticoagulant actions. These drugs were found to be effective in previous outbreaks, namely those of hemagglutinin type 1 and neuraminidase type 1 (H1N1) influenza, and the Ebola virus. It has also been shown that they have been useful for survival in SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) infections. Statins exert an anti‐inflammatory effect by directly inhibiting the toll‐like receptor MYD88‐NF‐kB pathway and by upregulating angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2) expression.,

Numerous epidemiological studies demonstrate that individuals who were previously treated with statins had a lower risk of experiencing severe COVID‐19 outcomes, including admission into an intensive care unit, invasive mechanical intubation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and in‐hospital death, compared with nonexposed individuals. In total, 36 of 49 studies (73%) show a lower risk of severe COVID‐19 outcomes––in particular mortality––among statin users compared with nonusers. In 11 studies, ratio measures were close to 1. In 2 studies, an increased risk was observed. Most of these studies were conducted in hospitalized patients and/or patients tested for COVID‐19. This could have led to a collider bias––also known as admission bias––which could have distorted the association between statin exposure and severe COVID‐19 outcomes compared with that observed in the general population. That is, both the cause of using statins and the risk for COVID‐19–related hospitalization may influence the likelihood of being selected for the study. Furthermore, in the literature, there is little evidence on statin use with hospitalization for COVID‐19.

### Clustering COVID-19 ARDS patients through the first days of ICU admission. An analysis of the CIBERESUCICOVID cohort [^114jt49j]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary noncardiogenic edema. ARDS is associated with poor short- and long-term outcomes including high mortality rates, disability, and poor quality of life indicators. Several trials have failed to identify treatments for ARDS, and only corticosteroids, prone position, and limiting the damage caused by mechanical ventilation have shown improved outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe in late winter/early spring 2020, probably resulting in the highest number of ARDS patients ever treated concomitantly. COVID-19 has increased the knowledge about the physiopathology and treatment of ARDS, highlighting the importance of anti-inflammatory treatment over antivirals, thromboembolic events, and endothelial damage.

Sub-phenotypes of ARDS have been described as hypoinflammatory and hyperinflammatory, using clinical data and plasma inflammatory biomarkers in latent class analysis. These sub-phenotypes have been associated with different outcomes, and reanalyses of several clinical trials found that the hyperinflammatory sub-phenotype may have better outcomes when receiving simvastatin, or high-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels. In addition, these sub-phenotypes responded differently to fluid management. Models for a parsimonious identification of sub-phenotypes using a few variables and machine-learning strategies are being developed. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer patients could be classified into the hyperinflammatory sub-phenotype. A possible limitation of clustering is that the correct identification of sub-phenotypes is needed, and only one cross-sectional evaluation may underestimate the impact of the changes or evolutions of markers in the first days of admission. Bos et al. failed to identify sub-phenotypes in patients with COVID-19 by cross-sectional analysis with data from the respiratory system but two sub-phenotypes were identified through longitudinal analysis. Few data evaluating clustering using inflammation data and common variables measuring organ failure are available.

We hypothesized that patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS may be described by more than one discrete cluster and the clustering process and its result may change during the first days of their admission, which may have an impact on their prognosis. To evaluate this, we aimed to study a cohort of patients and analyze the clustering of patients at baseline and day 3 using readily available data measuring organ failure, respiratory variables, and inflammation.

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111YPy92]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal pathogen responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters human cells by engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This interaction may lead to an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a potential mechanism contributing to this pathogen's virulence. A combination of direct viral toxicity and indirect effects such as untempered thromboinflammation and dysregulation of the RAAS may underlie severe presentations of COVID-19, which can manifest with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial injury, and micro-and macro-thrombotic events. As such, several anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic therapies may hold promise for prevention or treatment of patients with COVID-19, and statins constitute one such class of medications.

Although statins have traditionally been administered to lower serum cholesterol, their pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, make them an attractive class of drugs in the setting of COVID-19 –. Moreover, through effects on lipid rafts in cellular membranes –, statins may influence viral transmission and infectivity. By these putative mechanisms, statins appear to have the potential to mitigate the impact of myocardial injury and thrombotic events that are associated with severe COVID-19 presentations.

To date, a number of studies have evaluated the use of statins in the treatment of pneumonia and ARDS. While primary results of randomized clinical trials evaluating statins in ARDS have not indicated a benefit, secondary analysis of 540 individuals from the HARP-2 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibition with Simvastatin in Acute Lung Injury to Reduce Pulmonary Dysfunction–2) trial demonstrated improved survival with statin treatment in patients with a hyperinflammatory phenotype.

In the current study, we compared patient baseline and presentation characteristics as well as clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, stratified by antecedent statin use, in a cohort of patients admitted with COVID-19 to a quaternary academic medical center in New York City. We utilized propensity score matching and multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association of antecedent statin use with the primary endpoint of in-hospital mortality at 30 days and secondary endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation at 30 days. Here we show that patients with antecedent statin use were generally older with more comorbidities, presented with lower levels of C-reactive protein at time of admission, and experienced lower inpatient mortality at 30 days in a propensity-matched cohort.

Executive summary — interpretation of recommendation strength and clinical-trial use policy states that, per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", and that "recommend" indicates strong recommendations while "suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. It also notes that when promising interventions were judged to have insufficient evidence of benefit with potential appreciable harms or costs, the expert panel recommended their use in the context of a clinical trial, acknowledging the current "knowledge gap" and aiming at avoiding premature favorable recommendations for potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Adjunctive statin therapy in patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113CAN71]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy and safety of adjunctive statin therapy in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) remains uncertain.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from inception to late April 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing statin versus no statin use in patients hospitalized with Covid-19. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) applying a random-effects model. R version 4.3.1 was used for statistical analyses.

Results

We included 7 RCTs comprising 4,262 patients, of whom 2,645 (62%) were randomized to receive statin therapy. Compared with no statin, statin use significantly reduced case-fatality rate (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80–0.98; I² = 0%). In a time-to-event analysis, we found similar results (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75–0.99; I² = 0%). Statin use also significantly reduced World Health Organization (WHO) scale at 14 days (mean difference -0.27; 95% CI -0.54 to -0.01; I² = 0%). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in length of hospital stay, elevation of liver enzymes, and C-reactive protein levels.

Conclusions

In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, statins significantly reduced case-fatality rate and WHO scale score.

### COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: not so atypical [^116ggGoZ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the pulmonary critical care community has come to realize that ARDS can be split into subphenotypes (Figure 1) that might respond differently to interventions. Heterogeneity can be observed in 1) the etiology of lung injury, 2) physiological changes, 3) morphology of affected lung parenchyma, and 4) biological response. Based on post hoc analyses of randomized clinical trials, patients with systemic hyperinflammation might respond differently to higher end-expiratory pressure, restrictive fluid management, or immunomodulation with simvastatin treatment, whereas patients with a nonfocal lung morphology benefit more from recruitment than prone positioning. However, no one is advocating for implementing these personalized approaches into clinical practice before they are validated in prospective clinical trials, despite a much stronger basis of evidence than is currently provided for COVID-19–related ARDS phenotypes.

Figure 1.
Subphenotypes of ARDS, stratified for the etiological subphenotype of COVID-19–related ARDS. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; Crs = compliance of the respiratory system; DAD = diffuse alveolar damage.

Etiology is generally a minor determinant of the pathophysiological presentation of ARDS, meaning that many patients with a similar "hit" show different biological, physiological, and morphological patterns. COVID-19–related ARDS is an etiological subphenotype of ARDS with a particular set of characteristics: frequent DAD, (possibly) a higher than expected Crs, low PaO₂/FiO₂ values, frequent nonfocal morphology, and some suggestions of profound systemic inflammation (Figure 1). But are patients with COVID-19–related ARDS inherently different from "typical ARDS"? With appreciation of the heterogeneity within ARDS, we have come to realize that there is no "typical ARDS".

Despite the described heterogeneity that is inherent to the syndromic definition of ARDS, low Vventilation was found to decrease mortality in an unselected population, and prone positioning was effective in patients with persistent hypoxemia. Yet, these interventions are the ones that are now challenged for the supportive treatment of COVID-19–related ARDS. Does subphenotyping of COVID-19–related ARDS require a different level of evidence before we adjust clinical practice? Or were we too strict in implementing subphenotype-based interventions in the pre–COVID-19 era? I would argue that we should maintain the highest standard to adjust our clinical practice and resist the temptation to jump to conclusions and provide alternative treatments that might harm our patients.

### Prevalence of phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a prospective observational study [^111ghgGs]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) unrelated to COVID-19, two phenotypes, based on the severity of systemic inflammation (hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory), have been described. The hyperinflammatory phenotype is known to be associated with increased multiorgan failure and mortality. In this study, we aimed to identify these phenotypes in COVID-19-related ARDS.

Methods

In this prospective observational study done at two UK intensive care units, we recruited patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected at baseline. Plasma samples were analysed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFR1) using a novel point-of-care assay. A parsimonious regression classifier model was used to calculate the probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype in COVID-19 using IL-6, soluble TNFR1, and bicarbonate levels. Data from this cohort was compared with patients with ARDS due to causes other than COVID-19 recruited to a previous UK multicentre, randomised controlled trial of simvastatin (HARP-2).

Findings

Between March 17 and April 25, 2020, 39 patients were recruited to the study. Median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO₂/FiO₂) was 18 kpa (IQR 15–21) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 12 (10–16). 17 (44%) of 39 patients had died by day 28 of the study. Compared with survivors, patients who died were older and had lower PaO₂/FiO₂. The median probability for the hyperinflammatory phenotype was 0.03 (IQR 0.01–0.2). Depending on the probability cutoff used to assign class, the prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype was between four (10%) and eight (21%) of 39, which is lower than the proportion of patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype in HARP-2 (186 [35%] of 539). Using the Youden index cutoff (0.274) to classify phenotype, five (63%) of eight patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype and 12 (39%) of 31 with the hypoinflammatory phenotype died. Compared with matched patients recruited to HARP-2, levels of IL-6 were similar in our cohort, whereas soluble TNFR1 was significantly lower in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.

Interpretation

In this exploratory analysis of 39 patients, ARDS due to COVID-19 was not associated with higher systemic inflammation and was associated with a lower prevalence of the hyperinflammatory phenotype than that observed in historical ARDS data. This finding suggests that the excess mortality observed in COVID-19-related ARDS is unlikely to be due to the upregulation of inflammatory pathways described by the parsimonious model.

Corticosteroids rationale and ARDS evidence — early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, recommendations cautioned against systemic corticosteroids due to risk of worsening clinical status, delayed viral clearance, and adverse events, yet given the hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19, immunomodulatory approaches including steroids continue to be evaluated to address ARDS and systemic inflammation; notably, a recent multicenter RCT in moderate to severe ARDS demonstrated a reduced number of ventilatory days and reduction in mortality with use of a 10-day regimen of dexamethasone.

### Issues for the management of people with diabetes and COVID-19 in ICU [^113rsEQD]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lipids and statin use

Most of diabetic patients are routinely on lipid-lowering treatment, in particular on statins in accordance with the current diabetes and cardiovascular disease guidelines. Statins have well-known anti-inflammatory effects and improve endothelial function, which may be protective against cardiovascular complications during COVID-19. However, through various mechanisms statins may enhance compensatory immune signals. In addition, similar to renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers, experimental studies showed that statins also augment the ACE2 receptor expression and might thus facilitate the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells. Whether statins may be beneficial or harmful during virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome is controversial. Further investigations are urgently required to clarify the interplay of these complex mechanisms with the new coronaviruses. In addition statins may cause myotoxicity. A markedly increase in creatine kinase may be observed in some patients with COVID-19.

The benefit of statins in cardiovascular prevention is well established in people with diabetes. In this context there is no evidence for withdrawing statins during COVID-19. However creatin kinase should be carefully monitored and, if increased, statin therapy should be temporarily withheld in order to avoid rhabdomyolysis.

IDSA COVID-19 Recommendation 11 — Among hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19 who have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, the IDSA guideline panel suggests tocilizumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Remarks add that patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab, and that in the largest trial the criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥ 75 mg/L.

### Intravenous vitamin C for patients hospitalized with COVID-19: two harmonized randomized clinical trials [^111v4yg2]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) was published by LOVIT-COVID Investigators and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the trial question was: what is the role of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the population was: 1569 patients (564 female, 1005 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy; healthcare-associated pneumonia; imminent death; known allergy to vitamin C. In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the interventions were: n = 1037 vitamin C (IV dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight over 30–60 minutes every 6 hours for 96 hours) n = 532 control (no vitamin C or placebo). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median organ support-free days to 21 days (7 days vs. 10 days; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in survival without persistent organ dysfunction at day 28 (57.1% vs. 60.7%; OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.12) No significant difference in the rate of survival to day 28 (65% vs. 67.2%; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19) Significant decrease in the rate of endotracheal intubation through day 28 (35.5% vs. 32.5%; OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99). In the LOVIT-COVID and REMAP-CAP (critically ill) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19, vitamin C was not superior to control with respect to median organ support-free days to 21 days.

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111y5dWo]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The limited evidence available regarding statins in the COVID-19 literature confirms the findings presented in the present manuscript. In a study which evaluated the prevalence and impact of myocardial injury in 2736 hospitalized patients in New York City, 36% of patients received statins prior to admission. Though not the focus of this manuscript, statin use was associated with significantly lower rates of in-hospital mortality by multivariable analysis (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47–0.69). In addition, a separate study of 154 elderly individuals suggested that statin use prior to admission was associated with less severe symptoms, but they did not assess in-hospital mortality. More recently, an analysis from the Wuhan, China demonstrated significantly lower 28-day mortality in patients who received inpatient statins compared with non-statin users (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.43–0.80). In this study, however, < 10% of hospitalized patients received statins. A meta-analysis of 8990 patients from four retrospective studies (including the study by Zhang et al.) revealed that COVID-19 patients who were statin users experienced significantly lower hazard for death or severe disease compared with non-statin users (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94). As the majority of these studies focused on patients from China, they may not be representative of the patient characteristics and burden of cardiovascular comorbidities in Western populations. Most recently, a separate meta-analysis focused exclusively on European and North American patient populations, and only one of the seven studies included overlapped with the previously mentioned analysis by Kow et al. Statin use was associated with significantly lower rates of progression to severe COVID-19 illness or death (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35–0.99). Notably, studies included in both of these meta-analyses varied significantly in terms of patient populations, adjunctive therapies administered, timing of administration (inpatient vs. outpatient) as well as drug and dosing of statin regimens. Importantly, as in the study by Zhang et al. in-hospital statin use in an observational setting may be subject to immortal time bias. With these studies as well as the findings of the present analysis in mind, the results of ongoing randomized clinical trials and registries will be crucial (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT04407273, NCT04390074, NCT04348695, NCT04426084, NCT04333407, NCT04380402, NCT04486508).

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^1145Yyn5]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

The strengths of this study include the multicenter enrollment of more than 500 patients from the ICU. Also, the double blind design reduced the risk of performance bias. A committee blinded to treatment assignment adjudicated all clinical outcomes, which enhances the reliability of reported outcomes.

This study has several limitations. First, type II error remains possible. Enrollment was stopped before the target sample size was reached. Although the study included 98% of the planned sample size based on re-estimations in 2020, the final primary outcome event rate was lower than expected. This situation might have been because of improved care for patients with covid-19 in the latter months of enrollment compared with the early months of the pandemic. Therefore, the trial was underpowered for the original hypothesis. Findings from the other ongoing statin trials in patients admitted to the ICU are awaited. Second, the acuity of illness in this study was lower than in ICU cohorts in some other studies, which might impact generalizability to extremely sick patients in the ICU. This challenge is likely multifactorial. The enrollment criteria required a minimum estimated survival of 24 hours and excluded patients already treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to be able to discern a treatment effect if one were to exist. Such factors could have led to the exclusion of the sickest patients, such as those with unstable respiratory status on invasive mechanical ventilation or those receiving multiple vasopressors from enrollment. Nevertheless, the study population was very ill, as evidenced by the need for cardiopulmonary support and high mortality rates at 30 day follow-up. Several of the baseline treatments and presenting features are similar to those of other randomized controlled trials of patients in the ICU with covid-19.

Finally, the treatments and care for patients with covid-19 have improved over time and could have affected the results. However, we did not identify a significant interaction between the assigned treatment and season of enrollment for the primary outcome (supplementary table S11).

Conclusions

In patients with covid-19 admitted to the ICU, atorvastatin 20 mg daily compared with placebo was not associated with a significant reduction in the composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or all cause mortality. The effects of a more potent statin regimen or the impact on a more targeted population of patients with covid-19 require additional investigation.

### Routine statins use is associated with less adverse outcome in patients above 70 years of age admitted to hospital with COVID-19 [^113si5k2]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to multiorgan insufficiency and death, particularly among the older adults. Statins have been suggested as potentially protective drugs due to their pleotropic effects, but the actual benefit of statin use among the older population in this setting is not clear. This study aimed to evaluate the association between preadmission statin use and the presentation and clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients older than 70 years of age.

Methods

A historical cohort study of all patients above 70 years of age who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in a large academic hospital between March and August 2020 was performed. The association between preadmission statin use and patients' presentation and adverse outcome was studied. Adverse outcome was defined as any of the following: shock, invasive or non-invasive ventilation, organ insufficiency, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, in-hospital or 30-day post-admission mortality, hospital stay longer than the median length of stay of all COVID-19 patients, referral to nursing home or rehabilitation center.

Results

Seventy-two (44%) of the 163 studied patients (median age 82 years, 45% males) had been preadmission treated with statins. The statin-treated patients (STP) had a higher prevalence of diabetes (40% vs 24%, p = 0.028) and cardiovascular disease (58% vs. 34%, p = 0.002). Seventy two percent of the STP had adverse outcome, compared to 86% of the non-STP (p = 0.033). After adjustment for potential confounders, prior statin use was associated with decreased risk for an adverse outcome (odds ratio = 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.18–0.92, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

The preadmission use of statins was associated with a lower risk of adverse outcome in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Continuation of statin treatment might be implemented for risk reduction of adverse outcomes in the older population in the era of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and less effective vaccines.

### Routine statins use is associated with less adverse outcome in patients above 70 years of age admitted to hospital with COVID-19 [^114Jnvbk]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As of March 2022, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected over 470,000,000 people and caused more than 6,100,000 deaths worldwide. COVID-19 may lead to multiorgan insufficiency, particularly among the older population and patients with chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Older adults are generally defined as those 70 years of age and older, and they have an increased risk to develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Statins are the most effective treatment for primary prevention and even more significant with regard to secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, having been shown to decrease the risk of both cerebrovascular and coronary artery disease in older adults, similar to their effects in young populations.

A beneficial role of statins was shown in the patients with pneumonia, other infection diseases and sepsis based upon their well-established pleotropic properties. The association between statins and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients was recently investigated in several retrospective studies, meta-analyses and a few randomized controlled trials. Most of those studies found that statin use was associated with improved clinical outcomes, while others reported no such association and even adverse outcomes among statin users. Although some studies included stratification according to age and showed mixed results, only one study directly addressed disease outcome specifically among hospitalized and non-hospitalized older patients, while there is no reported meta-analysis on this specific population. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the association between preadmission statin use and the presentation and clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients older than 70 years of age.

### Atorvastatin for reduction of 28-day mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: a randomized controlled trial [^114V25A7]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite widespread vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, the virus has not been eradicated, and COVID-19 has transitioned from pandemic to endemic status. COVID-19 denotes a cytokine storm, implying an aggressive immune response. Increased cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) activate the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) pathway, which causes sepsis, capillary damage, acute pulmonary injury, severe acute respiratory distress (ARDS), multi-organ damage, and death.

Statins are lipid-lowering medications that also have pleiotropic effects. Their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antioxidant properties may benefit COVID-19 patients: (1) reduce viral load by activating autophagy and regulating SARS-CoV-2 virus degradation or replication; (2) modulate the cytokine storm by blocking the NF-B pathway and NLRP3 inflammasomes; (3) improve endothelial function, which contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis; (4) enhance vein thrombus resolution and reduce the risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE).

Retrospective studies suggest that chronic statins reduce the risk of mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation, and hospitalization duration. Recent randomized trials, however, have yielded contradictory results. The INSPIRATION-S trial found no benefit for 20 mg atorvastatin for 30 days in COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care, and the RESIST trial found the same with 40 mg atorvastatin for 10 days or hospital discharge in mild-to-moderate cases. Another study, on the other hand, claimed a shorter hospital stay and lower C-reactive protein levels with statins. Furthermore, a recent review that summarized the current evidence clarified this debate.

Consequently, we designed a randomized clinical trial to investigate the role of atorvastatin in hospitalized (severe and critical cases) COVID-19 patients on the 28-day mortality, clinical improvement, and 6-month mortality. We hypothesized that atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for 28 days would reduce the 28-day all-cause mortality in adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Atorvastatin for reduction of 28-day mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: a randomized controlled trial [^116krtiR]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

In COVID-19, early statin administration may be critical for the beneficial statin effects. As a result, studies that looked at outcomes in hospitalized patients who were already taking statins found that they had a higher chance of survival. In addition, a prospective trial found a marginal survival benefit in patients who started atorvastatin within seven days of symptom onset. On the other hand, we did not find that the time of symptom onset at the time of hospitalization interacts with the effect of statins on mortality — in the exploratory strata analysis.

In contrast to our results, a randomized controlled trial claimed that adding atorvastatin 40 mg to the standard regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir decreased hospital stays (8 vs. 10 days, P = 0.01) and CRP levels (P = 0.01). However, this trial included only 40 participants — vs 220 in our study — and administered atorvastatin for 5 days vs 28 days in our trial. Another observational retrospective study reported a slower progression to death associated with atorvastatin in patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU. On the other side, one randomized controlled trial suggested that 20 mg atorvastatin per day increased the length of hospital stay (4 days vs. 6, P = 0.001) and the risk of ICU admission (18.4% vs. 1.3%).

A high dose of atorvastatin (40 mg) appears to be safe in severe COVID-19 cases. The placebo group had four patients drop out, whereas the Atorvastatin group had one patient experience a significant increase in liver enzymes. Similarly, the INSPIRATION-S reported that atorvastatin was safe in COVID-19 intensive care patients. This may be not true with simvastatin, as the REMAP-CAP study reported increased CK and liver enzyme levels. Due to limited resources, we were unable to perform serial laboratory monitoring for CK level. There were no detected adverse events in the form of myalgia or unexplained weakness.

In our sample, the 28-day mortality rate was relatively high. Other studies, however, have shown similar rates early and throughout the pandemic. Additionally, we only included severe and critical patients. Throughout the pandemic, our center has been overloaded with severe and critical cases.

Figure 1
Enrolment, Randomisation, and Inclusion in the intention-to-treat analysis.

1576 patients were seen in the six hospitals; 599 (38%) had some exclusion criteria, mainly chronic use of statins in 582. Overall, 994 patients were invited to participate in the study, 328 (33%) refused to sign the informed consent, 649 were randomised and assigned to one of four arms of treatment. Of them, 3 subjects did not meet protocol selection criteria, 3 subjects were lost of follow-up and 10 patients withdrew; consequently, the primary outcome was unknown in 13 patients, so they were not included in the analysis. Finally, 633 patients were considered in the modified ITT analysis.

Regarding the patient baseline characteristics, their mean age was 55.4 (SD ± 12.8 years), and 205 (32%) were women. There was a history of diabetes in 76 (12%), hypertension in 176 (28%), COPD in 28 (4%) and smoking in 104 (16.4%). The median time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was 10 days. At the time of enrolment, 45 (7%) cases were classified as mild pneumonia, 425 (67%) as moderate and 163 (26%) as severe; 49 (8%) patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 57 (9%) on high flow nasal cannula, 418 (66%) were receiving oxygen alone, and 109 (17%) were not on supplemental oxygen (Table 1). Nonadherence to the assigned treatment varied between 29 (18%) and 41 (25%) patients per arm (Figure 1). In all four arms of the study, 98% of patients did not receive other antiviral or anti-inflammatory treatments, except for the use of dexamethasone as part of the standard of care (Table S2).

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^116LDdrW]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Plaque stabilization, and antithrombotic propertiesare also favorable characteristics of this class of drugs. It has previously been demonstrated in several series of COVID-19 patients that pre-existing cardiovascular disease is associated with risk for clinical decompensation and severe disease. Therefore, it is conceivable that antecedent statin use may confer benefit by preventing myocardial injury and infarction as well as thrombotic events, both of which may have influenced mortality and endotracheal intubation rates.

Other mechanisms, which may explain the effects of statin use in patients with COVID-19, have also been suggested. Functional membrane microdomains or lipid rafts consist of cholesterol and sphingolipids –, and viruses may gain entry to cells via receptors which are concentrated in these regions of the plasma membrane. Thus, it has been theorized that statin-mediated reduction in cholesterol levels may sufficiently alter the makeup of these lipid rafts, potentially preventing or reducing likelihood for viral infection or replication, and hence disease severity. Though lipid levels were not available for our entire cohort, we did find lower levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein in statin users. In addition, a recent computational docking analysis was performed to assess the interaction between an important SARS-CoV-2 protease (Mpro)and statins. Interestingly, these authors found that several statins demonstrated stronger interactions with Mpro than some protease inhibitors, implicating a potential mechanism by which statins may be able to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication. Preclinical evidence suggests that statins (as with ACEi and ARBs) can contribute to increased ACE2 expression and epigenetic modification. As ACE2 serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 to human hosts, it remains to be completely understood how the modulation and modification of ACE2 levels may impact viral replication and infectivity.

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^114CA3hd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in a hyperinflammatory state, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial injury, and thrombotic complications, among other sequelae. Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from February 1 st through May 12 th, 2020 with study period ending on June 11 th, 2020. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint includes in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, statin use is significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36–0.62, p < 0.001). We conclude that antecedent statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with lower inpatient mortality.

### Auxora vs. placebo for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: a randomized-controlled clinical trial [^114zUUeE]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Auxora was initially studied in patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS and hypoxemia. In this study, it was noted that Auxora decreased IL-6 levels in patients presenting with IL-6 ≥ 150 pg/mL, including 2 patients with values > 1000 pg/mL. This result was consistent with in vitro effects of Auxora on cytokine release in human lymphocytes. Based on these findings and the idea that COVID-19 pneumonia involved dysregulated immune and endothelial responses, it was hypothesized that Auxora may be effective in treating patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mortality and biomarker results from an initial, open-label study of Auxora in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia encouraged the transition to the current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CARDEA trial.

Results from the CARDEA trial suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of Auxora in addition to corticosteroids and standard of care in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. While not statistically significant, more patients with a baseline imputed PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 200 who received Auxora met the primary endpoint of time to recovery through Day 60. In addition, patients who received Auxora had a lower all-cause mortality rate at both Days 60 and 30. Patients, who required oxygen therapy via HFNC at baseline or had a baseline imputed PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 100 at baseline may have benefited the most from the addition of Auxora to corticosteroids and standard of care. There were similar trends when all randomized patients were analyzed.

Auxora was generally safe and well tolerated. Of note, reported AEs for elevated blood triglyceride levels and liver function tests were increased in patients in the Auxora arm when compared with placebo. None of the episodes of hypertriglyceridemia in the Auxora group were reported as being severe. One case of elevated transaminases in the Auxora group was considered severe and occurred in a patient also receiving remdesivir, simvastatin, and ezetimibe. The increased levels resolved with discontinuation of Auxora.

### Association between administration of systemic corticosteroids and… [^1118ns7V]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this prospective meta-analysis of 7 randomized trials that included 1703 patients of whom 647 died, 28-day all-cause mortality was lower among patients who received corticosteroids compared with those who received usual care or placebo. Meaning Administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Importance Effective therapies for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are needed, and clinical trial data have demonstrated that low-dose dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who required respiratory support. Objective To estimate the association between administration of corticosteroids compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality. The role of corticosteroids in treating severe infections has been an enduring controversy. 1–3 During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, rigorous data on the efficacy of corticosteroids have been limited. 4, 5 The pandemic has been a potent stimulus for clinical research addressing this controversy. While this initiative was in development, the UK-based Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy trial reported its findings from 6425 patients randomized to 6 mg/d of dexamethasone or usual care. Overall, dexamethasone resulted in an absolute reduction in mortality of 2. 8%.

The overall inverse variance–weighted fixed-effect risk ratio was 0. 80 for all-cause mortality comparing corticosteroids with usual care or placebo. The GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence that corticosteroids reduce all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 was moderate due to minor concerns across imprecision, a small amount of heterogeneity, and a small risk of reporting bias due to some trials not responding to the requests for data.

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome: potential of therapeutic interventions effective in treating progression from COVID-19 to treat progression from other illnesses-a systematic review [^112V5GkE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The resulting decrease in efficacy and capacity for gaseous exchangeis worsened by alveolar atelectasis. Where ARDS has advanced to the fibrotic stage, surfactant production is impeded, encouraging atelectasis. Despite physiological attempts to correct hypoxemia and hypercapnia presenting as dyspnoea, the condition deteriorates to refractory hypoxemia and respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV).MV incurs additional risks, including ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (eg, barotrauma), and an increased risk of nosocomial infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia. Prolonged MV increases the incidence of neuromuscular dysfunction, potentially triggering multiple-organ dysfunction. Other ARDS complications include mood disturbancesand organ dysfunction or failure. The leading cause of death is multiorgan failure, followed by thromboembolic complicationsand sepsis.

The widely heterogenous nature of ARDS has contributed to a lack of effective pharmacological treatments, although identifying the initial clinical insult can aid the selection of therapies. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) boost the lung and chest wall compliance, improving patient-ventilator synchrony and the extent of hypoxaemia, reducing oxygen consumption and the risk of VILI. In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of an NMBA for 48 hours improved patient survival and reduced ventilator dependence without causing muscle weakness. However, neuromuscular weakness can develop with their prolonged use, resulting in difficulties weaning patients off MV. Vasodilators are hypothesised to improve gaseous exchange relieving severe hypoxia, but therapy needs to be kept short term, and it is accepted that there is no mortality benefit. Bronchodilators may prevent worsening of alveolar-capillary permeability, helping to prevent further existing oedema, alongside offering potential anti-inflammatory effects, but studies have shown that they can be ineffective or even harmful in the treatment of ARDS. Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation and improve oxygenation and MV duration, but no significant changes in mortality rates have been reported, and their immunosuppressive actions may prolong viral replication. Despite the reported pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects of statins, their clinical benefit in ARDS remains inconsistent. Although surfactants do not improve mortality or MV duration in ARDS, they are thought to improve the mechanical properties of alveoli and, therefore, benefit CARDS patients, where clinical presentation is similar to infantile respiratory distress syndrome in which surfactants are routinely used. Alternative approaches include novel therapeutics such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release bioactive factors promoting repair of injured lung tissue. However, despite the wide range of therapeutics available, morbidity and mortality rates remain high.

Other therapies

ACE inhibitors and ARBs

ACE2 receptor–mediated endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2 is central to the viral life cycle. Conflicting data exist regarding the effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors and ARB, on ACE2 activity and levels in various human tissues and the resultant susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2. The totality of the available data is insufficient to recommend cessation of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in individuals with an existing indication for life-prolonging therapy with these drugs, and major societies have strongly recommended continuation of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy. An open label randomized trial is on the way to examine the effect of prophylactic ACE inhibitor and ARB withdrawal in COVID-19–naive individuals with essential hypertension as the sole indication for treatment on the risk of infection and subsequent complications. Based on the preclinical data described earlier in this review, 2 paired trials are currently underway examining losartan therapy in patients with COVID-19 who are ambulatory and hospitalized.

Statins

The anti-inflammatory pleiotropic effects of statins have been cultivated in different pathologic states. Statins have been shown in murine models of acute lung injury and in humans to attenuate the inflammatory component of acute lung injury. A multicenter randomized trial of simvastatin in patients with various causes of ARDS showed no difference as compared with placebo in ventilator-free days, multiorgan failure, and mortality. A subsequent study, subphenotyping the trial population in to hyperinflammatory versus hypoinflammatory ARDS, found a statistically significant improvement in survival with simvastatin in the hyperinflammatory group. A post hoc analysis of the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial observed a reduction in incident pneumonia with rosuvastatin. The benefit of statin therapy in the hyperinflammatory state in advanced COVID-19 is unknown.

### Simvastatin in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [^116Rm84R]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The efficacy of simvastatin in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is unclear.

Methods

In an ongoing international, multifactorial, adaptive platform, randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated simvastatin (80 mg daily) as compared with no statin (control) in critically ill patients with Covid-19 who were not receiving statins at baseline. The primary outcome was respiratory and cardiovascular organ support-free days, assessed on an ordinal scale combining in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and days free of organ support through day 21 in survivors; the analyis used a Bayesian hierarchical ordinal model. The adaptive design included prespecified statistical stopping criteria for superiority (> 99% posterior probability that the odds ratio was > 1) and futility (> 95% posterior probability that the odds ratio was < 1.2).

Results

Enrollment began on October 28, 2020. On January 8, 2023, enrollment was closed on the basis of a low anticipated likelihood that prespecified stopping criteria would be met as Covid-19 cases decreased. The final analysis included 2684 critically ill patients. The median number of organ support-free days was 11 (interquartile range, -1 to 17) in the simvastatin group and 7 (interquartile range, -1 to 16) in the control group; the posterior median adjusted odds ratio was 1.15 (95% credible interval, 0.98 to 1.34) for simvastatin as compared with control, yielding a 95.9% posterior probability of superiority. At 90 days, the hazard ratio for survival was 1.12 (95% credible interval, 0.95 to 1.32), yielding a 91.9% posterior probability of superiority of simvastatin. The results of secondary analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis. Serious adverse events, such as elevated levels of liver enzymes and creatine kinase, were reported more frequently with simvastatin than with control.

Conclusions

Although recruitment was stopped because cases had decreased, among critically ill patients with Covid-19, simvastatin did not meet the prespecified criteria for superiority to control. (REMAP-CAP ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02735707.).

In this large analysis from a quaternary academic medical institution in an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrated that antecedent statin use was associated with significantly lower rates of in-hospital mortality within 30 days. These results indicate the important need for randomized controlled trials evaluating the benefits of statin therapy in patients affected by COVID-19.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^114qrrXM]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Potential explanations for the observed findings

These findings can be explained in several ways. First, it is possible that statin treatment in this study had a small protective role, which was not detected. Despite our re-estimation of the sample size, the primary efficacy outcome event rate was lower than expected. This issue might have been multifactorial, including more frequent use of corticosteroids, better general care in the ICU, and lower acuity of illness in some patients. Second, it is possible that statin treatment is beneficial in early covid-19 before the inflammatory response leads to irreversible damage. This is in line with the prespecified subgroup analysis that suggested a potential treatment effect in patients who were enrolled within the first seven days of hospital admission. However, as this finding was not adjusted for multiplicity, the results should be considered exploratory. Third, it is possible that the effect of statins on venous or arterial thrombosis or mortality become apparent beyond the 30 days of follow-up. Assessment of outcomes at 90 days is still ongoing and will be reported in the future.

The rate of thrombotic events in the current study was lower than in several other studies. In INSPIRATION-S, routine imaging screening for thrombotic disease was not part of the study protocol. Imaging tests were performed only in cases of clinical suspicion. Although underdiagnosis is possible, many more patients were tested with imaging than those with an ultimate diagnosis of thrombosis. Among patients who had diagnostic imaging tests for venous thromboembolism, the proportion with confirmed venous thromboembolism was 13% (supplementary table S2). Some studies suggest that most thrombotic events in patients admitted to the ICU with covid-19 include subsegmental pulmonary embolism, distal deep vein thrombosis, and catheter associated thrombosis, which are less severe forms of venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, recent large multicenter observational studiessuggest lower event rates for venous thromboembolism in covid-19 than initially estimated in smaller studies; a finding that was confirmed in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis. This finding could be partly related to more frequent use of prophylactic anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory treatments in more recent studies, compared with those that were conducted early during the covid-19 pandemic.

### Statin use and mortality in COVID-19 patients: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111z33BM]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Statin therapy is administered to patients with high cardiovascular risk. These patients are also at risk for severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Statins exhibit not only cardioprotective but also immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This study performed a systematic review of published evidence regarding statin treatment and COVID-19 related mortality.

Methods

A systematic PubMed/Embase search was performed from February 10, 2020 until March 05, 2021 for studies in COVID-19 patients that reported adjusted hazard or odds ratio for death in statin users versus non-users.

Results

22 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n = 41,807, weighted age 56 ± 8 years, men 51%, hypertension 34%, diabetes 21%, statin users 14%) that reported adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in statin users versus non-users showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.53, 0.81). Meta-analysis of 6 studies that reported continuation of statin therapy during hospitalization (58–100% of patients) revealed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI 0.47, 0.62). Meta-analysis of 12 studies (n = 72,881, weighted age 65 ± 2 years, men 54%, hypertension 66%, diabetes 43%, statin users 30%) that reported adjusted odds ratios for mortality showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% CI 0.55, 0.78). Multivariable meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant association of hazard or odds ratios with anthropometric characteristics or comorbidities.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies showed that statin therapy was associated with an about 35% decrease in the adjusted risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Impact of prior statin use on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients: data from tertiary referral hospitals during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy [^115WZtow]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of statins may reduce the risk of infections and infection-related complications.

Objective

We aimed to assess the impact of prior statin use on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality.

Methods

In this observational multicenter study, consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were enrolled. In-hospital mortality and severity of COVID-19 assessed with National Early Warning Score (NEWS) were deemed primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to obtain balanced cohorts.

Results

Among 842 patients enrolled, 179 (21%) were treated with statins before admission. Statin patients showed more comorbidities and more severe COVID-19 (NEWS 4 [IQR 2–6] vs 3 [IQR 2–5], p < 0.001). Despite having similar rates of intensive care unit admission, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation, statin users appeared to show higher mortality rates. After balancing pre-existing relevant clinical conditions that could affect COVID-19 prognosis with PS matching, statin therapy confirmed its association with a more severe disease (NEWS ≥ 5 61% vs. 48%, p = 0.025) but not with in-hospital mortality (26% vs. 28%, p = 0.185). At univariate logistic regression analysis, statin use was confirmed not to be associated with mortality (OR 0.901; 95% CI: 0.537 to 1.51; p = 0.692) and to be associated with a more severe disease (NEWS ≥ 5 OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.067–2.71; p = 0.026).

Conclusions

Our results did not confirm the supposed favorable effects of statin therapy on COVID-19 outcomes. Conversely, they suggest that statin use should be considered as a proxy of underlying comorbidities, which indeed expose to increased risks of more severe COVID-19.

### Statins and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes mellitus: a retrospective cohort study with propensity score matching [^1144nnUJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Statins are usually the first line of treatment as lipid-lowering agents and are used widely in patients with cardiovascular risks. Apart from their lipid-lowering effects, statins have also been known for their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory effects, and vasculo-protective effects, and these pleiotropic effects of statins have prompted exploration of any possible benefits of statins in the COVID-19 disease. An early study conducted in China noted that inpatient statin use was associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients. Subsequently, multiple retrospective cohort studies, including one conducted by us, noted the association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, none of these studies looked at the inpatient statin therapy and continuation of statins in the inpatient setting among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

However, literature is scarce on the role of statins in patients with DM developing COVID-19 infection. The study by Saeed et al. noted that inpatient statin use was associated with decreased mortality in patients with DM and COVID-19, whereas the results from CORONADO study suggest increased mortality among the antecedent statin users in COVID-19 patients with DM. These conflicting results led us to explore the association of inpatient statin use with mortality, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation in the patients hospitalized with COVID-19, among a majority Black patient population. We also explored if the association between statins and clinical outcomes was any different in the subset of patients with DM. Additionally, we also looked at the intensity-response relationship of inpatient statins in COVID-19 patients. We also investigated if the continuation of statin therapy in the inpatient setting has any association with clinical outcomes among the COVID-19 patients who were using antecedent statins as home medication.

### Survival of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving atorvastatin: a randomized clinical trial [^113vpCjR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

As statins decrease the progression of sepsis and its related mortality, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on survival and symptom improvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This randomized controlled trial was performed on 156 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Bojnourd city in 2021. Patients were randomly divided into comparison (standard therapy: hydroxychloroquine + Kaletra®) and intervention groups (atorvastatin 20mg, SD, plus standard therapy). The main outcomes were the rate of symptom improvement, duration of hospitalization, need for intubation, and mortality rate. In this study, seven patients died, two patients (2.6%) in the comparison group and five (6.6%) in the intervention group. The mean hospitalization days (p = 0.001), the pulse rate (p = 0.004), and the frequency of hospitalization in the ICU ward (18.4% vs. 1.3%) were longer and greater in the intervention group. The remission probability in the comparison group was greater (p = 0.0001). The median hospitalization days in the intervention group was longer (p < 0.001) and remission in the comparison group occurred 1.71 times sooner (hazard ratio = 1.70, 95% confidence interval = 1.22–2.38, p = 0.002). Totally, adding atorvastatin to the standard regime in this study increased hospitalization days and imposed negative effects on symptom improvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^1154oATc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Our study has important limitations. We performed propensity matched analysis and multivariable adjustment to minimize the likelihood for confounding. As a retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data, however, there remains the potential for unmeasured confounders. In addition, we also performed a number of sensitivity analyses and findings remained consistent. In addition, medication reporting and reconciliation in the electronic medical record, especially in the setting of the ongoing pandemic, may have been subject to errors on the part of individual clinicians. While the primary endpoint of in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in antecedent statin users, it remains to be seen whether patients who survived (possibly in-part due to prior statin therapy) may experience long-term morbidity and sequelae of COVID-19 infection, and further analyses are needed in this regard. Moreover, it was not possible to verify duration of statin therapy or patient adherence with statin therapy. However, patients in the antecedent statin group had better lipid profiles, suggestive of medication effect. In addition, errors with data entry are unlikely to affect the primary endpoint, inpatient mortality. To increase the capacity for critical care interventions, multiple temporary intensive care units (ICU) were created in previously non-ICU patient care areas at our institution. Thus, assessment for need for ICU level-of-care or outcomes in ICU patients was not possible. We did, however, assess need for invasive mechanical ventilation as part of the key secondary endpoint, a therapy which was almost exclusively used in ICU settings. Further, patients who are receiving statins may reflect overall better outpatient care, and possibly a low-risk cohort. However, patients on statins were much older, and had a more severe burden of comorbidities in our study. Moreover, we examined proxy variables for socioeconomic status, including NYC borough of residence and medical insurance, and these were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, missingness for disease and drug variables cannot be quantified, as there were no codes to indicate that data were missing. It was assumed that a characteristic was not present if the patient's record did not include information on it, such as hypertension or the use of statins. Lastly, a small proportion of patients (2.5%) included in this analysis remained hospitalized at the end of study period, and so reporting on in-hospital outcomes in such patients remains incomplete at this time.

### Safety and effectiveness of statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: systematic review and collaborative meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116k1crF]. Thrombosis Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Statins may impact COVID-19 outcomes through lipid-mediated and lipid-independent pathways. However, the clinical impact of statin therapy among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remains unclear due to the limited power of existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov was conducted through July 17th, 2024. RCTs were included if they compared statin therapy to control (placebo or standard care) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and enrolled at least 250 randomized participants. Studies with co-treatment were considered in sensitivity analyses. The primary effectiveness outcome was 30-day all-cause death. The main safety outcomes were myopathy and rise in liver enzymes.

Results

Three RCTs were included in the main analysis (3882 statin-naive patients, 33.7% female, average follow-up duration 37 days). Compared with control, statin therapy was associated with reduced all-cause death (20.9% vs. 23.8%; odds ratio [OR]: 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70–0.96; P = 0.01), with a small but significant increase in myopathy (0.6% vs. 0%; risk difference: 0.00, 95% CI -0.00; 0.01), and no significant difference in liver enzyme abnormalities (1.0% vs. 1.4%; OR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.25–3.99). A sensitivity analysis including two additional RCTs that included randomized co-treatments yielded similar findings. There were no significant interactions for effectiveness by disease severity (critically vs. non-critically ill, P = 0.38) or sex (males vs. females, P = 0.83).

Conclusion

Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in 30-day all-cause death compared with control and exhibited an excellent safety profile.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^114cfggs]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Efficacy

Because no interactions occurred between the two interventions (ie, anticoagulation intensity and use of atorvastatin) for the primary efficacy outcome based on Mantel Haenszel χ² test (P = 0.97 for interaction), the results for statin randomization are reported independently. By 30 day follow-up, the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 95 (33%) patients assigned to atorvastatin and 108 (36%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.21, P = 0.35, fig 2). This translated to a risk difference of −3.6% (95% confidence interval −11.2% to 4.0%). Results for the primary outcome were largely driven by all cause mortality: 90 (31%) deaths occurred in the atorvastatin group and 103 (35%) in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.22). No patient was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

The use of imaging tests for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism was similar between the study groups 57 (20%) in the atorvastatin group and 58 (20%) in the placebo group; P = 0.64). These tests included 17 computed tomography pulmonary angiograms in each group, and 40 venous doppler studies in the atorvastatin group and 41 in the placebo group (supplementary table S4). Venous thromboembolism was diagnosed in six (2%) patients assigned to atorvastatin and nine (3%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 2.06). The rate of arterial thrombosis did not differ significantly between the two groups (0% v 0.3%, risk difference −0.3%, 95% confidence interval −0.9% to 0.3%; P = 0.32). Adjudicated type I myocardial infarction was not clinically diagnosed in either group.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^115kVgSP]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study INSPIRATION-S was published by INSPIRATION-S Investigators. and colleagues in 2022 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the INSPIRATION-S study, the trial question was: what is the role of atorvastatin in critically ill adult patients with COVID-19? In the INSPIRATION-S study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the INSPIRATION-S study, the population was: 587 patients (256 female, 331 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were estimated survival < 24 hours; weight < 40 kg; major bleeding or serious bleeding diathesis within 30 days from enrollment; liver enzymes > 5 times the ULN; active liver disease; CK concentration > 500 U/L. In the INSPIRATION-S study, the interventions were: n = 290 atorvastatin (20 mg per oral daily for 30 days) n = 297 placebo (matching placebo). In the INSPIRATION-S study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with ECMO, or death from any cause at day 30 (33% vs. 36%; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.21). In the INSPIRATION-S study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause (31% vs. 35%; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22) No significant difference in VTE (2% vs. 3%; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.06) No significant difference in arterial thrombosis (0% vs. 0.3%; ARD -0.3, 95% CI -0.9 to 0.3). In the INSPIRATION-S study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in elevated liver enzymes, fatal bleeding. In the INSPIRATION-S study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, atorvastatin was not superior to placebo with respect to venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with ECMO, or death from any cause at day 30.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^111UMYt3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

General principles of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy — During the early phase of infection, when viral load is high and the host's adaptive immune response has not mounted, treatments targeting viral replication are most likely to be effective; these include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, molnupiravir, remdesivir, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and donor convalescent plasma, and timely initiation is critical because they are more efficacious when given within 5 to 7 days of symptom onset. Most patients do not progress to severe or critical disease, but some with risk factors do; later in the disease process, in severe and especially critical disease, an excessive and aberrant inflammatory response is implicated as the primary cause of immunopathological damage, and anti-inflammatory therapies like corticosteroids, IL-6 inhibitors or JAK inhibitors have been shown to be beneficial.

### Statin therapy did not improve the in-hospital outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection [^113CLsCJ]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) number of death cases is still increasing. One of the comorbidities associated with severe outcome and mortality of COVID-19 is dyslipidemia. Statin is one of the drugs which is most commonly used for the treatment of dyslipidemic patients. This study aims to analyze the association between statin use and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 infection.

Methods

We systematically searched the Google Scholar database using specific keywords related to our aims until August 1st, 2020. All articles published on COVID-19 and statin were retrieved. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software.

Results

A total of 9 studies with a total of 3449 patients were included in our analysis. Our meta-analysis showed that statin use did not improve severity outcome [OR 1.64 (95% CI 0.51–5.23), p = 0.41, I² = 93%, random-effect modelling] nor mortality rate from COVID-19 infection [OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.50–1.21), p = 0.26, I² = 0%, fixed-effect modelling].

Conclusion

Statin use did not improve in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 infections. Patients with dyslipidemia should continue taking statin drugs despite COVID-19 infection status, given its beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes.

### Simvastatin in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [^113dZekY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) was published by REMAP-CAP Investigators and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the trial question was: what is the role of simvastatin in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection? In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the population was: 2688 patients (907 female, 1781 male). The inclusion criteria were critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who were not receiving statins at baseline. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of statin therapy or another medication that could not be co-administered with simvastatin; severe liver disease; a creatinine level > 2.26 mg/dL unless the patient was receiving RRT; a duration of > 48 hours since the start of organ support in an ICU. In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the interventions were: n = 1846 simvastatin (at a dose of 80 mg daily) n = 842 no statin (standard of care without any simvastatin). In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median number of organ support-free days (11 days vs. 7 days; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.34). In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in in-hospital survival (73.4% vs. 70%; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.27) No significant difference in progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO, or death (37% vs. 42.5%; OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02) Significant increase in median respiratory support-free days (18 days vs. 14 days; OR 1.16, 95% CI 1 to 1.35). In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the REMAP-CAP (COVID-19, simvastatin) study, the conclusion was: in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who were not receiving statins at baseline, simvastatin was not superior to no statin with respect to median number of organ support-free days.

### Association between antecedent statin use and severe disease outcomes in COVID-19: a retrospective study with propensity score matching [^1164ASnV]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Statins have been associated with a reduction in inflammatory markers and improved endothelial function. Whether statins offer any benefit in COVID-19 needs to be elucidated.

Objective

To determine the association between antecedent statin use and severe disease outcomes among COVID-19 patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study on 1014 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Outcomes were mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and intensive care admission. Patients were classified into statin-users vs statin non-users based on antecedent use of statins. Multivariable regression analysis was performed adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, insurance, and comorbidities. Propensity score matching was performed to achieve a 1:1 balanced cohort.

Results

A total of 1014 patients (Median age 65 (IQR 53–73); 530 (52.3%) males; 753 (74.3%) African Americans; median BMI 29.4 (IQR 25.1–35.9); 615 (60.7%) with Medicare insurance) were included in the study. About 454 patients (44.77%) were using statins as home medication. Antecedent statin use was associated with significant decrease in mortality in the total cohort (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46–0.95; p = 0.03). Among the propensity score matched (PSM) cohort of 466 patients (233 statin users and 233 statin non-users), all the baseline characteristics had similar distribution among the two groups. Statin users had significant reduction in mortality in the PSM cohort as well (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37–0.83; p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Statin use was associated with significant reduction in mortality among COVID-19 patients. These findings support the pursuit of randomized clinical trials to explore the possible benefits of statins in COVID-19.

### Could statins help treat COVID-19? [^116Yd7Un]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Their findings haven't consistently linked the drugs with a lower short-term risk of dying after contracting COVID-19. These observational studies found an association between statin use and lower mortality among patients with COVID-19: In an article published earlier this year, Gupta and her colleagues found that among 1296 New York City patients hospitalized with COVID-19,
26. 5% of patients who hadn't been taking statins died within 30 days of hospital admission compared with 14. 8% of patients who used the drugs. Wayne State University researchers found that in a cohort of 466 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those who had been taking moderate or high doses of statins, but not low doses, had a significantly reduced risk of dying compared with those who had not been taking statins. The study didn't find a significant association between statin use and intensive care unit admission or the need for mechanical ventilation.

The aforementioned Italian study in JAMA Internal Medicine analyzed data from about 4000 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Lombardy, Italy, ICUs. Long-term treatment with statins, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, β-blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and anticoagulants before admission was associated with higher mortality but only in an unadjusted analysis. Unmeasured confounders, as opposed to the drugs themselves, could explain that observation, the authors noted. The trial involved ICU patients with COVID-19 in Iran. It was designed to answer 2 primary questions: whether a higher anticoagulant dose or a newly prescribed statin could reduce the risk of dying within 30 days of hospital admission. Patients were randomized to a higher dose or standard dose of anticoagulant therapy, and then each of those groups was randomized to 20 mg per day of atorvastatin or a placebo.

In addition, Bikdeli said, the trial results don't rule out the possibility that initiating statin therapy might help patients with COVID-19 who don't require ICU care, including people with long COVID who have persistent symptoms. Or, perhaps, doubling the atorvastatin dose would be effective in the ICU, Bikdeli said, adding that he is considering a trial to answer that question.

### Atorvastatin for reduction of 28-day mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients: a randomized controlled trial [^11286SkR]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this double-blind randomized controlled trial of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for 28 days — compared with placebo — did not reduce the 28-day mortality. Likewise, atorvastatin did not reduce the risk of major secondary outcomes like in-hospital mortality, 6-month mortality, AKI, or IMV.

Like our results, a randomized clinical trial showed that a lower dose of atorvastatin (20 mg) once daily in ICU patients with COVID‐19 for 30 days did not reduce the composite outcome of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or all‐cause mortality. The authors supposed that the effect of atorvastatin on thrombosis or mortality may be shown beyond the 30-day follow‐up; therefore, they plan to extend the follow-up for 90 days. Another randomized trial of non-critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported that the combination of colchicine and rosuvastatin in addition to standard of care didn't appear to reduce the risk of progression of COVID-19 disease or thromboembolic events. More recently, the international REMAP-CAP study did not find a superiority of simvastatin over the control regarding the cardiovascular and respiratory organ support-free days in COVID-19 patients.

### Immunomodulatory therapy for the management of severe COVID-19. beyond the anti-viral therapy: a comprehensive review [^1155x8pN]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related to Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) may cause severe illness in 20% of patients. This may be in part due to an uncontrolled immune-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection triggering a systemic hyperinflammatory response, the so-called "cytokine storm". The reduction of this inflammatory immune-response could be considered as a potential therapeutic target against severe COVID-19. The relationship between inflammation and clot activation must also be considered. Furthermore, we must keep in mind that currently, no specific antiviral treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2. While moderate-severe forms need in-hospital surveillance plus antivirals and/or hydroxychloroquine; in severe and life-threating subsets a high intensity anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy could be a therapeutic option. However, right data on the effectiveness of different immunomodulating drugs are scarce. Herein, we discuss the pathogenesis and the possible role played by drugs such as: antimalarials, anti-IL6, anti-IL-1, calcineurin and JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, heparins, angiotensin-converting enzyme agonists and statins in severe COVID-19.

Other ongoing and completed studies

It is conceivable that lipid modulating agents might affect the risk of thrombosis or inflammation in patients with covid-19. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials are assessing the effects of lipid modulating agents, including statins, omega 3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin across the spectrum of illness severity in covid-19. Specifically, for patients admitted to the ICU, three additional trials are ongoing (NCT04813471, NCT04359095, and NCT04631536) and the results will be informative about whether statins do have a benefit in the treatment of acute severe covid-19. In the adaptive Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community-acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) trial (NCT02735707), simvastatin (80 mg orally once daily for up to 28 days) is being compared with no treatment. The main study outcomes include days alive not receiving organ support in the ICU by day 21, and 90 day all cause death.

A distinct treatment effect for statins based on the underlying inflammatory biomarkers is possible. INSPIRATION-S, however, did not have a prespecified biomarker study. Results from other randomized controlled trials, assessing the results based on background and interval changes in biomarkers and use of other anti-inflammatory drugs (such as corticosteroids) should elucidate this issue.

The daily dose of statin used in the current study (atorvastatin 20 mg once daily) was relatively similar to that used in HARP-2 (simvastatin 80 mg once daily). This dose was chosen in INSPIRATION-S to minimize the risk of statin associated adverse effects, especially by coadministration of antiviral agents. The rates of statin associated adverse events (increased liver enzyme levels and myopathy) were, however, low in the current study. This observation is in part explained by the brief period of study intervention, compared with cardiovascular trials in which patients receive statin treatment for months or years. In this regard, atorvastatin 40 mg once daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily might have been more effective without compromising safety.

Randomization and allocation concealment

A randomization Table (1:1) was created by a pharmacist who was not involved in the study using computer-generated random permuted blocks (4, or 6 in each block). The same pharmacist assigned patients to either group without providing the study group with the randomization table. After evaluating the inclusion criteria, randomization was carried out within 24 h of hospital admission.

For 28 days, patients were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin (Atorstat, Delta Pharm Co. Egypt) 40 mg/day orally (group A) or placebo (group B). During the hospitalization, all cases received corticosteroids and prophylactic anticoagulation. All patients received medical care according to the local hospital protocol and at the discretion of the treating physician. The placebo is similar to the original drug in terms of the drug package, tablet color, consistency, and size. Unconscious or ventilated patients received the drug through a nasogastric tube.

Blinding

Patients, caregivers, data collectors, and data analysts were all blinded to the study group. Delta Pharma (Egypt) supplied the atorvastatin and a similar placebo. The company did not participate in any aspect of the study, including participant recruitment, data collection, data analysis, or results reporting. The company prepared a similar drug and placebo package (labeled as A and B). Even the pharmacist, who is involved in treatment allocation, had no idea about what treatment group is — only A or B. In this manuscript, we used "A" to describe the Atorvastatin group and "B" to describe the placebo group. This is not necessarily the drug labels used in the study.

Criteria for discontinuation

We daily monitored patients for adverse events; if the patient developed myalgia or unexplained weakness, we checked CK levels and stopped if CK was > 10 times ULN, drug-induced hepatitis, or serum transaminases were > 8 times ULN. Patients who received azole antifungals had a lower monitoring threshold for liver injury and rhabdomyolysis.

According to local hospital protocol, all patients received the standard of care. Antiviral therapy was permitted.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^114akMNt]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

### Use of repurposed and adjuvant drugs in hospital patients with COVID-19: multinational network cohort study [^111RwtXh]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

By the end of 2020, more than 85 million confirmed cases of covid-19 and almost 2 000 000 related deaths occurred worldwide. Despite a lack of evidence on effectiveness, several medicines were repurposed in the first few months of the pandemic on the basis of in vitro antiviral activity.

For the purpose of illustration, the US Food and Drug Administration gave emergency approval for use of hydroxychloroquine on 28 March 2020 but revoked this on 15 June 2020and the Recovery and Solidarity trials also found little benefit associated with hydroxychloroquine use. Remdesivir was also proposed as treatment for covid-19 after showing in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. An international placebo controlled randomised controlled trial showed a decrease in time to recovery. The Solidarity trial, however, suggested that remdesivir has no benefit on mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and duration of hospital stay. Other drugs, such as interferon and lopinavir combined with ritonavir have also been shown to be ineffective.

In the absence of approved antivirals for the treatment of covid-19, the cornerstone of management has been supportive care, with adjunctive treatments playing a major role. The two recognised drug classes used for adjunctive treatment are corticosteroids and anticytokines (eg, tocilizumab). A large randomised controlled trial and meta-analysis showed that the glucocorticosteroid dexamethasone and corticosteroids reduced mortality among patients receiving mechanical ventilation or oxygen. Tocilizumab was found to significantly reduce mortality in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. Although additional adjunctive treatments are recognised in 2020 guidelines, including antithrombotics, statins, and antihypertensives, recommendations for covid-19 treatment in clinical guidelines have varied both geographically and temporally.

Regulators and public health agencies need to keep up with trends in covid-19 clinical practice. Tweets and press conferences have been shown to influence entire practice patterns but based on little evidence for the utility of treatments. Although attention has shifted to vaccine surveillance since December 2020, there is still a need to understand what treatments are effective for individual patients and at what harm This body of evidence is critical for comparative purposes as more data become available during the pandemic. With known problems in the supply chain for certain drugs, an understanding of what drugs are being used to treat covid-19 at different stages of the disease could help resource constrained environments.

### Outpatient atorvastatin use and severe COVID-19 outcomes: a population-based study [^115HqZek]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Evidence of the effect of statins on patients with coronavirus disease (2019) COVID-19 is inconsistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between chronic use of statins-both overall and by active ingredient-and severe outcomes of COVID-19 (risk of hospitalization and mortality), progression to severe outcomes, and susceptibility to the virus. We conducted a population-based case-control study with data from electronic records to assess the risk of (1) hospitalization: cases were patients admitted due to COVID-19 and controls were subjects without COVID-19; (2) mortality: cases were hospitalized patients who died due to COVID-19 and controls were subjects without COVID-19; (3) progression: cases were hospitalized COVID-19 subjects and controls were nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients; and (4) susceptibility: cases were patients with COVID-19 (both hospitalized and nonhospitalized) and controls were subjects without COVID-19. We collected data on 2821 hospitalized cases, 26996 nonhospitalized cases, and 52318 controls. Chronic use of atorvastatin was associated with a decreased risk of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] = 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74–0.92) and mortality (aOR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53–0.93), attributable in part to a lower risk of susceptibility to the virus (aOR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86–0.96). Simvastatin was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (aOR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40–0.87). The wide degree of heterogeneity observed in the estimated odds ratios (ORs) of the different statins suggests that there is no class effect. The results of this real-world study suggest that chronic use of atorvastatin (and to a lesser degree, of simvastatin) is associated with a decrease in risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^11592kGY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Widespread vaccination, hybrid immunity, and reduced pathogenicity with circulating Omicron variants have decreased the rate of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in the general population. Certain patients with COVID-19 remain at high risk for severe outcomes. Clinicians must individualize treatments based on expected benefits and relative harms for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Guideline-directed therapy for severe and critical COVID-19 has remained static over the last couple of years. Data on immunomodulatory agents have improved our understanding of the management of severe and critical COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains on the role and timing of these agents in the Omicron era.

### Effect of antiplatelet therapy on survival and organ support in critically ill patients with COVID-19… [^111JN2bU]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Does antiplatelet therapy administered to critically ill patients with COVID-19 improve organ support–free days up to day 21. Findings In this bayesian randomized clinical trial that included 1557 patients, antiplatelet therapy with either aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor, compared with no antiplatelet therapy, resulted in a
95. 7% posterior probability of futility with regard to the odds of improvement in organ support–free days within 21 days. Meaning Among critically ill patients with COVID-19, there was a low likelihood that treatment with an antiplatelet agent provided improvement in organ support–free days within 21 days. Importance The efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is uncertain. Objective To determine whether antiplatelet therapy improves outcomes for critically ill adults with COVID-19.

Conclusions and Relevance Among critically ill patients with COVID-19, treatment with an antiplatelet agent, compared with no antiplatelet agent, had a low likelihood of providing improvement in the number of organ support–free days within 21 days. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT02735707. Accordingly, despite a high occurrence of thrombosis, optimal antithrombotic strategies in critically ill patients remain unknown. Platelet activation has been implicated in the COVID-19 inflammatory response, 11, 12 and autopsies have shown microvascular thrombi with megakaryocyte and platelet-fibrin deposition in the setting of organ failure. 13–15 In this trial, the effect of antiplatelet therapy on the composite of hospital survival and organ support provision for up to 21 days was evaluated in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Five patients were censored before 90 days. The estimated mortality rate at 90 days for the control group was 32. 7% and for the pooled antiplatelet group was
29. 5%.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^112y5aAg]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

To avoid type I error inflation, it was prespecified to not conduct interim analyses to test the superior efficacy of atorvastatin versus placebo. The data and safety monitoring board had independent access to the study data and conducted prespecified interim safety analyses at 25%, 50%, and 75% of recruitment.

Patients enrolled between 29 July 2020 and 19 November 2020 were considered for eligibility to be randomized to anticoagulation, followed by randomization to statin treatment. At trial design phase, considering a two sided type I error rate of 0.05 and a 25% relative risk reduction for the primary outcome with statin treatment compared with placebo, the investigators estimated a priori that the study would be underpowered to detect a significant difference between the groups (supplementary fig S1). Therefore, the study protocol prespecified that if resources allowed and the study investigators agreed to collaborate, enrollment for the statin randomization could be continued after completion of enrollment for the anticoagulation hypothesis (ie, randomization to intermediate dose prophylactic anticoagulation versus standard dose prophylactic anticoagulation). To maintain harmony with eligibility criteria, the steering committee used the same eligibility criteria (including the anticoagulation hypothesis eligibility criteria) for patients who would be considered only for the statin randomization. By the time randomization of 600 patients was completed for the anticoagulation study, 364 were assigned to atorvastatin or to placebo. Based on an estimated event rate of 55% from the pre-randomization period at enrolling sites, this sample size would have provided a 63% power to detect a significant difference for the primary outcome between the two groups for the statin randomization. Considering an actual pooled event rate of 44.8% for the primary outcome in the INSPIRATION (anticoagulation) study, a sample of 596 patients was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a significant difference for the primary outcome between statin treatment and placebo. The target sample size for INSPIRATION-S was increased to 626 patients (313 in each group) to account for an exclusion rate of 5% owing to duplicate or incorrect entries. Therefore, enrollment for only the statin randomization was planned to continue from 20 November 2021. On 4 April 2021 the steering committee terminated enrollment owing to the lack of additional funding and the excessive burden of new enrollment to site investigators. By that time, 605 patients were randomized to receive atorvastatin or placebo.

### Atorvastatin associated with decreased hazard for death in COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU: a retrospective cohort study [^112d1qnz]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

To the editor,

Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic, the medical community started a race against time to find effective treatments for this disease. Atorvastatin as adjuvant immunomodulatory therapy is of particular interest given its low cost, known safety profile, and availability. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to interact with Toll-like receptors on the host cell membrane, increasing the expression of the MYD88 gene, ultimately activating NF-κB and triggering inflammatory pathways. Experimental models have demonstrated that statins stabilize MYD88 levels after a pro-inflammatory trigger, and, in a murine model, atorvastatin significantly attenuated NF-κB activation. Furthermore, in the real world, two retrospective cohort studies reported a reduced risk of influenza death among statin users. Therefore, we assessed whether statin users at a dose of 40 mg daily had reduced inpatient mortality hazard from COVID-19.

In this retrospective cohort study, we used a de-identified dataset that included 87 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our community hospital intensive care unit (ICU) located in Evanston, IL, from March to May 2020. We performed a Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model to examine the relationship between adjuvant treatments and inpatient mortality. To minimize confounders, we adjusted for age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, invasive mechanical ventilation, severity according to the National Institutes of Health criteria (respiratory rate > 30, SpO₂ < 94%, PaO₂/FiO₂ < 300 mmHg or lung infiltrates > 50%), number of comorbidities (as a continuous variable), and other adjuvant therapies (including hydroxychloroquine, intravenous steroids, azithromycin, tocilizumab, colchicine, and antibiotics), forcing these variables into the model. We also performed a sensitivity analysis calculating the E value (with the lower confidence limit) as described by VanderWeele et al. for the obtained point estimate. The E value is defined as the minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, conditional on the measured covariates, to explain away a specific exposure-outcome association fully.

### Relation of statin use prior to admission to severity and recovery among COVID-19 inpatients [^112NeyxM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The impact of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and recovery is important given their high prevalence of use among individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. We studied the association between use of statin/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/ARB in the month before hospital admission, with risk of severe outcome, and with time to severe outcome or disease recovery, among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We performed a retrospective single-center study of all patients hospitalized at University of California San Diego Health between February 10, 2020 and June 17, 2020 (n = 170 hospitalized for COVID-19, n = 5,281 COVID-negative controls). Logistic regression and competing risks analyses were used to investigate progression to severe disease (death or intensive care unit admission), and time to discharge without severe disease. Severe disease occurred in 53% of COVID-positive inpatients. Median time from hospitalization to severe disease was 2 days; median time to recovery was 7 days. Statin use prior to admission was associated with reduced risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.11 to 0.71, p < 0.01) and faster time to recovery among those without severe disease (adjusted HR for recovery 2.69, 95%CI 1.36 to 5.33, p < 0.01). The association between statin use and severe disease was smaller in the COVID-negative cohort (p for interaction = 0.07). There was potential evidence of faster time to recovery with ARB use (adjusted HR 1.92, 95%CI 0.81 to 4.56). In conclusion, statin use during the 30 days prior to admission for COVID-19 was associated with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19, and a faster time to recovery among patients without severe disease.

### Statins and SARS-CoV-2 infection: results of a population-based prospective cohort study of 469 749 adults from 2 Canadian provinces [^117QSH7m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our results stand in stark contrast to the previously published small observational studies, suggesting benefits with statins in COVID‐19 that we discussed in our introduction. However, our study is several magnitudes larger and we were able to adjust for a host of potential confounders and also included an analysis weighted by propensity for statin use that those studies did not. This confirms the longstanding tenet that there are caveats to observational studies that limit extrapolating their findings to recommendations about treatment. Given our sample size and findings, we do not think randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of statins on COVID‐19 outcomes are likely to be informative in patients younger than 75 years. In fact, preliminary results from the INSPIRATION‐S (The Intermediate Versus Standard‐Dose Prophylactic Anticoagulation in Critically‐Ill Patients With COVID‐19: An Open Label Randomized Controlled Trial ‐ Statin) trial revealed no mortality difference for atorvastatin versus placebo in 587 patients with COVID‐19 admitted to ICUs. Based on our data demonstrating mortality of 31.3% at 30 days in those older than 75 years not taking statins, we estimate that ≈7000 patients would need to be randomized to statin versus placebo to establish or refute (with 80% power) at least a 10% mortality difference with statin use in individuals with COVID‐19 over age 75 years. Until such a randomized trial is conducted, we believe the most reasonable assumption is that while statins have many indications for which definitive proof of their benefit already exists, prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or improving outcomes in those hospitalized with COVID‐19 are unproven. However, our data do demonstrate the safety of continuing statin therapy in patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2.

### Promises and challenges of personalized medicine to guide ARDS therapy [^114vNdbH]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential treatment responses in ARDS biologic phenotypes

Inflammatory phenotypes typically defined as hyperinflammatory/reactive and hypoinflammatory/uninflamed with distinct clinical outcomes have now been described in different settings in several studies of ARDS. Recently, these inflammatory phenotypes have been described in both COVID-19 and in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Thus, these phenotypes may represent "treatable traits" beyond the current syndromic definition of ARDS.

In a secondary analysis of the HARP-2 trial (simvastatin 80 mg or placebo in patients with ARDS), patients in the hyperinflammatory subgroup had significantly increased 28-day survival when randomized to simvastatin. In contrast, in an analysis of the SAILS study (rosuvastatin 10 mg or placebo in patients with sepsis induced ARDS), there was no treatment effect in either group. This difference may be related to differences in the study population (all-cause vs. sepsis-related) or the statins used (differences in dose and hydrophilicity).

Although these data support the concept of a precision medicine approach with simvastatin and other pharmacological therapies, it is important to highlight that these data should be regarded as hypothesis generating and need to be confirmed in prospective clinical trials. One final challenge to consider for enabling the translation of this precision medicine approach into prospective clinical trials and subsequently clinical practice is how to rapidly identify phenotypes at the bedside in real time. It is likely that plasma biomarkers, which are not routinely available, will be required to most accurately identify inflammatory phenotypes. The current lack of point-of-care assays represents a significant barrier to the clinical implementation of ARDS phenotypes. Ongoing clinical trials such as the PHIND trial (NCT04009330) aim to develop a point-of-care assay that can identify hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory phenotypes rapidly at the bedside. Such assays to facilitate identification of phenotypes to guide pharmacological therapy will be an important step in delivering precision medicine at the bedside.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^112J6Lfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guideline methodology — evidence selection prioritized acceptable randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effectiveness, with prophylaxis populations excluding those who had reported COVID-19 infection; if acceptable RCTs were found, no additional non-randomized or non-comparative single-arm evidence was sought, while single-arm data were included only when a historical control event rate could be estimated and conflicts were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Reviewers used a standardized form to extract data, calculating risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and for continuous outcomes calculated either mean and standard deviation or standard mean difference; where applicable, data were pooled using a random effects model, with a fixed effects model for two or fewer trials or pooling of rates, and results were presented in RevMan forest plots. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach; within GRADE, certainty could be reduced by risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, or publication bias, and could be strengthened by large or very large effects, a dose-response gradient, or opposing residual confounding, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool. Outcomes used for decision-making may change as higher-quality direct evidence becomes available; for example, at the time of the first guideline clinical improvement outcomes such as need for mechanical ventilation were not reported, only radiographic findings.

### Statins and SARS-CoV-2 infection: results of a population-based prospective cohort study of 469 749 adults from 2 Canadian provinces [^113yCEg5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although statins generally have an excellent safety profile in humans, randomized trials of statinsfailed to demonstrate any benefits in sepsis in the pre‐COVID era. Thus, our finding that statin use was not associated with a lower risk of being SARS‐CoV‐2 swab positive or better outcomes in adults younger than age 75 years with COVID‐19 is not surprising. Our finding of a lower mortality risk in patients older than 75 years with COVID‐19 perhaps reflects the fact that not all deaths in patients with COVID‐19 are because of the infection itself or multi‐organ failure but that some are because of thromboembolic disease or coronary events (which would be expected to be less likely in statin users and also represent a higher proportion of deaths in very elderly patients with COVID‐19). An alternate explanation for higher ED visits but fewer deaths in statin users older than 75 years could be selection bias and residual confounding. Specifically, a preventive therapy such as a statin is more likely to be prescribed to elderly individuals who are relatively well ("healthy‐users") and that these same patients are also more likely to see physicians on a regular basis, undergo recommended screening tests, exercise, eat well, stop smoking, be immunized, and be more adherent to medications and public health guidance (all nonmeasured potential confounders of our results).

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^112vFLqh]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

All clinical outcomes were available for assessment in all patients and no outcome values were missing. For baseline characteristics, the study protocol allowed for multiple imputations if missing values occurred for > 5% but < 20% of values. Since none of the baseline characteristics met these criteria, multiple imputations were not used for the study variables. No adjustment was planned for the P value thresholds for multiplicity of comparisons. Therefore, owing to the potential for type 1 error, results from analyses other than the primary efficacy outcome should be considered exploratory. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical package, version 4.0.3 (R Core Team).

Patient and public involvement

In the context of the pandemic and the need to design the study in a short period, no patients were involved in setting the research questions or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. The study results and the manuscript were shown to a few members of the public after submission of the manuscript.

### Pros and cons for use of statins in people with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) [^114h8FPs]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher among people with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are used in the majority of people with DM and CVD. This mini-review discusses the current understanding of benefit-risk ratio of use of statins in COVID-19.

Methods

We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till June 12, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed.

Results

Statins, with their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant properties, have the potential to reduce severity of lung injury in, and mortality from, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections. Statin-induced upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has the potential to reduce lung injury from excess angiotensin II. By disrupting lipid rafts, statins have the potential to reduce viral entry into cells. However, benefit-risk ratio of its complex interaction with MYD88 gene expression on outcomes in COVID-19, and the putative role of low serum LDL cholesterol in increasing severity of SARS-CoV2 infection need further clarification.

Conclusions

People with COVID-19, who are already on statins for an underlying co-morbid condition, should continue on it unless there are specific contraindications. De-novo use of statins in people with COVID-19 with no underlying co-morbidity might be beneficial but awaits substantiation in clinical trials; till that time, de novo use of statins in COVID 19 should be limited to a clinical trial setting.

### Teaching old drugs new tricks: statins for COVID-19? [^116bUcdn]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has driven unprecedented efforts to identify existing treatments that can be quickly and effectively repurposed to reduce morbidity and mortality. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Zhang et al. (2020) report an association between statin use and improved outcomes in a large observational study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Given the widespread availability, low cost, and safety of statins, this promising result should be further investigated in randomized controlled trials.

### Rationales and uncertainties for aspirin use in COVID-19: a narrative review [^117MwDDt]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

COVID-19-induced endotheliitis provides a reasonable sound for treatment modalities to stabilise the endothelium while tackling SARS-CoV-2 replication, especially with anti-inflammatory, anticytokine drugs, ACE inhibitors and statins. Florêncio et al formulated a hypothesis that aspirin and statins play an essential role in preventing COVID-19-induced endotheliitis, and progression to severe forms.

Low-dose aspirin has a putative role for secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 with established CVD, but its role in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with chronic endothelial dysfunction is controversial. Aspirin has pleiotropic effects on endothelial function and assessing these effects during COVID-19 era in further research will be very helpful for proper understanding and management of COVID-19 infection.

COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and aspirin

COVID-19-induced coagulopathy may, in part, be due to direct vascular damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or ACE-2 inhibition, the latter is expressed on arterial and venous endothelial cells and plays an anti-inflammatory protective role. In severe and critical COVID-19, a bi-directional association of inflammation and coagulopathy may exist where persistent inflammatory status acts as an important trigger for the coagulation cascade and may promote an aggressive immune response. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6, could activate the coagulation system and suppress the fibrinolytic system. Inflammatory cytokines can contribute to a pro-coagulopathic state by several pathways, but the actual mechanisms of inflammatory-induced coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 remain to be determined.

### The impact of statin therapy on in-hospital prognosis and endothelial function of patients at high-to-very high cardiovascular risk admitted for COVID-19 [^115eCB3d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statins may protect against adverse outcomes from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through their pleiotropic effects. Endothelial dysfunction seems to be implicated in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and can be attenuated by statins. This study assessed the role of preadmission statin therapy and its interaction with endothelial function, measured using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) at hospital admission, in predicting in-hospital outcomes among patients with COVID-19 having high-to-very high cardiovascular (CV) risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 having high-to-very high CV risk, including a subgroup of patients who underwent FMD assessment. Among 342 patients, 119 (35%) were treated with statins at study baseline. Preadmission statin therapy was independently associated with a 75% risk reduction of intensive care unit admission/in-hospital death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.252, 95% confidence interval 0.122–0.521, p < 0.001). In the subgroup of patients with an FMD assessment (245 patients, 40% statin-treated), preadmission statin therapy was independently associated with higher FMD values (β = 0.159, p = 0.013). However, preadmission statin therapy×FMD interaction was not associated with in-hospital outcomes (F = 0.002, p interaction = 0.960). Preadmission statin therapy is associated with better in-hospital outcomes among patients with COVID-19 having high-to-very high CV risk, independent of the endothelium-protective effects of these drugs.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — evidence to recommendations: The panel considered core elements of the GRADE evidence, including certainty of evidence and the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, and acknowledged additional domains where applicable (feasibility, resource use, acceptability). For all recommendations, expert panelists reached consensus, with voting rules agreed on prior to the panel meetings for situations when consensus could not be reached; if deciding between a strong or a conditional recommendation in the same direction, "80% of the panel must vote for a strong recommendation", and when deciding between a conditional recommendation or no recommendation, "50% of the panel must vote for the same option with less than 20% voting for the alternative option". Recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional"; "we recommend" indicates strong recommendations and "we suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. Where comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly "not using the intervention", and the recommendations acknowledge the current "knowledge gap" and aim at avoiding premature favorable recommendations and the rapid diffusion of potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

### Effectiveness of rosuvastatin plus colchicine, emtricitabine / tenofovir and combinations thereof in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a pragmatic, open-label randomized trial [^113V48od]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) shows that in hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by RT–PCR or viral antigen testing with mild, moderate, or severe pneumonia and receiving dexamethasone, the FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSUV combination is associated with a reduced risk of dying within the first 28 days and a lower need for invasive mechanical ventilation than the standard of care with dexamethasone. No differences were found between the treatment with FTC/TDF or COLCH+ROSUV compared with the SOC in terms of the need for transfer to the intensive care unit or mortality within the first 7 days of hospital stay.

No published RCTs testing the use of the FTC/TDF+COLCH+ROSUV combination were found in the literature search in PubMed. One published phase 2 RCT assessing the effect of the FTC/TDF combination in reducing the viral load in subjects with SARS-CoV-2-related nasopharyngeal infection was identified. As of 8 August 2021, 2 additional RCTs assessing these drugs were registered on the clinicaltrials.gov website (NCT04712357, NCT04890626). Regarding the use of statins in the treatment of COVID-19, one factorial RCT was carried out to assess the effect of two different doses of statins plus enoxaparin in preventing venous or arterial thrombosis, avoiding treatment with extracorporeal oxygenation membrane (ECMO) or reducing the 30-day mortality, based on the hypothesis that statins would mitigate poor outcomes in some subgroups of patients with hyperinflammatory states, however, those results are not available yet. Eight ongoing RCTs that explored the use of statins in this setting were found in(NCT04472611, NCT04813471, NCT04631536, NCT04348695, NCT04333407, NCT04380402, NCT04466241, and NCT04952350). Moreover, a meta-analysis showed a mortality risk reduction (OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.88; 21 studies, I² 85%), albeit with a very low level of evidence and a very uncertain estimated effect. A subgroup analysis suggested that the effect was greater in the inpatient group receiving statins compared to prehospital statin use.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^112vdnVx]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of statin treatment versus placebo on clinical outcomes in patients with covid-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design

INSPIRATION/INSPIRATION-S was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial with a 2×2 factorial design. Results for the anticoagulation randomization have been reported previously. Results for the double blind randomization to atorvastatin versus placebo are reported here.

Setting

11 hospitals in Iran.

Participants

Adults aged ≥ 18 years with covid-19 admitted to the ICU.

Intervention

Atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily versus placebo, to be continued for 30 days from randomization irrespective of hospital discharge status.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or all cause mortality within 30 days from randomization. Prespecified safety outcomes included increase in liver enzyme levels more than three times the upper limit of normal and clinically diagnosed myopathy. A clinical events committee blinded to treatment assignment adjudicated the efficacy and safety outcomes.

Results

Of 605 patients randomized between 29 July 2020 and 4 April 2021 for statin randomization in the INSPIRATION-S trial, 343 were co-randomized to intermediate dose versus standard dose prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin based regimens, whereas 262 were randomized after completion of the anticoagulation study. 587 of the 605 participants were included in the primary analysis of INSPIRATION-S, reported here: 290 were assigned to atorvastatin and 297 to placebo (median age 57 years (interquartile range 45–68 years); 256 (44%) women). The primary outcome occurred in 95 (33%) patients assigned to atorvastatin and 108 (36%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.21). Death occurred in 90 (31%) patients in the atorvastatin group and 103 (35%) in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.22). Rates for venous thromboembolism were 2% (n = 6) in the atorvastatin group and 3% (n = 9) in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 2.06). Myopathy was not clinically diagnosed in either group. Liver enzyme levels were increased in five (2%) patients assigned to atorvastatin and six (2%) assigned to placebo (odds ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 2.81).

Conclusions

In adults with covid-19 admitted to the ICU, atorvastatin was not associated with a significant reduction in the composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or all cause mortality compared with placebo. Treatment was, however, found to be safe. As the overall event rates were lower than expected, a clinically important treatment effect cannot be excluded.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Long-term follow-up after critical COVID-19… [^114VnuA7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Most notable among their initial trial findings was a substantial clinical benefit, including short-term 21-day survival, of the IL-6 receptor antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab. 5 These results contributed to the inclusion of this strategy in treatment guidelines for COVID-19 among critically ill patients. 6 Anticoagulation with heparin in noncritical disease of moderate severity also improved outcomes, 7 but none of the other tested therapies yielded favorable results. One of the main findings is unlikely to surprise readers aware of the short-term results of the REMAP-CAP trial and the current treatment guidelines for COVID-19. For the primary outcome of 180-day mortality, IL-6 receptor antagonists again demonstrated a very high probability of superiority.

This 180-day outcome provides reassurance that early mortality benefit from IL-6 receptor antagonists did not result in longer-term adverse outcomes, such as susceptibility to late-onset opportunistic or other infections, that would offset short-term benefits. Somewhat surprisingly given the negative results from the 21-day analysis, 11 antiplatelet agents also demonstrated a high likelihood of improving 180-day mortality. Results examining the secondary outcomes of quality of life and disability are both more unexpected and more nuanced. There is further reassurance that the IL-6 receptor antagonists did not lead to worse quality of life or greater disability, and likely even improved these outcomes at 180 days. The benefits were even more certain for the antiplatelet agents, with a substantial gain of 0. 08 in health-related quality of life over a baseline of
0.

63 in the control group. This result, combined with the 180-day mortality results also suggesting benefit, constitutes some of the most favorable evidence to date for these agents, 13 especially in light of the initial trial from the REMAP-CAP group showing a 95. 7% probability of futility. 11.

### A living WHO guideline on drugs for COVID-19 [^115KY1he]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Updates

This is the fourteenth version (thirteenth update) of the living guideline, replacing earlier versions (available as data supplements). New recommendations will be published as updates to this guideline.

Clinical Question

What is the role of drugs in the treatment of patients with covid-19?

Context

The evidence base for therapeutics for covid-19 is evolving with numerous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recently completed and underway. Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and subvariants are changing the role of therapeutics.

What Is New?

The guideline development group (GDG) defined 1.5% as a new threshold for an important reduction in risk of hospitalisation in patients with non-severe covid-19. Combined with updated baseline risk estimates, this resulted in stratification into patients at low, moderate, and high risk for hospitalisation. New recommendations were added for moderate risk of hospitalisation for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and for moderate and low risk of hospitalisation for molnupiravir and remdesivir. New pharmacokinetic evidence was included for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir, supporting existing recommendations for patients at high risk of hospitalisation. The recommendation for ivermectin in patients with non-severe illness was updated in light of additional trial evidence which reduced the high degree of uncertainty informing previous guidance. A new recommendation was made against the antiviral agent VV116 for patients with non-severe and with severe or critical illness outside of randomised clinical trials based on one RCT comparing the drug with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. The structure of the guideline publication has also been changed; recommendations are now ordered by severity of covid-19.

About This Guideline

This living guideline from the World Health Organization (WHO) incorporates new evidence to dynamically update recommendations for covid-19 therapeutics. The GDG typically evaluates a therapy when the WHO judges sufficient evidence is available to make a recommendation. While the GDG takes an individual patient perspective in making recommendations, it also considers resource implications, acceptability, feasibility, equity, and human rights. This guideline was developed according to standards and methods for trustworthy guidelines, making use of an innovative process to achieve efficiency in dynamic updating of recommendations. The methods are aligned with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development and according to a pre-approved protocol (planning proposal) by the Guideline Review Committee (GRC). A box at the end of the article outlines key methodological aspects of the guideline process. MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation provides methodological support, including the coordination of living systematic reviews with network meta-analyses to inform the recommendations. The full version of the guideline is available online in MAGICapp and in PDF on the WHO website, with a summary version here in The BMJ. These formats should facilitate adaptation, which is strongly encouraged by WHO to contextualise recommendations in a healthcare system to maximise impact.

Future Recommendations

Recommendations on anticoagulation are planned for the next update to this guideline. Updated data regarding systemic corticosteroids, azithromycin, favipiravir and umefenovir for non-severe illness, and convalescent plasma and statin therapy for severe or critical illness, are planned for review in upcoming guideline iterations.

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^113CopZp]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

In addition to the mechanisms above, studies prior to the current COVID-19 era evaluated the use of statins to prevent progression of ARDS and limit severity of illness, and evidence in this space is incomplete. While primary results of the randomized SAILS (Statin for Acutely Injured Lungs From Sepsis) and HARP-2 trials did not demonstrate statins were beneficial in ARDS, a secondary analysis of HARP-2 suggested improved survival with statin use in a hyperinflammatory phenotype. Subphenotype analysis of SAILS did not replicate these results. It is important to note that these trials administered different drugs and were characterized by different inclusion criteria. Whether specific statins confer greater benefit due to higher bioavailability in lung tissue or more profound pleiotropic effects remains to be seen. However, the benefit noted from statins in our cohort may share mechanisms with some of the prior positive statin studies in the ARDS literature.

Severity definitions and conditional recommendation meaning: Severe illness is defined as patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, including patients on supplemental oxygen. Critical illness is defined as patients on mechanical ventilation and ECMO, includes end organ dysfunction as is seen in sepsis/septic shock, and in COVID-19 the most commonly reported form of end organ dysfunction is ARDS. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Novel subtypes of severe COVID-19 respiratory failure based on biological heterogeneity: a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^117EC7q5]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Latent class analysis (LCA) of clinical and protein biomarker data has identified two subtypes of non-COVID acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), termed "hyper-inflammatory" and "hypo-inflammatory", the former characterized by elevated plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 and soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR-1) and lower levels of bicarbonate and protein C. These subtypes have significantly different mortality in secondary analyses of numerous trials and observational studies Moreover, the subtypes demonstrate different responses to therapies such as PEEP, fluid strategy, and simvastatin in secondary analyses of randomized trials. A similar approach to subtyping patients with COVID-19 ARDS early in the pandemic revealed significant overlap with non-COVID ARDS subtypes, but with the exception of IL-6, data on biomarkers of lung injury and inflammation were unavailable. Additionally, corticosteroids were associated with reduced 90-day mortality in one subtype, offering a plausible explanation for the mixed results from corticosteroid trials in severe COVID-19. An observational study similarly found two distinct subtypes of COVID-19 ARDS using clinical data from a single center, early in the pandemic. No data on biomarkers of lung injury or inflammation were collected. A recent retrospective cohort study by Verhoef et al. used latent profile analysis of clinical and extensive protein biomarker data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 who presented to acute care facilities and identified two novel subtypes with heterogeneous treatment response to corticosteroids. Due to the observational nature of the recruited cohort, the study was limited by heterogeneous practices around steroid or other immunomodulator drug administration, timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a mix of patients from the outpatient and inpatient settings, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn with regards to the biology of patients with severe COVID-19.

In this study, the primary objective was to apply LCA using clinical and protein biomarker data to test for evidence of latent subtypes in the I-SPY COVID randomized controlled trial of investigational agents for the treatment of severe COVID-19.

### Association between antecedent statin use and decreased mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^111C7rN1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The principal findings of this analysis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are (1) antecedent statin use was common in our cohort, as 36% of patients admitted to our institution were prescribed statins prior to their index admission; (2) patients receiving statins were older, with a higher burden of cardiovascular comorbidities, (3) patients receiving statins tended to present with lower levels of CRP, and (4) antecedent statin use was associated with significantly lower odds of patients experiencing the primary endpoint of in-hospital mortality in a propensity-matched analysis.

In addition to respiratory failure due to pneumonia and ARDS, COVID-19 is known to result in a number of extrapulmonary manifestations. Posited mechanisms explaining the multiorgan dysfunction that can result from severe COVID-19 presentations include but are not limited to direct effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as indirect effects of a dysregulated immune response and hyperinflammatory state. This is supported by clinical and laboratory markers of inflammation, as well as histopathologic and post-mortem data, which demonstrate extensive inflammation and endothelialitis as well as isolation of viral RNA in tissues from several organ systems in patients with COVID-19 –. Therefore, identifying treatment strategies to prevent serious sequelae of this viral infection may have the potential to improve prognosis. The current analysis suggests that statins merit further evaluation in COVID-19 given their pleiotropic properties and potentially disease-modifying effects in the setting of this viral illness.

There are many potential explanations as to how statins may have contributed to lower 30-day in-hospital mortality in our cohort, despite high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in patients with antecedent statin use. Statins, which target HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, confer a significant mortality benefit in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who are overrepresented in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In addition to hyperlipidemia and other cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation has been identified as a key modulator of atherogenesis and can contribute to adverse cardiovascular events. The potential benefits from statins extend beyond cholesterol-lowering properties, as there is a robust literature supporting the anti-inflammatory properties of statins in the preclinical and clinical arenas, suggesting that these drugs can stabilize and restore endothelial function, and lower rates of circulating inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP. In this regard, patients receiving statins presented with significantly lower CRP levels in this cohort compared with those who were not on statins.

### Atorvastatin versus placebo in patients with COVID-19 in intensive care: randomized controlled trial [^112VGtsH]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Covid-19 can result in multiorgan manifestations. The overactive immune response can lead to pulmonary and extrapulmonary injury. Pulmonary parenchymal injury, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, is the most common and sinister feature of severe covid-19. Vascular endothelial activation, a hypercoagulable state, and immobility because of severe illness or medical instrumentation might increase the risk of microthrombosis and macrothrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism in patients with covid-19. The rates of thrombosis and mortality are highest among patients with covid-19 who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties. Statins inhibit the nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) pathway and reduce inflammation. Statins might also exert antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. In the Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibition with Simvastatin in Acute Lung Injury to Reduce Pulmonary Dysfunction–2 Study (HARP-2), simvastatin compared with placebo was not associated with a reduced mortality in the overall population. In the subset of patients with a hyperinflammatory phenotype, however, simvastatin was shown to reduce all cause mortality. In addition to reducing inflammation, statins might exert endothelial stabilizing properties, such as increased nitric oxide production. Moreover, statins are known to have antithrombotic and modest profibrinolytic activities. In pre-covid-19 studies, statins have been shown to reduce plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, platelet aggregation, and the risk of vascular eventssuch as venous thromboembolism. Statins might also interfere with viral entry through the disruption of the membrane lipid rafts. Therefore, we hypothesized that statin treatment might be of benefit to adults with covid-19admitted to the ICU by reducing the risk of thrombotic events or death related to worsening inflammation or respiratory status.

The Intermediate vs Standard-Dose Prophylactic Anticoagulation in Critically-ill Patients With COVID-19: An Open Label Randomised Controlled Trial (INSPIRATION) and INSPIRATION-statin (INSPIRATION-S) studies were part of a randomized clinical trial with a 2×2 factorial design in patients with covid-19 admitted to the ICU. The first randomization tested the effect of intermediate dose versus standard dose prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin based regimens. The results are reported elsewhere. The second randomization tested the effect of atorvastatin 20 mg orally once daily versus placebo in patients with covid-19 admitted to the ICU. This manuscript reports the results of this second randomization (INSPIRATION-S).

### Dynamics of subphenotypes in critical illness: when the tick-tock of the clock counts [^116CgtSU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Critical illness is characterized by a variety of life-threatening diseases and syndromes. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a syndrome characterized by diffuse lung inflammation and noncardiogenic edema. Multiple diseases, including direct or indirect lung diseases, may cause ARDS, which can be categorized according to degrees of hypoxemia, mechanical respiratory measures, or different stages of evolution. Sepsis is a disproportionate response to an infection and the most common cause of ARDS.

Several clinical trials have failed to show the efficacy of therapies for ARDS or sepsis. In addition, some findings of benefits have not been replicated in subsequent studies. As inflammation is a key factor in the physiopathology of critical illness, subphenotypes based mainly on these inflammatory markers and other measures were proposed by Calfee and colleagues. Two subphenotypes based on latent class analysis were proposed and named hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory. The main differences between the subphenotypes were related to mortality and outcomes. Post hoc analyses of clinical trials showed that therapies with negative results, such as simvastatin and high degrees of positive end-expiratory pressure, could be effective in hyperinflammatory patients. Response to fluids may also differ in patients with different subphenotypes.

After these promising features, during coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the same group analyzed a population with COVID-19 ARDS. Using a similar approach, they described two classes with acceptable overlap with previously described subphenotypes. However, there is a lower incidence of hyperinflammatory subphenotypes. Those patients with higher inflammation have better outcomes related to corticosteroid therapy.

In this issue of Journal, van Amstel and colleagues (pp.) analyzed data from a prospective observational study (MARS [Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis]) and two randomized clinical trials (ALVEOLI [Assessment of Low Tidal Volume and Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure to Obviate Lung Injury] and CLOVERS [Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis]). Patients with longitudinal biomarker data during the first 4 days were included. Using a parsimonious classifier model, subphenotypes were assigned on Day 0 or Days 2 and 3. Only in ALVEOLI, 100% of patients had ARDS; in CLOVERS, a small proportion of patients developed ARDS (3.9%). In the MARS cohort, 25.8% of patients developed ARDS. Fewer than 36% of patients were classified as hyperinflammatory in MARS, and 15.6% remained hyperinflammatory on Day 2 and 6.3% on Day 4.
