## Question

What is the significance of Lactobacillus in a urine culture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of Lactobacillus in a urine culture and how to interpret it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the traditional versus modern view of urine sterility and culture thresholds. Then, I should verify the dual role of Lactobacillus as protective commensal versus rare pathogen. Next, I will review how to interpret colony counts in light of symptoms and specimen type. After that, I must assess host risk factors that shift the likelihood of true infection. I will now examine diagnostic limitations of standard cultures and when to suspect real infection. Finally, I need to determine management and prevention strategies and synthesize a clear take-home message, making sure each step is supported by data and guidelines [^116SCaSd].

> Let me first confirm the paradigm shift. Traditionally, clinical microbiology centered on detecting high-count classical uropathogens such as E. coli at ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL and often dismissed Lactobacillus as contamination, especially from vaginal sources, in midstream specimens; but wait, emerging culture-independent methods and Enhanced Quantitative Urine Culture (EQUC) show the bladder is not sterile and that low-abundance genera, including Lactobacillus, are present even in asymptomatic women, often at 10 to 10⁴ CFU/mL, below routine detection thresholds [^113iL4uM] [^1159m6Lp] [^115DFXjV] [^116SCaSd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the dual role of Lactobacillus. On one hand, Lactobacillus species are key commensals of the female genital and lower urinary tract, contributing lactic acid and other antimicrobial metabolites, and strains in the vagina and bladder frequently overlap within the same individual, suggesting an interlinked urogenital niche supportive of health [^115DFXjV] [^117LW61w]. On the other hand, although uncommon, Lactobacillus can be a true uropathogen, with case reports and series documenting symptomatic UTIs — most often in older or medically vulnerable hosts — such as L. delbrueckii with high-count bacteriuria and pyuria, and occasional invasive disease in immunocompromised individuals [^114qGUjr] [^1118d1Ag] [^115SBLLp].

> Next, I should review how to interpret quantitative results in clinical context. I need to ensure I correlate CFU with symptoms and specimen quality because low-level growth in a voided sample may reflect vaginal carryover, whereas catheterized or aspirated samples better reflect bladder bacteriuria; moreover, some symptomatic UTIs occur at counts as low as 10²–10⁴ CFU/mL depending on the organism and clinical setting, so universal thresholds are oversimplified and species-specific predictive values matter [^115DFXjV] [^113ERa8g] [^116jXsmr]. Let me double-check myself: for enterococci and group B streptococci in midstream urine, predictive value for bladder bacteriuria is poor across counts, reinforcing the need to prioritize catheterized specimens or repeated isolation when interpreting nontraditional organisms, which is a principle I also apply to Lactobacillus in symptomatic patients [^113ERa8g].

> I will now examine host-specific factors that increase the likelihood that Lactobacillus represents true infection rather than colonization. Elderly women, immunocompromised patients, and those with catheters are disproportionately represented in reports of Lactobacillus UTIs, with L. delbrueckii isolates frequently meeting high-count thresholds and showing pyuria; conversely, in premenopausal healthy women, Lactobacillus dominance is generally protective and associated with lower UTI risk [^114qGUjr] [^115DFXjV]. But wait, what if metabolic comorbidity changes the equation? In type 2 diabetes, urinary Lactobacillus composition shifts toward L. iners and away from L. gasseri, which could reflect altered host-microbe interactions and potentially modify susceptibility patterns, so I should consider diabetes as a contextual modifier when interpreting cultures [^115JHTv3].

> Next, I should review diagnostic reliability and potential pitfalls. Standard urine culture, using small inocula and limited media under aerobic conditions, often misses fastidious or low-abundance organisms that EQUC can recover; Lactobacillus may require CO2 or anaerobic conditions and can be misidentified or dismissed without modern methods such as MALDI-TOF, thereby generating false negatives or "mixed flora" reports that obscure clinically relevant findings in select cases [^113iL4uM] [^111xGCHX] [^1116zCui]. Let me verify that urine obtained by transurethral catheterization aligns with suprapubic aspirates and reduces urethral contamination; indeed, catheterized urine profiles match aspirates and consistently show low-abundance genera like Lactobacillus that standard methods miss, strengthening the interpretive value of catheterized specimens when Lactobacillus predominates in a symptomatic patient [^1159m6Lp] [^115DFXjV].

> Now, when should I suspect true infection rather than colonization or contamination? I should confirm the presence of compatible urinary symptoms and pyuria, prioritize a high-quality specimen such as catheterized urine, and look for high-count or repeatedly isolated Lactobacillus as a dominant organism; in such cases — particularly in older or immunocompromised hosts — Lactobacillus can be the culprit and merits targeted therapy, whereas asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated, including in catheterized patients where routine cultures are discouraged [^114qGUjr] [^116EoXQ4] [^111FUXt3]. Hold on, I should also verify guideline-aligned culture use: obtain urine culture to guide therapy in atypical or recurrent presentations and before treating presumed CA-UTI, ideally after catheter removal or exchange, and avoid routine cultures in asymptomatic catheterized patients to prevent overtreatment [^117ARgks] [^1141TKM5] [^112ezzEf] [^111FUXt3].

> Determining management requires care, and I need to double-check antimicrobial susceptibility nuances. If the patient is asymptomatic and Lactobacillus is present at low counts in a voided specimen, I should withhold antibiotics and avoid disrupting protective flora; if symptomatic with pyuria and Lactobacillus is the predominant organism in a high-quality sample, I should treat based on susceptibilities, recognizing that many Lactobacillus isolates are susceptible to beta-lactams while showing intrinsic resistance to metronidazole and often to fosfomycin — wait, I initially thought fosfomycin might be a reasonable oral option, but I need to correct that assumption because L. delbrueckii commonly demonstrates fosfomycin non-susceptibility and metronidazole inactivity, so beta-lactams guided by culture are preferred [^114qGUjr] [^1116zCui]. I should confirm that therapy duration follows local cystitis guidance and clinical response, with stewardship emphasis and reassessment if symptoms fail to improve or if alternative sources such as vaginal conditions explain the findings [^116RajvE].

> For recurrence prevention, I need to ensure I weigh the mixed evidence on probiotics. Vaginal L. crispatus suppositories show signal for reduced rUTI in trials, and a recent randomized, double-blind study suggests intravaginal or combined probiotics can lower recurrence and prolong time to first UTI, but overall data are heterogeneous and strain-specific, with prior systematic reviews and Cochrane analyses showing limited or inconsistent efficacy; guidelines are discordant, with EAU 2025 allowing probiotic use for cystitis prevention while SOGC 2017 recommends against routine probiotics, so shared decision-making is essential [^111gGuFZ] [^1142P7i8] [^113VmDTJ] [^113dwGy3] [^113KFShu] [^115QeG2E]. Let me reconsider alternatives as I counsel patients: cranberry products, D-mannose, and methenamine hippurate have supportive but variable evidence and can be considered alongside behavioral measures and, when indicated, topical vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women, all with careful monitoring of recurrence patterns and culture results to tailor strategies over time [^113tME1t] [^116RajvE].

> Synthesizing the final answer, I need to ensure the message is precise. The significance of Lactobacillus in urine is context-dependent: most often it reflects beneficial commensalism and should not trigger antibiotics, yet in select hosts — especially elderly, immunocompromised, or catheterized patients — with compatible symptoms, pyuria, and high-quality evidence of dominance, Lactobacillus can be the true uropathogen and warrants beta-lactam–based therapy directed by susceptibilities; interpret counts with caution, prioritize specimen quality, and avoid treating asymptomatic bacteriuria to preserve the protective urinary microbiota [^115DFXjV] [^116EoXQ4] [^114qGUjr] [^116SCaSd].

Lactobacillus in urine culture is usually a **commensal finding** [^112LrA6W] from the normal female urogenital microbiota [^113iL4uM] and is not considered pathogenic in asymptomatic patients [^115DFXjV]. It is most often a **contaminant** from vaginal or perineal flora during collection, especially in midstream samples [^113ERa8g] [^112LrA6W]. Only in rare cases — typically in immunocompromised or elderly patients with significant pyuria and high colony counts — should Lactobacillus be considered a potential pathogen [^1118d1Ag] [^114qGUjr] [^1116zCui]. Routine antibiotic treatment is not indicated unless there are clear clinical signs of infection [^116EoXQ4]; if treatment is needed, beta-lactams are preferred, as Lactobacillus is intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin and metronidazole [^114qGUjr] [^1116zCui].

## Clinical significance of lactobacillus in urine culture

Lactobacillus species are **commensal bacteria** commonly found in the female urogenital tract, including the vagina and bladder [^113iL4uM] [^115DFXjV]. Their presence in urine cultures is typically a normal finding that reflects the natural urinary microbiota [^116SCaSd]. Lactobacillus species play a protective role by maintaining an acidic environment and producing lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins that inhibit pathogenic bacteria [^112LrA6W] [^113uZ5Xh].

---

## Differentiating contamination from true infection

The presence of Lactobacillus in urine cultures is most often due to **contamination** from vaginal or perineal flora during collection, particularly with midstream urine samples [^113ERa8g] [^115DFXjV]. True infections caused by Lactobacillus are rare and typically occur in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions [^1118d1Ag] [^114qGUjr]. Criteria to differentiate contamination from true infection include:

- **Clinical symptoms**: Presence of urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, or fever [^116RajvE].

- **Colony count**: Significant bacteriuria (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with pyuria suggests true infection [^116jXsmr].

- **Patient population**: Immunocompromised or elderly patients are more likely to have true infections [^114qGUjr].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **clinical context** when interpreting Lactobacillus-positive urine cultures [^117ARgks]. Routine antibiotic treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic bacteriuria [^116EoXQ4] or when Lactobacillus is identified as a contaminant. Antibiotic treatment should be considered only for symptomatic patients or those at high risk of complications, such as immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women.

---

## Antibiotic susceptibility and resistance patterns

Lactobacillus species are generally susceptible to **beta-lactam antibiotics**, such as penicillin and ampicillin [^1116zCui]. However, they are **intrinsically resistant** to fosfomycin and metronidazole [^114qGUjr]. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended when Lactobacillus is isolated from symptomatic patients or those at high risk of complications [^1116zCui].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

The presence of Lactobacillus in urine cultures has **important clinical implications**:

- **Protective role**: Lactobacillus species help maintain urinary tract health by inhibiting pathogenic bacteria [^113uZ5Xh].

- **Contamination**: Most positive cultures reflect contamination rather than true infection.

- **Rare infections**: True infections are rare and typically occur in immunocompromised or elderly patients [^1118d1Ag].

For management, **no treatment** is appropriate for asymptomatic patients or when contamination is suspected [^116EoXQ4], whereas **antibiotic therapy** should be used for symptomatic or high-risk patients [^116RajvE], guided by susceptibility testing [^1116zCui].

---

## Conclusion

In urine cultures, Lactobacillus is **usually a nonpathogenic commensal or contaminant** [^115DFXjV], therefore **no antibiotics are indicated in asymptomatic patients** [^116EoXQ4]. Consider targeted therapy only when there are clear urinary symptoms with objective evidence of infection (e.g. pyuria, high colony counts) or in high-risk hosts [^114qGUjr].

Our previous study showed that bacterial genomes can be identified using 16S rRNA sequencing in urine specimens of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are culture negative according to standard urine culture protocols. In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol.

Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92%]) were reported as no growth at 10³ CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2%), Streptococcus (11.9%), Actinomyces (6.9%), and Staphylococcus (6.9%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum. Our study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.

### Subsp. andas emerging human uropathogens in elderly patients [^114qGUjr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii has been considered a very rare cause of human urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, little is known about its clinical significance and antimicrobial susceptibility, and genomic data from clinical isolates are lacking. This study aimed at analyzing clinical, microbiological, and genomic data of L. delbrueckii urinary isolates. All L. delbrueckii isolates collected from patients hospitalized in a French university hospital from 2014 to 2016 were included. Clinical and biological data were gathered. Species identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and MICs were determined using the broth microdilution method. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted using Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 bp, and genomes were compared using three approaches: multilocus sequence typing (MLST), average nucleotide identity (ANI), and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).

From 2014 to 2016, 48 isolates of L. delbrueckii were recovered from the urine of 48 patients (mean age = 84 years; sex ratio M/F = 0.04). Nearly half (44%) of patients were diagnosed with a UTI, and all had significant cultures (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with a positive direct examination in > 90% of cases. The majority of isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics (especially β-lactams), whereas they seemed intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin and metronidazole. Subspecies identification was consistent across the three approaches, showing that most L. delbrueckii isolates belonged to subspecies allosunkii.

### The vaginal microbiome: III. The vaginal microbiome in various urogenital disorders [^112LrA6W]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Vaginal microbiome, urinary microbiome, and recurrent urinary tract infections (REUTIs)

The research into the urinary microbiome has traditionally relied on standard urine cultures, which posed significant limitations in detecting the complete spectrum of urinary bacterial species. This is due to the presence of unculturable (fastidious) microorganisms and the lack of mucosal organism representation in urine specimens. However, microbiome characterization using 16S rRNA sequencing and enhanced quantitative urine culture has facilitated rapid advancements in urinary microbiome (UMB) knowledge.

The human bladder, previously thought to be a sterile organ, has been identified as a site of permanent microbial colonization. These findings raise new questions, such as the role of microbes in urinary tract syndromes and infections, and whether they are a cause or effect of these conditions.

Study design and methodology have been significantly heterogeneous, resulting in notable knowledge gaps concerning the UMB-VMB relationship. Variability in reported periurethral microbiota may arise from inconsistent specimen collection techniques, contamination from the vulva or vagina, sexual activity, menstruation, and recent use of hygiene products.

In the context of urinary disorders, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus have been the most frequently reported colonizing microbes in the UMB, both being lactic acid–producing bacteria playing a protective role against pathogens. Less frequently identified UMB bacteria include certain other species.

### Lactobacillus delbrueckii as the cause of urinary tract infection [^1118d1Ag]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lactobacilli are part of the normal bacterial flora of the vagina and are typically considered contaminants when cultured from urine specimens of female patients. Here, we describe the case of a female patient with chronic pyuria and urinary tract symptoms, in which Lactobacillus delbrueckii was determined to be the causative microorganism.

### Approach to a positive urine culture in a patient without urinary symptoms [^116EoXQ4]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a condition in which bacteria are present in a noncontaminated urine sample collected from a patient without signs or symptoms related to the urinary tract. ASB must be distinguished from symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) by the absence of signs and symptoms compatible with UTI, or by clinical determination that a nonurinary cause accounts for the patient's symptoms. The overall purpose of this review is to promote an awareness of ASB as a distinct condition from UTI and to empower clinicians to withhold antibiotics in situations in which antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria is not indicated.

### Can vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections [^114psbxs]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Our review of the currently available data showed that vaginal Lactobacillus suppositories can help to reduce recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) in both pre- and postmenopausal women. This is interesting given that the vaginal microbiota and causative organisms of rUTI can differ between these two hormonally distinct groups. Sequencing studies have shown that L. crispatus is more abundant in premenopausal than in postmenopausal women and that Escherichia coli is the predominant cause of rUTI in premenopausal females, whereas a more diverse variety of organisms is found in postmenopausal women. Despite these differences, supplementation with Lactobacillus may continue to provide beneficial effects. In our review, studies that included both pre- and postmenopausal women did not separately analyze differences in rUTI in the two cohorts. This would be interesting to further evaluate in future studies.

A significant reduction in rUTI was demonstrated in patients who used the Lactobacillus probiotic for one year in two prospective studies. These results were not observed in the randomized controlled trials. Additionally, there is no published literature discussing adequate dosing time of probiotics (oral or vaginal) for the prevention of bladder infections. We can only assume that use must be continuous, as in any other prophylactic regimen such as with antibiotics, and tapered with time if appropriate.

This review is limited by the available published data, as there are few prospective studies evaluating this topic, involving a small total number of patients. Also, there is heterogeneity in the Lactobacillus species evaluated.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for febrile infants, more specifically with respect to urine tests, the ACEP 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining a urine culture if a urinary tract infection (UTI) is still suspected in febrile infants and pediatric patients aged 2 months to 2 years with a negative dipstick urinalysis result.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^113nNwMT]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Our method provides consensus metagenome references for any bacterial species present with greater than ten-fold aligned sequence coverage. Extracted references can be compared using genome-wide SNP comparison tools to produce cladograms highlighting relationships to key published reference strains of the same species. Six of our asymptomatic control donors displayed Lactobacillus crispatus levels with sufficient coverage to construct independent consensus references for both their urine and vaginal swab samples. Comparison of these references against previously published vaginal and gut strains shows that, in all six cases, the closest homologies were between urine and vaginal L. crispatus references computed from the same donor (Fig. 6). This pairing of donor-specific references strongly suggests that L. crispatus strains in both the urine and vaginal samples are sufficiently unique to an individual donor and shared across urogenital sites. Of note, all consensus references show highest homology to published vaginal rather than gut strains, further supporting the hypothesized anatomical niche-specific strain adaptation of this genetically diverse species.

- **Cladogram analysis**: Cladogram based on SNP relationships between consensus builds of Lactobacillus crispatus from urine and vaginal swab samples from six donors, compared to eight 'vaginal strains' and five 'gut' strain references. Vaginal and urine consensus references from the same individual show the highest homology to each other and are highlighted.

### Perspectives from the Society for Pediatric Research: Probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^114nYd73]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

Probiotics have received significant attention from both scientific and lay communities for their potential health-promoting properties, including the treatment or prevention of various conditions in children. In this article, we review the published data on the use of specific probiotic strains for three common pediatric conditions: the prevention of urinary tract infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea and the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

Research into the utility of specific probiotic strains is of varying quality, with data often derived from small studies and case series. We discuss the scientific merit of these studies, their overall findings regarding the utility of probiotics for these indications, issues in the reporting of methods, and results from these clinical trials, as well as future areas of investigation.

### Practical bench comparison of BBL CHROMagar orientation and standard two-plate media for urine cultures [^112FPfhU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 1023 urine samples sent for routine culture were plated onto sheep blood and MacConkey agars as well as a BBL CHROMagar Orientation (CO; Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) plate, and the results were compared. Of these, 250 urine samples (24%) grew more than 10,000 CFU of one or two putative pathogens/ml, and 773 showed no growth (NG) or mixed growth. The study noted a 50% reduction in inoculation time and a more than 20% reduction in work-up time. For our laboratory, with 50% "no growth" and approximately 25% significant results (50% Escherichia coli), CO allowed time and workup cost savings for a majority of cultures. A cost analysis, considering time and supplies for our laboratory, showed that if CO is used alone, the break-even level for CO pricing is USD 1.78.

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^1159m6Lp]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Contrary to medical dogma, urine is not sterile, even in asymptomatic individuals. For over 60 years, the standard urine culture protocol has been the primary tool for detecting bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories. This aerobic protocol was designed to detect causative agents of pyelonephritis and is particularly effective at detecting abundant Escherichia coli (> 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/ml) but little else. Culture-independent analysis of urine obtained by suprapubic aspirate, which bypasses the vulva, vagina, and urethra, demonstrates the presence of bacteria in the bladders of women. The microbial profiles observed in aspirated urine are similar to those in urine obtained by transurethral catheter (TUC), indicating the avoidance of urethral contamination in catheterized samples. We note the difference between TUC, which is transient and not associated with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and indwelling catheters that are known to harbor biofilms and result in CAUTI. Analyzing urine sampled by TUC, we previously found that the majority of asymptomatic women contain bacterial genera typically not detected by standard urine culture. These genera, including Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, tend to be in low abundance (between 10 and 10⁴ CFU/ml) and require growth conditions and carbon sources not available in standard urine culture. Therefore, we developed an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol that captures a broad range of bacterial taxa.

### The urinary microbiome in patients with refractory urge incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infection [^11782o2F]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The diversity of the urinary microbiota in the nine patients was investigated by examining the 38 urine samples using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. A median of 25 genera of bacteria (IQR 21–36) per patient was detected. Based on the relative abundance of the top 15 bacterial taxa, the samples clustered into six different urotypes, where samples in the same urotype shared ≥ 80% similarity by Euclidean distance (Fig. 2). The most common urotype was U5 (n = 12; dominated by Corynebacteriaceae), followed by U3 (n = 10; dominated by Escherichia), U6 (n = 10; diverse organisms), U4 (n = 3; dominated by Lactobacillus), U1 (n = 2; dominated by Klebsiella), and U2 (n = 1; dominated by Staphylococcus). All patients had at least two and up to four different urotypes, suggesting a continuous flux in their urinary microbiota (Fig. 1). Overall, the most abundant organism identified by culture-independent analysis showed high concordance with the dominant organism identified by traditional microbiology culturing.

- **Clustering of urinary microbial profiles**: This is demonstrated by the dendrogram (left) and by the dominant bacterial taxa present as depicted in the histogram (middle). Traditional microbiology results are also shown (right) to demonstrate the concordance between two different methods. The urine samples are identified by patient (P) number followed by sample (S) number from that patient. The dendrogram was based on the Euclidean distance between urine samples, which were clustered at ≥ 80% similarity as shown.

### In-depth microbiological characterization of urine from subjects with type 2 diabetes [^115JHTv3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Gender differences in the human microbiota are implicitly due to differences in anatomical structures and hormone levels. In particular, higher levels of Lactobacillus spp. have been observed in the urinary tract of aging women with type 2 diabetes (T2D), confirming our finding of more lactobacilli in slightly younger females with T2D. The increase of lactobacilli could be mainly attributed to L. iners prevailing in T2D in our study; conversely, the prevalence of L. gasseri, a probiotic bacterium also inhabiting the vagina of some women, was drastically reduced in T2D. In previous studies, L. gasseri showed anti-obesity and anti-insulin resistance effects. Its reduction in the urinary tract, in conjunction with T2D, could be one of the factors leading to the increase of insulin resistance, which is typical of T2D.

Prevalences of F. hominis and N. succinicivorans were selectively reduced in males with T2D. A few cases of genitourinary and urinary tract–derived blood infections due to these two species have been reported in recent years, including pyelonephritis, balanoposthitis, and interstitial cystitis. Although their role in human health still needs to be explored, the decrease of such bacteria in T2D may correlate with a reduced risk of infection in males. In parallel, in females with T2D, W. neuii was found to be less prevalent than in healthy women. Winkia neuii is a common colonizer of the skin and female urinary tract and rarely causes infections in humans. As with F. hominis and N. succinicivorans, the reduction of such a potential pathogen in T2D could represent a positive aspect.

### Effectiveness of prophylactic oral and/or vaginal probiotic supplementation in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1142P7i8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Widespread antibiotic resistance has sparked interest in the identification of non-antibiotic strategies, particularly probiotics, for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs). In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of prophylactic probiotic supplementation through oral and intravaginal routes in the prevention of recurrent UTIs.

- **Methods**: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 174 premenopausal women with a history of recurrent UTIs. Participants were randomized into one of four treatment groups: placebo (G1 - oral placebo and vaginal placebo), oral probiotic (G2 - oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria and vaginal placebo), vaginal probiotic (G3 - oral placebo and vaginal lactobacilli), and a probiotic combination (oral lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria and vaginal lactobacilli) for four months. Participants were followed up for one year to monitor symptomatic UTIs. The primary endpoints were the number of symptomatic UTIs at four months, the proportion of participants with at least one symptomatic UTI, and the time to the first symptomatic UTI.

- **Results**: At four months, the incidence of UTIs was 70.4% in G1, 61.3% in G2, 40.9% in G3, and 31.8% in G4. The mean number of symptomatic UTI recurrences at four months was significantly lower (P < .05) in G3 (1.06) and G4 (1.07) compared to G1 (2.1) and G2 (1.63). Additionally, the time to first symptomatic UTI was significantly longer (P < .05) in G3 (123.8 days) and G4 (141.8 days) compared with G1 (69.3 days) and G2 (71.9 days). Probiotic supplementation was well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed.

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic…

### Bacteraemia caused by Lactobacillus casei in a patient after cardiac surgery. A case report [^115SBLLp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Lactobacillus spp. are lactic acid bacteria commonly found in the environment, including water, domestic sewage, plants, and human and animal organisms. In humans, they are a natural component of the bacterial flora in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary system. These bacteria are beneficial to human health and are part of everyday functional foods.

Due to their natural ability to produce lactic acid, these bacteria lower the pH of their environment. This property is exploited by the industry to produce fermented milk, yogurt, cheese, and pharmaceuticals, including probiotics. Lactic acid bacilli are commonly known as probiotic bacteria and are considered "good" bacteria, playing a pro-health role in the body.

Although Lactobacillus was not previously considered significantly pathogenic, it may cause severe infections in individuals with immune system dysfunctions. Cases have been documented of endocarditis, meningoencephalitis, pneumonia, prosthetic joint infections, urinary tract infections, abscesses, and bacteraemia caused by Lactobacillus bacteria.

### Probiotic lactobacilli for urogenital health in women [^116amjAi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The microbiota of the vagina primarily form from the ascension of microbes from the rectal area. The numbers and types of microbes fluctuate with hormone levels, sexual contact, douching, and diet, yet the basic composition is relatively simple, with lactobacilli dominant in healthy females. The depletion of these organisms in women susceptible to urinary and vaginal infections raises the question of whether artificial supplementation of lactobacilli could lower infection rates. At the time of writing, a two-strain combination of *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* GR-1 and *Lactobacillus reuteri* RC-14 has proven to be the most effective at restoring and maintaining a normal vaginal microbiota. Other organisms show promise in resolving diseases that afflict over one billion women worldwide each year. The mechanisms involved have not been completely resolved but seem to include modulation of host immunity, reduction in pathogen ascension from the rectum, and interference with colonization and survival of pathogens.

### Can vaginal lactobacillus suppositories help reduce urinary tract infections [^113VmDTJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) pose a significant burden to both patients and the healthcare economy. Recently, vaginal probiotics and supplements have garnered attention in mainstream media and lay press as a promising non-antibiotic alternative. This study systematically reviews whether vaginal probiotics are an effective prophylactic for rUTIs.

A PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted from inception to August 2022 to identify articles on the prospective, in vivo use of vaginal suppositories for rUTIs prevention. The search terms used included "vaginal probiotic suppository" (yielding 34 results), "vaginal probiotic randomized" (184 results), "vaginal probiotic prevention" (441 results), "vaginal probiotic UTI" (21 results), and "vaginal probiotic urinary tract infection" (91 results). In total, 771 article titles and abstracts were screened.

Eight articles met the inclusion criteria, undergoing detailed review and summary. Among these, four were randomized controlled trials, with three including a placebo arm. The rest comprised three prospective cohort studies and one single-arm, open-label trial. Five of the seven articles that specifically assessed rUTI reduction with vaginal suppositories reported a decrease in incidence with probiotic use. However, only two studies showed statistically significant results; both focused on Lactobacillus crispatus, though neither was randomized. Additionally, three studies confirmed the efficacy and safety of using Lactobacillus as a vaginal suppository.

The data support the use of vaginal suppositories containing Lactobacillus as safe and potentially effective for rUTI prophylaxis.

### Utilization of the intestinal tract as a delivery system for urogenital probiotics [^111B5xvB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Orally consumed viable bacteria with proposed beneficial health effects, known as probiotics, are increasingly used to treat disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been recently suggested that specifically selected lactobacilli could have a therapeutic role in female urogenital tract infections. Additionally, it has been proposed that some of these bacteria could be not only intravaginally instilled but also orally delivered. The authors investigate the ability of lactobacilli isolated from the vagina to survive gastrointestinal tract transit and establish a link between the rate of intestinal survival and vaginal colonization.

### Standardization of microbiome studies for urolithiasis: An international consensus agreement [^111xGCHX]. Nature Reviews Urology (2021). Low credibility.

In order to cross-validate sequencing results and ensure that the detected bacteria come from the stones rather than the surrounding urine, a metaculturomic approach is recommended. An expanded quantitative urine culture protocol has been developed for both urine and stone samples, while other culturomic approaches have been developed for stool samples.

- **Metaculturomics for urine and stone samples**: For the expanded quantitative urine culture protocol, large volumes of sample (10 µl and 100 µl) are plated onto various media, including blood agar, chocolate agar, colistin and nalidixic acid agar, and CDC anaerobe blood agar. These plates are incubated under multiple atmospheric conditions (aerobic, anaerobic, 5% CO2) for 48 hours. The minimum detection threshold is 10–100 colony-forming units per milliliter.

- **Metaculturomics for stool samples**: Stool samples contain greater taxonomic and metabolic diversity than urine and stone samples, requiring a wider variety of conditions to adequately capture the diversity present. The most successful culture conditions for capturing broad diversity include aerobic and anaerobic culturing in blood agar with or without rumen fluid, marine broth, or trypticase soy broth. Preincubation of stool or urine samples in broth, under the defined conditions, often increases the diversity of bacteria isolated, as preincubation puts all bacteria in the sample into an active metabolic state. Notably, specific taxa or metabolic functions can be targeted by using specialized media types and/or conditions.

### Nonantibiotic treatments for urinary cystitis: an update [^113tME1t]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infections encountered in everyday clinical practice. Given the increase in antimicrobial therapy resistance, there has been heightened interest in nonantibiotic treatment options for these common infections.

A review of the recent literature includes nonantibiotic management options for UTIs, symptoms of cystitis, and prevention of recurrent UTIs (reUTIs).

The article provides an overview of alternative therapies to antibiotics in the treatment of cystitis and reUTI prophylaxis. These alternatives include alkalinization of urine, cranberry products, probiotics, NSAIDs, D-mannose, herbal medicine, methenamine hippurate, oral immunostimulants (immunotherapy), topical oestrogens, vitamins, and acupuncture. Over the last few years, intense research has focused on finding evidence to corroborate potentially efficacious nonantibiotic treatments. However, alternative treatments for UTIs have not provided conclusive evidence that antibiotic usage can be completely replaced by nonantibiotic options. This is largely due to a lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials on the subject.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults: the most fragile women are prone to long-term colonization [^112TPQWG]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

While the identification of risk factors helps clinicians to better assess the potential need for treatment, there is still an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests differentiating asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) and urinary tract infections (UTI), especially in the geriatric population. This challenge could be overcome by improving the diagnosis of the inflammatory state of the urinary tract mucosa. Analysis of inflammation marker cytokine levels in urine has shown promise in distinguishing ABU from upper urinary tract infections. Alternatively, the risk for a severe infection and the need for treatment could be predicted based on bacterial determinants. Several virulence factors in E. coli have been previously associated with pyelonephritis. Given the recent advances in molecular diagnostics, a rapid molecular diagnostic test detecting the presence of E. coli and its pathogenicity potential could help decide whether to administer antibiotics. After such treatment, the administration of avirulent ABU strains in a probiotic-like manner might reduce the risk of reinfection with the virulent strain and might prove a superior strategy compared to merely administering antibiotics alone.

### The urinary microbiome: Improving diagnostics and management of urinary tract infections in adult females [^111pQV8y]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Low credibility.

This article discusses the urinary microbiome in relation to urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. It makes biologic sense that the microbiota of different niches (bladder, vagina, and gut) interact with each other in health, as well as during a UTI event; however, these relationships remain poorly understood. Future research should close knowledge gaps regarding the interactions between the urinary microbiota and the host, amongst the microbiota of adjacent niches, and between the microbes within the same microbiota. This new knowledge should result in improved UTI treatment in the age of antibiotic stewardship.

### Lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities [^1116zCui]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The genus Lactobacillus is taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically, often requiring molecular identification. Although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens. They are extensively used in a variety of commercial products, including probiotics.

Their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined, in part because of their taxonomic complexity, and are compounded by the different methods recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute and the International Dairy Foundation. Their use as probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of whether the use of any antibiotics will affect their ability to survive. Lactobacillus species are generally acid-resistant and are able to survive ingestion. They are typically resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides, and ciprofloxacin, with L. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas L. rhamnosus and L. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

### Cervicovaginal microbiota, women's health, and reproductive outcomes [^117LW61w]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

The Human Microbiome Project has shown a remarkable diversity of microbial ecology within the human body. The vaginal microbiota is unique in that, in many women, it is most often dominated by Lactobacillus species. However, in some women, it lacks Lactobacillus spp. and is comprised of a wide array of strict and facultative anaerobes, a state that broadly correlates with increased risk for infection, disease, and poor reproductive and obstetric outcomes.

Interestingly, the level of protection against infection can also vary by species and strains of Lactobacillus, and some species, although dominant, are not always optimal. This factors into the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and possibly influences the occurrence of resultant adverse reproductive outcomes such as tubal factor infertility.

The composition and function of the vaginal microbiota appear to play an important role in pregnancy and fertility treatment outcomes. Future research in this field will shed further translational mechanistic understanding onto the interplay of the vaginal microbiota with women's health and reproduction.

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^115HKeCK]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

In only 60% of the examined samples (26/43 UTI cases) was the organism identified in culture the most prevalent organism in the sample as measured by cfDNA (Fig. 2b). Whereas bacterial culture is skewed toward species that are readily isolated on routine bacteriological media employed for urine culture, cfDNA sequence analyses permit the identification of a broader spectrum of bacterial species. To evaluate this concept further, we assayed two samples collected from one of the subjects included in the analysis above diagnosed with *Haemophilus influenzae* bacteruria. *H. influenzae* is a very uncommon uropathogen that does not routinely grow on media employed for conventional urine culture (tryptic soy agar with sheep blood and MacConkey agar).

Repeated urine cultures for this patient were negative, but given a urinalysis suggestive of a UTI and given that the patient developed *H. influenzae* bacteremia, the original urine specimen collected at presentation was re-plated onto chocolate agar, upon which *H. influenzae* was isolated. In the sample taken at the time of presentation, which was cultured, and also a sample taken 4 days after presentation, we observed *H. influenzae* cfDNA (0.037 RGE and 0.41 RGE, respectively). This case supports the utility of urinary cfDNA to identify infections where conventional culture fails.

- **Profiling the urinary microbiome**: The urinary tract was traditionally regarded as sterile, but recent studies have revealed that it often harbors microbiota. We examined the composition of the urinary microbiome by urinary cfDNA profiling in the absence of UTI (n = 43).

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^115DFXjV]. Nature Communications (2018). High credibility.

Metagenomic analyses have indicated that the female bladder harbors an indigenous microbiota. However, there are few cultured reference strains with sequenced genomes available for functional and experimental analyses. Here, we isolate and genome-sequence 149 bacterial strains from catheterized urine of 77 women. This culture collection spans 78 species, representing approximately two-thirds of the bacterial diversity within the sampled bladders, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Detailed genomic and functional comparison of the bladder microbiota to the gastrointestinal and vaginal microbiotas demonstrates similar vaginal and bladder microbiota, with functional capacities that are distinct from those observed in the gastrointestinal microbiota. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of bacterial strains isolated from the vagina and bladder in the same women identifies highly similar *Escherichia coli*, *Streptococcus anginosus*, *Lactobacillus iners*, and *Lactobacillus crispatus*, suggesting an interlinked female urogenital microbiota that is not only limited to pathogens but is also characteristic of health-associated commensals.

### Randomised trial of cranberry-lingonberry juice and Lactobacillus GG drink for the prevention of urinary tract infections in women [^115P1PLC]. BMJ (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine whether recurrences of urinary tract infections (UTIs) can be prevented with cranberry-lingonberry juice or with Lactobacillus GG drink. This was designed as an open, randomised controlled 12-month follow-up trial.

The setting involved health centres for university students and staff of a university hospital. Participants included 150 women with UTIs caused by Escherichia coli, who were randomly allocated into three groups. Interventions comprised 50 mL of cranberry-lingonberry juice concentrate daily for six months, 100 mL of Lactobacillus drink five days a week for one year, or no intervention.

The main outcome measure was the first recurrence of symptomatic UTI, defined as bacterial growth ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units/ml in a clean-voided midstream urine specimen.

The results showed that the cumulative rate of first UTI recurrence during the 12-month follow-up differed significantly between the groups (P = 0.048). At six months, eight (16%) women in the cranberry group, 19 (39%) in the Lactobacillus group, and 18 (36%) in the control group had experienced at least one recurrence. This indicated a 20% reduction in absolute risk in the cranberry group compared with the control group (95% confidence interval: 3% to 36%, P = 0.023, number needed to treat = 5, 95% confidence interval: 3 to 34).

The conclusion was that regular consumption of cranberry juice, but not Lactobacillus, appears to reduce the recurrence of urinary tract infections.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^116jXsmr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

From a microbial perspective, each uropathogenic species may carry its own infection dynamics, suggesting that employing universal thresholds across all species to define infection (e.g. ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) is likely an oversimplification. Some patients may experience symptomatic infections with bacterial counts as low as 10² CFU/mL. Not only are these levels below the limit of detection of a standard 1 µL inoculum, but they also overlap with potential levels of contamination. Unfortunately, in deciphering low-level pathogens from prominent contaminants, a laboratory cannot directly control for the variable quality of specimen collection, and a traditional culture cannot differentiate the active pathological process of a UTI from colonization or asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB).

### Cervicovaginal microbial features predict spread to the upper genital tract of infected women [^113TdP8Q]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

In contrast, lactic acid produced by Lactobacillus sp. directly kills CT, while D(−) lactic acid produced by some Lactobacillus sp. inhibits CT infection by down-regulating host epithelial cell proliferation. In this study, we were unable to detect associations of the most abundant Lactobacillus species with CT positivity but identified differences in low-abundance strains. We questioned whether the low-abundant Lactobacillus ASVs that were differentially abundant by MaAsLin2 analysis were genuine Lactobacillus species or accidental assignments of artificial sequences to Lactobacillus species, given the taxonomic complexity among Lactobacillus species and the limitations of characterizing these species through the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Although ASVs have intrinsic biological meaning independent of the reference database or the specific context of a study, the taxonomic resolution is much lower compared to the full length of 16S rRNA sequences or metagenome sequences.

Recent genomic studies identifying genetic elements that control functional differences between and within Lactobacillus species, such as the role of bile salt hydrolases that promote colonization of vertebrate-adapted niches, the ability to metabolize extracellular glycogen important for microbial growth in the female genital tract, and the identification of novel urogenital tract species, suggest that it is premature to conclude that the differences we detected between CT-infected and -uninfected women are artifactual and future investigations should consider implementing typing approaches.

### Molecular identification of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis [^11783UYm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis affects millions of women and is associated with several serious health conditions. The cause of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood despite numerous studies based on cultures. Bacteria in microbial communities can be identified without cultivation by characterizing their ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences.

- **Methods**: We identified bacteria in samples of vaginal fluid with a combination of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 16S rDNA with clone analysis, bacterium-specific PCR assay of 16S rDNA, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed directly on vaginal fluid from 27 subjects with bacterial vaginosis and 46 without the condition. Twenty-one subjects were studied with the use of broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and 73 subjects were studied with the use of bacterium-specific PCR.

- **Results**: Women without bacterial vaginosis had 1 to 6 vaginal bacterial species (phylotypes) in each sample (mean, 3.3), as detected by broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and Lactobacillus species were the predominant bacteria noted (83 to 100 percent of clones). Women with bacterial vaginosis had greater bacterial diversity (P < 0.001), with 9 to 17 phylotypes (mean, 12.6) detected per sample and newly recognized species present in 32 to 89 percent of clones per sample library (mean, 58 percent). Thirty-five unique bacterial species were detected in the women with bacterial vaginosis, including several species with no close cultivated relatives. Bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that several bacteria that had not been previously identified were present in these samples.

### A comparison of the performance of commercially available chromogenic agars for the isolation and presumptive identification of organisms from urine [^113DWfKB]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare four media — UTI medium, BBL CHROMagar, CPS ID2, and Harlequin CLED — using a collection of fully characterized organisms and subsequent "field trial".

- **Methods**: Seven hundred and eighty-seven fully characterized isolates (730 Gram-negative bacteria, 47 Gram-positive bacteria, and 10 yeasts) were used to test for the accuracy of organism identification. To assess isolation rates and the ability to detect mixed cultures, 1,435 urine samples were cultured in the three best-performing chromogenic media (UTI medium, BBL CHROMagar, and CPS ID2) and CLED.

- **Results**: The chromogenic agars differed in their accuracy of identification, with BBL CHROMagar performing best and Harlequin CLED performing least well. Similarly, BBL CHROMagar achieved a higher overall isolation rate than UTI medium and CPS ID2. When mixed growth was defined as greater than two organism types, BBL CHROMagar detected more mixed cultures than did UTI medium and CPS ID2, although the differences were not significant. When mixed growth was defined as greater than one organism type, the increased number of mixed growths detected by BBL CHROMagar became significant, largely due to differences in enterococcal isolation rates.

- **Conclusion**: The use of BBL CHROMagar, UTI medium, or CPS ID2 chromogenic agar as a replacement for CLED agar would improve the detection rate of contaminated urine samples. Enhanced identification helps to distinguish different species, facilitating the monitoring of bacterial resistance in support of the national antibiotic strategy. BBL CHROMagar gave the highest overall organism recovery rate.

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^113dwGy3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity, including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis, and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to the development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTIs may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses to make informed patient care decisions.

- **Objectives**: Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations? Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose, or frequency of probiotic was compared.

### Comparative molecular and microbiologic diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis [^113KqvJf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

If species, as opposed to genus identification, may have only modest consequences on the management of most patients, for some cases the consequences can be substantial. The identification of Lactobacillus crispatus, instead of S. agalactiae, led to the search and treatment of the dental portal of entry and the identification of Abiotrophia adiacens instead of group C streptococci; thus, in this last case, the antimicrobial drug treatment was prolonged. In five of six cases of negative blood culture, PCR permitted the identification of the responsible microorganism. The identification of S. gallolyticus in one patient led to the search for and removal of a precancerous intestinal polyp. In four cases, Bartonella species were identified, and the antimicrobial drug regimens were modified with the introduction of gentamicin and prolonged treatment.

- **16S rDNA PCR is of particular diagnostic value**: It is especially useful when serology has not been performed and when a serologic test is not available, as in the case of Tropheryma whippleii. Moreover, we believe that PCR on resected valves should be performed in patients with positive blood cultures under two conditions: 1) in the absence of species identifications; or 2) if there is a lack of correlation between the putative microbial identification by conventional microbiologic techniques and the clinical signs and symptoms or course of the endocarditis.

### Perspectives from the Society for Pediatric Research: Probiotic use in urinary tract infections, atopic dermatitis, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea: an overview [^1152LL59]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

In the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association's clinical practice guidelines on the use of probiotics, there is no comment on the use of probiotics for the prevention of non-C. difficile colitis. However, the authors offer a conditional recommendation, based on low-quality evidence, to use probiotics to prevent C. difficile colitis in children on antibiotics.

There is significant heterogeneity in the literature regarding the use of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), which poses challenges when making recommendations for their use. Additional clinical considerations regarding the use of probiotics for AAD include financial implications, as most patients may need to pay for probiotics out of pocket, potentially incurring a financial burden. This consideration is crucial when deciding whether to initiate probiotics for the prevention of AAD, especially since not every child on antibiotics will develop AAD. The number needed to treat to prevent one case of AAD is approximately 11. While this is a reasonable number, it remains an important consideration when weighing the decision to prescribe probiotics for patients for whom the cost is prohibitive. Additionally, although probiotics are generally safe and well tolerated, the increased complexity of the medication regimen may affect patient adherence with antibiotic therapy. In fact, the number of medication doses has been shown to influence patient non-adherence with medication regimens.

### Predictive utility of prior positive urine cultures [^111M2WqX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A patient's prior urine cultures are often considered when choosing empiric antibiotic therapy for a suspected urinary tract infection. We sought to evaluate how well previous urine cultures predict the identity and susceptibility of organisms in a patient's subsequent urine cultures.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multinational, multicenter, retrospective cohort study, including 22,019 pairs of positive urine cultures from 4,351 patients across two healthcare systems in Toronto, Ontario, and Chicago, Illinois. We examined the probability of the same organism being identified from the same patient's positive urine culture as a function of time elapsed from the previous positive urine specimen. In cases where the same organism was identified, we also examined the likelihood of the organism exhibiting the same or better antimicrobial susceptibility profile.

- **Results**: At 4–8 weeks between cultures, the correspondence in isolate identity was 57% (95% confidence interval, 55%-59%), and at more than 32 weeks it was 49% (95% CI, 48%-50%), still greater than expected by chance (P < .001). Despite high local rates of ciprofloxacin resistance in urine isolates across all patients (40%; 95% CI, 39.5%-40.5%), ciprofloxacin resistance was less than 20% among patients with a prior ciprofloxacin-sensitive organism and no subsequent fluoroquinolone exposure.

- **Conclusions**: A patient's prior urine culture results could guide empiric therapy decisions in cases of suspected urinary tract infection.

### Voided midstream urine culture and acute cystitis in premenopausal women [^113ERa8g]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The cause of acute uncomplicated cystitis is determined based on cultures of voided midstream urine, but few data guide the interpretation of such results, especially when gram-positive bacteria grow.

- **Methods**: Women aged 18 to 49 with symptoms of cystitis provided midstream urine specimens, after which urine was collected using a urethral catheter for culture (catheter urine). Microbial species and colony counts in the paired specimens were compared. The primary outcome was a comparison of the positive predictive values and negative predictive values of organisms grown in midstream urine, using the presence or absence of the organism in catheter urine as the reference.

- **Results**: The analysis of 236 episodes of cystitis in 226 women yielded 202 paired specimens of midstream urine and catheter urine that could be evaluated. Cultures were positive for uropathogens in 142 catheter specimens (70%), 4 of which had more than one uropathogen, and in 157 midstream specimens (78%). The presence of Escherichia coli in midstream urine was highly predictive of bladder bacteriuria even at very low counts, with a positive predictive value of 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter of 93% (Spearman's r = 0.944). In contrast, in midstream urine, enterococci (in 10% of cultures) and group B streptococci (in 12% of cultures) were not predictive of bladder bacteriuria at any colony count (Spearman's r = 0.322 for enterococci and 0.272 for group B streptococci). Among 41 episodes in which enterococcus, group B streptococci, or both were found in midstream urine, the predictive value was inadequate.

### The ability of prior urinary cultures results to predict future culture results in neurogenic bladder patients [^1129JpxF]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

To determine if previous urinary cultures can predict the organism and susceptibility of subsequent urinary cultures in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively identified a sample of neurogenic bladder patients from a tertiary care urology clinic from July 2015 to July 2016. We reviewed patient charts and used electronic laboratory records to identify all urine cultures done in the two years prior. Sequential culture pairs were identified to determine the concordance of the initial culture organism to the subsequent one, as well as the concordance of the initial culture's antibiotic resistance status to the subsequent culture's status.

- **Results**: We identified 146 patients with neurogenic bladder, primarily due to spinal cord injury (n = 61), multiple sclerosis (n = 26), or spina bifida (n = 25). These individuals primarily used intermittent catheterization (n = 69, 47%), spontaneous voiding (n = 59, 40%), or indwelling Foley catheter (n = 31, 21%). In the previous two years, 81 participants had at least two positive urine cultures, resulting in a total of 479 cultures examined for organism/susceptibility concordance. There was a 56% concordance of bacterial species between subsequent urine cultures, which decreased significantly with increasing time between cultures (P = 0.02). Antibiotic susceptibility concordance was high for ciprofloxacin (77%), nitrofurantoin (79%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75%), with no significant change over time between cultures (P > 0.90).

- **Conclusions**: Previous positive urine cultures can provide valuable insights into future culture results in neurogenic bladder patients.

### Probiotics [LGG-BB12 or RC14-GR1] versus placebo as prophylaxis for urinary tract infection in persons with spinal cord injury [ProSCIUTTU]: A study protocol for a randomised controlled trial [^117H2eKt]. BMC Urology (2016). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in people with a neurogenic bladder. Individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) and those with the spinal demyelinating form of multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly susceptible to developing neurogenic bladder dysfunction.

UTIs carry a high societal cost, and existing prevention strategies are ineffective. People with a neurogenic bladder are at significant risk of UTIs, averaging approximately two UTI episodes per year for persons with SCI. A major clinical challenge is that simple oral antibiotics often prove ineffective due to the high prevalence of multi-resistant organisms (MROs) within the SCI population, affecting about 40–50% of individuals. This exacerbates the health, societal, and economic consequences of the disease and can lead to life-threatening problems that may spread through hospitals and communities if not controlled. Health care costs associated with cross-infection are estimated at US$18–30 billion yearly in the United States and UK combined, with Australian costs expected to be proportionate.

- **Non-antibiotic prevention in SCI**: Based on existing literature, commonly used non-antibiotic UTI prevention methods in SCI populations have proven ineffective. Preventing UTIs, especially those caused by MROs, is a clinical imperative for individuals with SCI and neurogenic bladder. Non-antibiotic prevention is necessary to prevent UTIs without increasing the antimicrobial resistance burden.

### Subspecies and emerging human uropathogens in elderly patients [^113pH33Y]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Lactobacillus delbrueckii has been considered a very rare cause of human urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, little is known about its clinical significance, antimicrobial susceptibility, and genomic data from clinical isolates. This study aimed to analyze clinical, microbiological, and genomic data of L. delbrueckii urinary isolates. All L. delbrueckii isolates collected from patients hospitalized in a French university hospital from 2014 to 2016 were included. Clinical and biological data were gathered.

Species identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted using Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 bp. Genomes were compared using three approaches: multilocus sequence typing (MLST), average nucleotide identity (ANI), and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.

From 2014 to 2016, 48 isolates of L. delbrueckii were recovered from the urine of 48 patients (mean age = 84 years; sex ratio M/F = 0.04). Nearly half of the patients (44%) were diagnosed with a UTI, and all had significant cultures (≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL) with a positive direct examination in more than 90% of cases. The majority of isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics, especially β-lactams, whereas they seemed intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin and metronidazole. Subspecies identification was consistent across the three approaches, showing that most L. delbrueckii isolates belonged to subspecies allosunkii (n = 40; 83%).

### Urinary cell-free DNA is a versatile analyte for monitoring infections of the urinary tract [^115QLQn2]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Conventional bacterial culture, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were conducted on ninety of the 141 samples in the study, which had corresponding same-day urine cultures. Each of these clean-catch midstream urine samples was inoculated onto tryptic soy agar with sheep blood (Becton, Dickinson and Company [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) and MacConkey agar using a 1-μL inoculation loop and incubated in ambient air at 35 °C. Four urine samples, reported as mixed bacterial flora, were excluded due to lack of further identification. The remaining 86 samples were classified as either negative urine culture (n = 43) or positive urine culture (n = 43) for cfDNA/bacterial correlation and ROC analyses.

A positive urine culture was defined as one growing an organism identified at least to the genus level. Almost all bacterial isolates were recovered at a colony count ≥ 10,000 cfu/mL, while three isolates were recovered at a colony count < 10,000 cfu/mL. Conversely, a urine culture was defined as negative when either no organism was isolated in culture (35 cultures, < 1000 cfu/mL) or when the organism was unidentified to either the genus or species level and the colony count was < 10,000 cfu/mL (8 cultures).

### Culturing of female bladder bacteria reveals an interconnected urogenital microbiota [^111cMULo]. Nature Communications (2018).

Metagenomic analyses have indicated that the female bladder harbors an indigenous microbiota. However, there are few cultured reference strains with sequenced genomes available for functional and experimental analyses. Here, we isolate and genome-sequence 149 bacterial strains from catheterized urine of 77 women. This culture collection spans 78 species, representing approximately two-thirds of the bacterial diversity within the sampled bladders, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Detailed genomic and functional comparison of the bladder microbiota to the gastrointestinal and vaginal microbiotas demonstrates similar vaginal and bladder microbiota, with functional capacities that are distinct from those observed in the gastrointestinal microbiota. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of bacterial strains isolated from the vagina and bladder in the same women identifies highly similar Escherichia coli, Streptococcus anginosus, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus crispatus, suggesting an interlinked female urogenital microbiota that is not only limited to pathogens but is also characteristic of health-associated commensals.

### Adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^115qiFpn]. Microbes and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human-specific pathogenic bacterium that colonizes the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhea. In this study, we analyzed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. We show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. Protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between Lactobacillus species. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus was not.

Lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. Further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. Hence, gonococci bind to colonized lactobacilli, and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting in reduced bacterial colonization. Also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. Taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

### The potential role of probiotics in pediatric urology [^116u8Rx3]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

The application of select microbial strains to increase the host population of good bacteria is termed probiotics, defined as "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host". This review aimed to evaluate the potential role that probiotic therapy may have in pediatric urology.

Many children globally die from diseases such as gastrointestinal infections and HIV, and many experience recurrent urinary tract infections that persist into adulthood. Until recently, the roles of intestinal and urogenital (vaginal, urethral, and perineal) microflora in health and disease received limited attention. The available literature data on this topic were examined, and a personal viewpoint is presented on how they may relate to urology.

There is mounting evidence that certain strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria play a significant role in maintaining and restoring health in children and adults.

Implications for pediatric urology include a decreased risk of infection and stone disease, as well as potential positive effects on preventing and managing inflammatory and some carcinogenic diseases.

### Bacterial vaginosis: A practical review [^111aLKtC]. JAAPA (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from the overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.

- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition to a decrease in lactobacilli.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.

- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by a milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Cervicovaginal bacteria are a major modulator of host inflammatory responses in the female genital tract [^1158yQ2V]. Immunity (2015). Low credibility.

Colonization by Lactobacillus in the female genital tract is thought to be critical for maintaining genital health. However, little is known about how genital microbiota influence host immune function and modulate disease susceptibility. We studied a cohort of asymptomatic young South African women and found that the majority of participants had genital communities with low Lactobacillus abundance and high ecological diversity. High-diversity communities strongly correlated with genital pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.

Transcriptional profiling suggested that genital antigen-presenting cells sense gram-negative bacterial products in situ via Toll-like receptor 4 signaling, contributing to genital inflammation through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway and recruitment of lymphocytes by chemokine production. Our study proposes a mechanism by which cervicovaginal microbiota impact genital inflammation and thereby might affect a woman's reproductive health, including her risk of acquiring HIV.

### The new world of the urinary microbiota in women [^112ci2BM]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Emerging evidence challenges the long-held paradigm that the healthy bladder is sterile. These discoveries may provide new opportunities to address important women's health conditions, including preterm labor and delivery, urinary tract infections, and common forms of urinary incontinence. Traditional tools for urinary bacterial assessment, such as urinary dipsticks and standard urine cultures, have significant limitations that restrict the information available to clinicians. For example, the standard urine culture does not detect slow-growing bacteria that die in the presence of oxygen.

Two new, complementary tools, however, can detect these and other organisms, allowing for a more complete characterization of bacterial communities within the female bladder. Obstetrician-gynecologists should become familiar with these new approaches — expanded quantitative urine culture and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing — that can detect previously unrecognized organisms. These advances make it possible to answer previously intractable scientific and clinical questions.

Traditional nomenclature used to describe the bacterial status in the bladder is quite dated and unsuited for the emerging information about the bacterial milieu of the female urinary tract. In the context of the sterile bladder paradigm, clinicians have learned about "uropathogens", "asymptomatic bacteriuria", and "urinary tract infection". Given that the lower urinary tract is not sterile, these terms should be reevaluated. Clinicians can already benefit from the emerging knowledge regarding u…

### Cell surface-associated compounds of probiotic lactobacilli sustain the strain-specificity dogma [^111TMUu3]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

Probiotic lactobacilli can positively impact the health status of targeted (diseased) populations, but efficacy depends strongly on the strain employed, and the molecular basis for this phenomenon is poorly understood. This review discusses the state-of-the-art in the field of molecular probiotic-host interactions, focusing on subtle strain-specific differences in the biochemical characteristics of cell surface-associated probiotic ligands and the consequences thereof for the immune responses elicited. This research aims to enhance our understanding of strain-specificity in relation to probiotic functionality and will allow for the molecular science-based design of screening and characterization assays targeted to improve the selection of probiotic candidate strains. Moreover, identified bioactive effector molecules could be isolated or produced for administration in a more pharmacological regime.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial of a Lactobacillus crispatus probiotic given intravaginally for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection [^111gGuFZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common among women and frequently recur. Depletion of vaginal lactobacilli is associated with UTI risk, which suggests that repletion may be beneficial. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a Lactobacillus crispatus intravaginal suppository probiotic (Lactin-V; Osel) for prevention of recurrent UTIs (reUTI) in premenopausal women.

- **Methods**: One hundred young women with a history of reUTI received antimicrobials for acute UTI and then were randomized to receive either Lactin-V or placebo daily for 5 days, then once weekly for 10 weeks. Participants were followed up at 1 week and 10 weeks after intervention for UTIs. Urine samples for culture and vaginal swabs for real-time quantitative 16S ribosomal RNA gene polymerase chain reaction for L. crispatus were collected.

- **Results**: ReUTI occurred in 7/48 (15%) of women receiving Lactin-V compared with 13/48 (27%) of women receiving placebo (relative risk [RR], 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.2–1.2). High-level vaginal colonization with L. crispatus (≥ 10⁶ 16S RNA gene copies per swab) throughout follow-up was associated with a significant reduction in reUTI only for Lactin-V (RR for Lactin-V, 0.07; RR for placebo, 1.1; P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Lactin-V after treatment for cystitis is associated with a reduction in reUTI. Larger efficacy trials of this novel preventive method for reUTI are warranted. Clinical trials registration: NCT00305227.

### The human urinary microbiome and how it relates to urogynecology [^115YfQTj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Recent studies applying molecular techniques have demonstrated the presence of a urinary microbiota not detected by standard microbiological techniques. These microbiotas have been found in the urine of both healthy individuals and those suffering from clinical symptoms. The present article reviews the findings of these studies at the time of writing, describing the molecular techniques, and specifically outlining any differences in microbiomes in relation to urogynecological disease. Further, the role of commensal bacteria in the lower urinary tract is considered.

- **Methods**: An extensive literature search was conducted to identify articles on the microbiome of the female urinary tract in health and disease. We searched the electronic meta-databases Ovid MEDLINE® 1946–2015 and Embase 1974–2015. The keywords "microbiome, microbiota, bacterial colonization, microbiology, commensal bacteria, and bacteriuria" were searched in combination with "lower urinary tract symptoms, urogenital symptoms, urinary tract infection, overactive bladder and urinary incontinence". A total of 426 papers were retrieved; 33 were included in this paper.

- **Results**: The microbiome of the female lower urinary tract shows variance between individuals and between age groups. There are significant differences between the microbiota in the lower urinary tract of individuals with urological symptoms and those without, relating to type and proportion of commensal Lactobacillus spp. There is only weak evidence to suggest that Lactobacillus might be applied as a therapeutic measure.

### Efficacy of probiotic prophylaxis after the first febrile urinary tract infection in children with normal urinary tracts [^1144FiCR]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Low credibility.

Growing antibiotic resistance and debates over their efficacy for urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence warrant studying non-antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing UTI recurrences.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 181 children, aged 4 months to 5 years, with a normal urinary tract after recovery from their first febrile UTI in a 1:1 ratio to receive a probiotic mixture of *Lactobacillus acidophilus*, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*, *Bifidobacterium bifidum*, and *Bifidobacterium lactis* (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90) for a total of 18 months of therapy. The primary objective was to show the superiority of probiotic prophylaxis to placebo. The primary endpoint was composite cure (UTI-free survival) at 18 months, and the secondary endpoint was the median time to first UTI recurrence.

- **Results**: The probiotics were superior to placebo concerning the primary efficacy endpoint. At 18 months, composite cure was observed in 96.7% (3 of 91) of the patients in the probiotic group and 83.3% (15 of 90) of those in the placebo group (P = 0.02). The median time to the first incidence of UTI recurrence was 3.5 months (range, 1–4 months) and 6.5 months (range, 2–14 months) in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.04). The main microorganism that caused reUTI was *Escherichia coli*, followed by *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and these results were not significantly different between the two groups. We found no specific adverse events among the participants who received the probiotic mixture during the course of therapy.

The probiotics were more effective than placebo in preventing UTI recurrence over 18 months.

### Connecting the dots: Translating the vaginal microbiome into a drug [^1141G2od]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

A Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota (VMB) has been associated with health and is considered an important host defense mechanism against urogenital infections. Conversely, the depletion of lactobacilli and increased microbial diversity amplify the risk of adverse gynecologic and obstetric outcomes. A common clinical condition that exemplifies dysbiosis is bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is currently treated with antibiotics but frequently recurs due, in part, to persistent dysbiosis and the failure of lactobacilli to repopulate the vagina. New treatment options are needed to address BV challenges.

The VMB is relatively simple and optimally dominated by one or several species of Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus crispatus is strongly associated with vaginal health and is depleted in dysbiosis. Replenishing the dysbiotic VMB with protective L. crispatus CTV-05 is a promising approach to prevent reinfections and improve women's health. Here, we discuss the confirmation of this approach with the microbiome-based biologic drug, LACTIN-V (L. crispatus CTV-05), focusing on the prevention of BV recurrence.

### A highly accurate nanopore-based sequencing workflow for culture and PCR-free microbial metagenomic profiling of urogenital samples [^116Zg8Hz]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of urinary and vaginal microbiomes**: Figure 4a shows the percentage of species in each donor that were present in both vaginal and urinary microbiomes (dark blue), specific to vaginal samples (dark green), or specific to urine samples (light green). Species found at more than 1,000 cells per swab with any detected level in urine for the same species were scored as a match. Figure 4b provides an example of the relationship between measured species (> 1,000 cells) in vaginal and urinary microbiomes in samples from donor 30.

- **Co-profiled urine and vaginal microbiomes**: An in-depth analysis of weekly urine and vaginal samples from three volunteers produced a temporal series spanning a full menstrual cycle (Fig. 5a-c). High levels of concordance between urinary and vaginal microbiomes of the same individual were apparent across the majority of this testing period. However, transitory changes were observed in the vaginal and urinary microbiome composition of some individuals. Of interest, the nature of these changes seemed specific to each location. The Lactobacillus crispatus to Lactobacillus iners ratio is transiently inverted in donors 23 and 24 urine samples, while in the vagina, the same donors exhibit a similar phenomenon with the Gardnerella vaginalis & Gardnerella swidsinskii to Lactobacillus crispatus ratios over the same timeframe. These findings are compatible with previous studies describing similar phenomena in both urinary and vaginal microbiomes.

### Probiotic agents to protect the urogenital tract against infection [^113uZ5Xh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

The urogenital microflora of a healthy woman comprises approximately 50 species of organisms, differing in composition according to reproductive stages and exposure to several factors, including antibiotics and spermicides. Infections are very common, with more than 300 million cases of urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, and yeast vaginitis occurring worldwide per annum. During infection in the bladder and vagina, the urogenital flora is often dominated by the infecting pathogens, in contrast with healthy phases when indigenous organisms predominate.

Premenopausal women have a flora composed mostly of lactobacilli. Certain properties of these strains, such as adhesive ability and the production of acids, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide, and biosurfactants, appear important in providing protection to the host. While efforts to artificially restore an unbalanced flora using probiotics have met with mixed results, ongoing research aimed at selecting scientifically based strains could potentially offer a reliable alternative treatment and preventive regimen to antibiotics in the future.
