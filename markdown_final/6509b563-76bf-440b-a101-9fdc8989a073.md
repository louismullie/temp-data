## Question

Calcium channel

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about calcium channels, including their types, mechanisms, organ-system roles, disease links, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining calcium channels and their core physiological principles. Then, I should classify the major channel families and their gating mechanisms. Next, I will examine organ-system physiology and pathology, followed by therapeutic targeting and safety considerations. Finally, I will integrate emerging areas and conclude with a concise synthesis, making sure I verify claims against high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational concept: calcium channels are transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca2+ influx along its steep electrochemical gradient, converting extracellular or electrical signals into intracellular Ca2+ signals that govern contraction, secretion, excitability, and gene expression. I should double-check that this aligns with canonical reviews and structural biology summaries before proceeding [^115HsRek].

> I will now classify the principal families, but wait, let me verify the canonical groupings: voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) channels, and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are the major classes, with ligand-gated Ca2+-permeable channels such as NMDA receptors also contributing in specific tissues. I need to ensure I capture the high-voltage activated (L, N, P/Q, R) versus low-voltage activated (T-type) distinctions within VGCCs and the STIM1–ORAI1 axis for SOCE [^115L8w1F] [^112iEHib] [^112GovbS].

> Next, I should review VGCCs mechanistically; hold on, I should verify the subunit architecture and gating states. VGCCs comprise a pore-forming α1 subunit with auxiliary α2δ and β subunits that modulate trafficking and biophysics, and they cycle through closed, open, and inactivated states with voltage-dependent transitions; structural work on CaV1.1 and CaV2.3 illustrates these principles and supports subtype-specific pharmacology and disease relevance [^115HsRek] [^1116G3S1] [^111SnLyf].

> For SOCE, let me think about the canonical STIM1–ORAI1 pathway. I should confirm that STIM1 senses ER Ca2+ depletion and clusters at ER–plasma membrane junctions to gate ORAI1, generating the highly Ca2+-selective CRAC current that sustains lymphocyte activation and other secretory programs. Mutations in ORAI1 or STIM1 cause immunodeficiency, underscoring clinical importance [^112iEHib] [^116vFGPg] [^117QNBsU].

> Regarding TRP channels, I need to check their diversity and activation modes. TRP channels are polymodal and variably Ca2+-selective, with TRPC subunits often implicated in SOCE-like responses, TRPV5/6 specialized for epithelial Ca2+ transport, and TRPA1/V1 contributing to nociception and immune modulation. Structural and functional studies of TRPV5/6 clarify gating and selectivity and their roles in kidney and gut Ca2+ handling [^112GovbS] [^114euYt8] [^116NYAhD] [^117AYUzg].

> Now, let me consider the immune system. I should confirm that lymphocytes rely on SOCE for activation, with TRP channels fine-tuning Ca2+ signaling and effector function, and that CaV1.2 and auxiliary subunits are selectively enriched in TH2 cells, linking CaV blockade to potential anti-allergic strategies. This mechanistic layer connects ion channels to immunomodulation and autoimmunity [^116vFGPg] [^112GovbS] [^112nDb2v] [^115CXR8t].

> Turning to the kidney, I need to ensure I quantify fractional Ca2+ reabsorption correctly. Approximately 98% of filtered Ca2+ is reclaimed, with TRPV5 in the distal nephron accounting for a smaller but critical fraction, and TRPV6 mediating intestinal absorption. Dysregulation of these pathways contributes to hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis, and the Ca-sensing receptor coordinates calciotropic responses across gut, bone, and kidney [^114Tkw1F] [^116NYAhD] [^1125EmEC].

> In the heart, I should double-check that L-type Ca2+ channels dominate excitation–contraction coupling and action potential plateau, while T-type channels contribute to automaticity. Defective Ca2+ handling underlies arrhythmias and heart failure, and emerging data highlight nontraditional ion channels such as TRPM3 and ANO6 in conduction system physiology, suggesting new therapeutic targets [^112SRukp] [^116BmB3B] [^114c2mex].

> For the nervous system, let me verify that presynaptic N- and P/Q-type channels drive neurotransmitter release, T-type channels shape burst firing and network oscillations, and TRP channels transduce noxious stimuli. Clinically, gabapentinoids target α2δ subunits to reduce Ca2+ channel trafficking and transmitter release, and T-type blockade is relevant to absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain, though I should be cautious about overgeneralizing across pain phenotypes [^117N14eo] [^111SnLyf] [^112xcuTY] [^114JW3Q4] [^116tG8a3].

> In endocrine tissues, I should confirm that pancreatic β-cells utilize CaV1 and CaV3 channels for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, that zona glomerulosa cells generate Ca2+ oscillations via T- and L-type channels to drive aldosterone synthesis, and that N-type channels contribute to adrenocortical steroidogenesis. These links rationalize Ca2+ channel blockade as a metabolic or endocrine strategy in select contexts [^117GxVoK] [^114yTao8] [^111Ky2R1].

> Let me now examine disease associations systematically. Immunodeficiency and autoimmunity can arise from ORAI1/STIM1 defects, TRP channel dysregulation contributes to inflammatory bowel disease and atopy, TRPV6 is an oncochannel in multiple cancers, T-type channels are upregulated in medulloblastoma and other tumors, and L-type channel gain-of-function or excess density promotes cardiac hypertrophy and arrhythmias. I should confirm each linkage against the cited evidence before concluding [^112iEHib] [^112GovbS] [^116oNyGj] [^116NsXYh] [^1153KpRR].

> Therapeutically, I need to ensure I distinguish classes and mechanisms. Dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine CCBs are first-line for hypertension and angina, with favorable stroke reduction but less benefit in heart failure, and within-class differences matter for outcomes. Gabapentinoids modulate α2δ to treat neuropathic pain, verapamil has been explored for bipolar disorder with mixed results and CNS-penetrant agents are needed, and repurposing CCBs to downregulate TXNIP has been proposed for diabetes. I should double-check safety signals, including hypotension, edema, and potential bleeding risk with short-acting agents in observational cohorts [^1116G9US] [^113tMEg3] [^112xcuTY] [^112eeszm] [^117G47S6] [^117WRyZm].

> But wait, what about emerging areas? I should review that extracellular vesicles carry functional BK Ca channels influencing recipient cell integrity, that CatSper is temperature-gated and essential for sperm hyperactivation, and that mechanosensitive Piezo channels couple to VGCCs to amplify Ca2+ influx in chronic pain. These discoveries suggest new diagnostic and therapeutic angles at the interface of ion transport and intercellular communication [^115oyGyz] [^111ga2fP] [^114igSx2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform efficacy across CCBs. I need to emphasize pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity within dihydropyridines and the distinct profiles of verapamil and diltiazem, as these differences translate into divergent hemodynamic and outcome effects and caution against extrapolating class-wide benefits or harms [^116v8y6U].

> In summary, calcium channels comprise a tightly regulated, ubiquitously expressed system that transduces electrical, chemical, and mechanical stimuli into Ca2+ signals governing contraction, secretion, excitability, and gene expression. Their dysregulation underlies diverse pathologies, and selective pharmacologic modulation — via CCBs, gabapentinoids, or emerging TRP/T-type blockers — offers clinically meaningful therapeutic opportunities when matched to disease mechanism and channel phenotype [^112iEHib] [^112GovbS] [^1116G9US].

Calcium channels are integral membrane proteins that mediate Ca2+ influx, shaping excitability, contraction, secretion, and signaling across tissues [^115HsRek]. They include **voltage-gated (L-, N-, P/Q-, R-, T-type)** [^115L8w1F], **store-operated (ORAI/STIM)** [^116vFGPg], and **transient receptor potential (TRP)** channels [^112GovbS], each with distinct gating, kinetics, and pharmacology [^115L8w1F]. Ca2+ entry through these channels is essential for normal physiology, and dysregulation contributes to cardiovascular, neurological, immune, and metabolic diseases [^113NZEHB] [^112eYbkE] [^112GovbS] [^114KzNUS], making them key therapeutic targets [^113haTea].

## Physiological roles

Calcium channels mediate diverse **physiological processes**, including:

- **Excitation-contraction coupling**: L-type channels in cardiac and skeletal muscle initiate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and contraction [^112SRukp] [^1118RvJd].
- **Neurotransmitter release**: N- and P/Q-type channels drive presynaptic Ca2+ influx and vesicle fusion [^notfound].
- **Hormone secretion**: L-type channels in endocrine cells regulate insulin and aldosterone release [^117GxVoK] [^114yTao8].
- **Immune cell activation**: SOCE and TRP channels coordinate lymphocyte signaling and cytokine production [^112GovbS] [^116vFGPg].
- **Renal calcium reabsorption**: TRPV5/6 in the kidney and intestine maintain Ca2+ homeostasis [^117AYUzg] [^116NYAhD].

---

## Pathophysiological implications

Dysregulated calcium channels underlie multiple diseases, including **cardiovascular disease** — arrhythmias, hypertension, and heart failure linked to altered L- and T-type currents [^113NZEHB] [^116BmB3B]; **neurological disorders** such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and neurodegeneration involving VGCCs and TRP channels [^117N14eo] [^116tG8a3]; **immune disorders** in which aberrant SOCE and TRP signaling contribute to autoimmunity and inflammation [^112GovbS] [^112iEHib]; and **metabolic disorders** including diabetes and obesity, wherein Ca2+ signaling affects insulin secretion and adipocyte function [^114KzNUS] [^113SsTN8].

---

## Therapeutic targeting

Calcium channels are **major drug targets**:

- **L-type blockers**: Dihydropyridines (e.g. amlodipine), non-dihydropyridines (verapamil, diltiazem) for hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias [^1116G9US] [^113tMEg3].
- **T-type blockers**: Mibefradil, zonisamide for arrhythmias, neuropathic pain, and cancer [^116NsXYh] [^116Mrrzg].
- **Gabapentinoids**: α2δ ligands (gabapentin, pregabalin) for neuropathic pain and epilepsy [^112xcuTY].
- **TRP modulators**: Experimental agents targeting TRPV1, TRPA1, and TRPV6 for pain, inflammation, and cancer [^116tG8a3] [^116oNyGj].

---

## Emerging research and future directions

Current research focuses on **subtype-selective modulators** to improve efficacy and reduce off-target effects, and on structural biology to guide drug design using high-resolution structures of CaV and TRP channels [^115HsRek] [^114euYt8]. Additional efforts include exploring calcium channels as targets in cancer, autoimmunity, and metabolic disease, and investigating organelle-specific channels, including ER and mitochondrial calcium transporters, for therapeutic potential [^117QdP6V] [^112iEHib] [^114KzNUS].

### Role of potassium and calcium channels in sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation in the foeto-placental circulation [^111FA9oz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sevoflurane has been demonstrated to vasodilate the foeto-placental vasculature. We aimed to determine the contribution of modulation of potassium and calcium channel function to the vasodilatory effect of sevoflurane in isolated human chorionic plate arterial rings.

Methods

Quadruplicate ex vivo human chorionic plate arterial rings were used in all studies. Series 1 and 2 examined the role of the K⁺ channel in sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether tetraethylammonium, which blocks large conductance calcium activated K⁺ (K_Ca²⁺) channels (Series 1A+B) or glibenclamide, which blocks the ATP sensitive K⁺ (K_ATP) channel (Series 2), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation. Series 3–5 examined the role of the Ca²⁺ channel in sevoflurane induced vasodilation. Separate experiments examined whether verapamil, which blocks the sarcolemmal voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channel (Series 3), SK&F 96365 an inhibitor of sarcolemmal voltage-independent Ca²⁺ channels (Series 4A+B), or ryanodine an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ channel (Series 5A+B), modulated sevoflurane-mediated vasodilation.

Results

Sevoflurane produced dose dependent vasodilatation of chorionic plate arterial rings in all studies. Prior blockade of the K_Ca²⁺ and K_ATP channels augmented the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. Furthermore, exposure of rings to sevoflurane in advance of TEA occluded the effects of TEA. Taken together, these findings suggest that sevoflurane blocks K⁺ channels. Blockade of the voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels inhibited the vasodilator effects of sevoflurane. In contrast, blockade of the voltage-independent and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ channels did not alter sevoflurane vasodilation.

Conclusion

Sevoflurane appears to block chorionic arterial K Ca²⁺ and K ATP channels. Sevoflurane also blocks voltage-operated calcium channels, and exerts a net vasodilatory effect in the in vitro foeto-placental circulation.

### Understanding the role of cavia transient receptor potential (TRP) channel in viral infection: implications in developing future antiviral strategies [^117Xuf2E]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

4 TRP channel as store-operated channel and its implications in viral infection

In 1986, J. W. Putney forwarded an unprecedented model for capacitative calcium entry. This model postulates that emptying Ca 2+ from the ER immediately triggers calcium influx via the plasma membrane-residing Ca 2+ channels from the extracellular environment into the cytosol. In brief, calcium release from the intracellular stores activates calcium release from the plasma membrane-residing calcium channels. This calcium entry is referred to as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) via store-operated channels (SOC). Notably, the Ca 2+ from the internal stores is limited, whereas the Ca 2+ from the extracellular medium is unlimited, contributing to the high Ca 2+ requirement during viral infection. Accordingly, Ca 2+ influx from SOC has been reported to promote viral infection and pathogenesis. Hence, any newly discovered calcium channel or longstanding calcium channel also passes through the intrinsic assessment or re-assessment as a possible SOC.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in TRP channels as a possible SOC. The main reason for such a surge in TRP channel interest is primarily because of its (i) unanticipated diversity, (ii) varying assortment of Ca 2+ ion selectivity, and (iii) polymodal activation mechanisms. The basis of permeation properties and diversity in the activation mechanism remains elusive because these TRP channels structure remains vaguely studied. Additionally, not all TRP channels are equally hailed as SOC. The TRPC family is the prime contender as an active SOC. Further, TRP channels such as TRPM7, which is not a SOC channel yet, by virtue of its kinase domain, can regulate SOC activity in the cells.

### ANO4 (anoctamin 4) is a novel marker of zona glomerulosa that regulates stimulated aldosterone secretion [^113tBb5c]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

ANO4 (anoctamin 4) function is debated: it has been described as CaCC in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)293-transfected cellsbut also as a phospholipid scramblase involved in apoptosisor even as a non-selective cation channel. Another recent article reported that ANO4 colocalizes with the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase and reduces Ca 2+ store release, probably acting as a leakage channel.

Until recently, most or all of the evidence concerning membrane polarization and ion traffic in the regulation of aldosterone secretion has pointed to cation channels and transporters. The discovery that the chloride channel, CLCN2, has germline mutations, which increase excitatory efflux of chloride ions, in families with early onset of PA, creates considerable interest in the role of another putative chloride channel whose expression shows a high degree of ZG selectivity. We have investigated the role of ANO4 in regulating human ZG function, using measures of aldosterone secretion and cell proliferation. We have studied ANO4's influence on responses to Angiotensin II, ionomycin, and ATP, which increase intracellular calcium by different mechanisms (IP 3 -stimulated ER calcium release and voltage-dependent T- and L-type calcium channels, release from ER stores and via purinergic receptor activation, respectively) – and for comparison have studied ANO1, a well-characterized, ubiquitous CaCC.

### Calcium intake and adiposity [^114wx2cX]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Limited epidemiologic and experimental data support the possibility that dietary calcium intake plays a role in human body weight regulation. The aim of this review was to present the data from human studies that link calcium and dairy intake to body weight, describe the existing evidence for an effect of calcium intake on body weight from animal models of obesity, present evidence of a role for intracellular calcium in the regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis, elucidate the potential suggested relation between dietary calcium intake and intracellular calcium concentrations, and outline the effects of calcium supplementation on dietary fat absorption. We suggest that these data support the need for large, population based clinical trials to assess the effects of supplemental calcium and other components of dairy products on human body weight.

### Nociceptors: their role in body's defenses, tissue specific variations and anatomical update [^114PRSWA]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Nociceptive Perception Changes

Pathological and potentially pathological stimuli are transduced into electrical signals in nociceptors, which represent nerve endings with branched main axons, innervating distinct regions in the dermatomes, organosomes and angiosomes. The nociceptive signal is derived from afferent stimulation which leads to depolarization of peripheral terminals producing an active potential. This provides attenuation of stimuli engagement, which leads to transduction of the action potential. Since the action potential is ion dependent, a specific association is seen between Na, Ca, Cl and K ions and their role in creation of the nociceptive signal. Sodium, Calcium and Chloride are responsible for depolarization, suggesting that opening of ion channels permeable to Sodium, Chloride, and Calcium will cause sufficient effect for depolarization. On the other hand potassium channels when closed does not lead to depolarization, but amplifies existing fluctuations due to increased resistance of the transmembrane electrohomeostasis.

The electrochemical and physical aspects of nociceptive signal formation are what define the ability of the receptor to play a role in both hyperalgesic and anti-hyperalgesic responses. Four critical functionalities of the nociceptor to provide proper signal transduction include: threshold, relaxation, allodynia and hyperalgesia. A normal response of a nociceptor it shows both threshold and relaxation behavior: it does not respond to weak stimulus under the threshold value and has a relaxation period, in which it repolarizes and is inactive. During relaxation, stimuli can reactivate the nociceptor at a lower threshold. Abnormal nociceptor behaviors are seen when the receptor experiences significantly increased stimuli capable of causing damage. Abnormal stimuli cause eithey allodynia (receptor response to signals lower than threshold) and hyperalgesia (exaggerated signal to overthreshold stimuli). These processes define that an abnormally functioning nociceptor has no specific threshold value. These conditions are mediated by inflammatory cytokines and cell to cell signaling, which initiate a local pathological response. Normally, an abnormally functioning nociceptors has the capability to return to threshold-dependent functioning. Understanding of these mechanisms is what can drive bioengineering of signal transduction.

### New insights on the role of TRP channels in calcium signalling and immunomodulation: review of pathways and implications for clinical practice [^1144WZvq]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

TRP channels have emerged as an essential component of calcium signalling machinery. TRP channels are involved in the activation of both innate and adaptive immune system cells. With links to diverse pathological conditions, including autoimmune and inflammatory states, TRP channels represent a promising future therapeutic target. The fact that these channels can sense changes in pH, temperature or even mechanical stress and change the function of the cell leaves these receptors amenable to a wide range of modulators. This leaves a window of opportunity to modulate immune cells via different means.

### Calcium-mediated regulation of mitophagy: implications in neurodegenerative diseases [^111uh31u]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The low resting [Ca²⁺]c that is established through the aforementioned mechanisms, provides a massive driving force for calcium entry inside the cell, which is further enhanced by the electrical potential that exists across the PM (Δψ = −70 mV in the cytoplasm side relative to the extracellular milieu) and is opposed only by the latter's impermeability. As a result, the opening of PM Ca²⁺ channels leads to the rapid influx of calcium inside the cell, following its electrochemical gradient, and causes a dramatic increase of [Ca²⁺]c, that can go beyond the 1 μM range. Although the identity of such channels varies among cell types, they are generally categorized as either voltage-gated Ca²⁺-permeable channels (VGCCs), activated by membrane depolarization, or ligand-gated Ca²⁺-permeable channels, activated by the binding of specific signaling molecules. Likewise, cytoplasmic calcium levels can rise through the release of Ca²⁺ from internal stores, a feature that allows the generation of spatially confined calcium spikes in discrete cellular regions through localized discharges.

### The β and α ₂ δ auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated calcium channel 1 (Ca1) are required for T2 lymphocyte function and acute allergic airway inflammation [^115CXR8t]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

T lymphocytes express not only cell membrane ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 but also voltage-gated calcium channel (Ca v) 1 channels. In excitable cells these channels are composed of the ion-forming pore α1 and auxiliary subunits (β and α2δ) needed for proper trafficking and activation of the channel. Previously, we disclosed the role of Ca v 1.2 α1 in mouse and human T H 2 but not T H 1 cell functions and showed that knocking down Ca v 1 α1 prevents experimental asthma.

Objective

We investigated the role of β and α2δ auxiliary subunits on Ca v 1 α1 function in T H 2 lymphocytes and on the development of acute allergic airway inflammation.

Methods

We used Ca v β antisense oligonucleotides to knock down Ca v β and gabapentin, a drug that binds to and inhibits α2δ1 and α2δ2, to test their effects on T H 2 functions and their capacity to reduce allergic airway inflammation.

Results

Mouse and human T H 2 cells express mainly Ca v β1, β3, and α2δ2 subunits. Ca v β antisense reduces T-cell receptor-driven calcium responses and cytokine production by mouse and human T H 2 cells with no effect on T H 1 cells. Ca v β is mainly involved in restraining Ca v 1.2 α1 degradation through the proteasome because a proteasome inhibitor partially restores the α1 protein level. Gabapentin impairs the T-cell receptor-driven calcium response and cytokine production associated with the loss of α2δ2 protein in T H 2 cells.

Conclusions

These results stress the role of Ca v β and α2δ2 auxiliary subunits in the stability and activation of Ca v 1.2 channels in T H 2 lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the beneficial effect of Ca v β antisense and gabapentin in allergic airway inflammation.

### Calcium antagonists: Do they equally protect against kidney injury? [^112Vh2mn]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Calcium antagonists are a heterogeneous group of drugs that affect not only different channels but different parts of the same channel. These differences translate into different renal hemodynamic effects. This Commentary discusses the implications of these differences for surrogate markers of outcome.

### Immunolocalization of the calcium-sensing receptor in developing human kidney [^1131Ckw9]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The calcium-sensing receptor (CSR) is a G-protein receptor that plays a critical role in calcium regulation. In the kidney, the CSR regulates calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb, where stimulation of the CSR inhibits calcium reabsorption in response to increased calcium in the peritubular fluid. In the collecting duct, apical CSR activation may play a role in osmoregulation, increasing water excretion in response to increased luminal calcium.

Methods

We studied the ontogeny of the CSR in developing human kidney using immunohistochemical methods.

Results

The CSR is first expressed in the S-shaped body in the region destined to form the ascending limb and distal tubule. Other regions of the S-shaped body, as well as ureteric buds, do not express the CSR. The CSR is observed in thick ascending limb as early as 20 wk of development. The CSR is not observed in proximal tubule or collecting duct between 20 and 40 wk of human development.

Conclusion

During early human renal development, CSR expression is limited to the thick ascending limb and distal tubule, where this receptor may play a role in calcium homeostasis between 20 and 40 wk of human development.

Identification and Function of the Individual TRP Channels in T Cells

TRPA

Stokes et al. have demonstrated widespread expression of TRPA1 mRNA and protein throughout the human body, including in primary and secondary lymphoid organs such as thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. They also demonstrated expression by Jurkat T cell lines. Since then, the TRPA1 ion channel has been found to be expressed by both murine and human T cells.

TRPA1 has been linked to murine models of colitis and human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IL10 −/− TRPA1 −/− mice developed more severe CD4 + T cell-medicated colonic inflammation than their IL10 −/− counterparts. In line with this, CD4 + T cells from TRPA1 −/− mice experienced a greater and more sustained level of calcium influx upon TCR stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) cells. This manifested in greater expression of the Th1 transcription factor Tbet and the Th1 cytokines IFNγ and IL2. Similarly, in human CD4 + T cells, TPRA1 knockdown increased IFNγ and IL2 production.

Bertin et al. have also gone some way towards explaining how TRPA1 exerted these anti-inflammatory effects in their experimental systems. TRPA1 and TRPV1 were co-localised at the plasma membrane of CD4 + T cells, with TRPA1 inhibiting the activity of the TRPV1 channel. Reduced expression of TRPA1 promoted TRPV1-mediated TCR-induced calcium influx and CD4 T cell activation. Interestingly, colonic biopsies from IBD patients have a greater number of infiltrating TRPA1 + TPRV1 + leukocytes and T cells compared to controls. TRPV1 transcript levels are downregulated in biopsies from patients with IBD compared to controls, while the opposite pattern is true for TRPA1. Bertin et al. therefore suggest that differential expression of TRP channels or altered infiltration of TRPA1 + TRPV1 + T cells contributes to the pathophysiology of this condition.

TRPC

A number of studies have demonstrated expression of TRPC channels by murine T cells, human T cell lines and human T cells.

### Investigating the mechanism of conditioning versus postoperative electrical stimulation to enhance nerve regeneration: one therapy, two distinct effects [^1174PW3v]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Channels and Signaling Pathways (Table 3)

TABLE 3
Channels and signaling pathways.

It is generally accepted that electrical stimulation, delivered at any time point, first induces a retrograde signal from the site of stimulation to the neuronal cell body, which initiates numerous molecular cascades. The effects of CES and PES on voltage‐gated cation channels are therefore of considerable interest. Studies to investigate the effects of these channels have largely relied on evaluating the effects of electrical stimulation in the presence of channel blockers such as lidocaine and nifedipine. Such studies have suggested a role for voltage‐gated sodium channels in mediating the effects of PES. CES is more completely studied and has been shown to be governed by voltage‐gated calcium channels and the calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) pathway. Further, CES has been shown to activate axonal voltage‐gated sodium channels, which triggers activation of Schwann cell voltage gated calcium channels. Cytosolic calcium release from internal stores in Schwann cells triggers mitochondrial calcium influx. The effect of electrical stimulation, either CES or PES, on ion‐gated channels is poorly understood but most likely plays an important role in mediating the effects of these two treatment modalities. The net result of the resultant retrograde signal is the activation of multiple molecular pathways within the neuronal cell body.

### The unexpected role of calcium-activated potassium channels: limitation of NO-induced arterial relaxation [^115MMhrJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Finally, this study provides another important piece of evidence supporting the idea that an NO‐induced reduction of calcium influx via VOC enables the BK channel to limit the anticontractile effect of NO. Namely, in BK channel β1‐subunit–deficient mice, in which the BK channel cannot respond to NO‐induced reductions of calcium influx because of a considerably decreased calcium sensitivity of the BK channel, 17 the anticontractile effect of NO, and its action on the functional availability of the BK channel were no longer affected by iberiotoxin.

In conclusion, the data of the present study show that an NO‐induced reduction of calcium influx via L‐type VOCs leads to a decrease of BK channel activity, which limits the anticontractile effect of NO, especially at lower levels of contractility.

This study demonstrates, first, that continuously present NO donors evoke a strong anticontractile effect on rat and mouse arteries, which is induced by NO. Second, it shows that the iberiotoxin‐induced augmentation of the anticontractile effect of NO is associated with an NO‐induced reduction of the effect of iberiotoxin over almost the whole range of vessel contractility, whereas activation of BK channels facilitates NO‐induced vasodilation only at high contraction levels. Finally, it reveals that NO evokes a reduction of calcium influx via L‐type calcium channels that may enable the BK channel to limit the anticontractile effect of NO, especially at lower levels of contractility.

Introduction

Successful fertilization is crucial for species survival, and evolution has finely tuned this process by optimizing its timing, location, and environmental conditions. In species that fertilize internally, sperm must reach the egg at the right time after undergoing their final maturation, known as capacitation, in the oviduct. Capacitation enables sperm to develop hyperactive motility or hyperactivation – an essential motility pattern characterized by an asymmetrical flagellar bending that allows sperm to navigate through the oviduct to reach the egg –. Sperm that fail to undergo hyperactivation exhibit impaired fertilization ability. Heat has been shown to stimulate hyperactivation, a process driven by a flagellar calcium influx through the sperm-specific calcium channel, CatSper –. This ion channel is critical for male fertility, as CatSper-deficient rodents and human males are sterile –. CatSper activation is triggered by intracellular alkalinization, membrane depolarization, and, in primates, by exposure to progesterone –. However, despite extensive studies on CatSper activation, the role of temperature in its regulation remains largely unexplored.

While CatSper-mediated hyperactivation is essential for sperm fertility, premature CatSper activation must be avoided as it triggers ion channel degradation and renders sperm dysfunctional. To prevent this, a safeguarding mechanism has likely evolved to keep CatSper closed until the sperm reach the egg. A similar mechanism must also prevent CatSper activation within the male reproductive tract, as its failure could lead to male infertility.

Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of CatSper activation and deactivation, focusing on an underexplored factor influencing CatSper function- the physiological core body temperature. Despite mounting evidence that sperm hyperactivation is heat-dependent, and critical for fertilization, the role of temperature in CatSper regulation remains unexamined. Given the paramount importance of elevated temperatures (38–40 °C) in fertilization, we explored how physiological conditions mimicking the male and female reproductive tracts influence CatSper behavior.

### Update on antiarrhythmic drug pharmacology [^114P7TpG]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias constitute a major public health problem. Pharmacological intervention remains mainstay to their clinical management. This, in turn, depends upon systematic drug classification schemes relating their molecular, cellular, and systems effects to clinical indications and therapeutic actions. This approach was first pioneered in the 1960s Vaughan-Williams classification. Subsequent progress in cardiac electrophysiological understanding led to a lag between the fundamental science and its clinical translation, partly addressed by The working group of the European Society of Cardiology (1991), which, however, did not emerge with formal classifications. We here utilize the recent Revised Oxford Classification Scheme to review antiarrhythmic drug pharmacology. We survey drugs and therapeutic targets offered by the more recently characterized ion channels, transporters, receptors, intracellular Ca 2+ handling, and cell signaling molecules. These are organized into their strategic roles in cardiac electrophysiological function. Following analysis of the arrhythmic process itself, we consider (a) pharmacological agents directly targeting membrane function, particularly the Na + and K + ion channels underlying depolarizing and repolarizing events in the cardiac action potential. (b) We also consider agents that modify autonomic activity that, in turn, affects both the membrane and (c) the Ca 2+ homeostatic and excitation-contraction coupling processes linking membrane excitation to contractile activation. Finally, we consider (d) drugs acting on more upstream energetic and structural remodeling processes currently the subject of clinical trials. Such systematic correlations of drug actions and arrhythmic mechanisms at different molecular to systems levels of cardiac function will facilitate current and future antiarrhythmic therapy.

### Mechanisms of altered Ca ² ⁺ handling in heart failure [^116BmB3B]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Ca²⁺ plays a crucial role in connecting membrane excitability with contraction in myocardium. The hallmark features of heart failure are mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias; defective intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis is a central cause of contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias in failing myocardium. Defective Ca²⁺ homeostasis in heart failure can result from pathological alteration in the expression and activity of an increasingly understood collection of Ca²⁺ homeostatic and structural proteins, ion channels, and enzymes. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of defective Ca²⁺ cycling in heart failure and considers how fundamental understanding of these pathways may translate into novel and innovative therapies.

### TRP channels: a journey towards a molecular understanding of pain [^116tG8a3]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

The perception of nociceptive signals, which are translated into pain, plays a fundamental role in the survival of organisms. Because pain is linked to a negative sensation, animals learn to avoid noxious signals. These signals are detected by receptors, which include some members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels that act as transducers of exogenous and endogenous noxious cues. These proteins have been in the focus of the field of physiology for several years, and much knowledge of how they regulate the function of the cell types and organs where they are expressed has been acquired. The last decade has been especially exciting because the 'resolution revolution' has allowed us to learn the molecular intimacies of TRP channels using cryogenic electron microscopy. These findings, in combination with functional studies, have provided insights into the role played by these channels in the generation and maintenance of pain.

### Role of the calcium-sensing receptor in reducing the risk for calcium stones [^114D6QqT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The tight control of blood Ca2+ levels within a narrow range is essential for the performance of vital physiologic functions. Muscle contraction, neuronal excitation, and intracellular signaling processes acquisitively require Ca2+. It is the concerted action of intestine, bone, and kidney that controls the Ca2+ balance through the regulation of intestinal absorption, bone (de)mineralization, and renal excretion of Ca2+, respectively. Along the nephron, fine-tuning of blood Ca2+ levels takes place by Ca2+ reabsorption. The calciotropic hormones regulate Ca2+ transport processes, leading to whole-body Ca2+ homeostasis and, importantly, preserving a constant Ca2+ concentration in the blood. Defects in renal Ca2+ handling can lead to hypercalciuria, consecutive kidney stone formation, and obstructive nephropathy. Here we give an overview of the key players involved in normal Ca2+ management and describe the in-depth investigations on a renal hypercalciuric model of disease, the Trpv5 knockout mouse, which naturally displays molecular adaptations that prevent Ca2+ precipitation in the kidney.

### Calcium channel antagonists: morbidity and mortality-… [^117WRyZm]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Association with Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to have prohemorrhagic effects; specifically, they inhibit platelet aggregation. Pahor and colleagues. 7 conducted a study to determine whether an increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage exists among patients who take calcium channel antagonists. This was a prospective cohort study of 1, 636 patients more than 67 years of age who were prescribed either beta blockers, ACE inhibitors or calcium channel antagonists as monotherapy for hypertension. Hospital discharge diagnoses and death certificates were used to assess the incidence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. A summary of results is shown in Table 4. The authors concluded that an association exists between the use of calcium channel antagonists and the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the elderly population.

It is important to remember that the antiplatelet effects of calcium channel antagonists may be beneficial in patients with certain cardiovascular diseases, so the risks of an association with an increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage must be weighed against the benefits of treating diseases, such as hypertension and angina, when considering a patient for therapy with one of these agents. Many of the limitations of the previous study by Pahor and associates 7 are applicable to this study 8 as well. A major issue is the difference between the two populations studied. In general, patients who were prescribed calcium channel antagonists had a statistically significant higher percentage of comorbidities, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, stroke and diabetes. In addition, they had a statistically significant higher percentage of physical disabilities and a higher number of hospital admissions.

Not only were the patients who were prescribed calcium channel antagonists sicker than those in the control group, but they may have had a greater likelihood of cancer detection since they had more frequent hospital admissions. This study, like the others, also involved mainly short-acting formulations of calcium channel antagonists, which have limited use today compared with the longer-acting preparations. Increased Risk of Mortality in Elderly Patients In a final study by Pahor and colleagues. This study, 38 not unlike the others previously cited, 7, 8 also has limitations. As mentioned previously, no cause-and-effect relationships can be drawn from observational studies. Only associations between exposure to calcium channel antagonists and mortality can be made. Similar to the studies regarding the risks of gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cancer, 7, 8 the present study 38 used the same methods of defining hypertension, evaluating drug exposure and obtaining outcome results.

### Structural mechanisms of TRPV6 inhibition by ruthenium red and econazole [^117AYUzg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

TRPV6 is a representative of the vanilloid subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that is considered the principal epithelial calcium channel for Ca²⁺ absorption in intestines and many other organs. TRPV6 is highly selective to Ca²⁺ ([P_Ca/P_Na] > 100) – and its constitutive activity is regulated positively by membrane lipids, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) –, and negatively by Mg²⁺, which is at least partially responsible for the strong inward rectification displayed by these channels, and calmodulin (CaM) that causes Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation – by plugging the channel through a unique cation-π interaction by inserting the side chain of lysine K115 into a tetra-tryptophan cage at the pore's intracellular entrance. Dysregulation of TRPV6 leads to disturbed calcium homeostasis. Thus, knockout TRPV6 –/– mice exhibit defective intestinal Ca 2+ absorption, increased urinary Ca 2+ excretion, decreased femoral bone mineral density, lower body weight, alopecia, dermatitis, and severely impaired male fertility –, whereas changes in TRPV6 expression have been shown in several mouse models of human diseases –. Decreased mRNA and protein levels of TRPV6 have been found in placentas of women suffering from pre-eclampsia. Several human TRPV6 gene mutations have been recently linked to transient neonatal hyperparathyroidism, skeletal under-mineralization and dysplasia, and chronic pancreatitis –. Because of the central role of calcium in cancer development, TRPV6 has also been classified as an oncochannel that is involved in both increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, and overexpressed in various types of human cancer, including breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, thyroid, endometrial cancers, and leukemia. TRPV6 inhibitors can therefore be used for the treatment of a broad range of diseases associated with disturbed calcium homeostasis, including TRPV6-rich tumors –.

### Genetic T-type calcium channelopathies [^113w6W7w]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Diversity, structure and function of Ca v 3 channels

Although T-type currents recorded from various native tissues present a common feature illustrated by a low-threshold of activation around −55 mV, they also exhibit several differences in their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. This heterogeneity is in part explained by the existence of three T-type channel isoforms, Ca v 3.1, Ca v 3.2and Ca v 3.3, which in humans are encoded by the genes CACNA1G, CACNA1H and CACNA1I, respectively (figure 1A). This diversity is further enriched by the existence of several channel splice variants. Indeed, alternative splicing of Ca v 3.1, Ca v 3.2and Ca v 3.3contributes to increase the functional diversity of T-type channels and may also have important pathophysiological implications.

### Expert consensus on ion channel drugs for chronic pain treatment in China [^115hh8Yk]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ion channel drugs have been increasing used for chronic pain management with progress in the development of selective calcium channel modulators. Although ion channel drugs have been proven safe and effective in clinical practice, uncertainty remains regarding its use to treat chronic pain. To standardize the clinical practice of ion channel drug for the treatment of chronic pain, the National Health Commission Capacity Building and Continuing Education Center for Pain Diagnosis and Treatment Special Ability Training Project established an expert group to form an expert consensus on the use of ion channel drugs for the treatment of chronic pain after repeated discussions on existing medical evidence combined with the well clinical experience of experts. The consensus provided information on the mechanism of action of ion channel drugs and their recommendations, caution use, contraindications, and precautions for their use in special populations to support doctors in their clinical decision-making.

### Role of calcium-sensing receptor in mineral ion metabolism and inherited disorders of calcium-sensing [^1128fqZg]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

The extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), a G protein-coupled receptor that resides on the parathyroid cell surface negatively regulates secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The CaR is functionally expressed in bone, kidney, and gut — the three major calcium-translocating organs involved in calcium homeostasis. Further studies are needed to define fully the homeostatic roles of the CaR in tissues that are involved in systemic extracellular calcium [Ca²⁺]ₒ homeostasis. The role of the CaR in regulating calcium metabolism has been greatly clarified by the identification and studies of genetically determined disorders that either activate or inactivate the receptor. Antibodies to the CaR that either activate or inactivate it produce syndromes resembling the corresponding genetic diseases. Expression of the CaR is significantly reduced in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, which could contribute to the defective [Ca²⁺]ₒ-sensing in these conditions. Calcimimetics act as CaR agonists or allosteric activators and thereby potentiate the effects of [Ca²⁺]ₒ on parathyroid cell function. This kind of pharmacological manipulation of the CaR is now used for the treatment of hyperparathyroid states, whereby the calcimimetics increase the activation of the CaR at any given level of extracellular calcium. Calcimimetics are also an effective element in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly in dialysis patients, by virtue of reducing plasma levels of PTH, calcium and phosphate.

### Analgesic mechanisms of gabapentinoids and effects in experimental pain models: a narrative review [^112xcuTY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

The focus of perioperative pain management should be to attempt to minimise the nociceptive input and reduce the risk of transition to central sensitisation. Gabapentinoids are being increasingly used as adjuncts for management of perioperative pain. Although gabapentinoids are classed as calcium channel blockers, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood. The analgesic effect in neuropathic pain is well evidenced but the role in postoperative pain is less certain. Medline and EMBASE database searches were conducted to identify studies relating to mechanisms of action and effects in experimental animal models of inflammatory and postoperative pain and human models of experimental pain. The effects of gabapentinoids may be attributed to depression of dorsal horn sensitivity through a multitude of mechanisms. They inhibit calcium mediated neurotransmitter release through effects on α2δ-1 subunits. They inhibit forward trafficking of α2δ-1 from the dorsal root ganglion, their recycling from endosomal compartments, thrombospondin mediated processes and stimulate glutamate uptake by excitatory amino acid transporters. Mechanisms not directly related to neurotransmitter release at dorsal horn include inhibition of descending serotonergic facilitation, stimulation of descending inhibition, anti-inflammatory actions, and influence on the affective component of pain. Gabapentinoids are effective analgesics in most animal models of inflammation and postoperative pain but effects in human models are variable.

### The role of voltage-gated calcium channels in pancreatic β-cell physiology and pathophysiology [^117GxVoK]. Endocrine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels are ubiquitously expressed in various cell types throughout the body. In principle, the molecular identity, biophysical profile, and pharmacological property of CaV channels are independent of the cell type where they reside, whereas these channels execute unique functions in different cell types, such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and hormone secretion. At least six CaValpha1 subunits, including CaV1.2, CaV1.3, CaV2.1, CaV2.2, CaV2.3, and CaV3.1, have been identified in pancreatic beta-cells. These pore-forming subunits complex with certain auxiliary subunits to conduct L-, P/Q-, N-, R-, and T-type CaV currents, respectively. beta-Cell CaV channels take center stage in insulin secretion and play an important role in beta-cell physiology and pathophysiology. CaV3 channels become expressed in diabetes-prone mouse beta-cells. Point mutation in the human CaV1.2 gene results in excessive insulin secretion. Trinucleotide expansion in the human CaV1.3 and CaV2.1 gene is revealed in a subgroup of patients with type 2 diabetes. beta-Cell CaV channels are regulated by a wide range of mechanisms, either shared by other cell types or specific to beta-cells, to always guarantee a satisfactory concentration of Ca2+. Inappropriate regulation of beta-cell CaV channels causes beta-cell dysfunction and even death manifested in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes current knowledge of CaV channels in beta-cell physiology and pathophysiology.

### Spatially resolved multiomics of human cardiac niches [^114c2mex]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our work sheds new light on the cellular profiles and composition of niches in the human heart. In the CCS, P cells expressed the TF FOXP2 and ion channel genes not traditionally associated with cardiac pacemaking. These include members of the TRP family of non-selective cation channels for which their conductance is regulated by physicochemical stimuli and can modulate cardiomyocyte excitability. TRPM3, inhibited by the βγ-subunits of G i/o -coupled GPCRs, has been implicated in SAN-associated and AVN-associated GWAS traits, and could modulate P cell excitability in a fashion similar to GIRK channels. We also report ANO6, which encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel, in human CCS cells. Notably, another member of the same anoctamin family (ANO1) is the primary pacemaker channel responsible for peristaltic slow-wave generation in the Cajal cells of the gut, and was detected in mouse SAN. We developed drug2cell, a tool to identify drug-target expression at the single-cell level. This tool highlighted P cells as previously unknown cellular targets for drugs with chronotropic side effects (including GLP-1 analogues and perampanel), the mechanisms of which had remained elusive. In the future, applying drug2cell to whole-body cell atlas datasets may improve in silico screening by predicting adverse effects in cell types across all organs.

Through our spatial analyses, we showed that the glial population NC2_glial_NGF + is a niche partner of CCS cells in both nodes and the AV bundle. These cells express key elements required to maintain the glutamine pool and may therefore facilitate cardiac glutamatergic signalling in an astrocyte-like role. Similarly, our analysis highlighted multiple trans-synaptic adhesion interactions suggesting a synapse-like interconnection, as supported by the envelopment of P cells by glial processes. Consistent with the recently suggested cardiomyocyte–neuron signalling circuit, NC2_glial_NGF + cells may promote CCS innervation through the secretion of the neurotrophic factor NGF, the receptors of which (NGFR and NTRK1) are expressed in the nearby RAGP. Together, these findings indicate an important multifaceted role for NC2_glial_NGF + cells in supporting CCS cells.

### Calcium signaling in airway smooth muscle [^117Sk4V5]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Contractility of airway smooth muscle requires elevation of intracellular calcium concentration. Under resting conditions, airway smooth muscle cells maintain a relatively low intracellular calcium concentration, and activation of the surface receptors by contractile agonists results in an elevation of intracellular calcium, culminating in contraction of the cell. The pattern of elevation of intracellular calcium brought about by agonists is a dynamic process and involves the coordinated activities of ion channels located in the plasma membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Among the signaling molecules involved in this dynamic calcium regulation in airway smooth muscle cells are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cyclic ADP-ribose, which mobilize calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by acting via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, respectively. In addition, calcium influx from the extracellular space is critical for the repletion of the intracellular calcium stores during activation of the cells by agonists. Calcium influx can occur via voltage- and receptor-gated channels in the plasma membrane, as well as by influx that is triggered by depletion of the intracellular stores (i.e., store-operated calcium entry mechanism). Transient receptor potential proteins appear to mediate the calcium influx via receptor- and store-operated channels. Recent studies have shown that proinflammatory cytokines regulate the expression and activity of the pathways involved in intracellular calcium regulation, thereby contributing to airway smooth muscle cell hyperresponsiveness. In this review, we will discuss the specific roles of cyclic ADP-ribose/ryanodine receptor channels and transient receptor potential channels in the regulation of intracellular calcium in airway smooth muscle cells.

### Structures of the R-type human ca2.3 channel reveal conformational crosstalk of the intracellular segments [^1116G3S1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Here, we report the structural analysis of the human Ca v 2.3 complex. The high-resolution structure provides an accurate template for drug discovery. To investigate the role of the CH2 II helix, we determined the cryo-EM structures of a CH2 II -truncated mutant (named as ΔCH2) in addition to the full-length channel. Our studies show that CH2 II stabilizes the inactivated conformation of the channel by tightening the juxtamembrane region on the cytosolic side.

### Preventing β-cell loss and diabetes with calcium channel blockers [^117G47S6]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

In the present studies, we have combined mechanistic molecular studies, in vitro INS-1 experiments, and in vivo studies using two different mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes as well as human islets and different doses of verapamil to elucidate the potential of pharmacological downregulation of proapoptotic TXNIP for the treatment of diabetes. Our genetic models of whole body and β-cell TXNIP deficiency reported previously strongly support the role of TXNIP inhibition in the observed antidiabetic effects. Additional attractive features of this approach in regard to potential translation into clinical studies include the possibility for oral administration of verapamil or other calcium channel blockers and the fact that this class of medications has been widely used for many years, including by patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, concerns about off-target effects and cardiac complications are dramatically reduced by the fact that calcium channel blockers are heart medications and, more important, we and others have demonstrated their beneficial effect specifically in diabetic cardiomyopathy. In addition, while the strongest effects are expected in tissues with high expression levels of-type calcium channels, such as heart and β-cells, downregulation of TXNIP in other tissues seems also to be beneficial and might be responsible for the improved insulin sensitivity we observed in BTBR ob/ob mice (Fig. 7 B) as well as our previously reported double mutant congenic BTBR lep ob/ob txnip hcb/hcb.

### Calcium channel blockers and cardiovascular mortality… [^114oarLt]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers are a diverse and widely used class of medications for patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease and certain arrhythmias. All calcium channel blockers dilate coronary and peripheral blood vessels. Recent case control studies have raised concern about increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with hypertension who are receiving calcium channel blockers when compared with patients receiving other antihypertensive medications. Given the large number of patients taking these medications, it is important to determine if there is in fact a specific risk associated with the use of calcium channel blockers. Michels and associates performed a prospective study to determine if there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with hypertension who took calcium channel blockers compared with patients who used other antihypertensive medications.

A total of 14, 617 women from 30 to 55 years of age who had hypertension and regularly used antihypertensive medications were observed over a six-year period. A first fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event occurred in 385 women during this period. Women who used calcium channel blockers alone had an age-adjusted relative risk of myocardial infarction of 2. 36 compared with women receiving thiazide diuretics alone. Adjustment for coronary disease risk factors decreased the association considerably, but it still remained elevated. Women receiving calcium channel blocker therapy had a relative risk of 1. 64 compared with a

1. 88 relative risk in women receiving combination therapy. The authors found a significant elevation in the relative risk of total myocardial infarction among women who used a calcium channel blocker compared with those who did not.

However, it remains unclear if the elevation in risk for myocardial infarction among women who use calcium channel blockers is real or a result of confounding factors based on study methodologies. Clinical trials comparing long-acting calcium channel blockers against other antihypertensive agents are currently under way. Until more data are available, the authors advise following the recommendations of the Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Specifically, diuretics and beta blockers should be considered "first-line" choices for hypertension therapy, and calcium channel blockers should be reserved for special indications.

### Cellular calcium in bipolar disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112eYbkE]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The possible involvement of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in bipolar disorder has been under investigation for almost a 100 years. Researchers have compared a range of Ca 2+ parameters between cases and controls, but following landmark studies in the late 1980s, the main focus has been upon intracellular calcium ion concentrations ([Ca²⁺]), predominantly in platelets and lymphocytes. The postulated links between Ca 2+ and bipolar disorder are usually interpreted in the context of the fundamental roles of Ca 2+ in neuronal excitation, transmitter synthesis and release, and synaptic function and plasticity. Researchers also noted the effects of abnormal Ca 2+ levels on mood (e.g. in hyperparathyroidism), and the fact that lithium and some other psychotropic drug classes alter Ca 2+ functioning.

Over the past decade the study of Ca 2+ in bipolar disorder has been received new impetus from the increasingly compelling evidence that voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are part of the genetic aetiology. Interest is enhanced by the therapeutic opportunities which VGCCs provide, given their known druggability by existing calcium channel blockers and the gabapentinoids. However, despite multiple studies and several narrative reviews, there is no consensus as to the specific Ca 2+ abnormality — if any — which characterises bipolar disorder, nor is the robustness of the evidence clear. To address this gap, we have systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the literature regarding cellular Ca 2+ in bipolar disorder.

### Astroglial activation: current concepts and future directions [^115uGkN4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

14.2.3 Astroglial calcium signaling

Intracellular calcium ion homeostasis is essential for neuronal function, and impairment of calcium homeostasis might be a major mechanism through which Aβ and tau exert their neurotoxicity. The voltage‐gated calcium channels allow calcium influx following neuronal depolarization and receptor‐operated calcium channels (e.g. NMDA receptors). Treating calcium hikes represents an important therapeutic target. Toxic Aβ augments cytosolic calcium that may affect enzymes including proteases or phosphatases, resulting in cytoskeletal modifications, free radical production, and apoptosis. Aβ may cause excessive activation of calcium channels and form pores in the cytosolic plasma membrane. This allows a substantial influx of calcium ions from the extracellular space into the cytosol, impairing cellular function. Aβ has been found to potentiate calcium influx through the voltage gated calcium channels, particularly the L‐type. Nimodipine is an L‐type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor that was able to block excessive calcium influx in Aβ‐treated cultured neurons. However, this phenomenon was not observed in brain slices from mouse models of AD. In a NILVARD multicentre trial, L‐type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor attenuated Aβ levels but failed to ameliorate cognitive decline. Tau aggregates increase cytosolic calcium and ROS generation via NADPH. This effect was prevented by nifedipine and verapamil, both L‐type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitors. Tau fibrils activate voltage gated calcium channels leading to neuronal dysfunction.

NMDA receptors are permeable to calcium and often implicated in neuronal pathophysiology. Memantine is an approved NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of AD, which provides modest memory and cognitive improvements in moderate to severe AD. Memantine works by restricting excessive calcium influx, reducing neuronal excitability while preserving basal NMDA receptor function. Memantine exerts neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and tau phosphorylation. Galantamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil are the anti‐cholinesterase approved drugs to treat AD. These treatments work by increasing acetylcholine levels, which delay progression of AD through calcium‐dependent mechanisms. In addition, anti‐cholinesterase drugs administered with memantine may provide improved behavioral, cognitive, and global outcomes in patients affected with AD. Aducanumab is a controversial FDA approved treatment for MCI due to AD and mild AD in US, which selectively binds to aggregated Aβ fibrils and soluble oligomers (and not monomers) and was found to ameliorate calcium dysregulation in AD. Systemic administration of aducanumab rescued calcium overload in neurons.

### Calcium buffering in the heart in health and disease [^112FQJKA]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

The importance of changes in intracellular calcium concentration in cardiac function needs little introduction (see, for reviews). The systolic rise of ionized cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca²⁺]ᵢ) activates contraction and regulates many sarcolemmal ion currents and, thereby, the electrophysiology of the cell; abnormal Ca²⁺ handling is implicated in the genesis of arrhythmias. Calcium is also a major factor in the control of gene expression. Work using fluorescent Ca 2+ indicators has demonstrated how alterations of Ca 2+ fluxes into the cytoplasm underlie the changes of contractility in health and disease. It is often overlooked, however, that only ≈1% of cytoplasmic Ca 2+ is free, with the remainder being bound to cytoplasmic buffers. Therefore, the properties of these buffers will potentially play as large a role as Ca 2+ fluxes do in determining the size and kinetics of changes of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ.

Here we review recent progress in characterizing cytoplasmic buffers and their effects on the physiology of cardiac muscle, and disease mechanisms, as well. It is important to note that we also highlight the numerous areas where more work is required.

### Calcium and cancer: targeting Ca2 + transport [^117QdP6V]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2007). Medium credibility.

Ca2+ is a ubiquitous cellular signal. Altered expression of specific Ca2+ channels and pumps are characterizing features of some cancers. The ability of Ca2+ to regulate both cell death and proliferation, combined with the potential for pharmacological modulation, offers the opportunity for a set of new drug targets in cancer. However, the ubiquity of the Ca2+ signal is often mistakenly presumed to thwart the specific therapeutic targeting of proteins that transport Ca2+. This Review presents evidence to the contrary and addresses the question: which Ca2+ channels and pumps should be targeted?

### New insights on the role of TRP channels in calcium signalling and immunomodulation: review of pathways and implications for clinical practice [^114rghZp]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

T Lymphocytes

T cells comprise two main subsets. CD4 + T cells, or 'helper' T cells, are activated upon recognition of cognate antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II which is expressed by specialised antigen-presenting cells. Antigen recognition leads to the production of a cocktail of soluble mediators such as cytokines and chemokines which orchestrate the subsequent immune response. CD8 + T cells, or 'cytotoxic' T cells, recognise antigen encased in MHC class I, which is expressed by the vast majority of human cell populations. Antigen recognition by CD8 + T cells triggers cytotoxicity. There are several other T lymphocyte populations and sub-populations (reviewed in); however, the structure responsible for T cell activation in each case is the T cell receptor (TCR).

The details of TCR structure and signalling are complex and well beyond the scope of this review (reviewed in). However, Ca²⁺ homeostasis is key to many downstream signalling pathways and effector functions. In summary, TCR stimulation leads to the recruitment of signalling molecules and adaptors to the TCR to form a proximal signalling complex. This results in the phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase-C (PLC)-γ, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) to 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP₃ causes Ca²⁺ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Depletion of ER Ca²⁺ is sensed by STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) whose Ca²⁺-binding domain is located on the luminal surface of the ER membrane. STIM1 undergoes oligomerisation and translocation to the plasma membrane, enabling interaction with ORAI1 proteins, which are members of the CRAC channel. This process, known as SOCE, is responsible for a large and sustained increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels. It is believed that several other Ca²⁺ channels expressed on the cell surface, including TRP channels, then modulate or fine-tune Ca²⁺ flux in T cells. Calcium signalling is crucial to the development and activation of T cells. Interestingly, STIM1 has been identified as a critical modulator of intracellular calcium in T cells. Deficiencies of STIM1 expression have been linked to abnormal function of T cells. Here, we provide an overview of the role of TRP channels in the regulation of intracellular calcium in T lymphocytes (Fig. 3). The main TRP channels have been sub-grouped into TRPA, TRPC, TRPM and TRPV.

### Novel vascular biology of third-generation L-type calcium channel antagonists: ancillary actions of amlodipine [^114oUkZh]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were developed as vasodilators, and their use in cardiovascular disease treatment remains largely based on that mechanism of action. More recently, with the evolution of second- and third-generation CCBs, pleiotropic effects have been observed, and at least some of CCBs' benefit is attributable to these mechanisms. Understanding these effects has contributed greatly to elucidating disease mechanisms and the rationale for CCB use. Furthermore, this knowledge might clarify why drugs are useful in some disease states, such as atherosclerosis, but not in others, such as heart failure. Although numerous drugs used in the treatment of vascular disease, including statins and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, have well-described pleiotropic effects universally accepted to contribute to their benefit, little attention has been paid to CCBs' potentially similar effects. Accumulating evidence that at least 1 CCB, amlodipine, has pharmacologic actions distinct from L-type calcium channel blockade prompted us to investigate the pleiotropic actions of amlodipine and CCBs in general. There are several areas of research; foci here are (1) the physicochemical properties of amlodipine and its interaction with cholesterol and oxidants; (2) the mechanism by which amlodipine regulates NO production and implications; and (3) amlodipine's role in controlling smooth muscle cell proliferation and matrix formation.

### Protein kinase C-dependent activation of caV1.2 channels selectively controls human TH2-lymphocyte functions [^112nDb2v]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In addition to calcium release-activated calcium channel/ORAI calcium channels, the role of voltage-gated calcium (Cav1) channels in T-cell calcium signaling is emerging. Cav1 channels are formed by α1 (CaV1.1 to CaV1.4) and auxiliary subunits. We previously demonstrated that mouse TH2 cells selectively overexpressed CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels. Knocking down these channels with Cav1 antisense (AS) oligonucleotides inhibited TH2 functions and experimental asthma.

Objective

We investigated the expression profile and role of Cav1 channels in human T-cell subsets, with a focus on TH2 cells.

Methods

We compared the profile of CaV1 channel subunit expression in T-cell subsets isolated ex vivo from the blood of healthy donors, as well as in vitro-polarized T-cell subsets, and tested the effect of the Cav1 inhibitors nicardipine and Cav1.2AS on their functions.

Results

CaV1.4 expression was detectable in CD4(+) T cells, ex vivo TH1 cells, and TH17 cells, whereas Cav1.2 channels predominated in TH2 cells only. T-cell activation resulted in Cav1.4 downregulation, whereas Cav1.2 expression was selectively maintained in polarized TH2 cells and absent in TH1 or TH9 cells. Nicardipine and CaV1.2AS decreased Ca(2+) and cytokine responses in TH2, but not TH1, cells. Protein kinase C (PKC) α/β inhibition decreased Ca(2+) and cytokine responses, whereas both calcium and cytokine responses induced by PKC activation were inhibited by nicardipine or Cav1.2AS in TH2 cells.

Conclusion

This study highlights the selective expression of Cav1.2 channels in human TH2 cells and the role of PKC-dependent Cav1.2 channel activation in TH2 cell function. Blocking PKC or Cav1.2 channel activation in TH2 cells might represent new strategies to treat allergic diseases in human subjects.

### Calcium signalling and transport in the kidney [^114Tkw1F]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

The kidney plays a pivotal role in regulating calcium levels within the body. Approximately 98% of the filtered calcium is reabsorbed in the nephron, and this process is tightly controlled to maintain calcium homeostasis, which is required to facilitate optimal bone mineralization, preserve serum calcium levels within a narrow range, and support intracellular signalling mechanisms. The maintenance of these functions is attributed to a delicate balance achieved by various calcium channels, transporters, and calcium-binding proteins in renal cells. Perturbation of this balance due to deficiency or dysfunction of calcium channels and calcium-binding proteins can lead to severe complications. For example, polycystic kidney disease is linked to aberrant calcium transport and signalling. Furthermore, dysregulation of calcium levels can promote the formation of kidney stones. This Review provides an updated description of the key aspects of calcium handling in the kidney, focusing on the function of various calcium channels and the physiological stimuli that control these channels or are communicated through them. A discussion of the role of calcium as an intracellular second messenger and the pathophysiology of renal calcium dysregulation, as well as a summary of gaps in knowledge and future prospects, are also included.

### Different effects of hypertension and age on the function of large conductance calcium-and voltage-activated potassium channels in human mesentery artery smooth muscle cells [^1127tQP5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is one of the most common diseases and is a major risk factor for stroke, myocardial infarction, and other diseases. 1, 2 In hypertension, aberrant expression and dysfunction of the ion channels in artery smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) are the main reasons for the continuing increase in blood pressure and the higher responsibility to the vasoconstrictors. 3, 4 Large‐conductance calcium‐ and voltage‐activated potassium channels (BK Ca channels) in the ASMCs help maintain the homeostatic vascular tone by counteracting vascular tone. In addition to their membrane voltage and Ca 2+ sensitivity, these channels are activated by intracellular local Ca 2+ release events through ryanodine receptors (termed "Ca 2+ sparks") on the sarcoplasmic reticulum to produce local Ca 2+ signaling for inducing spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) in the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). 5 Contrary to reports that hypertension caused the increased functional expression of BK Ca channels in vasculature, 2, 6 we recently reported that the function of BK Ca channels was reduced in ASMCs from Han Chinese patients with hypertension. Our results supported the theory that reduced expression of the BK Ca β1 subunit would uncouple BK Ca channels (STOCs) from Ca 2+ sparks in the VSMCs, resulting in disruption of the BK Ca channel–mediated homeostatic function to counteract vascular tone during hypertension. 7

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112o4ae9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Contractile signaling and calcium handling in PAH — The RV is characterized by hypertrophy with both systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and downregulation of SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a) appears to play a critical role in the pulmonary vasculature in PAH. Observational data show intracellular calcium recycling was similar to normal left ventricles in idiopathic PAH but depressed in scleroderma‑PAH, and a follow-up study of skinned cardiomyocytes from RV biopsies revealed significant sarcomere dysfunction in scleroderma‑PAH. Knowledge gaps include a need for more insight into mechanisms of calcium homeostasis in the RV myocyte and that the occurrence, timing, and pathophysiologic relevance of changes in SERCA2a during RVH in PAH is unknown; although selective pulmonary SERCA2a gene transfer may benefit the vascular bed in PAH, whether cardiac‑targeted SERCA2a therapy would benefit the RV is unknown. Additional gaps note that the role of mitochondrial calcium handling has not been assessed in RVF, that effects of neurohormonal modulators (including inhibitors of the renin‑angiotensin/aldosterone system) and β‑adrenergic receptor antagonists on RV contractile function require further study, and that RV‑tropic agents may improve outcomes but their role and potential adverse events remain incompletely explored. Recommendations/pathway for progress specify that more studies of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling system in preclinical models and humans are required, that studies of active and passive mechanisms controlling RV diastolic and systolic function are likely to identify new insights, that more study of calcium pumps, gap junctions, and ion channels in RV myocytes is required, and that more studies focusing on regulation of SERCA2a in RVF are needed.

### New insights on the role of TRP channels in calcium signalling and immunomodulation: review of pathways and implications for clinical practice [^111k7BxL]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immunomodulation is the process which results in regulation or alteration of the scope, type, duration, or competency of an immune response. The enforcers of such scheme, immunomodulators, can be both extrinsic or intrinsic. In its broadest sense, immunomodulation encompasses any intervention directed at modifying the immune response with a therapeutic end point. Such strategies have clinical importance in the development of new vaccines, treatment of autoimmune diseases and allergies, strategies in regenerative medicine, transplantation and immunotherapy for cancer (Fig. 1). Our understanding of the complexity of the immune system has changed greatly over the past decade which has resulted in trials of new therapies against cancer and a whole subset of other diseases. Central to this expansion is our better understanding of the molecular aspect of immune system machinery.

Fig. 1
Immunomodulators can potentiate and aggravate pro- or anti-inflammatory responses based on the desired therapeutic end point. In addition to pharmacological strategies, other examples include alterations in materials used, mechanical stimulation. Biological modulation have been tried so far mostly for pro-inflammatory effects

Calcium as the most abundant mineral in the human body plays an important role in the regulation of physiological processes and is also involved in many pathological disorders. More so, it plays an important role in regulating immune function. There are many complex routes for calcium entry into the cell. Stimulation of immune cells results in the depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2+ stores. This seems to be sensed by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) located within the ER through interaction with plasma proteins, namely Orai1 protein. In turn, this results in sustained activation of calcium release-activated channels (CRACs) resulting in calcium influx, a process known as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (reviewed in). Such sustained calcium influx across the cell membrane is important for lymphocyte activation and the initiation of both innate and adaptive immune response. Other routes of calcium entry into the cell include voltage-gated calcium channels, IP3R cell surface receptors that are activated by IP3 ligand, P2X receptors and NMDA receptors. This review focusses on transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, as they are widely expressed throughout the immune system, have varied roles and offer new therapeutic potentials.

### Renin-angiotensin system expression and secretory function in cultured human ciliary body non-pigmented epithelium [^1171yTtL]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components have been identified in human ciliary body and aqueous humour, pointing to a role for the RAS in the regulation of aqueous humour dynamics. Here, the authors examine the functional expression of a RAS and the effects of angiotensin II (AII) on a signal transduction pathway and ion secretion mechanism in cultured human ciliary body non-pigmented epithelium (HNPE).

Methods

RAS expression was examined in cultured HNPE cells using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Secretory function was determined using spectrofluorescence imaging microscopy to measure cell calcium (Ca(2+)(I)) and volume responses. Single channel patch clamp techniques were employed to investigate ion channel activity.

Results

PCR analysis demonstrated the expression of angiotensinogen and the AT(1b) receptor in HNPE cells. A large conductance potassium (BK) channel (mean 190 (SEM 5.6) pS, n = 22 cells), was observed in plasma membrane patches. This channel was calcium sensitive with channel open probability (Pₒ) increasing with increasing Ca²⁺(ᵢ) (K₀.₅ 10.79 (0.44) μM Ca²⁺, Hill coefficient of 1.04 (0.04)). AII (100 nM) increased the number (N) of active BK channels in HNPE cells and also the probability of channel opening (Pₒ). N×Pₒ increased from 0.008 (0.002) to 1.38 (0.4) following the addition of AII (p = 0.0064). AII also induced a rapid rise in Ca²⁺(ᵢ) from resting values of 112 (14) nM to a peak of 992 (106) nM (p < 10⁻⁴). A simultaneous cell volume reduction of 24.70% (3.34%) (p < 10⁻⁴) occurred during this calcium signal. Losartan (1 microM) significantly blocked the AII induced BK channel activation (p = 0.0131), the Ca²⁺(ᵢ) response (p < 10⁻⁴), and the AII induced volume effect (p = 0.0046).

Conclusion

It was demonstrated that AII activates a Ca²⁺(ᵢ) signalling system which subsequently increases potassium ion channel activity. These effects are accompanied simultaneously by cell volume loss, indicating that AII acts as receptor operated secretagogue in HNPE cells. The ability of an AT(1) receptor antagonist to inhibit these processes may thus offer a new family of pharmaceutical agents to the current armamentarium in the treatment of glaucoma.

### Ankyrin is an intracellular tether for TMC mechanotransduction channels [^111XtJm8]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

(I) Quantification of initial calcium responses in body wall muscles for each genotype in (H). n = 12–16.

For (A)–(C), scale bars represent 10 μm. For (F) and (H), gray shadings represent SEMs. Calcium traces in black dashed box indicate primary mechanosensory responses, and calcium traces in red dashed box indicate secondary responses. For (G) and (I), each data point indicates the average ratio change in a time window from 11.6 s to 12 s. Error bars indicate SEMs. ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01; ✱✱✱ p < 0.001 (unpaired t test).

To test whether C. elegans muscle cells respond to mechanical stimuli, we used an automatic microfluidic device to deliver precise and repeatable mechanical stimuli to body wall muscles of C. elegans. Animals are loaded into an imaging channel that is well fitted to the worm's body size so that they are trapped, but not physically restricted, in the imaging area, and mechanical stimuli are delivered through a pair of 500-μm-width actuated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes (Figures 3 D and 3E). In wild-type animals, we observed a quick and robust calcium response to a 1-s touch stimulus with 30 psi (Figures 3 F and 3G; Video S1). This primary mechanical response was long-lasting; subsequently, a secondary calcium increase, probably caused by muscle contraction, was also observed (Figure 3 F). When we applied touch stimuli to tmc-1 mutants, such calcium responses were not observed (Figures 3 F and 3G; Video S2). This defect could be rescued by muscle-specific expression of tmc-1 (Figures 3 F and 3G), demonstrating that TMC-1 functions cell autonomously in body wall muscles. Notably, human TMC1 could also rescue the mechanotransduction defect of tmc-1 mutants, suggesting a functional conservation between human and nematode TMC genes. In contrast, we observed no significant difference between tmc-2 mutants and wild-type animals in response to mechanical stimuli (Figures 3 F and 3G). Given the different subcellular localization of TMC-1 and TMC-2 in body wall muscles (Figure 3 A), TMC-1 and TMC-2 are unlikely to form heteromeric channels in vivo, and these two highly conserved channel subunits may play distinct roles in regulating muscle function. Similar to tmc-1 mutants, calm-1 mutants also showed dramatically reduced mechanically triggered activity (Figures 3 H and 3I). This mechanosensitive response defect could be rescued by muscle-specific expression of calm-1 (Figures 3 H and 3I), suggesting that CALM-1 is cell autonomously required for TMC-1-mediated mechanosensation in body wall muscles.

### Pathological and therapeutic advances in Parkinson's disease: mitochondria in the interplay [^115ppsaM]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcium modulators

As discussed previously, Calcium (Ca 2 +) plays a key role in the normal functioning of neurons and is also involved in many cellular processes, for example, oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, proteasomal dysfunction, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis that can eventually lead to cell death in PD. Neurodegenerative conditions like PD generally affect mitochondria and the bioenergetic status of the cell, where mitochondrial Ca 2 + dysregulation plays a key role in pathogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) are still under investigation due to which Ca 2 + homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics have received more attention in recent years. Several studies have reported calcium dysregulation as the underlying mechanism for the elevated cytosolic calcium level. For example, under normal physiological conditions, voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels (L-type) are opened by neuronal plasma membrane depolarization during an action potential and closed during repolarization. In midbrain neurons, stimulation of the cells with DA lead to activation of these channels. In PD, L-type Ca 2 + channels are autonomously active leading to an increased cytosolic Ca 2 + influx. Furthermore, α-Syn itself has also been reported to increase cytosolic Ca 2 + levels by forming plasma membrane pores allowing extracellular Ca 2 + to pass. The elevated intracellular Ca 2 + levels require higher ATPase activity to transfer Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane, resulting in an extra burden to the already bioenergetically impaired neurons in PD. Increased intracellular Ca 2 + levels also affect Ca 2 + handling in intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria which might potentiate pathological effects. Zonisamide, anticonvulsant agent used for epilepsy, is a T-type calcium channel blocker, blocks recurring firing by voltage gated sodium channel blockage or by allosterically binding to GABA receptor. It aids in increasing striatal DA levels in animal model of PD and hence, entered clinical trial as an adjunctive therapy for advanced stage PD management (NCT04182399). Suvecaltamide/ CX-8998, T-type Ca 2 + channel blocker clinical trial phase II has been withdrawn which aimed at assessing its effect on tremor associated with PD (NCT03436953). Isradipine, L-type Ca 2 + channel blocker, is currently under phase III screening for PD management (NCT02168842) but it failed to slow the PD progression clinically.

### Evidence for opposing selective forces operating on human-specific duplicated TCAF genes in neanderthals and humans [^114q4Bwg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The opposing effects on the TCAF2 expression found between H4 and H5 haplogroups and the observations of high expression of both TCAF2 and TRPM8 in liver and prostate tissues are particularly intriguing. While the classical function of TRPM8 is as cold and menthol receptors for sensory neurons, it was first identified as an overexpressed gene in prostate cancer, and is known for its role in controlling calcium flux and homeostasis — an important physiological process in cold signaling. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated the role of TRPM8 in energy homeostasis; specifically, it is required for precise thermoregulation in response to cold in the fed and fasting states in mice. Not only is TRPM8 required for cold detection in mice, but TRPM8 -knockout mice raised at mild cold temperatures develop late-onset obesity and display a metabolic dysfunction with a higher content of lipid droplets in liver. This implies that the TRPM8 ion channel, in addition to its role in detecting environmental cold, is a known regulator of insulin homeostasis through neuronal control of liver insulin clearance and, thus, required for precise thermoregulatory responses to cold and fasting. Interestingly, a rare variant within the TCAF locus (chr7:143735931) was recently reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes in sub-Saharan African populations. Given this variant's restricted geographic distribution and low frequency in the GTEx data (allele frequency: ~0.4%; GTEx portal as of 2020.07.21), it explains neither the observed patterns of diversity nor the selection and the eQTL signals observed here. Therefore, if the TCAF haplotype and structural diversity affect an individual's ability to regulate TRPM8 ion-channel gating and, thus, body temperature, we hypothesize that the antagonistic forces of selection promote adaptations to a cold environment or an enhanced ability to dynamically adapt to changing conditions, such as diet. Further experimental investigations on the adaptive significance and role of the different TCAF copies in regulating TRPM8 in humans are required. These are now possible given that the structure and diversity of this dynamic locus has been more fully resolved.

### Autoregulation of cardiac L-type calcium channels [^115TpqzY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

l-Type calcium channels (LTCCs) are major contributors to electrical and contractile function of the heart. They regulate action potential duration, enable calcium entry into cardiac myocytes for contraction, and regulate growth-related signaling in the heart. In cardiac development and in mature heart disease, LTCCs are regulated at levels of acute function and transcription. In addition, LTCCs are clinically relevant therapeutic targets for antihypertensive medications. In this review, we discuss LTCC homeostasis whereby cardiac myocytes maintain LTCC expression via a novel transcriptionally regulated pathway that includes a segment of the LTCC that moves between surface membrane and nucleus.

### Epidemiologic review of the calcium channel blocker drugs… [^115hPenq]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

The approval of CCBs in the 1980s rested on their proved efficacy on the surrogate outcomes of blood pressure lowering and angina relief. 24 Few data on major cardiovascular outcomes or long-term safety were available. In addition, the Psaty et al and Pahor et al studies raised the question of whether their results, drawn from short-acting preparations, were applicable as well to the increasingly dominant long-acting CCBs. Yet, aside from the imprecision of some of these estimates, the study is prone to the same confounding-by-indication concerns that plague its peers. The prevalence of prior CHD was substantially higher in the short-acting than in the long-acting CCB group, which was in turn higher than in the alternative-drug group. These limitations make it impossible to draw firm conclusions from the findings.

In summary, based on clinical trials comparing long-acting DHPs with placebo, existing evidence supports the safety and efficacy of these agents in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In populations at modest risk of CHD, such evidence is in the form of a reduction in cardiovascular events, driven primarily by a decrease in stroke. A third large cohort study similarly showed no significant mortality difference in comparisons of patients with CHD on and off a regimen of short-acting CCBs. 61 Taken together, these studies strengthen the notion of superior BB efficacy in secondary prevention but cannot settle CCB safety or efficacy questions in the absence of BB administration. Interestingly, it did find that discontinuation because of adverse events was lower for BBs.

Regardless, because the stable angina data still allow moderate differences in risk, and in view of unproved differential symptom relief, β-blockade should be first-line therapy for this condition. Early in the controversy's development, studies suggesting an increased risk of cancer15–17 were also published. The biological plausibility of the association was provided by reports that CCBs could interfere with calcium-mediated127–129 Pahor and associates' findings, 15, 16 however, need to be viewed in the context of important limitations. Also, proved carcinogens generally exert selective tissue effects and are associated with latent periods beyond 4 years, the follow-up period in question. 35 The absence of a latency period, together with the observation that the increased risk was not confined to a particular type of cancer, supports the notion that the elevated risk may have been the effect of residual confounding.

### Calcium channel auxiliary α ₂ δ and β subunits: trafficking and one step beyond [^111SnLyf]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

The voltage-gated calcium channel α(2)δ and β subunits are traditionally considered to be auxiliary subunits that enhance channel trafficking, increase the expression of functional calcium channels at the plasma membrane and influence the channels' biophysical properties. Accumulating evidence indicates that these subunits may also have roles in the nervous system that are not directly linked to calcium channel function. For example, β subunits may act as transcriptional regulators, and certain α(2)δ subunits may function in synaptogenesis. The aim of this Review is to examine both the classic and novel roles for these auxiliary subunits in voltage-gated calcium channel function and beyond.

### The calcium-sensing receptor: a molecular perspective [^111c9XPK]. Endocrine Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Compelling evidence of a cell surface receptor sensitive to extracellular calcium was observed as early as the 1980s and was finally realized in 1993 when the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) was cloned from bovine parathyroid tissue. Initial studies relating to the CaR focused on its key role in extracellular calcium homeostasis, but as the amount of information about the receptor grew it became evident that it was involved in many biological processes unrelated to calcium homeostasis. The CaR responds to a diverse array of stimuli extending well beyond that merely of calcium, and these stimuli can lead to the initiation of a wide variety of intracellular signaling pathways that in turn are able to regulate a diverse range of biological processes. It has been through the examination of the molecular characteristics of the CaR that we now have an understanding of how this single receptor is able to convert extracellular messages into specific cellular responses. Recent CaR-related reviews have focused on specific aspects of the receptor, generally in the context of the CaR's role in physiology and pathophysiology. This review will provide a comprehensive exploration of the different aspects of the receptor, including its structure, stimuli, signalling, interacting protein partners, and tissue expression patterns, and will relate their impact on the functionality of the CaR from a molecular perspective.

### The role of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of essential hypertension… [^1116G9US]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Calcium channel blockers, originally developed for the treatment of angina and supraventricular arrhythmias, have been shown to lower elevated blood pressure effectively in hypertensive patients. Verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem represent prototype compounds for unique chemical classes with differing pharmacologic properties. These drugs lower elevated blood pressure with efficacy comparable with other commonly used antihypertensives. Combination therapy with other agents usually results in an additive response. Side effects are usually mild and reversible and usually are an extension of the drug's pharmacologic effects. Moreover, adverse metabolic effects on lipid, glucose, or potassium levels are not common.

Because of the excellent antihypertensive effects of calcium channel blockers and their potential importance in a variety of other disease states, these agents should be routinely considered for use as a first-line antihypertensive agent in appropriately selected patients with hypertension of any severity as part of a comprehensive plan to minimize cardiovascular risk.

### The immunological synapse: a dynamic platform for local signaling [^116pKiL6]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Overview and Future Questions

Ion channels have joined the array of molecules that localize at the synapse and have the potential — through local ionic signaling and physical links to receptors, enzymes, and cytoskeletal elements — to effect modulation of a network of other elements. Given the level of potential complexity, there is still much to be learned about the local signaling dynamics in the IS. Some of the key questions are: What are the mechanisms that enable ion channels to redistribute into the synapse? Figure 3b illustrates some of the key interactions that are currently known but where the exact cytoskeletal mechanisms remain undiscovered. Of particular note is the movement of the STIM1 subunit, which resides on the ER membrane, into close proximity with the Orai1 subunit, localized on the plasma membrane — might this ER translocation utilize a cytoskeletal rail system for its assembly? Conversely, what are the feedback loops between Ca 2+ signaling and synapse stabilization, notably how does localized calcium gradients affect the local balances of forces that influence cell movement? For example, in motile fibroblasts, "flickers" of calcium are observed at the leading edge, likely in part regulated by TRPM7, perhaps functioning as a stretch-sensitive calcium-permeable channel. Does "balanced" calcium flux at the IS maintain a stable (non-motile) IS and, in contrast, does variegated microcluster formation lead to a destabilization and result in probing motility? Similar questions surround the cessation of signaling at the IS: Does Ca 2+ depletion or K + accumulation in the synaptic cleft initiate or terminate signaling in DCs or B cells as the APC? Finally, how may ion channel modulators (blockers or openers) be harnessed for therapeutic action in autoimmunity and transplantation? As a promising example, Kv1.3 blockade in vivo by a peptide inhibitor has shown efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalitis and in delayed type hypersensitivity responses, and it completely immobilizes T EM cells in the periphery without altering the motility of naive T cells in the lymph node. It is becoming clear that answering these questions will require an integrated view extending from calcium channel function to localized motility and the action of the T-cell cytoskeleton.

### Opening of the human epithelial calcium channel TRPV6 [^114euYt8]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Calcium-selective transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 6 (TRPV6) channels play a critical role in calcium uptake in epithelial tissues. Altered TRPV6 expression is associated with a variety of human diseases, including cancers. TRPV6 channels are constitutively active and their open probability depends on the lipidic composition of the membrane in which they reside; it increases substantially in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Crystal structures of detergent-solubilized rat TRPV6 in the closed state have previously been solved. Corroborating electrophysiological results, these structures demonstrated that the Ca 2+ selectivity of TRPV6 arises from a ring of aspartate side chains in the selectivity filter that binds Ca 2+ tightly. However, how TRPV6 channels open and close their pores for ion permeation has remained unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human TRPV6 in the open and closed states. The channel selectivity filter adopts similar conformations in both states, consistent with its explicit role in ion permeation. The iris-like channel opening is accompanied by an α-to-π-helical transition in the pore-lining transmembrane helix S6 at an alanine hinge just below the selectivity filter. As a result of this transition, the S6 helices bend and rotate, exposing different residues to the ion channel pore in the open and closed states. This gating mechanism, which defines the constitutive activity of TRPV6, is, to our knowledge, unique among tetrameric ion channels and provides structural insights for understanding their diverse roles in physiology and disease.

### Use' em and lose' em-activity-induced removal of calcium channels from the plasma membrane [^1168Thjn]. Neuron (2007). Low credibility.

Calcium influx via L-type (Cav1.2 and Cav1.3) calcium channels is tightly regulated to ensure optimal intracellular calcium levels. Although much is known about acute modulation of these channels by second messengers, the mechanisms that control their trafficking to and from the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. In this issue of Neuron, Green and colleagues demonstrate that the opening of L-type calcium channels results in negative feedback regulation due to their calcium-dependent internalization.

### T-type calcium channels in neuropathic pain [^116Mrrzg]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Pain is a quite frequent complaint accompanying numerous pathologies. Among these pathological cases, numerous neuropathies are retrieved with identified etiologies (chemotherapies, diabetes, surgeries…) and also more diffuse syndromes such as fibromyalgia. More broadly, pain is one of the first consequences of most inherited diseases. Despite its importance for the quality of life, current pain management is limited to drugs that are either old or with a limited efficacy or that possess a bad risk benefit ratio. As no new pharmacological concept has led to new analgesics in the last decades, the discovery of new medications is needed, and to this aim, the identification of new druggable targets in pain transmission is a first step. Therefore, studies of ion channels in pain pathways are extremely active. This is particularly true with ion channels in peripheral sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia known how to express unique sets of these channels. Moreover, both spinal and supraspinal levels are clearly important in pain modulation. Among these ion channels, we and others revealed the important role of low voltage-gated calcium channels in cellular excitability in different steps of the pain pathways. These channels, by being activated nearby resting membrane potential, have biophysical characteristics suited to facilitate action potential generation and rhythmicity. In this review, we will present the current knowledge on the role of these channels in the perception and modulation of pain.

### Molecular properties and physiological roles of ion channels in the immune system [^116FoWjC]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

The discovery of a diverse and unique set of ion channels in T lymphocytes has led to a rapidly growing body of knowledge about their functional roles in the immune system. Here we review the biophysical and molecular characterization of K+, Ca2+, and Cl- channels in T lymphocytes. Potent and specific blockers, especially of K+ channels, have provided molecular tools to elucidate the involvement of voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channels in T-cell activation and cell-volume regulation. Their unique and differential expression makes lymphocyte K+ channels excellent pharmaceutical targets for modulating immune system function. This review surveys recent progress at the biophysical, molecular, and functional roles of the ion channels found in T lymphocytes.

Calcium plays a key role in skeletal mineralization and several intracellular and extracellular homeostatic networks. It is an essential element that is only available to the body through dietary sources. Daily acquisition of calcium depends, in addition to the actual intake, on the hormonally regulated state of calcium homeostasis through three main mechanisms: bone turnover, intestinal absorption, and renal reabsorption. These procedures are regulated by a group of interacting circulating hormones and their key receptors. This includes parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcitonin, fibroblast growth factor 23, the prevailing calcium concentration itself, the calcium-sensing receptor, as well as local processes in the bones, gut, and kidneys.

### A systematic review of calcium channel antagonists in bipolar disorder and some considerations for their future development [^115d7xHX]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, recent genomic, molecular and pharmacological findings provide convergent evidence that LTCCs are an important player in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder and some of its component phenotypes (memory and sleep). The case for therapeutically targeting these channels is correspondingly strengthened. In addition, trials using LTCC antagonists in bipolar disorder can (and should) now select or stratify participants based on CACNA1C risk genotype, as this may modify the treatment effect, and in due course may allow pharmacogenetic prediction of response.

Pharmacological and other considerations for LTCC antagonist drug discovery

Despite the enhanced rationale for LTCC antagonism provided by the recent data, there remain other major issues, which need to be taken into account if the therapeutic potential of this approach is to be realised. It is clear that, for various reasons, the existing licensed LTCC antagonists are unlikely to provide sufficient potency, tolerability and safety. For example, the older drugs (notably verapamil and diltiazem) have either poor or uncertain blood–brain barrier permeability and hence may not produce sufficient channel blockade for efficacy in bipolar disorder or any other disorder requiring central nervous system LTCC occupancy. Whereas this is less of a problem for most of the newer drugs, they all suffer from one or more other limitations. In particular, they all block LTCCs located in the heart and vasculature at least as effectively as they block those situated in neurons. Moreover, LTCCs in the periphery are more abundant than in brain, and so it is inevitable that there will be side effects and risks related to LTCC blockade in the cardiovascular system. Indeed, effects on brain and behaviour may not be readily observable at tolerable doses of current LTCC antagonists. Hence, new LTCC antagonists, which can overcome the current limitations and are designed specifically for central nervous system indications are required.

### Targeting voltage-gated calcium channels for neuropathic pain management [^113haTea]. Neurotherapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) play obligatory roles in diverse physiological functions. Pathological conditions leading to changes in their biophysical properties and expression levels may cause malfunctions of VGCC-mediated activities, resulting in disease states. It is believed that changes in VGCC properties under pain-inducing conditions may play a causal role in the development of chronic pain, including nerve injury-induced pain or neuropathic pain. For the past several decades, preclinical and clinical research in developing VGCC blockers or modulators for chronic pain management has been fruitful, leading to some U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs currently available for chronic pain management. However, their efficacy in pain relief is limited in some patients, and their long-term use is limited by their side-effect profiles. Certainly, there is room for improvement in developing more subtype-specific VGCC blockers or modulators for chronic pain conditions. In this review, we summarized the most recent preclinical and clinical studies related to chronic pain medications acting on the VGCC. We also included clinical trials aiming to expand the application of approved VGCC drugs to different pain states derived from various pathological conditions, as well as drug combination therapies trying to improve the efficacies and side-effect profiles of current pain medications.

### T-type calcium channels regulate medulloblastoma and can be targeted for therapy [^116NsXYh]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medulloblastoma is a CNS tumor that arises in the cerebellum, primarily in pediatric patients. The 5-year survival rate for pediatric medulloblastoma patients is ∼ 70%. Patients often experience permanent neurological deficits such as reduced motor and cognitive functions as a result of radiation and chemotherapy. Medulloblastoma is classified into four molecular subgroups: SHH, WNT, Group 3 and Group 4. SHH and WNT have a better prognosis than Group 3 and Group 4. Current treatment options for medulloblastoma include surgical resection and radio and chemotherapy but patients frequently experience permanent neurological deficits such as reduced motor and cognitive functions, reducing their overall quality of life.

T-type calcium channels are voltage gated channels that are active around resting membrane potential. They channel calcium from the extracellular space into the cell. Calcium signaling regulates numerous important cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. T-type calcium channels are deregulated in some cancers including colon carcinoma, breast cancer and gliomas. Inhibition of T-type calcium channels with the selective inhibitor mibefradil has shown significant anti-tumor effects in gliomas in preclinical. These studies formed the foundation for a Phase 1 clinical trial of mibefradil with temozolomide in recurrent glioma patients. The trial showed that mibefradil was safe with minimal side effects and elicited responses in select patients. However, a comprehensive study of the expressions, functions and therapeutic targeting of T-type calcium channels in medulloblastoma has, to our best knowledge, not been published to date.

This study aimed to elucidate the role of T-type calcium channels in medulloblastoma using a multi-omic approach incorporating transcriptomic, proteomic/phosphoproteomics, coupled to functional analyses, and experimental therapy. We hypothesized that T-type calcium channels act as oncogenes to promote medulloblastoma malignancy parameters. We analyzed publicly available data and found that T-type calcium channels are upregulated in medulloblastoma tumors and that expression correlates with patient survival. Inhibition of T-type calcium channels with mibefradil significantly reduced medulloblastoma cell growth and invasion. Additionally, mibefradil significantly reduced tumor volume in vivo and prolonged animal survival. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that inhibition of T-type calcium channels regulates numerous cellular pathways such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. Also, T-type calcium channels are co-expressed in gene modules regulating numerous cellular pathways in medulloblastoma tumors. This is the first study elucidating the roles and therapeutic targeting of T-type calcium channels in medulloblastoma.

### Definition of calcium channel blocker-NCI dictionary… [^112pVuCM]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

calcium channel blockerListen to pronunciationA type of drug that keeps calcium from entering the muscle cells of the heart and blood vessels. This causes the blood vessels to relax and widen, which allows the blood to flow more easily and lowers blood pressure. Some calcium channel blockers may also slow the heartbeat. Calcium channel blockers are used to treat high blood pressure, chest pain, abnormal heartbeat, and several other conditions. Also called calcium antagonist.

### Structural insights on TRPV5 gating by endogenous modulators [^116NYAhD]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The calcium ion is vital for an array of cellular functions, and in the human body the kidneys regulate calcium homeostasis by filtration and reabsorption. Around 99% of calcium is reabsorbed by the kidney tubules, with ~15% of that reabsorption occurring via transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) channels in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule. TRPV5 is specialized for this task and is only expressed in the apical membrane of kidney epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting tubule. When open, TRPV5 allows calcium in the urine to flow along a concentration gradient through the channel pore into the cell. This gradient is maintained by the calcium sequestering protein calbindin, which delivers calcium to active transport proteins at the basolateral membrane of the epithelium, which then export the ions into the blood stream. Though this mechanism of calcium reabsorption is responsible for only ~15% of total calcium reabsorbed in the kidney, TRPV5 activity is critical for the homeostatic balance of calcium. This is exemplified by TRPV5 knock out mice, which have been reported to have systemic calcium imbalance in the form of hypercalciuria and bone mineral loss. In humans, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TRPV5 in African–American populations result in a significant increase in calcium reabsorption that is correlated with a lower risk of nephrolithiasis. Together, these observations suggest that TRPV5 could be a potential drug target for human disorders involving altered calcium homeostasis.

### New insights on the role of TRP channels in calcium signalling and immunomodulation: review of pathways and implications for clinical practice [^112GovbS]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the human body and is central to many physiological processes, including immune system activation and maintenance. Studies continue to reveal the intricacies of calcium signalling within the immune system. Perhaps the most well-understood mechanism of calcium influx into cells is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which occurs via calcium release-activated channels (CRACs). SOCE is central to the activation of immune system cells; however, more recent studies have demonstrated the crucial role of other calcium channels, including transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. In this review, we describe the expression and function of TRP channels within the immune system and outline associations with murine models of disease and human conditions. Therefore, highlighting the importance of TRP channels in disease and reviewing potential. The TRP channel family is significant, and its members have a continually growing number of cellular processes. Within the immune system, TRP channels are involved in a diverse range of functions including T and B cell receptor signalling and activation, antigen presentation by dendritic cells, neutrophil and macrophage bactericidal activity, and mast cell degranulation. Not surprisingly, these channels have been linked to many pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis, atherosclerosis, hypertension and atopy.

### Structure, gating, and pharmacology of human ca3.3 channel [^115L8w1F]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca V channels) serve as a crucial transducer converting depolarization of membrane potential to local intracellular calcium signals, and thus initiate many physiological events, such as neuronal firing, pacemaker rhythms, neurotransmitter release as well as smooth muscle contraction –. Ca V channels can be traditionally classified into high-voltage activated (HVA) calcium channels (L, N, P/Q, and R-types), and low-voltage activated calcium channels such as T-type calcium channels –. Each Ca V subtype has distinct tissue-specific localization, electrophysiological properties, and pharmacological profiles. In particular, T-type Ca V channels, also termed as Ca V 3 channels, are widely expressed throughout the nervous, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular systems. Three T-type calcium channel isoforms, including α1G (Ca V 3.1), α1H (Ca V 3.2), and α1I (Ca V 3.3), have been identified in mammals and well characterized –, and they display distinct kinetic properties concerning their rates and voltage dependency of activation and inactivation. Among them, Ca V 3.3 is featured by slow activation and inactivation, suggesting that it plays a role in sustained firing.

### Calcium-channel blockers and end-stage renal disease: pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations [^113acg6q]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the different calcium-channel blockers.

Recent Findings

Calcium-channel blockers have been in use for some time in the end-stage renal disease population. Their primary use has been as antihypertensive and antianginal therapies. In this regard, they are effective agents. Recently, it has been noted that dialysis-related hypotension occurs less frequently in calcium-channel blocker treated patients. Also, access patency and overall patient survival are improved with calcium-channel blocker therapy.

Summary

Calcium-channel blockers are useful agents for the control of hypertension in end-stage renal disease patients and appear to favorably influence survival in this population. Calcium-channel blockers are not dialyzable and their pharmacokinetics do not substantially change with renal failure therefore they do not require dose adjustment based on level of renal function. Too few studies exist to determine if individual calcium-channel blockers differ in their effects. Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed in the end-stage renal disease population to better understand the role of calcium-channel blockers in the excess cardiovascular disease burden of this population.

### Calcium signaling in immune cells [^116vFGPg]. Nature Immunology (2009). Medium credibility.

Calcium acts as a second messenger in many cell types, including lymphocytes. Resting lymphocytes maintain a low concentration of Ca²⁺. However, engagement of antigen receptors induces calcium influx from the extracellular space by several routes. A chief mechanism of Ca²⁺ entry in lymphocytes is through store-operated calcium (SOC) channels. The identification of two important molecular components of SOC channels, CRACM1 (the pore-forming subunit) and STIM1 (the sensor of stored calcium), has allowed genetic and molecular manipulation of the SOC entry pathway. In this review, we highlight advances in the understanding of Ca2+ signaling in lymphocytes with special emphasis on SOC entry. We also discuss outstanding questions and probable future directions of the field.

### Expression of N-type calcium channels in human adrenocortical cells and their contribution to corticosteroid synthesis [^111Ky2R1]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

The inhibition of aldosterone activity is a useful approach for preventing the progression of cardiovascular and renal diseases in hypertensive patients. Although the results of our previous in vivo study suggested that N-type calcium channels may have a role in regulating plasma aldosterone levels, the direct relationship between N-type calcium channels and aldosterone production in adrenocortical cells has not been examined. In this study, the analysis of quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, western blotting, and immunocytological staining indicated the possible presence of N-type calcium channels in human adrenocortical cells (H295R cell line). Patch clamp analysis indicated that omega-conotoxin GVIA (CnTX), an N-type calcium channel inhibitor, suppressed voltage-dependent barium currents. During steroidogenesis, CnTX significantly reduced the transient calcium signaling induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) and partially prevented Ang II-induced aldosterone and cortisol formation with no significant influence on CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 mRNA expression. In addition, in α1B calcium channel subunits, knockdown significantly decreased Ang II-induced aldosterone formation with increments in CYP11B2 mRNA expression. We also investigated the inhibitory activities of some types of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs; cilnidipine: L-/N-type CCB, efonidipine: L-/T-type CCB, and nifedipine: L-type CCB), and these agents showed a dose-dependent inhibition effect on Ang II-induced aldosterone and cortisol production. Furthermore, only cilnidipine failed to suppress CYP11B1 expression in H295R cells. These results suggest that N-type calcium channels have a significant role in transducing the Ang II signal for aldosterone (and cortisol) biosynthesis, which may explain the mechanism by which N-type calcium channels regulate plasma aldosterone levels.

### Calcium antagonists for Duchenne muscular dystrophy [^114M9vGW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle condition starting in childhood, leading to severe disability and a shortened life span. It is due to severe deficiency of the protein dystrophin which performs both structural and signalling roles within skeletal and cardiac myocytes. Calcium accumulates in dystrophic muscle cells and plays a role in cell damage. It has been hypothesised that use of calcium antagonists might reduce this calcium load and its toxic effect on muscle cells.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of calcium antagonists on muscle function and muscle strength in people with DMD.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register (February 2008), MEDLINE (from January 1950 to March 2008) and EMBASE (from January 1947 to March 2008) were searched. Search terms were 'calcium antagonists' or 'calcium channel blocker' or 'dantrolene' or 'verapamil' or 'nifedipine' or 'flunarizine' or 'diltiazem' or 'amlodipine' or 'nicardipine' and 'Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne'. Bibliographies in reports of any trials were also searched.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of any calcium antagonist in people with DMD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors assessed all identified trials for inclusion in the study on the basis of whether they fulfilled the selection criteria. Both authors extracted data from the trials and assessed the methodological quality. Had there been more than one trial of the same intervention and outcome of sufficient methodological quality, we had planned to undertake a meta-analysis.

Main Results

Five randomised or quasi-randomised double-blind trials fulfilled the selection criteria, but were not sufficiently comparable to undertake a meta-analysis. The drugs studied were verapamil (8 participants), diltiazem (56 participants), nifedipine (105 participants) and flunarizine (27 participants). There were limitations in the description of blinding and randomisation, and definition of outcome measures. One trial, using verapamil, showed a difference between groups in muscle force measured by ergometry, but also revealed cardiac side effects. The numbers of people included in the trials were low, and so the studies may not have included enough people for sufficient power to detect small differences in muscle force or function between placebo and control groups. In addition, calcium antagonists were in an early stage of development and some of the second generation drugs that have a better side effect profile, such as amlodipine, have not been studied.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to show a significant beneficial effect of calcium antagonists on muscle function in DMD.

### New insights on the role of TRP channels in calcium signalling and immunomodulation: review of pathways and implications for clinical practice [^117QNBsU]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

SOCE is a widespread phenomenon among cells where upon depletion of intracellular stores of calcium, cell surface channels are activated to allow entry of Ca²⁺ ions to replenish the stores. This highlights role of the Ca²⁺ entry for developmental and/or physiological process of different cells. The first SOCE was identified by Hoth et al. in mast cells and was named Ca²⁺ release-activated Ca²⁺ channels (CRAC, which is simply a specific SOCE with high Ca²⁺ selectivity; [P_Ca²⁺/P_Na⁺] > 1000), and has been mainly found in haematopoietic cells. CRAC is subject to feedback inhibition by intracellular Ca²⁺ and is rightfully considered to be the best defined SOCE current that is activated by depletion of Ca²⁺ stores. Depletion of ER Ca²⁺ stores, in all non-excitable cells (apart from non-nucleated erythrocytes) and many types of excitable cells, causes activation of plasma membrane Ca²⁺-permeable channels. This process is known as capacitative or store-operated Ca²⁺ entry, and the term 'capacitative' gives an appropriate impression as it is possible that close interactions between the ER and plasma membrane underlies SOC activation. Above all, it should be noted that induction of I_CRAC does not necessarily require the depletion of stores and that other store depletion-stimulated currents or channels have been identified. As previously alluded to, STIM1 have been shown to sense the depletion in calcium stores and result in sustained activation of CRAC via interaction with Orai1, which is an essential pore subunit of CRAC. Mutations in Orai1 can result in immune deficiency by abolition of CRAC channel function.

### T-and L-type calcium channels maintain calcium oscillations in the murine zona glomerulosa [^114yTao8]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

The zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland is responsible for the synthesis and release of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. This steroid hormone regulates salt reabsorption in the kidney and blood pressure. The most important stimuli of aldosterone synthesis are the serum concentrations of angiotensin II and potassium. In response to these stimuli, voltage and intracellular calcium levels in the zona glomerulosa oscillate, providing the signal for aldosterone synthesis. It was proposed that the voltage-gated T-type calcium channel Ca V 3.2 is necessary for the generation of these oscillations. However, Cacna1h knock-out mice have normal plasma aldosterone levels, suggesting additional calcium entry pathways.

METHODS:

We used a combination of calcium imaging, patch clamp, and RNA sequencing to investigate calcium influx pathways in the murine zona glomerulosa.

RESULTS:

Cacna1h −/− glomerulosa cells still showed calcium oscillations with similar concentrations as wild-type mice. No calcium channels or transporters were upregulated to compensate for the loss of Ca V 3.2. The calcium oscillations observed were instead dependent on L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Furthermore, we found that L-type channels can also partially compensate for an acute inhibition of Ca V 3.2 in wild-type mice. Only inhibition of both T- and L-type calcium channels abolished the increase of intracellular calcium caused by angiotensin II in wild-type.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our study demonstrates that T-type calcium channels are not strictly required to maintain glomerulosa calcium oscillations and aldosterone production. Pharmacological inhibition of T-type channels alone will likely not significantly impact aldosterone production in the long term.

### A systematic review of calcium channel antagonists in bipolar disorder and some considerations for their future development [^112eeszm]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder is a common mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of up to 4.4%. Mood stabilisation and prophylaxis is the principal aim of treatment. Despite the established efficacy of lithium and sodium valproate, manic and depressive episodes still recur in many patients, and all the existing drug treatments suffer from poor tolerability and potential harms. There is a corresponding need for improved treatments.

Calcium signalling has long been implicated in bipolar disorder, following reports of altered levels of calcium in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with mania, and the observation that long-term lithium treatment is associated with altered calcium metabolism, including hyperparathyroidism. These reports, taken together with the similarities in the mechanism of action of lithium and calcium channel blockers, prompted investigations of these drugs (primarily verapamil) beginning in the 1980s as potential treatments for bipolar disorder. This was facilitated by the fact that verapamil and other drugs that block-type calcium channels (LTCC) were already available and in use for the treatment of hypertension and angina. However, although studies reports have continued to emerge since that time regarding LTCC antagonists in bipolar disorder, the only evidence that has been systematically assessed concerns verapamil in the treatment of mania, with the data not demonstrating superiority over placebo.

To investigate further the efficacy and tolerability of this class of drugs, we have conducted a systematic review of all LTCC antagonists in the treatment of acute episodes (both manic and depressive) and the prevention of relapse, in bipolar disorder. Our stimulus for doing so is that there is a renewed interest in the use of LTCC antagonists because the evidence for aberrant calcium signalling being important in the disorder has grown significantly in the past few years, and LTCC antagonists are still mentioned in recent guidelines for the treatment of acute mania. The evidence is twofold. First, genomic data show that LTCC genes, especially CACNA1C, which encodes the Ca v 1.2 alpha subunit, are part of the aetiology of bipolar disorder and several related phenotypes. Second, these genetic findings are complemented by new molecular and functional data arising from induced-pluripotent stem cell approaches, which considerably strengthen the prior evidence for aberrant calcium signalling in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and in the response to lithium therapy (see Discussion). Hence, in addition to a systematic review of the clinical data, we briefly review these recent findings and their implications for developing novel LTCC antagonists for use in bipolar disorder. Many of the considerations also apply to the potential role of this class of drugs for other neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Parkinson's disease and substance dependence.

### Providing alternative fuel for the brain in anorexia nervosa: a review of the literature on ketones and their effects on metabolism and the brain [^115xfTJm]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Other effects of ketone bodies and ketogenic diet on the brain

In addition to their role in body and brain metabolism, KBs have been (directly or indirectly via effects secondary to a ketogenic diet) shown to have other effects on the brain. In addition to brain metabolism, KBs affect regulation of cell signalling, neuronal firing, the release of glutamate, and gene expression modulation in the brain or neuronal cultures. There is also evidence of effects of exogenous ketones on circulating dopamine in humans and mice. KBs act as signalling molecules that coordinate a complex responsive network in the brain.

KBs also modulate neuronal excitability through several mechanisms; for example, via a reduction in neuronal firing secondary to a direct or indirect regulation of the activity of several ion channels, particularly potassium ATP-sensitive (K-ATP) channels. The effect of ketones on neuronal firing is one of the main mechanisms through which ketogenic diets might have their beneficial effect on epilepsy It has been shown that physiological concentrations of D-BHB and AcAc reduced the spontaneous firing rate of neurons, and restored energy status, calcium homeostasis, and M-channel activity in slices from different rodent brain regions. A critical role of K-ATP channels as mediating the effect of KBs activity on neuronal firing has been emphasized in a mouse genetic model with enhanced KB metabolism.

Further, KBs have also been shown to impair the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. D-BHB directly inhibits the neuronal vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) by binding to its allosteric site. VGLUTs promote glutamate uptake in synaptic vesicles for subsequent release. By limiting glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles, KBs were shown to reduce the secretion of glutamate into the synaptic cleft, thus further blocking post-synaptic neuronal excitability.

KBs have also been found to promote long–term adaptive modifications through changes in gene expression. Notably, KBs play a role in upregulating the expression of the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system. BDNF is crucial in the development of neuronal circuits regulating cognition, anxiety, and eating-related behaviours. Effects of KBs on BDNF have been shown in exposure to a ketogenic diet in humans and rodents. For example, an up-regulation of BDNF expression has been shown in cerebral cortical neurons in mice through D-BHB action. Exploratory studies in human adults have found associations between D-BHB and plasma BDNF either secondary to a KD intervention or in the context of exogenous ketone ingestion.

### Calcium choride (calcium chloride) [^115fdtjm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Pharmacology

Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the body and the major fraction is in the bony structure. Calcium plays important physiological roles, many of which are poorly understood. It is essential for the functional integrity of the nervous and muscular systems. It is necessary for normal cardiac function and is one of the factors that operates in the mechanisms involved in the coagulation of blood.

Calcium chloride in water dissociates to provide calcium (Ca²⁺) and chloride (Cl¯) ions. They are normal constituents of the body fluids and are dependent on various physiological mechanisms for maintenance of balance between intake and output. Approximately 80% of body calcium is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts; urinary excretion accounts for the remaining 20%.

### Functional large-conductance calcium and voltage-gated potassium channels in extracellular vesicles act as gatekeepers of structural and functional integrity [^115oyGyz]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our discovery of functional BK Ca channels in EVs highlights the diversity of these nanovesicles that are actively secreted by different cell types. This finding encourages further exploration of the roles that various ion channels and transporters play in EVs, which is important for understanding how these vesicles affect cellular behavior and integrity. Identifying other functional ion channels and transporters in EVs is key to understanding their roles in regulating cargo selection and influencing the responses of recipient cells. The integrity of EVs involves not just their structure but also the functional outcomes that result from interactions between these channels and their environment. These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular and organ function, impacting processes like ion balance, signaling, and metabolism.

Additionally, examining the functional outcomes of different ion channels and transporters across various cellular and organ systems will enhance our understanding of how nanovesicles operate in physiological processes. This knowledge is important for comprehending how EVs can affect health and disease, especially in terms of cell communication and the transfer of bioactive molecules. While progress has been made in this area, the study of EVs in disease conditions is still developing. As we explore their molecular composition and functions, a broader understanding of ion transport mechanisms will be important. This comprehensive approach can help identify new biomarkers for diseases and potential therapeutic targets.

In summary, further research into the roles of ion channels and transporters in EVs will deepen our understanding of their functions and could lead to practical applications in clinical settings. By utilizing the unique properties of EVs, we may develop new diagnostic tools and therapies that leverage their roles in cellular communication and disease processes.

### No role of calcium-and ATP-dependent potassium channels in insulin-induced vasodilation in humans in vivo [^112vcmWr]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

The mechanism of insulin-induced vasodilation has not been completely clarified, but could be important in future treatment strategies of insulin resistance. Recently, a role for calcium-dependent and ATP-dependent potassium (K(Ca) and K(ATP)) channels in insulin-induced vasodilation has been demonstrated in in vitro studies. A role for these channels has never been confirmed in humans in vivo. Therefore, we investigated the role of these channels in insulin-induced vasodilation in humans in vivo. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was combined with intra-arterial infusion of placebo, tetraethylammonium (blocker of K(Ca) channels) or glibenclamide (blocker of K(ATP) channels) in three groups of 12 healthy volunteers. Bilateral forearm blood flow was measured with venous occlusion plethysmography. Systemic hyperinsulinemia induced a 20 ± 9% vasodilation (p = 0.001). Neither tetraethylammonium nor glibenclamide reduced this vasodilation as compared to placebo. According to the results of the present study, insulin-induced vasodilation seems not to be mediated by the opening of K(Ca) and K(ATP) channels in humans in vivo.

### Constitutively active TRPC channels of adipocytes confer a mechanism for sensing dietary fatty acids and regulating adiponectin [^113SsTN8]. Circulation Research (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

Calcium entry is pivotal in the heart and blood vessels, but its significance and mechanisms in adipose tissue are largely unknown. An important factor produced by adipocytes is adiponectin, which confers myocardial protection, insulin-sensitization, and antiatherosclerotic effects.

Objective

To investigate the relevance of calcium channels to adipocytes and the production of adiponectin.

Methods and Results

Microarray analysis led to identification of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)1 and TRPC5 as channel subunits that are induced when adipocytes mature. Both subunits were found in perivascular fat of patients with atherosclerosis. Intracellular calcium and patch-clamp measurements showed that adipocytes exhibit constitutively active calcium-permeable nonselective cationic channels that depend on TRPC1 and TRPC5. The activity could be enhanced by lanthanum or rosiglitazone, known stimulators of TRPC5 and TRPC5-containing channels. Screening identified lipid modulators of the channels that are relevant to adipose biology. Dietary ω-3 fatty acids (eg, α-linolenic acid) were inhibitory at concentrations that are achieved by ingestion. The adipocyte TRPC1/TRPC5-containing channel was functionally negative for the generation of adiponectin because channel blockade by antibodies, knock-down of TRPC1-TRPC5 in vitro, or conditional disruption of calcium permeability in TRPC5-incorporating channels in vivo increased the generation of adiponectin. The previously recognized capability of α-linolenic acid to stimulate the generation of adiponectin was lost when calcium permeability in the channels was disrupted.

Conclusions

The data suggest that TRPC1 and TRPC5 contribute a constitutively active heteromultimeric channel of adipocytes that negatively regulates adiponectin and through which ω-3 fatty acids enhance the anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin.

### Targeting calcium regulation for heart failure and arrhythmia therapeutics: a critical review [^113NZEHB]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in pharmacologic and procedural therapies, heart failure (HF) and cardiac arrhythmias remain significant global health burdens, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Defective Ca 2+ handling in cardiac myocytes is recognized as a central pathogenic mechanism underlying both heart failure and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. In this review, we critically assess the current state of research on Ca 2+ -handling proteins and their role in causing heart failure and arrhythmias, highlighting therapeutic implications. Recent paradigm-shifting discoveries, clinical trial outcomes, and challenges of targeting Ca 2+ -handling proteins are examined. As outlined in this review, an improved understanding of the relevant proteins and their differential expression and function in human health and disease is crucial for developing Ca 2+ handling-targeted therapeutics that can fundamentally alter the natural history of heart failure and arrhythmias.

### Nifedipine (afeditab) [^114qADnq]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Nifedipine is a calcium ion influx inhibitor (slow-channel blocker or calcium ion antagonist) which inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The contractile processes of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Nifedipine selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across the cell membrane of vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle without altering serum calcium concentrations.

Mechanism of Action:

The mechanism by which nifedipine reduces arterial blood pressure involves peripheral arterial vasodilatation and, consequently, a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance. The increased peripheral vascular resistance that is an underlying cause of hypertension results from an increase in active tension in the vascular smooth muscle. Studies have demonstrated that the increase in active tension reflects an increase in cytosolic free calcium.

Nifedipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator which acts directly on vascular smooth muscle. The binding of nifedipine to voltage-dependent and possibly receptor-operated channels in vascular smooth muscle results in an inhibition of calcium influx through these channels. Stores of intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle are limited and thus dependent upon the influx of extracellular calcium for contraction to occur. The reduction in calcium influx by nifedipine causes arterial vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance which results in reduced arterial blood pressure.

### Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: basic pharmacological similarities but fundamental therapeutic differences [^116v8y6U]. Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Recent trials indicate that treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients (including those with significant coronary artery disease). Since the fundamental mechanism of action of all CCBs is the same, it might be assumed that the findings of these outcome studies can be generalized to all types of CCB. However, in the light of the well-recognized clinical pharmacological differences between the 'rate-limiting' agents, verapamil and diltiazem, and the dihydropyridine group of CCBs, this must be considered to be a misconception. Less well-recognized, and often ignored, are the significant differences between agents within the dihydropyridine group. These differences translate to distinct differences in the therapeutic profiles and may well translate into differences in outcome during long-term treatment. Thus, the differences in pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and therapeutic profiles make it clear that caution should be exercised in assuming that all dihydropyridine CCBs licensed for once-daily administration are equivalent in terms of their durations of action and overall antihypertensive efficacy.

### Calcium currents and arrhythmias: insights from molecular biology [^112SRukp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Calcium channels are critical to normal cardiac function. They are involved in the generation and conduction of the action potential and in contraction. Three surface membrane channels have been identified. The L-type Ca channel is most abundant and is responsible for Ca entry into the cell that triggers contraction. T-type Ca channels are most prevalent in the conduction system and are probably involved in automaticity. A newly described TTX-sensitive calcium current may be important in "boosting" or enhancing conduction and contraction. The main intracellular Ca channel resides in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is responsible for the release of the Ca that activates contraction. Oscillatory behavior of this channel influences the sarcolemmal membrane, causing delayed aftercontractions and arrhythmias such as those seen in digoxin toxicity. The on-going molecular characterization of these channels will enhance our knowledge of their normal function and dysfunction in disease states, leading to the development of new therapeutic agents to treat arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction.

### Molecular pathway and structural mechanism of human oncochannel TRPV6 inhibition by the phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabivarin [^116oNyGj]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

TRPV6, a representative of the vanilloid subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, is the principal calcium uptake channel that captures diet-delivered calcium ions in the gut –. Dysregulation of this essential gatekeeper and master regulator of calcium uptake leads to disturbed calcium homeostasis. For example, knockout Trpv6 –/– mice have been shown to exhibit defective absorption of intestinal Ca 2+, increased urinary Ca 2+ excretion, decreased femoral bone mineral density, lower body weight, alopecia, dermatitis, and severely impaired male fertility –. Moreover, several human TRPV6 gene mutations have recently been linked to transient neonatal hyperparathyroidism, skeletal under-mineralization and dysplasia, hypercalciuria, chronic pancreatitis, various reproductive diseases, Pendred syndrome and Crohn's-like disease –.

Given the central role of calcium in cancer development, it is not surprising that TRPV6 was shown to overexpress in some of the most aggressive human cancers, including breast, prostate, colon, ovarian, thyroid, endometrial cancers, and leukemia –. For instance, Peleg et al. found that TRPV6 overexpression contributes to colonic crypt hyperplasia in mice and colon cancer cell proliferation in humans. Accordingly, suppression of TRPV6 expression was suggested to underlie cancer protective effects in the colon caused by high calcium diet. Strikingly, in 93% of biopsies, the levels of TRPV6 were elevated to greater extent in invasive than in noninvasive tumor areas. Moreover, the ancestral variant of this oncochannel has recently emerged as a driver of higher incidence, higher mortality, and more aggressive forms of cancer in people of African descent. Drugs capable of regulating TRPV6 activity are therefore urgently needed.

### Block of T-Type Ca²⁺ channels is an important action of succinimide antiabsence drugs [^114JW3Q4]. Epilepsy Currents (2002). Low credibility.

The role of calcium channel blockade in the antiepileptic action of ethosuximide is controversial, especially regarding the potency and efficacy of block. However, recent evidence obtained from transgenic animals and heterologous expression systems supports a major role of T-type calcium channels in both the generation of absence seizures and the action of ethosuximide in human absence epilepsy.

### Neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels: structure, function, and dysfunction [^117N14eo]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Voltage-gated calcium channels are the primary mediators of depolarization-induced calcium entry into neurons. There is great diversity of calcium channel subtypes due to multiple genes that encode calcium channel α1 subunits, coassembly with a variety of ancillary calcium channel subunits, and alternative splicing. This allows these channels to fulfill highly specialized roles in specific neuronal subtypes and at particular subcellular loci. While calcium channels are of critical importance to brain function, their inappropriate expression or dysfunction gives rise to a variety of neurological disorders, including, pain, epilepsy, migraine, and ataxia. This Review discusses salient aspects of voltage-gated calcium channel function, physiology, and pathophysiology.

### The role of mechanosensitive piezo channels in chronic pain [^114igSx2]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Mechanosensitive Piezo channels are ion channels activated by mechanical stimuli, playing a crucial role in mechanotransduction processes and mechanical hypersensitivity. When these channels are subjected to mechanical loading, membrane currents rise instantaneously, depolarizing and activating voltage-gated calcium channels. This results in an increase in intracellular Ca 2+, which contributes to heightened sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. This review delves into the characteristics and mechanisms of Piezo channels in chronic pain.

Recent Findings

The findings suggest that Piezo channels are integral to the occurrence and development of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, visceral pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache or orofacial pain, and inflammatory pain. Piezo channels significantly impact pain perception and transmission. These channels' critical involvement in various pain types highlights their potential as promising targets for chronic pain therapy.

Summary

This review discusses the role of Piezo channels in chronic pain. By understanding these pain mechanisms, new therapeutic strategies can be developed to alleviate chronic pain, offering hope for patients suffering from these debilitating conditions.

### Structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Ca (V) 1.1 at 3.6 å resolution [^115HsRek]. Nature (2016). Excellent credibility.

The voltage-gated calcium (Ca v) channels convert membrane electrical signals to intracellular Ca 2+ -mediated events. Among the ten subtypes of Ca v channel in mammals, Ca v 1.1 is specified for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal muscles. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the rabbit Ca v 1.1 complex at a nominal resolution of 3.6Å. The inner gate of the ion-conducting α1-subunit is closed and all four voltage-sensing domains adopt an 'up' conformation, suggesting a potentially inactivated state. The extended extracellular loops of the pore domain, which are stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds, form a windowed dome above the selectivity filter. One side of the dome provides the docking site for the α2δ-1-subunit, while the other side may attract cations through its negative surface potential. The intracellular I-II and III-IV linker helices interact with the β 1a -subunit and the carboxy-terminal domain of α1, respectively. Classification of the particles yielded two additional reconstructions that reveal pronounced displacement of β 1a and adjacent elements in α1. The atomic model of the Ca v 1.1 complex establishes a foundation for mechanistic understanding of excitation-contraction coupling and provides a three-dimensional template for molecular interpretations of the functions and disease mechanisms of Ca v and Na v channels.

### Calcium channel blockers: an update [^113tMEg3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the current literature pertaining to calcium channel blockers, including their classification, properties, and therapeutic indications, in light of several recent trials that have addressed their safety. Calcium channel blockers are a structurally and functionally heterogeneous group of medications that are used widely to control blood pressure and manage symptoms of angina. They are classified as dihydropyridines or nondihydropyridines. As a class, they are well tolerated and are associated with few side effects. The question of whether they may precipitate cardiovascular events has been largely settled by recent trials, such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the International Verapamil Slow-Release/Trandolapril Study (INVEST), and the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) study, in which no such association was found. Even so, the use of these agents has been linked with an increased risk of heart failure. Thus, long-acting calcium channel blockers may be safely used in the management of hypertension and angina. However, as a class, they are not as protective as other antihypertensive agents against heart failure.

### Calcium influx through plasma-membrane nanoruptures drives axon degeneration in a model of multiple sclerosis [^116Lw3dq]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Together these findings highlight how directly measuring calcium levels in different axonal compartments can illuminate our understanding of the role of calcium homeostasis in diseased axons. Indeed, when we used our approach to probe the mechanisms of calcium influx across the axonal plasma membrane, we found that canonical pathways of neuronal calcium influx such as opening of glutamate receptor and voltage-gated calcium channels or reverse action of the sodium-calcium exchanger are unlikely to drive calcium accumulation during focal axonal degeneration. In the case of glutamate, we found that, while exposure of the dorsal spinal cord to glutamic acid is sufficient to induce cytoplasmic calcium accumulation in neuronal cell bodies that can be found dispersed in the white matter, no such changes of the cytoplasmic calcium are induced in axons that run next to these neurons. One possible explanation might be the different densities of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are relatively abundant at synaptic and extra-synaptic locations on the cell body and dendrites but found only in confined nanocomplexes along mature axons in rodents and humans. Our data here suggest that the glutamate receptors in such nanocomplexes are insufficient to induce marked changes of the intra-axonal calcium levels or morphological alterations at least in mature CNS axons as probed here.

We also did not observe a protective effect of bepridil, a drug that blocks the sodium-calcium exchanger, on axonal calcium levels or the progression of focal axonal degeneration despite the fact that a similar local application of bepridil was able to completely block cytoplasmic calcium accumulation and axon damage induced by application of an exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor. The latter finding is consistent with previous reports that have demonstrated a protective effect of sodium channel blockers and inhibitors of the sodium-calcium exchanger on nitric-oxide-mediated neurodegeneration. Taken together, these findings indicate that, while NO and its downstream products can effectively induce axon degeneration, it is only one of several toxic mediators in EAE lesions and targeting NO actions alone is insufficient to prevent inflammatory axon degeneration at least in acute highly inflammatory EAE lesions. Similarly, blocking L- and T-type calcium channels with lomerizine, an intervention that limits secondary axon degeneration after optic nerve injury, could not prevent calcium accumulation and axon degeneration in acute neuroinflammatory lesions.

Calcium channel blockers in asthma — rationale and research questions are introduced, stating that "researchers have questioned whether calcium channel blockers (CCBs) might be efficacious in the treatment of this illness" and explaining mechanistic plausibility: "cytoplasmic calcium is involved in bronchoconstriction, mast cell mediator release, vagal reflex stimulation, airway mucus gland secretion, chemotaxis of eosinophils, and possibly even smooth muscle remodeling". The background cites "Middleton's suggestion that excessive permeability of airway cilia to calcium ions might play a role in the underlying mechanism of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and asthma".

### Calsequestrin: a well-known but curious protein in skeletal muscle [^1118RvJd]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Generally, the Ca 2+ supply in intracellular Ca 2+ signals consists of two Ca 2+ pools: internal Ca 2+ (in the endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER or SR)) and extracellular Ca 2+. To sustain body postures and perform body movements, skeletal muscle contracts or relaxes, and the main key elements governing skeletal muscle contraction and relaxation are well understood. During contraction and relaxation, the movements of contractile proteins in skeletal muscle cells (myotubes in culture conditions and fibers from skeletal muscle tissue) are mainly dependent on the cytosolic level of Ca 2+ ions that are released from the SR. Dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR, a voltage-gated Ca 2+ channel (i.e. Cav1.1.) on the transverse (t)-tubule membrane) senses the depolarization of the t-tubule membrane (i.e. action potentials) in response to acetylcholine that is released from motor neurons. T-tubules are invaginations of the plasma membrane and have a transverse orientation with respect to the main axis of myofibrils. The conformational changes in DHPR due to the action potential subsequently activate ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1, an internal Ca 2+ release channel on the SR membrane) via physical interactions (not all RyRs but every other RyR). The interaction allows the release of Ca 2+ from the SR to the cytosol through RyR1. The released Ca 2+ from the SR turns on contractile proteins and evokes skeletal muscle contraction. In short, a transient elevation in cytosolic Ca 2+ levels due to Ca 2+ release from the SR couples the action potential and muscle contraction (so-called "excitation–contraction (EC)" coupling). EC coupling is defined as an "orthograde signal" from DHPR in the t-tubule membrane to RyR1 in the SR membrane (to distinguish it from the retrograde signal from RyR1 to DHPR or the reverse-directional signals from proteins in the SR or on the SR membrane to proteins or events in the t-tubule/plasma membrane). Three different genes on chromosomes 19, 1, and 15 encode three distinct isoforms of RyRs (RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3). RyR1 is predominant in skeletal muscle, whereas RyR3 is expressed at much lower amounts than RyR1 in skeletal muscle. In addition to the physical interaction of DHPR and RyR1, the Ca 2+ that is released from SR binds and activates nearby RyR1, which does not interact physically with DHPR. This is called Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release, which contributes to rapid intracellular Ca 2+ release from the SR and to the amplification of Ca 2+ -mediated signals.

### A Ca²⁺-dependent transgenic model of cardiac hypertrophy: a role for protein kinase calpha [^1153KpRR]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium imbalances have been implicated as an underlying mechanism of human cardiac dysfunction. The voltage-dependent calcium channel plays a critical role in calcium regulation in the heart. Thus, aberrant calcium signaling arising from this channel could initiate the calcium imbalances observed in heart failure. In the present study, we used a transgenic mouse with an increased number of L-type calcium channels to identify the role of an increased, sustained ingress of calcium as an initiator of hypertrophy.

Methods and Results

Whole-heart histology and electrophysiology in isolated cardiomyocytes identified calcium-channel overexpression in the hearts of transgenic mice. Calcium-channel density was increased in 2-, 4-, and 8-month-old transgenic cardiomyocytes. Ventricular fibrosis, damage, and remodeling became more pronounced as the transgenic mice aged. Apoptosis was also present in transgenic hearts at 8 months of age. Increased protein kinase Calpha activation was elevated before the development of hypertrophy and failure.

Conclusions

Transgenic mice developed hypertrophy and severe cardiomyopathy as a function of age, thus confirming that changes in channel density are sufficient to induce disease. The small, sustained increase in the ingress of Ca²⁺ through the calcium channel elevated protein kinase Calpha before the development of hypertrophy, suggesting that protein kinase Calpha plays an important role in triggering hypertrophy.

### Phosphoinositides and intracellular calcium signaling: novel insights into phosphoinositides and calcium coupling as negative regulators of cellular signaling [^114KzNUS]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Intracellular Ca 2+ is a universal and versatile signaling molecule that controls many cellular processes, including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, hormone secretion, organelle communication, cell metabolism, and cell growth. Given the versatility and diversity of Ca 2+ functions, intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis is tightly regulated by spatiotemporally coordinated interactions of plasma membrane channels and transporters, as well as ER and mitochondrial Ca 2+ transporters and pumps –. Thus, dysregulation of Ca 2+ channels, pumps, and transporters in the plasma membrane, ER, and mitochondria has been shown to play an essential role in insulin resistance in diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, obesity-induced ER dysfunction leads to Ca 2+ depletion from ER stores and activation of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Chronic Ca 2+ depletion in the ER results in intracellular and mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload, which may further exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, such as a reduction in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

Ca 2+ and PIPs are versatile signaling molecules associated with many regulatory cellular pathways. Although the mechanistic details of Ca 2+ and PIP coupling are only now beginning to be understood, it is evident that through crosstalk, synergy, and negative feedback mechanisms, intracellular Ca 2+ fine-tunes PIP signaling to mediate complex metabolic responses. Although alterations in intracellular Ca 2+ homeostasis have been shown to be key pathophysiological events in insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, we discuss the molecular mechanism underlying intracellular Ca 2+ -mediated inhibition of PH-domain-carrying protein targeting the plasma membrane. We will also discuss the potential role of intracellular Ca 2+ as a contributing factor to the inhibition of PIP signaling, especially signaling mediated through the targeting of C2 and PH domain–carrying proteins to the membrane. Throughout this review, we highlight the expression and function of various Ca 2+ channels, pumps, and transporters in the plasma membrane, ER, and mitochondria and describe their roles in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Calcium chloride in water dissociates to provide calcium (Ca²⁺) and chloride (Cl⁻) ions. They are normal constituents of the body fluids and are dependent on various physiological mechanisms for maintenance of balance between intake and output. Approximately 80% of body calcium is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts; urinary excretion accounts for the remaining 20%.

For arrhythmia triggers that are secondary to dysfunctional intracellular Ca 2+ cycling, there are few, if any, agents that specifically target the Ca 2+ handling machinery. However, several candidates have been proposed in the literature. Here we review the idea that these agents or their derivatives will prove invaluable in clinical applications in the future.

### Understanding the role of cavia transient receptor potential (TRP) channel in viral infection: implications in developing future antiviral strategies [^115LSBcc]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Group II (single-stranded DNA viruses)

Human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) viral capsid protein, VP1, have phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-like activity. PLA2 has been reported to activate the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), aiding viral replication. Additionally, human endothelial cells (HMEC-1) infected with the B19 VP1 clone display accelerated CRAC channel activities, suggesting calcium's essential role in the pathophysiology of B19 infection.

Similarly, adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection to the host cells depends on the perturbation of host calcium homeostasis. Further, knock-out studies on secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 [SPCA1] encoded by the ATP2C1 gene in the Golgi network significantly abrupted the vesicular transport and changed the conformation of capsid for the nuclear entry. Additionally, increasing intracellular calcium levels through pharmacological modulators facilitates AAV transduction in both in vitro and in vivo models.

2.3 Group III (double-stranded RNA viruses)

Rotavirus (RV) non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) is found to be a viroporin, which localizes itself on the ER membrane, thereby inducing Ca 2+ release from the intracellular stores to the cytosol. NSP4-mediated ER Ca 2+ depletion contributes to SOCE, which in turn triggers Ca 2+ influx from the extracellular environment via PM. NSP4 viroporin is also found to be critical for viral replication and pathogenesis. Similarly, VP6 protein in rhesus rotavirus (RRV) is also reported to induce ERK phosphorylation, leading to the activation of PM-localized L-type calcium channels and resulting in the rise of intracellular calcium levels.

Similarly, orthoreovirus, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and bluetongue virus (BTV) requires increased calcium levels for the efficient viral infection. In orthoreovirus, intracellular calcium is found to be essential to carry out cell-cell fusogens and syncytium formation. On the other hand, IBDV viral protein, pep46, and BTV viral protein, non-structural phosphoprotein 2 (NS2), are calcium-dependent proteins. The former, pep46, requires elevated calcium for viral entry and lower calcium in the vesicles for its endosomal escape. The latter, NS2-calcium interactions, are crucial for the assembly of the viral inclusion body (VIB), which aids in viral replication.

### Small-conductance Ca-activated kchannels: insights into their roles in cardiovascular disease [^111aJpz5]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Life-threatening malignant arrhythmias in pathophysiological conditions can increase the mortality and morbidity of patients with cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac electrical activity depends on the coordinated propagation of excitatory stimuli and the generation of action potentials in cardiomyocytes. Action potential formation results from the opening and closing of ion channels. Recent studies have indicated that small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels play a critical role in cardiac repolarization in pathophysiological but not normal physiological conditions. The aim of this review is to describe the role of SK channels in healthy and diseased hearts, to suggest cardiovascular pathophysiologic targets for intervention, and to discuss studies of agents that target SK channels for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

### A family of calcium-permeable channels in the kidney: distinct roles in renal calcium handling [^113DoMdh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Calcium is an essential intracellular messenger and a major component of the mineral phase of the skeleton. Calcium is absorbed in the intestine and reabsorbed in the kidney. The underlying transepithelial calcium transport mechanisms play crucial roles in calcium homeostasis. In this review, we present new developments in the area of calcium transport at the apical membrane, the first step in transepithelial calcium transport.

Recent Findings

Recently, a group of transient receptor potential (TRP)-related calcium-permeable channels has been identified. Several of these channels serve as important epithelial calcium entry mechanisms and possibly also as osmolarity sensors.

Summary

Calcium channels in the kidney play important roles in maintaining total body calcium homeostasis. Their dysfunction may be associated with several human diseases such as hypercaliuric nephrolithiasis, certain forms of osteoporosis, Gitelman's disease and Bartter's syndrome.

### Store-operated CRAC channels: function in health and disease [^112iEHib]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2010). Medium credibility.

Elevation of cytosolic Ca(2+) levels through the activation of store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels is involved in mediating a disparate array of cellular responses. These include secretion, metabolism and gene expression, as well as cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, emerging evidence points to the involvement of aberrant CRAC channel activity in human diseases, such as certain types of immunodeficiency and autoimmunity disorders, allergy, and inflammatory bowel disease. This article summarizes recent advances in understanding the gating and function of CRAC channels, their links to human disease and key issues for the development of channel blockers.
