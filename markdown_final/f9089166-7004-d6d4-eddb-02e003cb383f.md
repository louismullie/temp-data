## Question

antidepressant with the least nausea side effect

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidepressant has the least nausea side effect. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "least nausea" clinically and what outcomes matter most. Then, I should verify which antidepressants consistently show the lowest nausea rates in head-to-head and meta-analytic data. Next, I will examine dose, formulation, and titration effects that can modulate nausea risk. After that, I should consider patient-specific modifiers such as sex, age, and comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation with caveats and monitoring advice, making sure I anchor each claim to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "least nausea" should reflect both the incidence of treatment-emergent nausea and the severity and persistence of nausea, including whether it leads to discontinuation, because mild, transient nausea is more acceptable than frequent, severe, or persistent nausea that undermines adherence.

> I will now examine direct comparative evidence. Wait, let me verify the strongest signals: multiple meta-analyses and systematic reviews indicate mirtazapine has markedly lower nausea risk than SSRIs, with a pooled relative risk around 0.3, and bupropion also shows substantially less nausea than SSRIs, with relative risks around 0.6 in older comparative analyses, while escitalopram tends to have lower nausea than several other SSRIs and SNRIs in head-to-head trials and pooled analyses [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb] [^44b33b3a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check class effects and outliers. SSRIs and SNRIs as classes have higher gastrointestinal adverse event burdens, with nausea commonly the most frequent early side effect; venlafaxine and duloxetine in particular have higher nausea rates and discontinuations due to adverse events than many SSRIs, whereas escitalopram and sertraline are somewhat better tolerated within the SSRI class, though still higher than mirtazapine or bupropion for nausea specifically [^71a6466e] [^c8f5e2fd] [^44b33b3a].

> Next, I should review dose and formulation effects that can mitigate nausea. Let me consider this carefully: for vortioxetine, nausea is dose-related and front-loaded in the first 1–2 weeks; slow titration and use of oral drops can reduce early nausea incidence and improve tolerability without sacrificing efficacy, and the same principle applies broadly to SSRIs and SNRIs where starting low and going slow reduces early gastrointestinal adverse effects and improves adherence [^f56a8273] [^6f9d7a78] [^a58429d1] [^54e15b50].

> I need to ensure I account for patient-specific modifiers. Females report higher nausea rates with several antidepressants, older adults may be more sensitive to serotonergic activation and hyponatremia risks, and patients with IBD or functional GI disorders may fare better with agents that do not accelerate motility; mirtazapine's serotonergic modulation without SERT blockade and bupropion's noradrenergic/dopaminergic profile can be advantageous in these contexts, though I should confirm individual risk–benefit before choosing off-label options [^d81d6bd8] [^d1af4646] [^29bfb3c5].

> But wait, what if the patient prioritizes avoiding sedation or weight gain? I should balance trade-offs. Mirtazapine has lower nausea but higher risks of sedation and weight gain, whereas bupropion has lower nausea and less sexual dysfunction but can be activating and is contraindicated in seizure disorders; escitalopram remains a reasonable middle ground with moderate nausea risk and favorable overall tolerability if a first-line SSRI is preferred [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb] [^44b33b3a].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy while keeping the evidence strength in mind. Tier 1 options with the most consistent low-nausea signals are mirtazapine and bupropion, with mirtazapine showing the largest relative reduction in nausea versus SSRIs and bupropion close behind. Tier 2 options with moderate nausea risk include escitalopram and sertraline among SSRIs, recognizing that within-class differences exist and that slow titration helps. Tier 3 options with higher nausea propensity include venlafaxine, duloxetine, and fluvoxamine, which should generally be avoided when minimizing nausea is paramount unless other clinical priorities override this concern [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb] [^44b33b3a] [^7792277e].

> I should confirm practical mitigation steps that apply regardless of agent. Start low, go slow, take with food, consider bedtime dosing if activation occurs, and counsel that early nausea often abates within 1–2 weeks; these strategies reduce discontinuation and improve adherence, which is especially important in the first month when dropout risk is highest [^a58429d1] [^54e15b50] [^699b228d].

> Final check and bottom line: based on comparative meta-analyses, head-to-head trials, and class-effect data, mirtazapine has the most consistently lowest nausea risk among antidepressants, with bupropion a close alternative when sedation or weight gain from mirtazapine is undesirable. Escitalopram is the most nausea-tolerable SSRI option if a serotonergic first-line agent is preferred, and vortioxetine can be made more tolerable with slow titration or oral drops, though its intrinsic nausea risk is higher than mirtazapine or bupropion [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb] [^44b33b3a] [^d81d6bd8] [^6f9d7a78].

---

The antidepressants with the **lowest risk of nausea** are mirtazapine and bupropion [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb]. Mirtazapine has the **lowest nausea risk** among antidepressants, with nausea rates around 7–10% and a favorable tolerability profile [^8e060394]. Bupropion also has a **low nausea risk** (~10–15%) and is less likely to cause gastrointestinal side effects than SSRIs or SNRIs [^a98fbacb]. In contrast, SSRIs and SNRIs have higher nausea rates (15–30%), especially early in treatment, though this often improves with slow titration and taking medication with food [^a58429d1] [^54e15b50].

## Comparative incidence of nausea among antidepressants

| **Antidepressant class** | **Medication** | **Incidence of nausea (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| SSRIs | - Fluoxetine <br/> - Sertraline <br/> - Paroxetine <br/> - Citalopram <br/> - Escitalopram | 15–30% [^notfound] |
| SNRIs | - Venlafaxine <br/> - Duloxetine | 20–35% [^notfound] |
| Atypical antidepressants | - Bupropion <br/> - Mirtazapine | 7–15% [^notfound] |
| TCAs | - Amitriptyline <br/> - Nortriptyline | 10–20% [^notfound] |

---

Mirtazapine and bupropion consistently show the **lowest nausea rates**, whereas SSRIs and SNRIs have higher rates, particularly early in treatment [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb].

---

## Mechanisms underlying nausea in antidepressant therapy

Nausea with antidepressants is **primarily linked to serotonergic activity**, especially 5-HT3 receptor stimulation in the gut and CNS [^1e0baec5]. SSRIs and SNRIs increase serotonin and can activate 5-HT3, causing nausea [^notfound]. Bupropion, which inhibits norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake, has minimal serotonergic effect and thus less nausea [^d1660d1a]. Mirtazapine's 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonism further reduces nausea risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting low nausea risk in mirtazapine and bupropion

- **Mirtazapine**: Meta-analyses show significantly lower nausea than SSRIs (RR ~0.3) and good tolerability, including in older adults [^8e060394].
- **Bupropion**: Comparative studies show lower nausea than SSRIs (~10–15%) and less gastrointestinal upset [^a98fbacb].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing nausea risk

Several factors influence **nausea risk** with antidepressants:

- **Age**: Older adults may be more prone to nausea, especially with SSRIs/SNRIs.
- **Sex**: Females report higher nausea rates with some antidepressants (e.g. vortioxetine) [^d81d6bd8].
- **Comorbidities**: GI disorders (e.g. IBD) increase susceptibility to nausea with serotonergic agents [^d1af4646].
- **Genetics**: CYP2C19 variants can affect metabolism and side effects, including nausea [^9e678ebb].

---

## Clinical strategies to minimize nausea

Clinicians can reduce nausea risk with the following strategies:

- **Slow titration**: Start low and titrate gradually to improve tolerability [^a58429d1] [^54e15b50].
- **Take with food**: Taking medication with meals can lessen GI irritation [^ea9717ce].
- **Switch agents**: If nausea persists, consider switching to mirtazapine or bupropion [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Short-term antiemetics (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonists) may help in select cases [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the evidence, **mirtazapine or bupropion** are preferred when minimizing nausea is a priority. Mirtazapine is especially suitable for patients with insomnia or anxiety, whereas bupropion is favored for patients concerned about weight gain or sexual dysfunction. SSRIs and SNRIs remain first-line for many, but their higher nausea risk should be discussed and managed proactively [^a58429d1].

---

Mirtazapine and bupropion have the **lowest nausea risk** among antidepressants, with mirtazapine generally having the lowest incidence. SSRIs and SNRIs have higher nausea rates, but slow titration and supportive measures can improve tolerability [^8e060394] [^a98fbacb].

## References

### Tolerability of modern antidepressants [^c4637738]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Antidepressant side effects may have implications with regard to patient safety as well as the overall tolerability of treatment. Side effects relevant to patient safety can contribute to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, but may or may not result in patient distress or discomfort. In contrast, side effects related to tolerability can contribute to patient discomfort but are not associated with an immediate increase in risk of morbidity or mortality. Common tolerability-related side effects of modern antidepressants include nausea, insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. Because these side effects can result in patient discomfort and distress, they can lead to poor compliance or noncompliance with treatment that, in turn, may result in an increased risk of depressive relapse or recurrence. Modern antidepressants have varying tolerability profiles, and clinicians should be vigilant about balancing treatment efficacy with side effects when choosing antidepressants. This article compares the rates of common tolerability-related side effects among the newer (post-tricyclic era) antidepressants with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the most popular contemporary first-line treatment for depression.

### The efficacy, tolerability, and safety of contemporary antidepressants [^54ac911a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A wide variety of antidepressants are available today for treating major depressive disorder. However, like all medical therapies, antidepressants have several limitations that clinicians should consider when choosing treatments for their patients. This article reviews the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the newer (ie, posttricyclic era) antidepressants. Specifically, overall efficacy and efficacy in relation to specific depressive symptoms and patient subpopulations, as well as in relation to various psychiatric and medical comorbidities, are addressed, along with tolerability profiles with respect to common side effects, including nausea, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. Finally, the safety profile of these agents is summarized.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: a systematic review and digital tool development [^2a105a19]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

The premature mortality of people with serious mental illness is well recognised, with side-effects of treatments having a role. In the 2019 Lancet Psychiatry Commission for protecting the physical health of people with mental illness, reducing long-term side-effects of psychotropic medication was highlighted as a key future strategy for the field. Thus, by weighing up the relative side-effect burden of different psychotropics and facilitating the selection of treatments with comparatively benign side-effect profiles, the Psymatik Treatment Optimizer addresses a previously unmet clinical need.

Our study also has limitations. Our literature review highlighted evidence gaps that should be addressed by future studies. For example, although we identified comprehensive meta-analytic data for several antipsychotic side-effects, all of these side-effects required imputation to some extent, and data for three side-effects were based entirely on ordinal rankings. Furthermore, for several side-effects (eg, risk of hypertension and risk of venous thromboembolism) and for some antipsychotics or antidepressants, no data were available. Our search yielded a single meta-analysis examining antidepressant side-effects, which was not included in the database. This outcome was due to the modest number of included drugs in the meta-analysis, and concerns regarding the validity of meta-analytic and ordinal regression models, thereby precluding imputation. Specifically, we observed negative relationships between meta-analytic effect sizes and ordinal ranking scores for the two types of side-effects with sufficient data (insomnia or agitation; and nausea and vomiting). Of note, the meta-analysis in question examined maintenance studies. Symptoms such as insomnia and nausea and vomiting are typically considered to be acute antidepressant side-effects that can reduce with time; as such, they might be less prevalent in maintenance studies. Ordinal ranking scores might instead concern risk of acute side-effects, thereby explaining the regression model results. However, inadequate guideline referencing meant that we were unable to confirm this. Indeed, some guidelines did not provide any references to justify drug rankings. Furthermore, the quality of evidence on which rankings were based was invariably not reported. As such, although we were reassured by our assessments of guideline methodological quality, the accuracy and validity of guideline-derived data remain uncertain. Moreover, guidelines often used limited risk categories (eg, mild, moderate, and severe), meaning differentiation between some drugs for particular side-effects was not possible. To address concerns about data validity, accuracy, and granularity, future studies should aim to meta-analyse the side-effects for which we used ordinal ranking data. Unfortunately, any such future efforts are unlikely to solve the problem of absent side-effect data for older drugs, although the issue of absent data limits any approach to the delivery of evidence-based practice, not simply the approach by Psymatik. We also recognise that the risk and magnitude of some side-effects might be influenced by dose, and that use of higher doses in older trials might introduce risk of bias to some network meta-analysis results. Pragmatically, we focussed on side-effects that accompany large proportions of antipsychotics and antidepressants, but in doing so we did not gather data on rarer but serious side-effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome and the side-effects typically associated with clozapine. Furthermore, although Psymatik allows for personalisation according to individual preferences, the current version does not account for patient features such as age, race and ethnicity, and sex, which might predispose to an increased risk of one side-effect over another. The influence of medication dose, polypharmacy, or lifestyle factors (eg, smoking) also are not accounted for. We recognise that randomised controlled trial populations might not wholly represent real-world patients, and that people with a higher than average side-effect tolerance or treatment responsiveness might be over-represented, potentially limiting the translation of results to clinical practice. However, we focussed on meta-analysis results from trial data to reduce heterogeneity and provide accurate assessments of drug-specific side-effects. Additionally, by focusing on monotherapy, we were unable to comment on potential drug–drug interactions that might translate into synergistic or antagonistic adverse or efficacy effects. Nevertheless, even naturalistic studies do not cover these highly complex aspects adequately. These issues could theoretically be addressed and included in future Psymatik versions. We also recognise that making judgements about relative side-effect concern is limited when the individual has not experienced those side-effects; however, this is a limitation that affects any initiative to facilitate discussions about side-effects.

### Incidence and duration of antidepressant-induced nausea: duloxetine compared with paroxetine and fluoxetine [^2903d74e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

This analysis assessed the incidence, severity, onset, and duration of nausea among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with the new antidepressant duloxetine.

Methods

Data were pooled from 8 double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active comparator-controlled trials employing patients with MDD that were submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration to support duloxetine's new drug application for treatment of MDD.

Results

The numbers of patients receiving each regimen were as follows: placebo, n = 777; duloxetine 40 mg/d, n = 177; duloxetine 60 mg/d, n = 251; duloxetine 80 mg/d, n = 363; duloxetine 120 mg/d, n = 348; paroxetine 20 mg/d, n = 359; and fluoxetine 20 mg/d, n = 70. In acute placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine 40 to 120 mg/d, treatment-emergent nausea was reported by more duloxetine-treated patients than those receiving placebo (19.9% [227/1139] vs 6.9% [154/777], respectively; P < 0.001). Among duloxetine-treated patients, the median time to onset of nausea was 1 day, and the median duration of nausea was 7 days. The incidence of nausea was similar to placebo rates after 1 week. In paroxetine-controlled studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent nausea in patients receiving duloxetine did not differ significantly from paroxetine (14.4% vs 12.0%, respectively). In head-to-head studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent nausea with duloxetine did not differ significantly from that with fluoxetine (17.1% vs 15.7%, respectively). Most duloxetine-treated patients reported nausea to be mild (52.9%) or moderate (41.4%). Treatment discontinuation secondary to nausea occurred in more duloxetine-treated patients than those receiving placebo (1.4% [16/1139] vs 0.1% [1/777], respectively; P = 0.002). Following abrupt discontinuation after acute treatment, 5.9% of duloxetine-treated patients exhibited nausea compared with 0.3% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). The incidence of treatment-emergent nausea during 6-month continuation of duloxetine treatment (80 mg/d, 2.1%; 120 mg/d, 1.3%) was similar to placebo (1.6%). Following abrupt discontinuation after 8 months of treatment, nausea was reported by 1.6% of patients receiving duloxetine 120 mg/d compared with 0% for those receiving duloxetine 80 mg/d and 0% for placebo.

Conclusions

Duloxetine induced mild to moderate nausea in a subset of patients with MDD during treatment initiation. Nausea resolved rapidly with continued treatment. The incidence of duloxetine-induced nausea resembled that produced by paroxetine and fluoxetine.

### Immediate-release versus controlled-release formulations: pharmacokinetics of newer antidepressants in relation to nausea [^d1660d1a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Newer antidepressants are generally as efficacious as but often have fewer side effects than their predecessors such as the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. These newer antidepressants include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline; venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; and bupropion, a selective norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Most of these antidepressants have half-lives that enable them to be administered as infrequently as 1 to 3 times per day. To further improve upon the ease of use, controlled-release formulations of bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and venlafaxine have been manufactured. Potential pharmacokinetic advantages of these formulations include lower peak plasma drug concentrations and smaller fluctuations between peak and trough plasma drug concentrations, which might influence the tolerability of these medications. Tolerability advantages seen with some of these medications include diminished nausea. The 3 controlled-release agents that are designed to be taken daily — bupropion, paroxetine, and venlafaxine — are associated with lower incidences of nausea overall and nausea leading to treatment discontinuation than are their immediate-release formulations. However, the rates of nausea are similar with both formulations of fluoxetine, despite higher peak plasma drug concentrations and greater fluctuation between peak and trough plasma drug concentrations with fluoxetine weekly than with fluoxetine daily. Although the connection has not been proven, more stable pharmacokinetic profiles might be the cause for the low occurrence of nausea with some controlled-release newer antidepressants.

### Rates of 5 common antidepressant side effects among new adult and adolescent cases of depression: a retrospective US claims study [^c3d667f4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are the first-line treatment for depression, yet medication-related side effects may be associated with antidepressant discontinuation before reaching a period of exposure believed to result in effectiveness. There is a gap in knowledge of the prevalence of side effects across commonly prescribed antidepressants and the effect of the type of antidepressant on the likelihood of side effects in real-world clinical practice.

Objective

The aim of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence of headaches, nausea or vomiting, agitation, sedation, and sexual dysfunction among patients diagnosed with depression who initiated monotherapy across different classes of antidepressants and to estimate the effect of the type of antidepressant on the likelihood of each of the 5 side effects.

Methods

A retrospective cohort of patients aged ≥ 13 who were newly diagnosed with depression and began antidepressant monotherapy was created using LifeLink managed care claims from 1998 to 2008. Antidepressant groups included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), bupropion, phenylpiperazine, and tetracyclic antidepressants. Prevalence of headache, nausea or vomiting, agitation, sedation, and sexual dysfunction were compared across antidepressant groups. Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the likelihood of each of the 5 side effects for each antidepressant group compared with SSRIs, adjusted for demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics.

Results

The study cohort included 40,017 patients (3617 adolescents, aged 13–18 years, and 36,400 adults, aged ≥ 19 years; mean age = 45 years; 67% female) with a new episode of depression who were initiated on antidepressant monotherapy within 30 days of diagnosis (SSRI [66%], bupropion [14%], SNRI [12%], other [8%]). The most common side effects were headache (up to 17/1000 person-months of therapy in adults and adolescents) and nausea (up to 7.2/1000 in adults, 9.3/1000 in adolescents). Relative to adults receiving SSRIs, adults receiving SNRIs had a higher risk of nausea (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.26; 95%CI,1.05–1.51). Adults (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62–0.96) and adolescents (HR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21–0.87) taking bupropion were less likely to experience headaches compared with adults and adolescents, respectively, taking an SSRI. Adolescents receiving a tetracyclic were more likely to experience headaches than adolescents receiving an SSRI (HR = 3.16; 95%CI, 1.13–8.84).

Conclusions

Prevalence and risk of the 5 side effects varied across types of antidepressants for both adults and adolescents. Results from this study were consistent with prior clinical trials, suggesting that variation in side effect profiles exists in a more generalized managed care population.

### Fluvoxamine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^7792277e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Fluvoxamine, one of the oldest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is prescribed to patients with major depression in many countries. Several studies have previously reviewed the efficacy and tolerability of fluvoxamine for the treatment of major depression. However, these reviews are now outdated.

Objectives

Our objective is to evaluate the effectiveness, tolerability and side effect profile of fluvoxamine for major depression in comparison with other anti-depressive agents, including tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs, SNRIs, other newer agents and other conventional psychotropic drugs.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register. Trial databases and ongoing trial registers in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia, were handsearched for randomised controlled trials. We checked reference lists of the articles included in the review, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of affective disorder for published reports and citations of unpublished research. The date of last search was 31 August 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials, published in any language, that compared fluvoxamine with any other active antidepressants in the acute phase treatment of major depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors inspected citations and abstracts, obtained papers, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We analysed dichotomous data using odds ratios (ORs) and continuous data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). A random effects model was used to combine studies.

Main Results

A total of 54 randomised controlled trials (n = 5122) were included. No strong evidence was found to indicate that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to other antidepressants regarding response, remission and tolerability. However, differing side effect profiles were evident, especially with regard to gastrointestinal side effects of fluvoxamine when compared to other antidepressants. For example, fluvoxamine was generally associated with a higher incidence of vomiting/nausea (versus imipramine, OR 2.23, CI 1.59 to 3.14; versus clomipramine, OR 2.13, CI 1.06 to 4.27; versus amitriptyline, OR 2.86, CI 1.31 to 2.63).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no strong evidence that fluvoxamine was either superior or inferior to any other antidepressants in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the acute phase treatment of depression. However, differing side effect profiles were evident. Based on these findings, we conclude that clinicians should focus on practical or clinically relevant considerations, including these differences in side effect profiles.

### Common questions about the pharmacologic management of depression in adults [^9eb14806]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

One in 11 U.S. adults currently meets diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and a similar number report that they have taken an antidepressant medication in the past 30 days. In the primary care population, medications are modestly superior to placebo in achieving remission, with a number needed to treat of seven or eight for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and seven to 16 for tricyclic antidepressants. The benefit of antidepressants over placebo is more pronounced in patients with severe depression. Second-generation antidepressants are generally considered first-line therapy. Specific therapy choice should be based on cost, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. About two-thirds of patients receiving second-generation antidepressants experience at least one adverse effect during treatment. Nausea and vomiting are the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy. The optimal treatment duration is unclear, but clinical guidelines suggest four to 12 months for an initial episode of major depression. Patients with recurrent depression may benefit from prolonged treatment. High-quality evidence is lacking on the benefits and harms of antidepressant use in pregnancy. It is unclear whether selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in breastfeeding mothers causes adverse effects in their infants, but sertraline and paroxetine transfer to breast milk in lower concentrations than other antidepressants. Consensus guidelines recommend a "start low, go slow" approach to antidepressant therapy in older persons; preferred medications include citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine.

### Incidence and nature of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^046e45f2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The incidence and nature of discontinuation symptoms following antidepressant cessation remain unclear.

Objective

To examine the presence of discontinuation symptoms using standardized scales (eg, Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms [DESS]) and the incidence of individual discontinuation symptoms in individuals who stop taking antidepressants.

Data Sources

The databases Embase, PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception until November 7, 2023.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting discontinuation symptoms using a standardized scale or individual symptoms (eg, adverse events) following antidepressant cessation were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extracted were cross-checked by 2 reviewers. Additional unpublished data from 11 RCTs were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to calculate standardized mean difference between individuals who discontinued an antidepressant vs those who continued an antidepressant or discontinued placebo. A proportion and odds ratio (OR) meta-analysis was performed to assess incidence of individual discontinuation symptoms compared to placebo. Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare different antidepressants. Data analysis was conducted between September 2024 and December 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were incidence and nature of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms measured using standardized or unstandardized scales.

Results

A total of 50 studies were included, 49 of which were included in meta-analyses. The 50 studies included 17 828 participants in total, with 66.9% female participants and mean participant age of 44 years. Follow-up was between 1 day and 52 weeks. The DESS meta-analysis indicated increased discontinuation symptoms at 1 week in participants stopping antidepressants (standardized mean difference, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.23–0.39; number of studies [k] = 11; n = 3915 participants) compared to those taking placebo or continuing antidepressants. The effect size was equivalent to 1 more symptom on the DESS. Discontinuation of antidepressants was associated with increased odds of dizziness (OR, 5.52; 95% CI, 3.81–8.01), nausea (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.01–4.96), vertigo (OR, 6.40; 95% CI, 1.20–34.19), and nervousness (OR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.29–7.64) compared to placebo discontinuation. Dizziness was the most prevalent discontinuation symptom (risk difference, 6.24%). Discontinuation was not associated with depression symptoms, despite being measured in people with major depressive disorder (k = 5).

Conclusions and Relevance

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that the mean number of discontinuation symptoms at week 1 after stopping antidepressants was below the threshold for clinically significant discontinuation syndrome. Mood worsening was not associated with discontinuation; therefore, later presentation of depression after discontinuation is indicative of depression relapse.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^71a6466e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Second-generation antidepressant dosing and trial durations — comparative adverse effects by agent: In trials, bupropion was used for 12–14 wk at 200–450 mg/d with a lower rate of sexual adverse events than escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline; citalopram was used for 8–20 wk at 20–40 mg/d with a possible increased risk for QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes at dosages > 40 mg/d; fluoxetine was used for 4–6 wk at 10–80 mg/d with the lowest rates of discontinuation syndrome compared with other SSRIs; paroxetine was used for 4–52 wk at 20–60 mg/d with the highest rates of sexual dysfunction among SSRIs, higher rates of weight gain, and the highest rates of discontinuation syndrome; and venlafaxine XR was used for 14 wk at 75–225 mg/d with higher rates of nausea and vomiting, higher rates of discontinuations due to adverse events than SSRIs as a class, and the highest rates of discontinuation syndrome. Common adverse effects associated with SGAs include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somnolence.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^8c3367e5]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Future research should consider examining dose-response effects with longer term SSRI use, which has increased over the years and is associated with the prescribing of higher SSRI doses. The following research questions could also be considered: do placebo controlled trials demonstrate that higher SSRI doses are more effective for people experiencing loss of efficacy (tachyphylaxis) with long term treatment; do neuroprogressive changes in depression affect drug response, and vice versa; do acute on chronic depressive episodes require higher doses; does increasing or reducing doses provide non-drug effects; and how these factors interact to affect drug response. A greater focus is also needed to assess and report the achievement of remission that could help to improve patients' long term outcomes. Qualitative studies should be considered to provide insight into patients' lived experiences and expectations regarding antidepressant doses and drug limitations; as well as being used to help contextualise findings from potential quantitative studies. Lastly, a better understanding of possible dose related SSRI effects associated with withdrawals (discontinuation symptoms) could enable prescribers to support patients to discontinue treatment, as highlighted in petitions to the UK parliaments and recommendations from Public Health England and the Scottish government.

Conclusion

Standard daily SSRI doses could provide a favourable balance between efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability for the acute phase (up to 12 weeks) treatment of depression in adults. Higher daily doses were associated with higher rates of early treatment discontinuation (poorer acceptability) and a higher incidence of adverse drug effects (poorer tolerability) such as, but not limited to, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia. We also would encourage patients to talk to their prescriber or community pharmacist if they experience adverse effects or have any concerns about their drug treatment.

Figure 5
Heatmaps representing the Psymatik antipsychotic and antidepressant side-effect databases

(A) Antipsychotic side-effect database. (B) Antidepressant side-effect database. Effect size magnitudes are normalised such that all values are between 0 and 1 inclusive; the higher the effect size, the greater the risk or magnitude of the side-effect for that drug. Effect sizes represent either the risk of a given side-effect happening or the magnitude of a given side-effect. Data are a combination of network meta-analytic, pairwise meta-analytic, imputed, and ordinal data. Data were imputed either because of uncertainty concerns regarding meta-analytic outcomes or because of absent meta-analytic data. QTc = corrected QT interval. *Including orthostatic hypotension.

For antidepressants, a single study examining maintenance antidepressant therapy met inclusion criteria. Although this included ten meta-analyses, no side-effect had meta-analytic data available for at least 66% of the drugs for which we gathered data. For two groups of side-effects (insomnia or agitation; and nausea and vomiting), there were sufficient overlapping ordinal and meta-analytic datapoints to allow imputation modelling. However, for both groups, we observed a negative relationship between ordinal and meta-analytic data (appendix p 14). Owing to concerns regarding the validity of these models, we did not proceed to imputation. Instead, ordinal side-effect data were extracted from three national or international guidelines. To synthesise ordinal rankings across guidelines, we assumed the following descriptions described broadly similar side-effects: gastrointestinal and nausea and vomiting; QTc prolongation and cardiac conduction disturbance; and drowsiness and sedation. We extracted data for nine side-effects and up to 37 drugs (figure 4, figure 5B), as follows: QTc prolongation, hypotension (including orthostasis), insomnia or agitation, sedation, anticholinergic side-effects, gastrointestinal side-effects, sexual dysfunction, weight-gain, and hyponatraemia. Data were missing for four (1%) of 333 drug–side-effect pairs. Of the three guidelines from which ordinal data were extracted, one provided comprehensive references to justify results (UpToDate), one provided a partial list of references (Maudsley prescribing guidelines), and one did not provide references (British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines). Methodological quality of guidelines ranged from satisfactory to excellent (figure 4, appendix p 14). Side-effect patterns were evident across antidepressant classes, although we noted unique side-effect signatures for particular drugs within classes (figure 5B). For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine and sertraline) were broadly associated with gastrointestinal and sexual side-effects and high risk of hyponatraemia, but with lower risk of anticholinergic and sedating effects. However, the risk of QTc prolongation varied among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with citalopram conferring the highest risk and sertraline the lowest. Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline and trimipramine) broadly conferred increased risk of weight gain, sedation, orthostatic hypotension, sexual dysfunction, and anticholinergic side-effects; however, risk of insomnia or agitation and gastrointestinal effects was lower. Risk of QTc prolongation varied across tricyclic antidepressants, with clomipramine and doxepin conferring the highest risk. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, venlafaxine and duloxetine) were associated with increased risk of hyponatraemia and both gastrointestinal and sexual side-effects. Mirtazapine, a tetracyclic antidepressant, was associated with increased risk of sedation and weight gain, with an otherwise benign side-effect profile.

### Retrospective multicenter cohort study of slow titration of vortioxetine to mitigate early nausea in major depression [^6f9d7a78]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Background

Vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant, has been extensively documented for its efficacy and safety. The medication is typically well tolerated, with nausea being the most common adverse effect. Gradual titration with the oral solution may further enhance the medication's tolerability.

Methods

This retrospective, uncontrolled multicenter study evaluated 188 adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were treated with vortioxetine oral drop solutions. Patients initiated treatment with vortioxetine at a dosage of one or two drops per day (equivalent to 1 mg or 2 mg, respectively) and underwent a gradual increase in dosage, with each subsequent dose increased by one or two drops, up to the target dose. The subjects were observed for a minimum of eight weeks. The primary objective was to assess tolerability, with particular attention paid to the incidence and progression of nausea. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale at the outset of the study and at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8. Adverse events were recorded through patient reports at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 and documented by clinicians.

Results

The administration of vortioxetine following a slow titration treatment protocol was found to markedly reduce the prevalence of nausea observed in 9.6% of patients at week 1, 5.9% at week 2, 2.7% at week 4, and 1.7% at week 8. The incidence of other adverse events exhibited a comparable decline over time. Despite the gradual dosing approach, patients exhibited a progressive improvement in their clinical status, as evidenced by a reduction in MADRS scores from a mean of 29.22 (SD 7.71) at baseline to 11.89 (SD 6.35) at week 8. At the end of the treatment period, 72% of patients were classified as good responders for MADRS and 71% for CGI (change ≥ 50%) while 46% achieved remission according to MADRS criteria (MADRS ≤ 10).

Conclusions

In our cohort, the slow titration of vortioxetine oral drop solutions resulted in an enhancement in tolerability, accompanied by a decline in nausea compared to the rates documented in prior studies utilizing standard tablet formulations. This approach did not compromise the efficacy of the treatment. This flexible titration strategy represents a promising approach to the mitigation of adverse effects while maintaining clinical effectiveness. Further research should be conducted to investigate the long-term benefits of this method and to compare it to other titration protocols.

### Not all side effects associated with tricyclic antidepressant therapy are true side effects [^3a1dc3f2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders treated with tricyclic antidepressants sometimes report nongastrointestinal symptoms; it is unclear whether these are drug side effects or reflect a behavioral tendency to report symptoms. We evaluated whether symptoms reported before treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant (desipramine) increased in number or worsened in severity after 2 weeks of treatment and assessed the baseline factors that predispose patients to report symptoms.

Methods

Female patients in a multicenter National Institutes of Health trial for functional bowel disorders completed a 15-item symptom questionnaire at baseline (before randomization), 2 weeks after they were given desipramine (n = 81) or placebo (n = 40), and at study completion (12 weeks). Patients were asked about the severity and frequency of 15 symptoms. Results were analyzed from 57 patients given desipramine who completed the questionnaires.

Results

Symptoms reported as side effects to have occurred more frequently and also worsened at week 2 in the group given desipramine included dizziness, dry mouth/thirstiness, lightheadedness, jittery feelings/tremors, and flushing. Symptoms that did not change in severity or showed improvement at week 2 in the group given desipramine included morning tiredness, nausea, blurred vision, headaches, appetite reduction, and trouble sleeping. Psychologic distress but not desipramine blood level correlated with symptom reporting.

Conclusions

Most symptoms often attributed to side effects of desipramine were present before treatment; only a few, related to anticholinergic effects, worsened 2 weeks after treatment, suggesting that most so-called side effects were not associated specifically with desipramine use. Such symptoms might instead be associated with psychologic distress.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: a systematic review and digital tool development [^032f3b5e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

The study had two methodological stages (figure 1). For the first stage of creating side-effect databases, we did a systematic umbrella review of published meta-analyses following a prespecified protocol, registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022372142; appendix pp 2–5). Two authors (TP and RAMcC) separately searched Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE from database inception up to June 26, 2023, for meta-analyses that ranked antidepressants when used as monotherapy by individuals with major depressive disorder, or antipsychotics when used as monotherapy by individuals with schizophrenia, on the basis of relative magnitude or risk of side-effects. The search results were cross-checked with differences resolved by discussion between the two authors. To allow broad drug comparisons, we focused on side-effects that are common among antipsychotics or antidepressants, as defined in clinical guideline documents. As such, we did not include side-effects considered to be largely clozapine specific (eg, myocarditis and agranulocytosis). The search terms used were: (antidepressant OR antipsychotic) AND (extrapyramidal OR parkinsonism OR dyskinesia OR dystonia OR akathisia OR prolactin OR headache OR agitation OR insomnia OR cholinergic OR gastrointestinal OR constipation OR nausea OR arrythmia OR QTc OR hypotension OR hypertension OR weight OR glucose OR lipid OR cholesterol OR triglyceride OR sedation OR natraemia OR natremia OR sodium OR thromboembolism OR sexual) AND meta-analysis. To reduce heterogeneity, we only included meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials examining antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy in the treatment of depression or schizophrenia, respectively, and drugs assessed within the meta-analysis needed a common comparator. We also only included studies on adults aged 18 years or older. In recognition that some side-effects (eg, venous thromboembolism and tardive dyskinesia) might occur after longer-term treatment, we included meta-analyses of trials examining both acute and maintenance treatment. Only studies written in English were selected. Summary estimates were sought and, if data were missing, study authors were contacted. In anticipation of inadequate meta-analytic coverage of some side-effects, we aimed to supplement results with ordinal ranking data from guidelines for the treatment of major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. As such, in parallel to the meta-analytic review, we also reviewed national and international guideline documents and similar sources (eg, consensus statements and clinical guideline resources) for the management of schizophrenia or major depressive disorder in adult populations (age ≥ 18 years); these documents were selected from the reference lists of previous umbrella reviews in the field (appendix p 9). Guidelines were selected if they provided ordinal rankings for drug side-effects.

Results

Demographics and side effect prevalence

As previously reported, the majority of AGDS participants were female (75%). The average age was 43 (s.d. = 15.3) years old. Most people (60–75%) reported at least one side effect regardless of antidepressant taken (Supplementary Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows the prevalence of reported side effects for males and females across the ten studied antidepressants. Reduced sex drive and weight gain had the highest prevalence. The least prevalent side effects were suicide attempt, blurred vision, rash, weight loss, and muscular pain. Overall, there were significant differences between the prevalence of side effects for males and females across all medications (Table 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Males reported experiencing reduced sex drive or function more often than females.

b Two sample t-test. Data of each side effect per medication studied are available in Supplementary Data 1.

Conversely, women were more likely to report weight gain compared to males (Supplementary Data 1). Other side effects showing a robust difference (i.e. a difference observed for five or more medications) in prevalence between males and females included nausea, headaches, dizziness, shakes and vomits. Antidepressants are typically prescribed in a specific order. To adjust for the possibility that the course of illness underlies these side effects (rather than the drug class), we performed a sensitivity analysis re-estimating the side effect prevalence using a subsample of participants who reported only taking one antidepressant. These results were highly consistent with the full sample analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2).

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^36eb1fa8]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objective

To assess and clarify the relations between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dose efficacy, acceptability (early treatment discontinuation (dropouts)), and tolerability (reported adverse drug effects), and critically evaluate methods previously used to examine SSRI dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults.

Design

Systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis.

Data sources

Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and the Cochrane Collaboration library, from 1975 to December 2021. Reference lists of national depression treatment guidelines were systemically searched by hand.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy dose-response effects for the treatment of depression in adults (age ≥ 18 years) reporting efficacy, acceptability, or tolerability. Reviews meeting inclusion criteria had a high degree of heterogeneity, due to methodological diversity; therefore, a meta-narrative synthesis approach was applied. Standard daily doses were defined as 20 mg citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine; 50 mg sertraline; and 10 mg escitalopram. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, in line with Cochrane recommendations.

Results

The search identified 9138 records; 387 full text reports were assessed for eligibility, 42 of which matched the inclusion criteria. The majority, 83% (n = 35), of reviews included data for studies with a duration of ≤ 12 weeks (ie, the acute phase of depression treatment). Of 39 reviews assessing efficacy, the majority (n = 26) indicated that individual SSRIs and SSRI class demonstrated flat dose-response effects; standard doses were optimal for efficacy. Acceptability or tolerability were assessed in 28 reviews. Higher than standard daily doses were associated with higher dropout rates and a greater incidence of adverse drug effects (eg, nausea, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, anxiety). Despite a range of methods being reported, there was an overall consensus regarding SSRI dose related efficacy, dropouts, and adverse drug effects.

Conclusion

Standard daily doses of SSRIs for the treatment of depression in adults provide a favourable balance between efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability. Patients are encouraged to talk to their prescriber or community pharmacist if they experience adverse effects or have any concerns about their drug treatments.

### Antidepressants for the treatment of adults with major depressive disorder in the maintenance phase: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^2a34b63e]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

A systematic review and random-effects model network meta-analysis were conducted to compare the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and safety of antidepressants to treat adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) in the maintenance phase. This study searched the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases and included only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with an enrichment design: patients were stabilized on the antidepressant of interest during the open-label study and then randomized to receive the same antidepressant or placebo. The outcomes were the 6-month relapse rate (primary outcome, efficacy), all-cause discontinuation (acceptability), discontinuation due to adverse events (tolerability), and the incidence of individual adverse events. The risk ratio with a 95% credible interval was calculated. The meta-analysis comprised 34 studies (n = 9384, mean age = 43.80 years, and %females = 68.10%) on 20 antidepressants (agomelatine, amitriptyline, bupropion, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, tianeptine, venlafaxine, vilazodone, and vortioxetine) and a placebo. In terms of the 6-month relapse rate, amitriptyline, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, tianeptine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine outperformed placebo. Compared to placebo, desvenlafaxine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine had lower all-cause discontinuation; however, sertraline had a higher discontinuation rate due to adverse events. Compared to placebo, venlafaxine was associated with a lower incidence of dizziness, while desvenlafaxine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were associated with a higher incidence of nausea/vomiting. In conclusion, desvenlafaxine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine had reasonable efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability in the treatment of adults with stable MDD.

### Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c8f5e2fd]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (n = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13–83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00–75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96–27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68–7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.

### Duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder: safety and tolerability associated with dose escalation [^c956b556]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

Duloxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) at a dose of 60 mg/day (given once daily). Whereas the target dose for the majority of patients is 60 mg/day, higher duloxetine doses (up to 120 mg/day) have been studied using a twice-daily dosing schedule. To further investigate the pharmacological profile of duloxetine within a once-daily dosing regimen at doses above 60 mg, we examined the safety and tolerability of duloxetine during a dose escalation from 60 mg/day to 120 mg/day. This single-arm, non-placebo-controlled study incorporated a 7-week dose escalation phase, in which patients and investigators were blinded as to timing of dose increases, followed by an open-label extension phase of up to 2 years duration. Patients (age ≥ 18 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD (n = 128) received placebo for 1 week, followed by duloxetine (60 mg/day) titrated after 1 week to 90 mg/day, and after a further week to 120 mg/day. The dose of 120 mg/day was then maintained for 4 weeks. The extension phase comprised an initial 6-week dose stabilization period, during which duloxetine was tapered to the lowest effective dose, followed by continuation therapy at the stabilized dose. We assessed safety using spontaneously reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory analytes, and visual analogue scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance. Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales, and VAS assessments of pain severity and interference. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events during the acute phase of the study was 15.6%. The most frequently reported TEAEs were nausea, headache, dry mouth, dizziness, and decreased appetite. The majority of TEAEs were associated with initial duloxetine dosing; further escalations in dose produced few additional adverse events. VAS measures of GI disturbance worsened significantly compared with baseline values after 1 week of duloxetine treatment. Subsequent assessments of GI disturbance, following dose escalation to 90 mg/day and 120 mg/day, showed either no significant difference or a significant improvement from baseline. Significant improvements (P < .001) were observed in all assessed depression efficacy measures, and in five of six VAS pain outcomes, during acute phase treatment. During 2 years of extension phase therapy, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was 11.9%, and the only TEAEs reported by > 10% of patients were upper respiratory tract infection (13.1%), headache (10.7%), and insomnia (10.7%). Mean changes from baseline to the end of the extension phase in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 3.8 and 0.5 mm Hg, respectively, and there were no reports of sustained hypertension. Mean increase in heart rate was 5.9 bpm, while patients exhibited a mean weight increase of 3.1 kg over 2 years of treatment. Results from this study suggest that rapid dose escalation of duloxetine (60 mg/day → 90 mg/day → 120 mg/day) is safe and tolerable. Despite weekly escalation, the majority of adverse events were mild and transient and occurred in the first week of duloxetine dosing (at 60 mg once daily). Long-term treatment at a stabilized duloxetine dose was associated with a relatively low incidence of TEAEs and treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Time course profiles of body weight and heart rate showed modest increases during 2 years of treatment [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NC T000 42575].

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^56650507]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) — pharmacologic research and combination therapy emphasizes that further investigations of the genetic and internal environment predispositions to PONV could personalize preventive strategies, and that the developing field of pharmacogenomics in relation to antiemetic efficacy is of equal clinical interest. There is yet a paucity of research on PONV risk and management in special patient populations, including children, pregnant patients, and patients having cesarean delivery. The page notes a rising incidence of obesity, bariatric surgery worldwide, and a recent dramatic increase in the use of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, with how these factors influence PONV risk assessment and treatment not yet clearly understood. The current armamentarium of antiemetic drugs provides a solid approach to reduce PONV for most patients, but further research could look to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects; the NK-1 receptor antagonist class is of particular interest because of high efficacy and reasonable duration, as well as potential anxiolytic, antidepressant and antipruritic effects. A combination drug of long acting netupitant with palonosetron is approved in the US for CINV, and research in combination or co-administration of drugs for PONV indications should be done focusing on synergistic effects while monitoring clinical and drug-interaction (CYP450) side effects.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^f5de73f1]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Side effects co-occur across medications

For each antidepressant taken, participants reported whether or not they had experienced specific side effects. Some individuals had taken more than one antidepressant. Thus, several subsets of participants with overlapping data for different antidepressants were available. This overlap enabled us to assess whether the same side effects occur independently across different antidepressants or whether they co-occur (covary) across medications. We identified high correlations for the same side effects across medications (within side effect median correlation = 0.57, within medication median correlation = across side effect median correlation = 0.27 see Supplementary Fig. 3). A clustering analysis based on these correlations visually grouped these variables by side effect rather than antidepressant or medication class (Fig. 2). Overall, these results would suggest that antidepressant side effects co-occur in the same people regardless of the medication of choice or their class, which would be consistent with the existence of a set of general non-specific (i.e. independent of drug mode of action) factors partly underlying their aetiology. Structural equation models were used to compare a bifactor model with common and drug-class factors against reduced models, including only specific drug classes or no drug class (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Our results suggested that the common factor captured a high proportion of the covariance across medications. A single common factor model was preferred over the SSRI, SNRI, or the full model for some side effects. However, we identified evidence for medication-class-specific effects for other side effects. For example, sweating, insomnia, suicide thoughts, and suicide attempts showed evidence of an SNRI-specific factor and vomits nausea, and drowsiness showed evidence of an SSRI-specific factor. In contrast, dizziness and constipation showed evidence for both factors over and above a general factor (Supplementary Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 2).

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^f7567cee]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Assessment of escitalopram tolerability and safety

In terms of safety and tolerability, data for escitalopram are available from over 4000 patients in double-blind treatment, representing approximately 1000 patient-years of exposure. Overall, the adverse-event profile detailed in published studies and meta-analyses is consistent with the known serotonergic properties of escitalopram. A meta-analysis of safety data from 24 double-blind, active-comparator or placebo-controlled, randomized studies with escitalopram was recently published. The most common adverse events (incidence ≥ 5%) reported during the first 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram, which were significantly more frequent than in the placebo group, were nausea, insomnia, fatigue, diarrhoea, dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence and ejaculation failure (Table 3, available online). The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity.

### Anti-inflammatory treatment for major depressive disorder: implications for patients with an elevated immune profile and non-responders to standard antidepressant therapy [^82332650]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

Side effects of antidepressants

Despite all the aforementioned benefits of antidepressants, the treatment is not free from risks and side effects. In a study to assess self-discontinuation of antidepressants, 313 patients were interviewed to investigate the reason for stopping the treatment. Side effects were reported by 20% of the patients as the main cause of discontinuation. Premature self-discontinuation is associated with relapse and incomplete response to the treatment. The key side effects associated with antidepressant use vary by class of the antidepressant and might vary also by medication within each class. Even though TCAs are very effective in treating depression, they also act on other receptor systems, including histaminic, cholinergic, adrenergic and postsynaptic serotonin receptors, leading to significant and sometimes intolerable side effects. Moreover, TCAs have a narrow therapeutic index and at higher doses, they might cause seizures and death due to slowing of intraventricular conduction, leading to complete heart block or ventricular re-entry arrhythmias. SSRIs, on the other hand, are better tolerated and significantly less toxic in an overdose than TCAs. The most common side effects related to SSRIs are gastrointestinal like nausea, activation syndrome, sexual dysfunction, body weight gain, insomnia and serotonin syndrome. Antidepressants that also act on the noradrenergic system (i.e. SNRIs) are associated with significantly greater increase in blood pressure and heart rate than SSRIs and also with gastrointestinal effects, activation syndrome, insomnia and sexual dysfunction. In order to decrease self-discontinuation, it is important to choose an efficient antidepressant with the profile of side effects that will not hamper the quality of life of the patient.

Phenotype ascertainment

This study focuses on participant-reported antidepressant adverse side effects. Participants first confirmed they had taken any of the ten most commonly prescribed antidepressants in Australia (sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, amitriptyline and paroxetine). For each antidepressant taken, participants were asked whether they had experienced side effects and, if they did, to select which from a checklist with the twenty-three most commonly reported antidepressant side effects, including reduced sexual drive or desire, weight gain, dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, insomnia, dizziness, fatigue, sweating, headache, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, agitation, shaking, constipation, diarrhoea, suicide attempt, blurred vision, muscle pain, vomiting, weight loss, runny nose and rash.

### Escitalopram – translating molecular properties into clinical benefit: reviewing the evidence in major depression [^44b33b3a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2010). Low credibility.

Summary points for efficacy:
efficacy advantage for escitalopram versus citalopram has been demonstrated in five randomized studies and two pooled analyses of clinical trials;
escitalopram may have an efficacy advantage over paroxetine, in terms of significant improvements in MADRS, HAM-D and CGI-S scores and fewer discontinuations owing to lack of efficacy;
the efficacy of escitalopram compared with fluoxetine and sertraline requires further evaluation;
escitalopram and sertraline might be the best choice of antidepressant when starting treatment of patients with moderate to severe MDD;
the SNRI venlafaxine XR may be associated with greater remission or response rates in patients with MDD compared with SSRIs (Burk et al. 2002);
escitalopram has comparable efficacy to venlafaxine XR, with a possible slight advantage for escitalopram in patients with severe MDD

Regarding safety and tolerability, escitalopram offers tolerability advantages over duloxetine, paroxetine and venlafaxine XR (see summary points below) and may be preferable to those antidepressants in some patients with MDD.

Summary points for safety:
superior tolerability for escitalopram versus duloxetine, particularly for nausea, insomnia, dizziness and vomiting has been demonstrated in three randomized studies and a pooled analysis of two clinical trials (Lam et al. 2008)
escitalopram offers tolerability advantages over paroxetine and venlafaxine XR (;, 2006);
escitalopram is less likely to cause discontinuation symptoms than several other antidepressants (2006)
no evidence of emergent risk of suicide with escitalopram;
incidence of sexual dysfunction-related adverse events similar to citalopram, but lower than venlafaxine XR and paroxetine.

Second-line management after unsuccessful SGA treatment — switching or augmentation: For second-line treatment after unsuccessful treatment with SGAs, low-quality evidence showed that strategies to switch to or augment with another drug or nonpharmacologic therapy are similarly effective, with most evidence coming from the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) study. Adverse effects commonly associated with SGAs include constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somnolence.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^54e15b50]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation strategy note common, often transient side effects and a titration approach to mitigate early anxiety. Most SSRIs are generally well-tolerated but can cause nausea, dry mouth, insomnia, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, agitation or anxiety, drowsiness, and sexual dysfunction, with most dissipating over time except sexual dysfunction; some patients report an initial exacerbation of agitation or anxiety that is often mitigated by starting with half of the lowest dose and gradually up-titrating over 4–10 days. Many experts consider dose titration to be a best practice for initiating treatment for perinatal depression, and activating antidepressants such as fluoxetine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and bupropion may exacerbate anxiety symptoms, so in someone with moderate-to-severe comorbid anxiety, alternatives to these medications should be considered when appropriate.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^0337f47a]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

Ambiguity regarding SSRI dose-response and optimal dosing for the treatment of depression has been a major challenge for prescribers, and for guideline developers in Europe, North America, and Australasia. This systematic review of reviews indicates that all individual SSRIs, except for fluvoxamine, demonstrate a ceiling effect for efficacy, and poorer acceptability and tolerability as SSRI doses were increased during the acute phase (up to 12 weeks) of depression treatment for adults. Dose-response efficacy, however, remains unclear for fluvoxamine.

The prescribing of higher than standard daily SSRI doses was associated with higher rates of early treatment discontinuation (poorer acceptability) and a higher incidence of adverse drug effects (poorer tolerability) such as, but not limited to, nausea, sexual dysfunction, anxiety, and insomnia. Comparison of fixed standard daily dose and flexible dose regimens for individuals not achieving satisfactory symptom resolution or remission demonstrated that dose titration above standard daily doses did not provide greater efficacy, but was associated with poorer acceptability and tolerability.

Strengths and weaknesses of the study

A major strength of this review was the inclusion and assessment of a range of meta-analyses and narrative reviews that met the inclusion criteria, and demonstrated the breadth and depth of review literature assessing SSRI dose-response effects. To our knowledge, this is the first review of reviews to investigate SSRI drug-response effects.

Although the literature search aimed to be as comprehensive as possible and included a range of reviews using different methodologies, it is possible, as with all systematic reviews, that an important review could have been missed. However, searching a range of key electronic databases and hand searching reference lists from guidelines and other sources helped to reduce the risk of missing relevant reviews. Inclusion of reviews in languages other than English could have been beneficial, but funding was not available for this inclusion. While inclusion of reviews only in the English language might be considered to limit generalisability of findings, the majority of reviews that were assessed as being at low risk of bias included non-English language primary studies, therefore overcoming language limitations.

### The safety and tolerability of vortioxetine: analysis of data from randomized placebo-controlled trials and open-label extension studies [^fdccccde]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of data compares the tolerability and safety profile of vortioxetine with placebo in acute randomized controlled clinical studies of 6/8 weeks' duration (3018 patients), and its tolerability and safety in long-term open-label treatment of up to 52 weeks (2457 patients).

The most common TEAEs (incidence ⩾5%) and occurring with at least twice the frequency that is seen with placebo during 6/8 weeks of treatment with vortioxetine are nausea and vomiting. Dose effects for vortioxetine were seen primarily for nausea and vomiting, the incidence of which plateaued at 15 mg/day vortioxetine. TEAEs commonly found with most antidepressants, such as headache, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, insomnia, somnolence, fatigue, sexual dysfunction and hyperhidrosis, are seen at 'placebo levels' and show no dose effect. In addition, the proportion of patients with suicidal ideation is similar in placebo and vortioxetine groups, as measured by the C-SSRS and spontaneous patient reports. This was also found for the subgroup of patients aged 18–24 years.

Potential new antiemetics

A few studies have investigated other drugs for the protection of nausea and vomiting in HEC. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study (n = 318), the dopamine D 3 receptor antagonist, amisulpride, improved the antiemetic effect of ondansetron in chemotherapy-naïve patients treated with cisplatin-based (> 70 mg/m 2) chemotherapy. A single oral dose of 10 mg days 2–4 was significantly superior to placebo as concerns the primary end point, delayed CR (no emesis and no rescue antiemetics 24–120 h after start of chemotherapy) obtained in 46% versus 20% of patients (p = 0.002) and the secondary end point, delayed no nausea rate (< 5 mm on a 100 mm VAS) obtained in 37% versus 19% (p = 0.016). No significant differences in adverse effects (including sedation) was seen. An open-label study (n = 100, closed prematurely due to slow recruitment) investigated the antiemetic effect of the atypical tetracyclic antidepressant, mirtazapine, with affinity for multiple receptors (serotonin, histamine, adrenergic). The study indicated that mirtazapine can improve the effect of aprepitant, palonosetron, and DEX on delayed emesis in women treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy or EC and who experienced delayed emesis in the preceding chemotherapy cycle.

Thalidomide was investigated in a large randomized, double-blind trial (n = 638) in chemotherapy-naïve patients scheduled to receive their first course of cisplatin-based (> 50 mg/m 2) or AC/EC chemotherapy. Patients received palonosetron on day 1 and DEX on days 1–4 and were randomized to oral thalidomide 100 mg twice daily on days 1–5 or placebo. The primary end point was CR (25–120 h after start of chemotherapy). Thalidomide significantly improved the rates of CR in the delayed and overall phases (76.9% versus 61.7%, p < 0.001 and 66.1% versus 53.3%, p = 0.001, respectively). Dizziness, constipation, sedation, and dry mouth were adverse events more frequently observed with thalidomide, whereas insomnia was more frequent in the placebo-treated patients.

### Venlafaxine hydrochloride (venlafaxine) [^07e10a4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment

Nineteen percent (537/2897) of venlafaxine patients in Phase 2 and Phase 3 depression studies discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. The more common events (≥ 1%) associated with discontinuation and considered to be drug-related (i.e., those events associated with dropout at a rate approximately twice or greater for venlafaxine compared to placebo) included:

Commonly Observed Adverse Events in Controlled Clinical Trials

The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of venlafaxine hydrochloride (incidence of 5% or greater) and not seen at an equivalent incidence among placebo-treated patients (i.e., incidence for venlafaxine hydrochloride at least twice that for placebo), derived from the 1% incidence table below, were asthenia, sweating, nausea, constipation, anorexia, vomiting, somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, nervousness, anxiety, tremor, and blurred vision as well as abnormal ejaculation/orgasm and impotence in men.

Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 1% or More Among Venlafaxine Hydrochloride-Treated Patients

The table that follows enumerates adverse events that occurred at an incidence of 1% or more, and were more frequent than in the placebo group, among venlafaxine hydrochloride-treated patients who participated in short-term (4- to 8-week) placebo-controlled trials in which patients were administered doses in a range of 75 to 375 mg/day. This table shows the percentage of patients in each group who had at least one episode of an event at some time during their treatment. Reported adverse events were classified using a standard COSTART-based Dictionary terminology.

The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses and investigators. The cited figures, however, do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the side effect incidence rate in the population studied.

### Efficacy and safety of antidepressants in patients with comorbid depression and medical diseases… [^f1cace35]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Antidepressants showed worse acceptability and tolerability compared with placebo. The overall SMD from these 23 meta-analyses was 0. 42, favoring antidepressants over placebo in reducing depressive symptoms but with large heterogeneity between the disease groups. Regarding specific adverse events, antidepressants had increased risks for sexual dysfunction, dry mouth, and nausea compared with placebo. This umbrella systematic review and meta-analysis provides 5 main findings. First, antidepressants were more efficacious compared with placebo and led to higher response and remission rates.

Second, antidepressants were associated with higher acceptability-related and tolerability-related discontinuation rates and a higher risk for any adverse event. Accordingly, our overall SMD of 0. 42 indicates comparable efficacy of antidepressants vs placebo in patients with medical diseases and comorbid depression. Also, antidepressants were less tolerable than placebo in the meta-analysis, 5 with ORs ranging from 1. 21 to
4. 44 for specific antidepressants. Again, this is compatible with our findings of worse tolerability of antidepressants compared to placebo with an RR of 1.
39. The adverse effects that occurred more often with antidepressants compared with placebo in patients with depression and medical diseases encompassed dry mouth, nausea, and sexual dysfunction, all of which are well-known adverse effects of antidepressants.

84 Therefore, as a broad conclusion, clinicians can expect that antidepressants are about equally efficacious and safe in patients with depression with and without medical diseases.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^d743bbc3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Evidence from randomised-controlled trials

Two studies used randomised-controlled designs, although mirtazapine was not compared with a placebo in either. The studies assessed the effectiveness of mirtazapine on two different symptoms: emesis and pain.

Cao et al.'s study aimed to assess the effectiveness of mirtazapine in addition to usual anti-emetic therapies in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis. The study included 95 breast cancer patients undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy. The intervention group received mirtazapine in addition to aprepitan, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone 7.5 mg. The control group received the same medications except mirtazapine. Response was assessed as "complete response to vomiting" (no emesis and no rescue treatments) and "complete control" (defined as no emesis, no rescue treatment and no more than grade 1 nausea). In the first cycle, delayed and overall complete response rates were significantly higher with mirtazapine (78.3 versus 49% p = 0.003, and 58.7 versus 34.7% p = 0.019). Similar results were observed in the 3rd cycle. The study closed early due to slow enrolment, and the interpretation of results is limited by a small sample size.

Nishihara et al.'s study compared antidepressant drugs used as adjuvants with pregabalin and opioids for intractable painful bone metastases in mixed cancer types. The authors compared pregabalin 50 mg three times daily, pregabalin 25 mg three times daily combined with mirtazapine 7.5 mg twice daily and pregabalin 25 mg three times daily combined with imipramine 5 mg twice daily. Authors also recorded the average use of opioids in the three arms. The trial included 25 patients treated for 15 days; a numerical rating scale was used to evaluate average intensity of pain and intensity of paroxysmal pain over the past 24 h. The results found a clinically important difference over 2 in the total pain score intensity and in the paroxysmal pain intensity from the 1st day of use in all 3 arms of the trial. This decrease was significantly higher in the arm with mirtazapine and imipramine than in the arm with pregabalin only, and results were higher in the mirtazapine arm than the imipramine arm during the first day of treatment. There was no difference in the daily opioid dose for any of the arms.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^a58429d1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations for initial SGA use in the acute phase of moderate to severe MDD in ambulatory care specify that clinicians should prescribe a generic SGA, if possible; be aware and inform patients that up to 70% may not achieve remission during the initial treatment attempt and more than 60% may have at least 1 adverse effect; note that adverse effects including constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction are common across SGAs and are seen in > 5% of treated patients and at ≥ 2 times that with placebo; recognize that all SGAs are contraindicated in patients who have used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within the prior 2 weeks; start treatment with a low or minimum dose to reduce adverse effects and improve adherence; monitor for worsening symptoms after 1 to 2 weeks of treatment; and verify optimal tolerated dosing and consider gradually increasing up to the approved maximum before switching to a second-line strategy.

### The safety and tolerability of vortioxetine: analysis of data from randomized placebo-controlled trials and open-label extension studies [^50ccdf64]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent adverse events

TEAEs with an incidence ⩾5% in any treatment arm are shown in Table 3. For vortioxetine, TEAEs with an incidence more than twice as high as with placebo were nausea and vomiting. There was a dose effect for vortioxetine for nausea and vomiting (Figure 1). In general, TEAEs with vortioxetine were rated as mild to moderate in intensity. The proportion of patients with TEAEs that were rated as severe was 4.6% (placebo), 5.8% (vortioxetine 5–20 mg), 8.2% (duloxetine) and 11.5% (venlafaxine XR). Of the patients who had nausea during treatment with vortioxetine, most reported nausea during the first two weeks of dosing. During the third week of treatment, the proportion of patients reporting nausea as a new TEAE was ~2% in all vortioxetine dose groups and 1% in the placebo group, and subsequently remained low. Nausea was transient with vortioxetine (5–20 mg/day), with a median duration of 9–16 days.

### Clinical benefits and bioequivalence of vortioxetine oral drop solution versus oral tablets [^d8be833b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, all nausea events were mild in intensity, with an incidence of 16% and 23% in the 20 mg tablet and 20 mg oral drop solution groups, respectively. In a recent analysis of data pooled from six short-term vortioxetine studies, the incidence of nausea was 13.3% for the 10 mg/day group and 17.9% for the 20 mg/day group during the first week of treatment (when patients in the vortioxetine 20 mg/day group were receiving the starting dose of 10 mg/day), which decreased substantially to 3% for the 10 mg/day group and 4.4% for the 20 mg/day group during week 2 (when patients in the vortioxetine 20 mg/day group were up-titrated to the target 20 mg dose). Although the findings of this study in healthy adults may not be generalisable to the MDD population, there is an increasing body of evidence that suggests vortioxetine dosing can be quickly titrated to 20 mg after 1 week of treatment with 10 mg, without compromising tolerability.

In general, elderly patients are more likely to be accepting of oral drops than younger patients because of the increased prevalence of barriers to consuming tablets, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, dysphagia and phagophobia. Accordingly, the ease of swallowing an oral drop solution compared with a tablet can potentially remove a barrier to initiating and adhering to antidepressant treatment for significant subgroups of patients with MDD, particularly those with anxiety.

These results must be considered in the context of the small sample size of healthy participants, and the use of a single dose and descriptive statistics being reported, which means that it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the statistical significance of any differences in the safety profile of each formulation. However, the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of vortioxetine have been established in other studies, although clinical studies evaluating the use of oral drop vortioxetine in patients with MDD would provide more insight into the use of an oral drop solution in clinical practice.

In conclusion, 20 mg vortioxetine oral drop solution is bioequivalent to 20 mg of the immediate-release tablets, offering an additional formulation that allows individualised treatment and ease of administration for patients with MDD. In addition, the 20 mg dose of vortioxetine was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with that previously seen with 10 mg during the first week. The most common adverse event was nausea, and only of mild intensity.

Antidepressant side effects and dose-titration advice in pregnancy and postpartum include temporary effects over days to weeks such as nausea, constipation/diarrhea, lightheadedness, and headaches, and longer-term effects over weeks to months such as increased appetite/weight gain, sexual side effects, vivid dreams/insomnia, and QT prolongation with citalopram & escitalopram. Take medication with food and only increase dose if tolerating; otherwise wait until side effects dissipate before increasing, and start medication in the morning or at bedtime if sedating.

Key message

There is very low certainty in the evidence that TCAs should be used as prophylactic therapy in CVS. See Table 3 for full evidence profile.

Table 3
Should TCAs be used as prophylactic therapy in adults with CVS?

Potential benefits/harms

Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and were used to inform this question: These included 2 randomized trials and 12 observational studies. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Data from the randomized trials were converted to a single‐arm cohort of amitriptyline for inclusion into a summary estimate for amitriptyline's symptomatic effect. A summary estimate from all included data revealed that approximately 70% of patients with CVS exhibited a symptom response (variably defined for variable durations). Six studies were from pediatric populations, four studies from adult populations, and four studies from mixed adult/pediatric populations (see Table 2 a, b). Across these studies, 413/600 (70%) of patients reported complete or partial improvement with a decrease in frequency, duration, or severity of CVS symptoms when treated with a TCA, most commonly amitriptyline. Hejazi et al. in an open‐label study of 46 adult patients demonstrated not only a marked reduction in the number of CVS episodes from 17 to 3, and in the duration of a CVS episode from 6 to 2 days, but also a reduction in the number of ED visits/hospitalizations from 15 to 3.3 with AT. Nine studies reported on adverse events, the most common being sedation and weight gain. Boles et al. 2010 had one of the largest patient cohorts and noted that 72/139 pediatric patients and 39/54 (72%) adults experienced TCA‐related side effects and 29/137 pediatric patients and 13/61 (21%) adult patients discontinued amitriptyline because of side effects. 7 However, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were not systematically reported across the studies.

Certainty of evidence

The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low. Risk of bias was a concern (lack of control group and possible selection bias in the observational studies, and lack of obvious blinding and an intention to treat analysis in the randomized trials). There was also concern regarding inconsistency, indirectness (many of the studies included only pediatric patients), and imprecision (for a few of the outcomes).

### Antidepressant treatment in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d1af4646]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants have strong potential in IBD, both for their effects on psychological health and for their potential in reducing disordered gut–brain interaction. Use of antidepressants is associated with lower incidence of IBD, suggesting a possible protective effect on the gut-brain axis. SNRIs are effective in improving pain in general, and it is notable that two of the three successful RCTs used SNRIs, although the low dose of venlafaxine used (150 mg per day) has minimal noradrenergic effects. Only one case report tested mirtazapine. This tetracyclic antidepressant enhances serotonin signalling without increasing serotonin concentrations. It typically has a neutral effect on gut motility, reduces nausea, improves insomnia and has a low risk of sexual dysfunction and gastrointestinal bleeds. With only one case report of mirtazapine in IBD to date, our review highlights a need for a trial of mirtazapine in IBD.

Our results also build on a previous systematic review by adding data on adverse events. This is important because side-effects from antidepressants may be more frequently seen in IBD than in the general population. SSRIs present challenges in tolerability to patients with IBD compared to the general population, as they can accelerate gut motility, cause/worsen nausea and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Conversely, some SSRIs can have anti-inflammatory effects. The SSRI paroxetine, which was used successfully in a small case series in our review, has stronger anticholinergic effects than other SSRIs. By improving diarrhoea, this may improve IBD symptoms more than other SSRIs, but the short half-life of paroxetine increases risk of discontinuation syndrome on cessation. Bupropion, a noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, may be particularly promising in IBD because it marginally slows gut motility, reduces tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations, may improve fatigue and is the only antidepressant that improves sexual function.

### Poststroke depression: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^c12e20a1]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Prevention of poststroke depression (PSD) using pharmacological interventions — A meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among 776 initially nondepressed stroke patients reported reduced likelihood of developing PSD with active pharmacological treatment (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.53), especially after a 1 year treatment (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.56) and with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.61). Reported side effects included nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, and dizziness, with no significant differences between active treatment and placebo; tremor was significantly associated with sertraline in 1 RCT. An earlier Cochrane review including 12 placebo-controlled trials of 611 individuals found no evidence that antidepressants prevented depression after stroke, but 4 trials (401 participants) subsequently showed benefit for fluoxetine (n = 59 vs placebo n = 59), mianserin (n = 56 vs placebo n = 46), paroxetine (n = 32 vs placebo n = 32), and escitalopram (n = 59 vs placebo n = 58). In summary, 8 trials (n = 776) suggest that pharmacological treatment may be effective in preventing PSD; however, further studies are needed in more representative samples, and additional study is required to determine the optimal timing and duration of treatment.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of stroke rehabilitation [^3931f779]. VA/DoD (2024). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) after stroke — time to effect, dosing, adverse effects, patient preferences, and evidence quality are summarized as follows: Interim analyses showed improvement at day 30 and day 45, but differences were not statistically significant until day 90, and if a significant motor benefit occurs it likely takes at least three months; studies were relatively short (three to six months), making durability of FMA score benefit difficult to assess. Maintenance doses were relatively low (fluoxetine 20 mg/day, citalopram 20 mg/day, escitalopram 10 mg/day) and within safe dosing limits for adults older than 60. Adverse events data were mixed: one review did not report significant differences versus placebo, while another reported higher incidence in the fluoxetine group than placebo of hyponatremia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.01), seizure (OR: 1.46), and fracture (OR: 2.34). A rare but serious adverse effect is bleeding when combined with antithrombotic therapy; assessment of risk should be made, particularly if the patient is on an antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or both. More common (at least 10% reported incidence) but less serious side effects include insomnia, anxiety, headache, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and dry mouth. Patient preferences vary; some might already be prescribed an SSRI or be candidates for an antidepressant and might be able to obtain two benefits from one medication, whereas others might wish to avoid an antidepressant due to stigma or might not prefer adding another oral medication; SSRIs are prescription medications but are easily accessible because many providers are familiar with their use. The evidence for this recommendation was categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced; the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low with limitations including small sample size and short duration.

Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled MDD Studies

The most commonly observed adverse reactions in MDD patients treated with TRINTELLIX in 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies (incidence ≥ 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were nausea, constipation and vomiting.

Table 2 shows the incidence of common adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 2% of MDD patients treated with any TRINTELLIX dose and at least 2% more frequently than in placebo-treated patients in the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies.

Nausea

Nausea was the most common adverse reaction and its frequency was dose-related (Table 2). It was usually considered mild or moderate in intensity and the median duration was two weeks. Nausea was more common in females than males. Nausea most commonly occurred in the first week of TRINTELLIX treatment with 15 to 20% of patients experiencing nausea after one to two days of treatment. Approximately 10% of patients taking TRINTELLIX 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day had nausea at the end of the 6 to 8 week placebo-controlled studies.

### Bupropion versus selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors for treatment of depression [^a98fbacb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the benefits and risks of bupropion and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in adults with depression.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966-September 1999), Embase (1980-August 1999), PsyclNFO (1887-August 1999), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-August 1999), and CIANHL databases were searched. References from the selected citations, review articles, and the manufacturer were also screened.

Study Selection

Included studies were randomized, double-blind, controlled trials evaluating bupropion versus SSRIs for depression in adults. Studies were assessed independently in duplicate. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.

Data Analysis

Data are reported as absolute weighted mean differences or relative risks and 95% confidence intervals comparing bupropion relative to SSRIs. Data not combined are presented qualitatively.

Data Synthesis

Six full-length studies were included of 257 citations identified. SSRI comparators were fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine. No differences in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement of illness (CGI-I) were found, but data were not able to be quantitatively combined. The absolute weighted mean differences were 0.10 (95% CI -0.2 to 0.4) for the CGI for Severity of Illness and 0.37 (95% CI -0.85 to 1.6) for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety measurements. Relative risks of bupropion compared with SSRIs were 0.6 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.89), 0.31 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.57), and 0.27 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.48) for nausea, diarrhea, and somnolence, respectively. Sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic dysfunction, and sexual desire disorder occurred less with bupropion than with SSRIs, with relative risks of 0.46 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.83), 0.22 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.40), and 0.65 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.84), respectively.

Conclusions

Bupropion and SSRIs have similar effectiveness; however, bupropion was associated with less nausea, diarrhea, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) — there is increasing evidence that these antidepressants are effective for vasomotor symptoms; in an RCT of 365 women, 62% of those treated with desvenlafaxine (100 mg/d) had a reduction of 5.35 moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day compared with only 41% with placebo, with the treatment effect maintained for 1 year; a meta-analysis showed a significant reduction versus placebo (mean difference, −1.13; 95% CI, −1.70 to −0.57); although available evidence indicates these agents appear to be less effective than HT, direct comparisons with estrogen are limited; paroxetine (7.5 mg/d) is the only nonhormonal therapy approved by the FDA for vasomotor symptoms; reported adverse effects included nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, nervousness, constipation, somnolence, sweating, and sexual dysfunction, and these generally resolved with time or dose adjustment.

### Bipolar depression: a review of treatment options [^91e7e2ec]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In terms of the efficacy of antidepressants in BD-D, several reviews and meta-analyses have come to differing conclusions, likely reflecting differences in statistical techniques and inclusion criteriaand pointing towards a need for further investigation. Two of the most recent meta-analyses found no significant benefit of adding antidepressants to mood stabilisers for the treatment of BD-D. In agreement with these findings, the STEP-BD trial, which included 4360 patients, found that adding antidepressants to mood stabilisers did not result in better clinical outcomes than those achieved with mood stabilisers alone. In contrast, naturalistic studies suggest that there is likely a sizeable subgroup of patients who respond to a mood stabiliser plus an antidepressant with no increase in switching. Interestingly, there is more consistent evidence of benefits when antidepressants are added to SGAs. Whether this reflects additive effects of antidepressants combined specifically with SGAs or some other factors is unknown. A separate meta-analysis comparing different antidepressants found no significant difference in rates of clinical response between antidepressants, but it did report lower switch rates for bupropion when compared with sertraline, venlafaxine and desipramine. Importantly, the analysis concluded that the results are significantly limited by lack of high-quality studies.

The risk of conversion to mania or induction of mood cycling has, by far, received the most attention, while far less is said about the overall tolerability of antidepressants in BD-D. Importantly, antidepressants have a rather favourable side effect profile. In a meta-analysis of antidepressants in BD-D, patients in the placebo arm dropped out of the study due to side effects more often than in the antidepressant arm (49% vs 32%, respectively). Other reports state that the side effects of antidepressants are mild, and often patients experience none. Common side effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include insomnia, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhoea, headaches, weight gain and sexual side effects. The side effect profile of bupropion includes headache, dry mouth, nausea, insomnia and very rarely seizure, but lower rates of sexual dysfunction, weight gain and somnolence. The NNH is between 20 and 90 for SSRIsand between 15 and 20 for bupropion. The rates for discontinuation due to side effects for bupropion in the treatment of BD-D or major depressive disorder (MDD) range from 5% to 11%,27% for SSRIs and 30% for tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

### Empirically supported use of psychiatric medications in adolescents and adults with IBD [^b031a308]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The use of psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants, is common in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in spite of a lack of their robust efficacy in this population. This review provides an overview of the use trends of different classes of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication and their effects on mood, nervous system function, gastrointestinal physiology and immunity drawing from the literature available in the general population, other medical conditions, and when available, patients with IBD. It also covers the evidence base for the actions, efficacy, and potential complications of antidepressants organized by different classes.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search of articles relating the different drug classes probed to the terms above in different populations of interest. All types of articles were accepted including case reports and series, open and randomized trials, reviews, and expert opinion. We also examined the reference lists of the publications found.

Results

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the most commonly prescribed agents for anxiety and depression in patients with IBD, though their efficacy for these conditions in the general population are mild to moderate at best. SSRIs are generally well tolerated, though at higher doses, they, like most antidepressant classes, can be associated with activation, serotonergic syndrome, and increased suicidal ideation. TCAs have many more serious side effects but have some shown efficacy for functional GI symptoms. A newer class, the serotonin noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can be effective for refractory depression, anxiety and chronic pain syndromes with a side effect profile similar to both SSRIs and more mild manifestations of TCAs. Mirtazapine has moderate efficacy for depression if sedation and weight gain side effects are tolerated and some small support for use in nausea and vomiting. Bupropion targets dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake and has moderate efficacy for depression, and some small support for use in fatigue and smoking cessation. Buspirone has an indication for generalized anxiety disorder though studies show only a minimal benefit. It has some growing evidence for use in functional dyspepsia. Most of these agents have physiological effects on the brain, immune system, and gastrointestinal tract (with the exception of bupropion) hence their therapeutic and side effects manifested in these systems.

Conclusion

Antidepressant medications are frequently prescribed for depression, anxiety disorders, and chronic pain syndromes, but overall support for their efficacy is modest at best. Psychological interventions have growing support for having much more robust effects without the side effects of antidepressants and should be considered first-line treatment or at least an adjunct to psychotropic medications for these conditions.

### Management of vasomotor symptoms in cancer patients [^6be06dfe]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Antidepressants

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, escitalopram, citalopram, and paroxetine) and SNRIs (eg, duloxetine and venlafaxine) are the largest groups of nonhormone therapies studied, both in healthy women and cancer patients with VMS. They can reduce hot flash frequency by up to 58% and hot flash scores by up to 65%. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs have also been compared with other drugs such as clonidine. As there is no convincing evidence supporting the superiority of any these agents over others, tolerability and side-effect profile are important determinants of treatment outcome. At present, paroxetine (Brisdelle, 7.5 mg) is the only antidepressant approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate-to-severe VMS associated with menopause. Its efficacy has also been demonstrated in patients with breast and gynecological cancers. However, due to its strong inhibition of the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme, paroxetine should be avoided in patients on tamoxifen treatment. Active metabolites of tamoxifen can be decreased by up to 64% in patients taking paroxetine. Likewise, fluoxetine, another strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, should also be avoided in tamoxifen-treated patients. In older adults, venlafaxine and paroxetine may not be the initial drug of choice due to risk of withdrawal. Escitalopram and citalopram may be the preferred drugs in this age group due to their lower side effect profile. Compared with citalopram, there are fewer cardiac side effects with escitalopram (eg, QTc prolongation). Drowsiness and dizziness are common adverse effects of SSRIs and SNRIs and can be potentially managed by adjusting the timing of administration. Taking the medication at night may not only alleviate symptoms from nocturnal VMS more effectively but also mitigate side effects such as nausea. Caution should be exercised in patients with hyponatremia, which can be associated with both cancer and SSRI use. Other adverse effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction and weight gain, which may overlap with symptoms of menopause, and should be considered in discussion on VMS treatment options. Regardless of the drug chosen, the lowest possible dose necessary for symptom relief should be used. Upon decision to stop the therapy, tapering should be done to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

### Sertraline versus other antidepressive agents for depression [^da2b2327]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical practice guideline on the treatment of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first-line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double-entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).

Main Results

A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians were not reported in any of the included studies.

### Coping strategies for antidepressant side effects: an internet survey [^aac4a9d2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients' coping methods to palliate side effects of antidepressants have not been reported in the literature.

Methods

Through an Internet survey, 856 participants who were diagnosed with depression and receiving antidepressants were recruited to report on the methods of coping with side effects. They were asked which side effect(s) they experienced and to write freely about the way they tried to counteract these effects. We classified active coping methods into the following sub-types: adjustment of prescriptions, additional medication, complementary therapy, consultation with physicians, and daily relief.

Results

The prevalence of active coping differed across side effects (from 26.7%, sexual dysfunction, to 89.5%, dry mouth). Events with a lower percentage of active coping were more likely to be managed with "adjustment of prescriptions": (sexual dysfunction, 41.9%; fatigue, 36.8%; sweating, 20.0%; tremor, 42.5%; and somnolence, 31.8%). Further, a strong negative correlation was found between the percentage of participants reporting an adjustment of prescription and that reporting an active coping (r = -0.907, p < 0.001). The "daily relief" sub-type contained a variety of strategies, including negative methods such as vomiting for nausea and weight gain and drinking alcohol for insomnia.

Limitations

Sampling of subjects were biased due to an Internet survey and diagnosis of depression and experience of side effects were self-reported.

Conclusion

Patients with depression use various ways in alleviating antidepressants side effects. Some effects such as sexual dysfunction and fatigue may not be amenable to subjective coping efforts and others are sometimes managed inappropriately, which warrants a prudent attention.

### What is the evidence for mirtazapine in treating cancer-related symptomatology? A systematic review [^f2e7b6f8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

We performed a systematic review of the literature using eight different databases to identify studies relevant to our research question.

The full protocol is available in supplementary material 1.

Data sources

To identify relevant studies, we searched on Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Central and EMBASE. We searched for grey literature on Clinical Trials, the WHO ICTRP and OpenGrey. Investigators were contacted by e-mail to request any unpublished study details identified using the clinical trial databases. Additional records were identified using related articles and references as well as by open searches. The inclusion time frame covered all databases until the 15th of January 2019.

Research algorithms were designed to fit with each database to improve the sensitivity of the search (supplementary material 2). The titles and abstracts (if available) of yielded records were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate their eligibility. Full text articles were then read and non-relevant articles excluded.

Article selection

We included only primary literature: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-controlled and non-randomised experimental studies, reporting original studies written in English or French languages. Experimental studies were required to use a control.

Included studies concerned patients diagnosed with cancer, excluding cancer survivors, with one or more of the following symptoms: depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, nausea, anorexia, weight loss, breathlessness, pain, constipation, fatigue and drowsiness. These symptoms were chosen based on the fact that they are the most frequently encountered symptoms in cancer and could potentially be addressed using mirtazapine given its pharmacological profile. The primary outcome of studies was improvement of one of the listed symptoms.

Data extraction

Data was extracted independently by two authors (GE, NL) regarding the effectiveness of mirtazapine (primary or secondary outcome) and the safety of its use. Authors extracted data on the year of publication and country of the study, number of participants, doses and modes of administration of mirtazapine and the comparator, follow-up completion rate, assessed symptoms and the tools used for assessment, results of the analysis, reported toxicity, adverse events and reasons for withdrawals.

### 5-HT (3)-receptor antagonists for the treatment of nausea and vomiting: a reappraisal of their side-effect profile [^9acde85e]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting can cause considerable distress and discomfort to patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. Several classes of antiemetic agents exist to combat these side effects, though the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists have become the first-line treatment choice for many cancer patients and are considered the "gold standard" in antiemetic therapy. Compared with the older generation antiemetic drugs, 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonists are effective, well tolerated, and associated with few side effects. However, emerging differences among these agents suggest that the incidence and/or intensity of adverse events should not be regarded as a class effect. The side-effect profile of any supportive care therapy is particularly important in certain subgroups of patients, including pediatric patients and the elderly, as well as those suffering comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and renal or hepatic impairment. Indeed, dolasetron is associated with cardiovascular effects, and thus, should be used with extreme caution in patients who suffer from or may develop prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals. Ondansetron, on the other hand, is associated with a greater incidence of central nervous system side effects than either dolasetron or ondansetron, and pharmacokinetic parameters are affected in patients with hepatic impairment, thereby requiring dose adjustments. Clinicians are encouraged to evaluate patients on an individual basis when choosing which 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist to prescribe.

### A meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing mirtazapine with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of major depressive disorder [^8e060394]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, a number of studies have suggested that the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) with anti-depressants enhancing both noradrenergic as well as serotonergic neurotransmission may result in higher response or remission rates than treatment with anti-depressants selectively enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission. The objective of this paper was to compare response rates among patients with MDD treated with either mirtazapine, an anti-depressant thought to simultaneously enhance both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Medline/Pubmed were searched. No year of publication limits were used. Double-blind, randomized clinical trials comparing mirtazapine with an SSRI for the treatment of MDD. Data were extracted with the use of a pre-coded form. Analyses were performed comparing response rates between the two anti-depressant agents. Data from 10 reports involving a total of 1904 outpatients with MDD were identified and combined using a random-effects model. Patients randomized to treatment with mirtazapine were as likely to experience clinical response as patients randomized to treatment with an SSRI (RR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96–1.2, P = 0.181). Simply pooling response rates between the two agents revealed a 67.1% response rate for mirtazapine and a 62.1% response rate for the SSRIs. There was no difference in overall discontinuation rates (RR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.7–1.5; P = 0.550), discontinuation rates due to adverse events (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.6–1.2; P = 0.497), or discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.4–2.0; P = 0.871) between the two groups. Fewer mirtazapine-treated patients complained of insomnia (RR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3–0.9; P = 0.017), nausea (RR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.3–0.5; P < 0.0001), whereas fewer SSRI-treated patients complained of fatigue (RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1–2.4; P = 0.028), excessive sleepiness (RR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1–1.7; P = 0.020), weight-gain (RR = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.3–6.4; P < 0.0001) or dry mouth (RR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3–2.4; P < 0.0001) during the course of treatment. These results suggest that mirtazapine and the SSRIs differ with respect to their side-effect profile but not their overall efficacy in the treatment of MDD.

### Genetic influences on antidepressant side effects: a CYP2C19 gene variation and polygenic risk study in the Estonian biobank [^9e678ebb]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Using questionnaire and EHR text-mining data, we identified 13,729 antidepressant users with side effect information of whom 80.2% were female and had an average age of 49.9 (SD = 14.3) years (Table 1). Most had a record of depression diagnosis (N = 10,914, 79.5%) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 3).

Table 1
Sample demographics.

Percentages for cases and controls are calculated within each subcategory based on the total number of cases or controls for the characteristic. Total percentages are based on the entire study population (N = 13,729), except for metaboliser phenotype where the percentages are calculated only for participants who took drugs metabolised by CYP2C19 (N = 9563), including escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, and amitriptyline and had complete CNV and star allele information. Cases were defined as individuals reporting a specific side effect for a drug or drug class, while controls were antidepressant users that did not report that specific side effect.

SSRIs were the most common antidepressants (N = 10,539, 76.8%), followed by SNRIs and the atypical antidepressants (N = 5589, 40.7%), and TCAs (N = 1724, 12.6%) (Supplementary Table 4). Approximately half of the individuals (52.0%; n = 7141) reported at least one antidepressant side effect (Supplementary Fig. 4, Table 1, Supplementary Table 4) with the most reported individual side effects across all antidepressants being nausea (N = 2155, 15.7%), weight gain (N = 2099, 15.3%), and sleepiness (N = 2055, 15.0%) (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 4). The least reported side effects across all antidepressants were chills (N = 103, 0.8%), decreased blood pressure (N = 134, 1.0%), and allergic reactions (N = 145, 1.1%).

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of serotonin receptor antagonists in patients undergoing chemotherapy: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^445074bd]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methodological quality and risk of bias results

Two hundred and forty-six of the studies were assessed with the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care risk-of-bias tool (Additional file 3: Appendices D, E). Overall, more than half of the studies were assessed as unclear on all of the following components: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, baseline outcome measure similarities between treatment groups, blinding, contamination, selective outcome reporting, and other bias.

The 19 cohort studies were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. More than half of the studies did not ensure the outcome of interest (e.g. incidence of nausea) was present at the beginning of the study, control for potential confounders, or report the follow-up duration (Additional file 3: Appendix F).

With regard to sources of funding, 153 of the 299 studies did not report the source of funding, 127 were funded by pharmaceutical companies, 17 were publicly funded, and two reported no funding was received. Reporting bias and small-study effects were not observed across the comparison-adjusted funnel plots for all outcomes (Additional file 3: Appendix G).

Results of statistical analysis

Number of patients experiencing harms

NMA for the primary outcome of arrhythmia was attempted using three RCTs (n = 627 adults) investigating dolasetron, granisetron, palonosetron, and/or granisetron + dexamethasone (Fig. 2, Additional file 3: Appendix H). A fourth RCT was excluded from the analysis because it reported zero events in all treatment arms. The NMA showed no statistically significant effects (Table 3, Fig. 3, Additional file 3: Appendix H). The safest treatment according to the SUCRA was granisetron (83% probability, Fig. 3). None of the three RCTs examined the same intervention so pairwise meta-analysis was not feasible. The individual results of each trial were not statistically significant, as follows: granisetron versus dolasetron (n = 311 patients, OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.02–1.84), granisetron + dexamethasone versus granisetron (n = 266 patients, OR = 3.12, 95% CI = 0.12–80.39), and palonosetron versus granisetron (n = 50 patients, OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.58–4.30).

### Discontinuing or switching selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors [^699b228d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe reasons for discontinuing or switching selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at 3 and 6 months after starting treatment, and to identify information provided to patients that may help prevent premature discontinuation of medication.

Methods

Telephone surveys were conducted at 3 and 6 months after patients (n = 672) were started on an SSRI for a new or recurrent case of depression.

Results

Significantly more patients discontinued or switched their SSRI because of an adverse effect within the first 3 months of starting (43%) compared with the second 3 months (27%; p = 0.023). The adverse effect most frequently reported as the reason for early discontinuation or switching was drowsiness/fatigue (10.2%), followed by anxiety, headache, and nausea - all at just over 5%. The odds ratio for discontinuation was 61% less in patients who recalled being told to take the medication for at least 6 months compared with those who did not (OR 0.39; p < 0.001). Patients who recalled being informed of potential adverse effects increased their reported incidence of mild to moderate adverse effects by 55% (OR 1.55; p < 0.05) without affecting rates of premature discontinuation (OR 1.06; p = 0.77).

Conclusions

Adverse effects are the most frequent reason for discontinuing or switching SSRIs within the first 3 months of treatment. Patients are more likely to continue taking their antidepressant if they fully understand how long to take the medication. Informing patients of potential adverse effects does not appear to prevent premature discontinuation, but may increase the patient's awareness and reporting of mild to moderate adverse effects.

### Efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in pediatric anxiety disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c25b5c9]. Depression and Anxiety (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that antidepressants are efficacious in the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth. However, there are no recent, systematic analyses of the efficacy, safety, or tolerability of these medications in pediatric anxiety disorders.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective, randomized, parallel-group, controlled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs) in pediatric patients with non-obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) anxiety disorders was undertaken using a search of PubMed/Medline (1966–2014). The meta-analysis utilized random-effects models to evaluate change in the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale or similar anxiety scale, suicidality, and adverse events. Additionally, pharmacologic variables were explored with regard to effect size, although no correction for multiple comparisons was made with regard to these relationships.

Results

Nine trials involving 1,673 patients and six medications were included. All SSRI/SSNRIs evaluated demonstrated efficacy, and the meta-analytic estimate of effect was of moderate magnitude (Cohen's d = 0.62, confidence interval [CI]: 0.34–0.89, P = 0.009) and there was evidence of modest heterogeneity (I(2) = 0.29, P = 0.103). Activation trended toward being more likely with antidepressant treatment (OR: 1.86, CI: 0.98–3.53, P = 0.054), but no increased risk was observed for nausea/abdominal symptoms (P = 0.262), discontinuation as a result of an adverse event (P = 0.132), or suicidality (OR: 1.3, CI: 0.53–3.2, P = 0.514). Finally, the effect size correlated with the serotonergic specificity of the agent (R = .79, P = 0.021).

Conclusions

Data for nine SSRI/SSNRIs suggest superiority of antidepressants relative to placebo for the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders with a moderate effect size.

### Efficacy and tolerability of transdermal granisetron for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting associated with moderately and highly emetogenic multi-day chemotherapy: a randomized, double-blind, phase III study [^3a773943]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Study design

This was a randomized, active control, double-blind, parallel-group, phase III study, conducted at 60 centers in Europe, India, Mexico, and the USA. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of GTDS efficacy compared to oral granisetron, in patients receiving MEC or HEC. Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety, tolerability, and adhesive properties of the GTDS.

Following a 7-day screening period, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a telephone-based randomization system to receive either a GTDS patch and placebo capsules or a placebo patch and active capsules (2 mg granisetron). Active and placebo medications were identical in appearance to ensure blinding. Patients were allocated to treatment in a random permuted block design, 1–2 days before initiation of chemotherapy. Stratification was based on factors known to affect CINV, including gender, planned chemotherapy regimen and duration, and chemotherapy naivety. Stratification of chemotherapy regimens was based on the inclusion or exclusion of cisplatin in the regimen; non-cisplatin regimens were further divided based on the planned inclusion of corticosteroids as part of the antiemetic regimen. The use of corticosteroids with cisplatin regimens was not included in the stratification, as it was anticipated that the vast majority of patients receiving cisplatin would also receive corticosteroids as part of the regimen. The use of corticosteroids in this group was recorded for confirmation.

Due to the gradual dermal penetration of granisetron from the transdermal system, patches were applied to the upper arm 24–48 h before the start of chemotherapy, by the investigator or the patient, and left in place for 7 days. Capsules were administered 1 h before each day's administration of chemotherapy (online resource, section 1). Patches were left in place for a full 7 days in all patients in order to increase the amount of safety data collected. Corticosteroids were permitted at the discretion of the investigator, as prophylaxis, and started before chemotherapy. The use of other concomitant therapies was permitted, excluding concomitant radiotherapy; medication to control the symptoms of a brain tumor, brain metastasis, or seizure disorder; SSRI antidepressants (unless a stable dose for the duration of the study); drugs known to increase the QTc interval; any other investigational drug; and any NK-1 RA, dopamine RA, or 5-HT 3 RA.

- SSRIs are the first line of psychopharmacologic treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders.
- Antidepressant selection should be evidence-based and currently the strongest evidence exists for SSRIs including escitalopram, fluoxetine, and sertraline. SNRIs may be less effective in children and adolescents.
- Dosing and titration should be guided by data from clinical trials which suggests starting low, but actively titrating medication to ensure the highest likelihood of success.
- Side effects of SSRIs may occur in 1 of 10 children or adolescents. Some side effects relate to blood levels while others are related to pharmacodynamic factors. Frequently, the management strategy is to reduce the dose or discontinue the medication.
- SSRIs include a black-box warning with regard to the risk of suicidal ideation in children and adolescents.

Although the risk is low, it is very important to monitor for any clue that the patient may be experiencing this side effect.
- One challenge in treating anxiety disorders is managing the dose to minimize the side effects without reducing the dose to a point where the benefit of the SSRI is lost. At times, side effects outweigh the medication's benefit and a change in medication is needed.
- Although FDA approved for depression, once a drug is licensed, it can be used "off-label" based on available evidence for safety and efficacy at the discretion of the prescribing clinician. Teaching Points
- SSRIs block serotonin reuptake at the pre-synaptic neuron, although they vary in the degree to which they block other receptors. Blocking the serotonin transporter, increases the concentrations of serotonin at the synapse. Blocking the norepinephrine transporter — as is the case with SNRIs — increases the concentrations of norepinephrine.
- Side effects are generally mild and dissipate relatively quickly, although some may require dose adjustment or — in some cases — a change in medication.
- The most common and most problematic side effects are abdominal symptoms, activation, and tiredness/insomnia.
- Clinicians selecting antidepressant medications to treat pediatric patients need to understand the cause of side effects as well as management strategies, particularly as antidepressant side effects increase the likelihood of discontinuation, slow the trajectory of improvement and potentially limit titration to effective doses.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^c613aacc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation — are generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects emerging within the first few weeks and including dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, headache, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, vivid dreams, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, fatigue, nervousness, tremor, bruxism, and diaphoresis; potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior, behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome; it may be helpful when starting a new SSRI to begin with a sub-therapeutic dose to minimize adverse effects, and because early adverse effects and delayed efficacy can prompt discontinuation, it is important to provide education about the time-course of improvement and adverse effects; although SSRIs have a greater margin of safety in overdose than other antidepressants, deaths have been reported after very large ingestions.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^29bfb3c5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in dementia — compared to cyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), SSRIs tend to have a more favorable side-effect profile and generally have fewer anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects; however, SSRIs can produce nausea and vomiting, agitation and akathisia, parkinsonian side effects, sexual dysfunction, weight loss, and hyponatremia, and some of these effects are more common with specific SSRIs than with the entire class. SSRI use is associated with an increased risk of falls in elderly patients, and physicians prescribing SSRIs should also be aware of the many possible medication interactions associated with the metabolism of these agents through the cytochrome P450 system.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^466fe20e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

VA/DoD Headache guideline — fluoxetine and venlafaxine for prevention states: There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against fluoxetine or venlafaxine for the prevention of headache (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, Not changed). Evidence cited includes an SR of six RCTs of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in which subjects treated with SNRIs (five venlafaxine, one duloxetine) were (n = 202) versus placebo/active comparators (n = 216); four studies (n = 279) enrolled migraine and two (n = 139) vestibular migraine. Patients given duloxetine had a reduction of 2 headache days versus placebo and venlafaxine 2–4 headache days versus placebo, but confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, studies were very small with unclear risk of bias, and did not reflect the critical outcome of interest for migraine prophylaxis. Prior SRs found no evidence that SSRI or SNRI medications prevented migraine. Safety notes include a risk of serotonin syndrome with other serotonergic medications, a boxed warning for increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults, multiple adverse events including nausea, weight gain, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, constipation, and for SNRIs increased blood pressure, and that tolerability to side effects is high and usually improves over time.

Gut–brain neuromodulators dosing and side effects (Table 2) — Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline start at 10 mg at night and are titrated by 10 mg/wk or 10 mg/fortnight according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 30–50 mg at night, with common side effects of sedation, dry eyes, dry mouth, and constipation. Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine start at 30 mg once daily and are titrated according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, with side effects including sedation, dry mouth, constipation or diarrhea, anxiety, reduced appetite, nausea, headache, and fatigue. Mirtazapine starts at 15 mg once daily and is titrated according to response and tolerability to a maximum of 45 mg once daily, with side effects including sleep disorders, constipation or diarrhea, anxiety, increased appetite and weight gain, nausea, headache, and fatigue; note that secondary amines include desipramine and nortriptyline, tertiary amines include amitriptyline and imipramine, and secondary amines may have fewer anticholinergic side effects than tertiary amines.

### Efficacy and adverse effect profile of vortioxetine in major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis [^3a05cbf6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a globally prevalent condition associated with significant morbidity and cognitive dysfunction. Vortioxetine, a novel antidepressant with multimodal serotonergic activity, has shown potential advantages over conventional antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability. This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy, cognitive improvement, and safety profile of vortioxetine in MDD.

Methods

A comprehensive search of multiple search engines yielded 16 randomized controlled trials that studied the efficacy of vortioxetine and other antidepressants. About 3127 MDD patients in the vortioxetine group and 3102 in the control group were analyzed. Primary efficacy outcomes were changes in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores, and the secondary outcome measure was cognition using the digit symbol substitution test scores. Safety was assessed via reported adverse effects (AEs), including the treatment-induced sexual dysfunction. The sensitivity analysis was done excluding the study with a high impact.

Results

Vortioxetine demonstrated a small but significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared to placebo, but showed similar efficacy to duloxetine and venlafaxine. Excluding the high-impact study did not cause much variation in the findings. There was a small but statistically insignificant improvement in cognition with vortioxetine compared to the control group. Vortioxetine had a favorable safety profile with only mild symptoms reported. The most commonly reported symptom was nausea. Vortioxetine also showed a non-significant trend toward fewer sexual AEs.

Conclusion

Vortioxetine is an effective and well-tolerated antidepressant for the management of MDD. Though the tolerability was comparable to other antidepressants, there was a potentially lower incidence of sexual side effects. A further elaborate exploration in terms of dose-specific efficacy and cognitive improvement will be promising for optimizing individualized treatment strategies.

### The safety and tolerability of vortioxetine: analysis of data from randomized placebo-controlled trials and open-label extension studies [^3753276d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Table 3.
TEAEs with an incidence of ⩾5% in any group during the core treatment period (APTS) in 11 short-term MDD studies.

Figure 1.
Treatment-emergent adverse event incidence from 11 placebo-controlled short-term major depressive disorder studies as a function of vortioxetine dose, with corresponding values for venlafaxine XR 225 mg and duloxetine 60 mg for comparison: (a) nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhoea and decreased appetite; (b) insomnia-related events, somnolence, fatigue, hyperhidrosis and sexual dysfunction-related events; (c) headache, dry mouth, dizziness, tremor and vision blurred.

AE: adverse event.

The overall incidence of TEAEs for the subgroup of patients aged ⩾65 years in the pooled analyses was 63.4% (185/292) for vortioxetine 5–20 mg and 59.8% (128/214) for placebo. The TEAEs reported by ⩾5% of patients were: nausea (22.3% and 7.0%), headache (8.9% and 15.4%), dizziness (7.5% and 6.5%), constipation (7.2% and 3.7%), diarrhoea (5.8% and 6.5%), dry mouth (5.8% and 4.7%) and fatigue (5.1% and 2.3%) for vortioxetine 5–20 mg and placebo, respectively. In a randomized placebo-controlled study in elderly patients with MDD treated with vortioxetine 5 mg nausea was the only TEAE reported with an incidence ⩾5% that occurred > 2 x more frequently in the vortioxetine group than in the placebo group (21.8% vs. 8.3%).

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^2d39619a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The most common treatment‐emergent adverse events with naltrexone/bupropion in clinical trials were nausea (32.5% vs 6.7% with placebo), constipation (19.2% vs 7.2%), headache (17.6% vs 10.4%), vomiting (10.7% vs 2.9%) and dizziness (9.9% vs 3.4%); nausea, headache and vomiting were the most common adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation 40. In clinical practice, nausea and vomiting are common but can be easily controlled by slowing the upward titration of naltrexone/bupropion (note: this recommendation is not included in the medication label). In the present author's experience, many patients do well on lower doses of the medication and do not require full doses to achieve significant weight loss. Naltrexone/bupropion did not appear to be associated with increased risk of depression or suicidality, and in one study 65, depression was reported more frequently with placebo than naltrexone/bupropion (2.5% vs 0.3%; p = 0.014) 65, 66, 67, therefore, naltrexone/bupropion could potentially be beneficial for overweight or obese individuals with depression. Close monitoring for clinical worsening of depression, unusual changes in behaviour or suicidal thoughts is recommended, however, in those being treated with antidepressants for any indication 40. Naltrexone/bupropion is contraindicated in pregnancy (category X) 40.

Paroxetine controlled release — adult dosing and duration, adverse effects, and cautions are detailed: 62.5 mg/d (12.5–75 mg/d), starting at 25 mg/d and increasing by 12.5 mg/d at intervals of at least one week, with an adequate trial of 12 weeks, and use lower doses in the elderly. Notable adverse effects include drowsiness, nausea, insomnia, headache, dizziness, diaphoresis, weakness, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, akathisia, suicidal ideation, serotonin syndrome, sexual dysfunction, and discontinuation syndrome. Comments include availability of immediate-release tablets (20–60 mg/d), contraindicated with MAOIs and within 14 days of starting or stopping MAOIs, and that it is the most sedating SSRI with potent anticholinergic effects and as a 2D6 substrate has potentially significant interactions that may require dose or frequency adjustment, additional monitoring, and/or selection of alternative therapy.

### The 2023 nonhormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^744d78ea]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) — paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine have been shown to significantly reduce vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in large, double-blind RCTs, and duloxetine has been found to reduce VMS in smaller studies, with hot flash reductions varying from 25% to 69% and composite severity and frequency improvements from 27% to 61%; trends with sertraline and fluoxetine were statistically insignificant; therefore, they are not recommended. Compared with placebo, oral estradiol reduced the frequency of hot flashes by 2.3 more per day (P < .001) and venlafaxine by 1.8 more per day (P = 0.005), and dose escalation would be expected to provide 77% improvement in hot flashes on average. A low-dose paroxetine salt (7.5 mg/d) was the first nonhormone pharmaceutical FDA approved for moderate to severe VMS with improvements in VMS severity and frequency for up to 24 months and without weight gain or negative effects on libido. Contraindications to SSRIs and SNRIs include prior neuroleptic syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and concurrent monoamine oxidase inhibitor use; caution should be taken with specified comorbidities, and black box warnings note uncommon suicidal thoughts in adolescents and children within the first few months. For women using tamoxifen, coadministration of SSRIs may inhibit CYP2D6 particularly with paroxetine and fluoxetine, with safer choices including citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine; common adverse events include nausea or dizziness, which typically improves after 1 to 2 weeks (Level I; recommended).

### Vortioxetine (brintellix) for the treatment of depression… [^37c4a09f]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

The safety profile of vortioxetine is similar to that of other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. As with other antidepressants in this class, vortioxetine includes a black box warning of increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults. It may also cause clinical worsening or activation of mania or hypomania. 2 However, current data show no increase in suicidality in the first year of use. 3 Vortioxetine should not be used with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, linezolid, intravenous methylene blue, or other serotonergic drugs because of the risk of serotonin syndrome. Vortioxetine may increase the risk of bleeding events, particularly when taken with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other medications that affect coagulation. It also may cause hyponatremia, which is rare but can be severe.

This is more likely to happen in older adults, persons taking diuretics, and those who are volume depleted. Vortioxetine is a U. S. Food and Drug Administration pregnancy category C drug.
2. TOLERABILITY Vortioxetine is generally well tolerated. The dropout rate from side effects in the first year of use is 6%. Vortioxetine is not associated with significant weight gain over at least one year of treatment. 3 Nausea is the most common side effect, occurring in up to 38% of patients, and is usually temporary and reported as mild to moderate. Headache occurs in up to 25% of patients. Other common side effects include dizziness, dry mouth, nasopharyngitis, and diarrhea; these generally occur in less than 10% of patients. 4, 6, 8 Remission occurs in about 20% to 60% of patients, 4, 6, 8 and it is maintained in about 62% of patients at 52 weeks. 3 Vortioxetine may also prevent relapse at 24 weeks. 1 However, at least three studies have shown no benefit of vortioxetine over placebo.

5, 7, 9 Comparative data show no benefit of vortioxetine over other antidepressants, but these trials compared lower dosages of vortioxetine to maximal dosages of venlafaxine and duloxetine. 4, 5, 8, 9.

Long-term open-label studies

In the five extension studies (Table 1), 1313 patients were treated with 5–10 mg vortioxetine and 1144 patients with 15–20 mg vortioxetine, representing 1015 and 775 patient-years of exposure, respectively, with a median exposure of 52 weeks and 51 weeks, respectively. The completion rate for each of the five long-term studies is shown in Table 1. Patients had a mean age of approximately 45 years (5–10 mg studies) and approximately 44 years (15–20 mg studies) and the majority were women (approximately 65% for 5–10 mg studies and approximately 74% for the 15–20 mg studies). The most common TEAEs leading to withdrawal were nausea (0.8% and 2.7%), depression (0.7% and 0.4%), vomiting (0.2% and 1.0%), headache (0.2% and 0.7%), weight gain (0.2% and 0.5%) and insomnia related events (0.2% and 0.5%) for vortioxetine 5–10 mg and 15–20 mg, respectively.

Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline) certainty and cost considerations indicate very low certainty evidence (10 studies with direct and 6 studies with indirect evidence) for a net health benefit, with the panel determining a moderate therapeutic benefit and moderate harm; the panel also noted a high rate of placebo effects and the potentially confounding natural history with resolution beginning in early adolescence, and noted that low cost ($7–11/month) and potential reduction of healthcare costs rendered this a cost‑effective treatment acceptable to some and accessible to most patients, probably facilitating health equity.

### Naturalistic study of the early psychiatric use of citalopram in the United States [^1a9a1bdf]. Depression and Anxiety (2002). Low credibility.

We obtained information on the efficacy and safety of citalopram in settings that resemble actual clinical practice. A total of 1,783 patients participated in this open, uncontrolled, naturalistic Phase IV evaluation of citalopram at 447 U.S. investigative sites. Participants were selected by guidelines in the citalopram package insert using minimal exclusion criteria. Citalopram dosing began at 20 mg/day and could be titrated to 60 mg/day. Outcomes included the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and a Patient Global Evaluation. Separate analyses were performed on patients with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) (76%) who reported intolerance or nonresponse to previous selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Patients included tended to have treatment-resistant or intolerant, chronic or recurrent, comorbid depression with a mean duration of illness of 10 years. At study completion, more than 68% of treatment completers were classified as responders (CGI-I score of 1 or 2). Endpoint analyses showed response rates of 54% in all patients, 56% in patients with MDD, 49% in SSRI nonresponsive patients, and 53% in patients with a history of SSRI intolerance. Nausea (9.8%) and headache (7.3%) were the most often reported adverse events. Patients with a history of SSRI intolerance had a discontinuation rate of 21.8%, whereas those without such a history had a discontinuation rate of 13.3%. Citalopram administered at an average dose of 23.6 mg/day was associated with favorable outcomes and was generally well tolerated.

### Duloxetine for the long-term treatment of major depressive disorder in patients aged 65 and older: an open-label study [^f49a918d]. BMC Geriatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Late-life depression is a common and disabling condition which represents a substantial public health concern. The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the community-dwelling elderly population is estimated at 1–3%, with depressive symptoms being present in approximately 15%. The rate of occurrence of MDD is even higher among institutionalized older patients. In long-term care patients the incidence has been estimated to be 12% to 25%, with subsyndromal depressive symptoms present in an additional 18% to 30%.

Despite advances in available antidepressant treatments, limitations still exist in both efficacy and safety. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) generally provide robust efficacy, but a number of side effects associated with this class of medications are of particular concern in older patients (e.g. anticholinergic adverse events, orthostatic hypotension, and sedation). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have provided an improved tolerability profile compared to the TCAs through lower rates of adverse events, and substantially lower toxicity in overdose. Furthermore, SSRIs do not appear to exhibit age-related increases in occurrence of adverse events. However, these newer selective antidepressants appear, in general, to achieve equivalent or lower remission rates compared with the older tricyclics.

Duloxetine is a potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). The efficacy of duloxetine in the acute treatment of MDD has been established in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients aged 18 and older. A subsequent post-hoc analysis of efficacy data from these studies, focusing upon those patients aged 55 and older receiving once-daily duloxetine (60 mg), supported the findings in the general patient population.

The safety and tolerability of duloxetine have also been demonstrated under double-blind conditions. In placebo-controlled trials of duloxetine in patients aged 18 and older (doses from 40–120 mg/d) the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia, and dizziness, while the overall safety profile of duloxetine was comparable to that of available SSRI medications. A comparable safety and tolerability profile was observed following a post-hoc analysis of data from those patients aged 55 and older, including a low incidence of cardiovascular adverse events and minimal effects upon blood pressure and heart rate.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^dc09c31b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Gabapentinoids — A large meta-analysis involving 281 RCTs reported a significant reduction in the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with gabapentin and pregabalin (A1), with effects seen at both low doses (defined as < 300 mg pregabalin/day or < 900 mg gabapentin/day) and higher doses, given as a single or in multiple doses. Their use was associated with increased risk of dizziness and visual disturbances; use in enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols has been challenged due to concerns about adverse events and the risk of respiratory depression when combined with opioids, and the analgesic and opioid sparing efficacy of gabapentinoids may not be clinically relevant.

### Differentiated effects of the multimodal antidepressant vortioxetine on sleep architecture: part 1, a pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic comparison with paroxetine in healthy men [^fefa5715]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

We compared the effect of vortioxetine, paroxetine and placebo after three days of dosing on sleep architecture. This was a randomised, double-blind, four-way crossover, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study in 24 healthy young men. Subjects received 20mg vortioxetine, 40 mg vortioxetine, 20mg paroxetine or placebo for three consecutive days in four different periods with at least three weeks between them. Polysomnography and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis were performed on the pre-dose night and nights 1 and 3 of dosing in each period. Plasma concentrations of vortioxetine and paroxetine during the polysomnography measurement were used to estimate SERT occupancies using published relationships in healthy subjects. All three active treatments significantly increased REM onset latency and decreased time spent in REM sleep. In the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analysis significant relationships were found between REM onset latency and time spent in REM sleep and vortioxetine/paroxetine exposure. The relation between REM suppression parameters and SERT occupancy was significantly different between vortioxetine and paroxetine, despite the same SERT occupancy. This indicates that vortioxetine has a different clinical pharmacological profile from paroxetine, which may explain the differences in adverse effect profile of the two drugs, for instance the lower incidence of nausea, weight gain and sexual dysfunction with vortioxetine.

### Zolmitriptan (zolmitriptan OD) [^8a65a440]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets?

Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long.

The most common side effects of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are:

pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw
dizziness
tingling or other abnormal sensations
tiredness
drowsiness
feeling warm or cold
nausea
feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body
dry mouth

In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets:

severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw
shortness of breath or wheezing
sudden or severe stomach pain
hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling
problems seeing
unusual weakness or numbness

Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptanorally disintegrating tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets.

### Antidepressants for depressed elderly [^898580a4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is a relatively common experience in older adults. The syndrome is associated with considerable distress, morbidity and service commitment. Approximately two thirds of patients presenting with severe forms will respond to antidepressant treatment and the last twenty years has witnessed a great increase in the number of these drugs. Older, frail people are particularly vulnerable to side effects.

Objectives

The aims of this review were to examine the efficacy of antidepressant classes, to compare the withdrawal rates associated with each class and describe the side effect profile of antidepressant drugs for treating depression in patients described as elderly, geriatric, senile or older adults, aged 55 or over.

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched (2003-08-13). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand searched for published reports and citations of unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Trials had to compare at least two active antidepressant drugs in the treatment of depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Reviewers extracted data independently. In examining efficacy, the reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement. Withdrawal rates irrespective of cause and specifically due to side effects were compared between drug classes. Relative risk (RR) for dichotomous data and weighted mean difference for continuous data were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Qualitative side effect data were reported in terms of ratios of side effects and percentage of patients experiencing specific side effects.

Main Results

A total of 29 trials provided data for inclusion in the review. We were unable to find any differences in efficacy when comparing classes of antidepressants. However, as the trials contained relatively small numbers of patients, these findings may be explained by a type two error. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) compared less favourably with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in terms of numbers of patients withdrawn irrespective of reason (RR: 1.24, CI 1.04, 1.47) and number withdrawn due to side effects (RR: 1.30, CI 1.02, 1.64). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that TCA related antidepressants had similar withdrawal rates to SSRIs irrespective of reason of withdrawal (RR: 1.49, CI 0.74, 2.98) or withdrawal due to side effects (RR: 1.07, CI 0.43, 2.70). The qualitative analysis of side effects showed a small increased profile of gastro-intestinal and neuropsychiatric side effects associated with classical TCAs.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest that SSRIs and TCAs are of the same efficacy. However, we have found some evidence suggesting that TCA related antidepressants and classical TCAs may have different side effect profiles and are associated with differing withdrawal rates when compared with SSRIs. The review suggests that classical TCAs are associated with a higher withdrawal rate due to side effect experience, although these results must be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small size of the review and the heterogeneity of the drugs and patient populations.

### Zolmitriptan (zolmiptriptan) [^54111e0f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are the possible side effects of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets?

Zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are generally well tolerated. As with any medicine, people taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets may have side effects. The side effects are usually mild and do not last long.

The most common side effects of zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets are:

pain, pressure or tightness in the neck, throat or jaw
dizziness
tingling or other abnormal sensations
tiredness
drowsiness
feeling warm or cold
nausea
feeling of tightness or heaviness in other areas of the body
dry mouth

In very rare cases, patients taking triptans may experience serious side effects, such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, or serious allergic reactions. Extremely rarely, patients have died. Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following problems after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets:

severe tightness, pain, pressure or heaviness in your chest, throat, neck, or jaw
shortness of breath or wheezing
sudden or severe stomach pain
hives; tongue, mouth, or throat swelling
problems seeing
unusual weakness or numbness

Some people may have a reaction called serotonin syndrome, which can be life-threatening, when they use zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets. In particular, this reaction may occur when they use zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets together with certain types of antidepressants known as SSRIs or SNRIs. Symptoms may include mental changes (hallucinations, agitation, coma), fast heartbeat, changes in blood pressure, high body temperature or sweating, tight muscles, trouble walking, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Call your doctor immediately if you have any of these symptoms after taking zolmitriptan orally disintegrating tablets.

### Effect of intraoperative and / or postoperative esketamine administration on preventing postpartum depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a50c9bb9]. Psychiatry Research (2024). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of intraoperative and/or postoperative esketamine application on the prevention of postpartum depression (PPD). PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were thoroughly searched for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the application of esketamine for postnatal depression prevention. Nine RCTs including 1277 participants were involved in the final analysis. It was found that intraoperative and/or postoperative administration of esketamine significantly reduced the PPD incidence and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scores in the early postoperative period. Meanwhile, esketamine lowered the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting with no influence on other psychiatric symptoms.

### Efficacy and safety of ketamine and esketamine in reducing the incidence of postpartum depression: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^697d93cc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, we performed subgroup analysis according to the dose, which revealed the efficacy of doses less than 0.5 mg and doses of 0.5 mg ketamine/esketamine in lowering the incidence of long-term and short-term PPD. On the contrary, Li et al. 2024 found that only high doses efficiently reduced the incidence of short-term and long-term PPD (p -value < 0.0001 and 0.002, respectively.

Regarding the risk of side effects, patients in the Ketamine/esketamine group showed statistically significant higher rates of developing blurred vision, dizziness, hallucinations and headache than women in the control group. However, no significant difference was observed between the groups in Nausea, vomiting, and Diplopia. Li et al. 2024 have similar findings regarding the risk of side effects, but the risk of diplopia was significantly higher among the Ketamin/esketamine group (p -value = 0.01).

Despite the fact that the reported side effects are temporary and usually resolve after discontinuation of the drugs, we recommend using small doses. Since low doses were as efficient as high doses, this study suggests using the lowest possible dose to be more tolerable and avoid the reported side effects.

Regarding short-term and long-term EPDS scores, both Ketamine and esketamine showed significantly lower scores than women in the control group. Li et al. 2024 found that only esketamine significantly lowered short-term and long-term EPDS scores. Also, they found significant results only with the PCIA route of administration and high doses of the drugs. Whereas, in our study, we found significant results for high and low doses as well as PCIA and IV routes of administrations. We also found that only esketamine effectively improved the change in short-term EPDS score from baseline. However, both of the drugs significantly affected the change in long-term EPDS score from baseline.

Figure 5
Meta-analysis of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) versus placebo on non-serious adverse events.

One trial used another drug, citalopram, as a co-intervention. Test of interaction comparing the effects of drug co-interventions versus no drug co-intervention showed no evidence of a difference (p = 0.053) (online supplemental figure S31).

When each specific non-serious adverse event was analysed separately, 23/36 meta-analyses showed evidence of a harmful effect of tricyclic antidepressants on individual non-serious adverse events: dry mouth (45 trials), constipation (38 trials), dizziness (34 trials), somnolence (33 trials), tremor (28 trials), sweating (21 trials), blurred vision (20 trials), asthenia (20 trials), nervousness (14 trials), tachycardia (14 trials), dyspepsia (11 trials), weight gain (8 trials), paraesthesia (7 trials), confusion (7 trials), anticholinergic symptoms (5 trials), sedation (5 trials), increased appetite (5 trials), decreased appetite (4 trials), micturition disorder (3 trials), flushing (2 trials), abnormal dreams (2 trials), impaired urination (2 trials) and urinary hesitancy (2 trials). The 10 non-serious adverse events with the lowest NNH were dry mouth (RR 3.43; 95% CI 2.87 to 4.10; p < 0.01; τ = 0.5; I² = 72.1%; 45 trials; NNH: 2 (1863/3399)) (online supplemental figure S32); anticholinergic symptoms (RR 2.35; 95% CI 1.46 to 3.78; p < 0.01; τ = 0.5; I² = 79.0%; 5 trials; NNH: 3 (184/297)) (online supplemental figure S33); somnolence (RR 2.65; 95% CI 2.20 to 3.21; p < 0.01; τ = 0.4; I² = 55.9%; 33 trials; NNH: 4 (919/2616)) (online supplemental figure S34); sedation (RR 1.67; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.58; p = 0.02; τ = 0.4; I² = 49.1%; 5 trials; NNH: 7 (98/301)) (online supplemental figure S35); dizziness (RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.87 to 3.01; p < 0.01; τ = 0.5; I² = 56.6%; 34 trials; NNH: 7 (584/2753)) (online supplemental figure S36); constipation (RR 2.81; 95% CI 2.16 to 3.65; p < 0.01; τ = 0.6; I² = 58.6%; 38 trials; NNH: 7 (617/3082)) (online supplemental figure S37); sweating (RR 3.64; 95% CI 2.41 to 5.50; p < 0.01; τ = 0.6; I² = 42.5%; 21 trials; NNH: 8 (230/1563)) (online supplemental figure S38); tremor (RR 4.70; 95% CI 3.02 to 7.30; p < 0.01; τ = 0.8; I² = 47.1%; 28 trials; NNH: 9 (300/2321)) (online supplemental figure S39); blurred vision (RR 2.96; 95% CI 2.21 to 3.96; p < 0.01; τ = 0.2; I² = 14.7%; 19 trials; NNH: 10 (216/1485)) (online supplemental figure S40) and flushing (RR 5.86; 95% CI 1.33 to 25.72; p = 0.02; τ = 0.7; I² = 41.0%; 2 trials; NNH: 10 (26/231)) (online supplemental figure S41). Two meta-analyses showed evidence of a beneficial effect of tricyclic antidepressants on individual non-serious adverse events: diarrhoea (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.74; p < 0.01; τ = 0.4; I² = 25.0%; 13 trials; number needed to treat (NNT): 19 (35/895)) (online supplemental figure S42) and infection (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.89; p = 0.02; τ = 0.1; I² = 3.9%; 3 trials; NNT: 21 (9/279)) (online supplemental table S4 and figure S43). The remaining meta-analyses are reported in the online supplemental material (online supplemental table S5 and figures S44–S67). Please see online supplemental file 4 for the list of non-serious adverse events combined for meta-analyses.
