## Question

Is this reasoning sound?

The patient's hyponatremia appears to have multiple contributing factors. The early, marked decline (Na 112, serum Osm 243, urine Na 77, urine Osm 266) was probably triggered by HCTZ therapy, excessive free water intake, and a low-solute diet, each of which reduces free water clearance and decreases serum sodium. Yet, the continued hyponatremia despite stopping HCTZ and restricting intake, together with inappropriately concentrated urine and a high urine sodium, points to underlying SIADH physiology maintaining the low sodium. This is further supported by only minimal early correction until hypertonic saline and water restriction were instituted. After these interventions plus oral urea, the sodium rose steadily to 128 (serum Osm 274, urine Na 46, urine Osm 459); the increase reflects solute-driven free water excretion while urine osmolality remained high due to ongoing ADH activity. In summary, oral intake factors and thiazide exposure drove the initial fall, but SIADH is the predominant ongoing mechanism.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the reasoning about a two-phase severe hyponatremia (Na 112 mmol/L) — with initial precipitants of thiazide use, high free-water intake, and a low-solute diet, and persistent SIADH as the ongoing mechanism — is sound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the plausibility of the proposed initial precipitants (thiazide, high water intake, low solute). Then, I should verify diagnostic compatibility with SIADH using guideline criteria and the provided labs. Next, I'll assess the argument for persistent SIADH physiology despite removal of triggers. After that, I will interpret treatment response, including hypertonic saline, fluid restriction, and urea, and what the urine osmolality implies. Finally, I need to ensure safety principles (correction limits, DDAVP strategies) are addressed and confirm that alternative etiologies and medication triggers were appropriately considered [^115cSj3z] [^111fLWER] [^116Pc3fn].

> Let me first anchor the clinical severity and general risks to ensure we're framing this correctly, because with Na 112 mmol/L I need to be vigilant about both cerebral edema and overcorrection risks. Severe hyponatremia warrants urgent assessment and often hypertonic saline for severe symptoms, but in chronic cases correction must be limited to avoid osmotic demyelination, typically targeting 4–6 mEq/L initially and not exceeding about 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours depending on risk, with tighter limits for high-risk patients such as those with alcoholism, malnutrition, or liver disease [^114zXmxm] [^114C7k4P] [^111wqz5y].

> Now, evaluating the proposed initial precipitants, I should confirm whether thiazide exposure, excessive water intake, and low solute intake can plausibly precipitate a sharp sodium drop. Wait, let me verify the thiazide signal: prospective data attribute a meaningful fraction of hyponatremia to thiazide-induced cases, and the mechanism of impaired dilution with volume-mediated ADH stimulus is well established, so that checks out; next, increased water intake can overwhelm excretory capacity, particularly when solute intake is reduced, because renal free water clearance depends on solute load, which is reduced in "tea and toast" or low-protein states that cap daily excretable water at low volumes, making even modest polydipsia dangerous in that context [^114dm6hA] [^111fLWER] [^115j5e1F].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about SIADH without mapping the labs to formal criteria; I need to check the essentials: hypotonic serum osmolality (< 275 mOsm/kg), inappropriately elevated urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/kg), urine sodium typically > 30 mmol/L on normal diet, clinical euvolemia, and exclusion of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, and renal insufficiency, with no recent diuretic use for a strict SIADH diagnosis; the provided profile (serum Osm 243 mOsm/kg, urine Osm 266 mOsm/kg, urine Na 77 mmol/L) fits the core SIADH biochemical pattern, and if HCTZ was stopped, that addresses the "no diuretic" caveat for diagnosis, while the degree of urine concentration makes primary polydipsia less likely because that classically shows urine osmolality ≤ 100 mOsm/kg [^115cSj3z] [^1121fSgV] [^111sjqQX].

> Next, I should review the argument that persistent hyponatremia after stopping HCTZ and restricting fluids implies an ongoing SIADH physiology rather than residual thiazide effect or low-solute intake alone. I will now examine the guideline "supplemental criteria" that support SIADH: lack of correction with isotonic saline and improvement with fluid restriction are supportive, though fluid restriction efficacy wanes as urine osmolality rises; I initially thought a urine osmolality above 500 mOsm/kg predicts poor response to fluid restriction, but wait, I should double-check the threshold — on review, a commonly cited threshold in the diagnostic laboratory literature uses > 600 mOsm/kg to indicate relative resistance and candidacy for V2 antagonists, so I should correct my earlier mental note from 500 to 600 mOsm/kg to align with that source, while still acknowledging that higher urine osmolality in general portends more restrictive fluid targets and less FR efficacy [^115cSj3z] [^114MVSuY] [^113VBoKn].

> I will now interpret the treatment response as an internal validity check of the mechanism. Hypertonic saline is the agent of choice for severe symptomatic hyponatremia because its osmolality exceeds maximal urine osmolality and will reliably raise serum sodium initially; subsequent control with fluid restriction makes physiologic sense in SIADH, and oral urea increases solute excretion to augment electrolyte-free water clearance without driving sodium load, which can be particularly useful when urine remains concentrated; the persistently elevated urine osmolality (e.g., 459 mOsm/kg) during recovery suggests ongoing ADH effect and aligns with SIADH subtypes where AVP/copeptin regulation is uncoupled from tonicity, such as "type C" patterns described with stable AVP independent of osmolality; the treatment description aligns with guideline-recommended approaches and the lab interpretation correctly — wait, I didn't complete that thought — correctly supports continued antidiuresis despite improving serum sodium, reinforcing SIADH as the ongoing driver [^116Pc3fn] [^114zYH9K] [^1121QQXQ] [^114MVSuY].

> But wait, I need to ensure safety nuances aren't overlooked, especially given the very low starting sodium and the risk profile. Limiting daily correction to around 8 mEq/L in high-risk chronic hyponatremia and generally ≤ 10 mEq/L in 24 hours is prudent, with frequent monitoring; desmopressin can be used reactively if the sodium rise is outpacing targets, or as rescue to re-lower with electrolyte-free water if overcorrection occurs and ODS risk escalates; importantly, symptoms of ODS are delayed, so vigilance beyond the first day is mandatory [^114C7k4P] [^117PQvbh] [^111wqz5y].

> Let me consider whether alternative etiologies were reasonably excluded and whether any medications could have sustained SIADH physiology. I should confirm clinical euvolemia, normal adrenal and thyroid function, and the absence of renal failure as required by SIADH criteria; additionally, a thorough medication review is essential because SSRIs/SNRIs and other agents can provoke SIADH, and if present, discontinuation of nonessential contributors is recommended as part of management [^115cSj3z] [^111B44kt] [^117WEY6s] [^116Fduk1].

> In summary, I should verify that the "two-phase" model is coherent: initial precipitants (thiazide, excess water, low solute) synergistically impair free water clearance to drive the acute fall, and persistent inappropriate urinary concentration with high urine sodium after trigger removal, coupled with the response to hypertonic saline, fluid restriction, and urea, supports ongoing SIADH physiology; the reasoning is sound and consistent with pathophysiology and guideline criteria, provided endocrine exclusions and diuretic cessation were confirmed and correction limits were respected during therapy [^111fLWER] [^115cSj3z] [^116Pc3fn] [^115bV1Sk].

---

Yes, the explanation is **internally consistent** and aligns with guideline-based physiology: thiazides, high free water, and low solute intake can cause an initial severe drop by impairing free water clearance [^111fLWER], while **persistent SIADH** is indicated by inappropriately concentrated urine and elevated urine sodium after stopping HCTZ and restricting intake [^1121fSgV] [^111B44kt]. The steady sodium rise with hypertonic saline [^116Pc3fn], water restriction [^115bV1Sk] [^114MVSuY], and urea [^114zYH9K] reflects solute-driven free water excretion despite ongoing ADH activity, supporting SIADH as the dominant ongoing mechanism.

---

## Initial severe hyponatremia: multifactorial etiology

The initial severe hyponatremia (Na 112 mmol/L, serum osmolality 243 mOsm/kg, urine sodium 77 mmol/L, urine osmolality 266 mOsm/kg) reflects a **multifactorial etiology** involving [^115bV1Sk]:

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) impairs renal dilution by increasing sodium loss and stimulating ADH, reducing free water clearance and lowering serum sodium [^111fLWER].

- **High free water intake**: Excess water intake can overwhelm renal excretion capacity, especially with thiazides or low solute intake, causing dilutional hyponatremia [^114RpkPA].

- **Low solute diet**: Low dietary solute (tea and toast, beer potomania) limits maximal urine volume, reducing free water clearance and predisposing to hyponatremia [^115j5e1F].

These factors together impair free water clearance, causing **dilutional hyponatremia** [^111fLWER].

---

## Persistence of hyponatremia: indication of SIADH

Persistent hyponatremia after stopping HCTZ and restricting intake — with inappropriately concentrated urine and elevated urine sodium — indicates **SIADH** [^115cSj3z]:

- **Inappropriately concentrated urine**: Urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/kg despite hypo-osmolality indicates inappropriate ADH activity [^1121fSgV].

- **Elevated urine sodium**: Urine sodium > 30 mmol/L with normal intake suggests renal sodium loss typical of SIADH [^111B44kt].

- **Euvolemic status**: SIADH presents as euvolemic hyponatremia with inappropriate water retention and sodium loss [^115bV1Sk].

These findings support **SIADH as the ongoing cause** [^114dm6hA].

---

## Limited early correction: further support for SIADH

Limited early correction until hypertonic saline and water restriction were applied further supports **SIADH** [^116Pc3fn]. For severe symptomatic hyponatremia, **hypertonic saline** is effective, especially in SIADH, by increasing serum sodium and reducing cerebral edema [^114zYH9K] [^115WbE1C], and **water restriction** is first-line for SIADH to reduce free water intake and increase serum sodium [^114MVSuY] [^115bV1Sk]. The need for these measures indicates **ongoing inappropriate ADH activity**.

---

## Steady improvement with oral urea: solute-driven free water excretion

Steady improvement to Na 128 mmol/L (serum osmolality 274 mOsm/kg, urine sodium 46 mmol/L, urine osmolality 459 mOsm/kg) with oral urea reflects **solute-driven free water excretion** [^113VBoKn]. Using **urea therapy** increases the osmotic load, promoting free water excretion and correcting hyponatremia despite ongoing ADH activity [^114zYH9K] [^113VBoKn]. The **persistent high urine osmolality** reflects ongoing ADH activity and is consistent with SIADH [^1121fSgV] [^1121QQXQ]. Together, this pattern supports **SIADH as the dominant ongoing mechanism** [^115bV1Sk].

---

## Clinical guidelines and evidence-based practices

The clinical course and management are consistent with **current guidelines**:

- **Initial management**: Identify and treat underlying causes, discontinue contributing medications, and restrict free water intake [^115cSj3z] [^111fLWER].

- **SIADH management**: Fluid restriction, hypertonic saline for severe symptoms, and urea or vasopressin antagonists for chronic SIADH [^116Pc3fn] [^1112hMeE] [^114zYH9K].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent serum sodium monitoring to avoid rapid correction and osmotic demyelination [^111fLWER] [^114C7k4P] [^111wqz5y] [^114mqwBU].

---

## Conclusion

The explanation is consistent with current understanding and guidelines: the initial drop was multifactorial (HCTZ, high free water, low solute), while persistent hyponatremia with inappropriately concentrated urine [^1121fSgV] and elevated urine sodium [^111B44kt] indicates **SIADH as the dominant ongoing mechanism**. The response to hypertonic saline [^116Pc3fn], water restriction [^115bV1Sk], and urea [^114zYH9K] further supports this diagnosis.

Fluid restriction

In patients with SIAD, fluid restriction (FR) is the first-line therapy currently recommended by EU and US hyponatremia guidelines, though evidence for efficacy is limited. FR has the advantages of being free and readily accessible; however, limitations include patient adherence, accuracy of fluid balance monitoring in real-world conditions, potential competing needs for concomitant medications that require coadministration of oral or IV fluid, and potentially poor tolerability with respect to thirst and quality of life. Interestingly, the osmotic threshold for thirst is lower in those with chronic SIAD, which may contribute to discomfort with FR. In a study comparing water intake post-hypertonic saline infusion in eight patients with chronic SIAD and eight healthy controls, the onset of thirst occurred at a significantly lower serum osmolality in those with SIAD (264 vs. 285 mOsm/kg H2O).

The clinical calculator, "Diagnostic criteria for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion", is a tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH). This condition is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. The criteria are primarily used to identify patients with hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, where SIADH may be the underlying cause.

- **Essential criteria**: Effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg, absence of clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia, urine sodium concentration greater than 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake, absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary or renal insufficiency, and no recent use of diuretic agents.

- **Supplemental criteria**: Provide additional diagnostic support, including serum uric acid less than 0.24 mmol/L, serum urea less than 3.6 mmol/L, failure to correct hyponatremia after 0.9% saline infusion, fractional sodium excretion greater than 0.5%, fractional urea excretion greater than 55%, fractional uric acid excretion greater than 12%, and correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction.

The Diagnostic Criteria for SIADH is a comprehensive tool that incorporates a wide range of clinical and laboratory parameters.

### Hyponatremia: Pathophysiology, classification, manifestations and management [^111fLWER]. International Urology and Nephrology (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia is an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.

- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.

- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH, it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to alleviate symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of severe or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear.

Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures (such as fluid restriction and hypertonic saline) and means like urea and demeclocycline, with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently, vasopressin receptor antagonists, known as vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy for SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous for patients because there is no need for fluid restriction, and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear beneficial for physicians and staff due to their efficiency and reliability. The side effects include thirst, polydipsia, and frequent urination.

In any therapy of chronic SIADH, it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 hours are critical for preventing an overly rapid correction of hypo…

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^114zXmxm]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients.

With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies.

ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered for several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to healthcare problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life, and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and the failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without a layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: Core curriculum 2020 [^114RpkPA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, influencing water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration.

Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over-rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia.

Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This core curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration, and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^115WbE1C]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, particularly in the management of severely symptomatic patients, the initial management according to the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommends obtaining a follow-up serum sodium concentration 20 minutes after the initial infusion while administering a second infusion of 150 mL 3% hypertonic saline over the subsequent 20 minutes.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^113cgXyq]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Initial management of hyponatremia includes assessment of neurological symptoms and signs to determine whether urgent treatment of severe hyponatremia with hypertonic saline is required. As discussed in "Acute Severe Hyponatremia", severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema, leading to seizures, coma, or death, and urgent intervention is recommended with a 100-mL bolus of hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride administered over approximately 15 minutes. An initial dose should be followed by clinical reassessment and a repeat dose if no clinical response, until this target increment has been achieved. The goal is to achieve an initial sodium increase of 4 to 6 mmol.

According to the Adrogué-Madias formula to estimate the effect of fluid administration on pNa, 100 mL of NaCl 3%, containing 51.3 mmol of Na+, may be expected to increase serum sodium by 1 to 1.5 mmol/L in most adults of average size (50–80 kg), assuming no urinary electrolyte-free water clearance in the same interval.

### Disorders of sodium [^113Bapty]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Sodium imbalances are a common occurrence in the emergency department. Although recognition and diagnosis are relatively straightforward, discovering the cause and management should be approached systematically. The most important items in the patient's history are whether the patient has symptoms and how long the imbalance has been developing. The rapidity of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, with the most rapid treatment occurring only in severely symptomatic cases. Overcorrection has dire consequences and must be approached in a careful and systematic fashion to prevent these devastating outcomes.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^116Pc3fn]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis and initial management of non-mild hyponatremia involves confirming a diagnosis of SIAD. Hypertonic saline is the agent of choice because it is immediately effective and titratable. It will reliably increase serum sodium irrespective of the underlying etiology, at least initially, as its osmolality (1026 mOsmol/L) exceeds that of maximal urine osmolality. However, it is not recommended to continue hypertonic saline beyond the resolution of acute severe symptoms due to the risk of serum sodium overcorrection, which can occur in around 20% of cases, unless the hyponatremia is documented to be of acute duration (< 24 hours) and rapid correction is tolerated. The risk of overcorrection is significantly higher if more than two boluses of 100 mL, or more than a single bolus of 150 mL, of 3% NaCl are given.

It has long been recognized that hypertonic saline may not have a long-term therapeutic effect in SIAD, as the administered sodium will eventually be excreted in the urine; however, its immediate efficacy can be lifesaving. Hypertonic saline is typically administered in a high-dependency setting or emergency resuscitation bay to allow for frequent monitoring. It is deemed safe to administer NaCl 3% through either a peripheral or central venous line, allowing for precise control of infusion rates and frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^113CmSbp]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). High credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and is often described in patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. In this report, we described both Castleman's disease and lymphoma coexisting in one patient with SIADH.

- **Case presentation**: A 70-year-old Chinese woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy presented with severe hyponatremia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Through a series of examinations, common causes such as pulmonary carcinoma were excluded. An abdominal mass detected by computed tomography was further investigated. Although the peripheral lymph node biopsy indicated Castleman's disease, the pathology of the abdominal lymph node revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After chemotherapy, hyponatremia was managed during a subsequent follow-up period.

- **Conclusion**: This patient presented a rare clinical condition of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion alongside Castleman's disease and lymphoma. Asymptomatic hyponatremia may persist for some time, suggesting that clinical physicians should pay attention to mild cases. We hypothesized that Castleman's disease could be a pre-lymphoma condition, as both have the potential to cause SIADH. The possibility of lymphoma, as well as Castleman's disease triggering SIADH, should be considered during re-biopsies.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1166gUQF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

- **Prevalence of hyponatremia**: A summary of key studies in adults reveals various findings. A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands, involving nearly 3,000 hospitalized patients with sodium measurements conducted over a 3-month period, found that 30% of patients had recorded sodium levels below 136 mmol/L during their admission. Similarly, a larger Danish prospective study of over 250,000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Additional retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, reporting rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L to be between 14.5% and 28.2%.

	- An outlying US study involving nearly 200,000 patients reported only 5.5% with hyponatremia; however, this study implemented stricter criteria, requiring two sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission. This approach did not account for those with transient initial hyponatremia, a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L.

	- Specific patient subgroups are at higher risk of moderate to profound hyponatremia, such as individuals following pituitary surgery. A meta-analysis showed that 5.6% of such cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. It is important to note that large database studies may not fully account for factors influencing the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies aim to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, the causes of pseudohyponatremia, such as increased serum lipids or protein, are not always accounted for.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^114hpGSU]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, particularly in terms of severity grading based on symptoms, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend classifying hyponatremia based on the symptomatic presentation:

- **Moderate**: Any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of moderate symptoms such as nausea without vomiting, confusion, or headache.

- **Severe**: Any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of severe symptoms such as vomiting, altered level of consciousness, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^113us68x]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. When hyponatremia is called acute severe, occurring over 4 to 6 days, there is usually no brain edema and symptoms are typically mild. For such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate of less than 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed.

The modalities of treatment for severe hyponatremia have primarily consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has demonstrated their efficacy in inducing a sustained water diuresis and correcting hyponatremia.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, specifically in the context of mildly symptomatic patients in chronic settings, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend initiating treatment directed at the underlying cause of hyponatremia.

### Evaluation and management of hyponatremia: An emerging role for vasopressin receptor antagonists [^113eqJq4]. Nature Clinical Practice Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists, collectively known as the 'vaptans', provide a new approach to the treatment of hyponatremia; therefore, an updated review of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia is particularly timely. After briefly defining hyponatremia and introducing its clinical aspects and complications, we present an approach to the diagnosis and evaluation of hyponatremia that is based primarily on the often-underused concept of free water clearance and, more specifically, the electrolyte-free water clearance.

We then review the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists in the management of hyponatremia from the standpoint of their pharmacology, their mechanism of action, and available efficacy data from clinical trials.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^115jvJ6G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

The principles of management of severe hyponatremia are fundamental in optimizing successful patient outcomes. Although principles addressing diagnosis are discussed in other works, this report focuses on the quantitative aspects of management.

The diagram underscores the importance of making an initial diagnosis and choosing the appropriate therapy within 2 to 3 hours of presentation. Subsequently, careful monitoring and therapeutic adjustments should be made.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111sjqQX]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), previously known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, is a disorder of sodium and water balance characterized by "inappropriate" (i.e. nonosmotic) retention of water. The first published cases of SIAD were two patients with bronchogenic carcinoma with hyponatremia, yet ongoing renal sodium loss, described by Schwartz et al. in 1957. Through careful observation of sodium and water intake and urine output, they attributed this syndrome to sustained, inappropriate secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The diagnostic criteria for SIAD, later published by the same authors in 1967, have remained remarkably current.

Over the decades since, the understanding of the prevalence, pathophysiology, and complications of SIAD has progressed. Substantial advances have been made in understanding the principles of management of acute severe hyponatremia, which have led to improvements in immediate mortality. A small but growing number of randomized trials have been conducted to inform management protocols. This review seeks to summarize the understanding of SIAD, examine the evidence base informing guidelines, and appraise important studies conducted more recently. We aim to synthesize the literature to derive practical and clinically relevant management principles to aid the understanding of clinicians and researchers and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.

While one of the key characteristics of SIAD is low serum osmolality, it is mor.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly concerning severely symptomatic patients, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend considering the repetition of therapeutic interventions. This should continue until a target increase of 5 mmol/L in serum sodium concentration is achieved.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^117PQvbh]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A systematic review of DDAVP in hyponatremia identified three different approaches. These include:

- **Proactive DDAVP**: Used in high-risk patients in combination with hypertonic saline before any correction. This approach is not widely recommended, as discussed in "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia".

- **Reactive DDAVP**: Administered in response to an actual or anticipated above-target plasma sodium (pNa) increase.

- **Rescue DDAVP**: Applied after pNa limits have been exceeded or upon the development of neurological symptoms.

Although there have been no prospective comparisons, a follow-up retrospective study concluded that a reactive strategy to maintain pNa within the target range, if overcorrection is deemed likely, was best supported by their data.

In summary, relowering pNa with electrolyte-free water and/or DDAVP to achieve a safe net 24-hour correction is an important tool that may be required during the often delicate management of hyponatremia to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.

### Normouricemia in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^117C6YeV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is seen in 40% to 60% of hospitalized acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and volume contraction are the most common causes. The serum uric acid level can be used to distinguish between these two causes of hyponatremia. Hypouricemia is the rule in SIADH, whereas hyperuricemia commonly accompanies volume contraction. This report presents an AIDS patient with SIADH and normouricemia secondary to pyrazinamide and ethambutol.

### Hyponatremia in the context of liver disease [^117HWaGN]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with liver disease and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and a reduced quality of life. In liver transplantation, the inclusion of hyponatremia in organ allocation scores has reduced waitlist mortality. Portal hypertension and the resulting lowering of the effective arterial blood volume are important pathogenetic factors, but in most patients with liver disease, hyponatremia is multifactorial. Treatment requires a multifaceted approach that tries to reduce electrolyte-free water intake, restore urinary dilution, and increase non-electrolyte solute excretion.

Albumin therapy for hyponatremia is a peculiarity of advanced liver disease. Its use appears to be increasing, while the vaptans are currently only given in selected cases. Osmotic demyelination is a special concern in patients with liver disease. Serial checks of serum sodium concentrations and urine volume monitoring are mandatory.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^111j3stj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and is often described in patients with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. In this report, we described both Castleman's disease and lymphoma coexisting in one patient with SIADH.

- **Case presentation**: A 70-year-old Chinese woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy had severe hyponatremia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Through a series of examinations, common causes such as pulmonary carcinoma were excluded. An abdominal mass was detected by computed tomography. Although the peripheral lymph node biopsy showed the pathological result as Castleman's disease, the pathology of the abdominal lymph node revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. After chemotherapy, the hyponatremia was treated during a period of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This patient presented with the rare clinical condition of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion alongside Castleman's disease and lymphoma. Asymptomatic hyponatremia may persist for some time, suggesting that clinical physicians should pay attention to the mild cases of hyponatremia. We also hypothesized that Castleman's disease is a condition of pre-lymphoma with both having the ability to cause SIADH. The possibility of lymphoma as well as Castleman's disease triggering the development of SIADH should also be taken into consideration for conducting re-biopsies.

### A copeptin-based classification of the osmoregulatory defects in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^1121QQXQ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most frequent electrolyte disorder, is caused predominantly by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). A comprehensive characterization of SIAD subtypes, defined by type of osmotic dysregulation, is lacking but may aid in predicting therapeutic success. Here, we analyzed serial measurements of serum osmolality and serum sodium, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), and plasma copeptin concentrations from 50 patients with hyponatremia who underwent hypertonic saline infusion. A close correlation between copeptin concentrations and serum osmolality existed in 68 healthy controls, with a mean osmotic threshold ± SD of 282 ± 4 mOsM/kg H2O. Furthermore, saline-induced changes in copeptin concentrations correlated with changes in AVP concentrations in controls and patients.

By using copeptin concentration as a surrogate measure of AVP concentration, patients with SIAD could be grouped according to the osmoregulatory defect:

- **Type A**: Ten percent of patients had grossly elevated copeptin concentrations independent of serum osmolality.
- **Type B**: Fourteen percent had copeptin concentrations that increased linearly with rising serum osmolality but had abnormally low osmotic thresholds.
- **Type C**: Forty-four percent had normal copeptin concentrations independent of osmolality.
- **Type D**: Twelve percent had suppressed copeptin concentrations independent of osmolality.

A novel SIAD subtype discovered in 20% of patients was characterized by a linear decrease in copeptin concentrations with increasing serum osmolality, known as type E or "barostat reset". In conclusion, a partial or complete loss of AVP osmoregulation was observed in these patients.

### Adenoma mimicking hyponatremia of SIAD [^113RmHoV]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder, with a prevalence as high as 20% in inpatient settings. It is classified based on volume status, urine sodium, and osmolality results. While this approach might help narrow down the differential diagnoses, it can sometimes overlook other potential diagnoses. In this case, we report refractory hyponatremia secondary to hypocortisolism due to a non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma. Interestingly, urine studies mimicked the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis but responded exclusively to hydrocortisone replacement. The hospital course was also complicated by hyponatremia-induced rhabdomyolysis, a rare complication of severe hyponatremia.

We discuss the role of anchoring heuristics and how they influence physicians' decisions, leading to possible diagnostic errors. One way to minimize the effect of anchoring bias on physicians is by increasing their cognitive awareness of such biases. Additionally, discussing complicated cases with all members of the medical team can highlight the clinician's thought processes, share uncertainty, and help broaden differential diagnoses.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and hyponatremia after spinal surgery [^111tY5vT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia caused by an inappropriately high level of antidiuretic hormone secretion after spinal surgery is an uncommon and self-limiting phenomenon that resolves within 2 or 3 weeks. During the early postoperative period, the patient's urine output and serum level of sodium should be monitored closely to prevent possible serious complications of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the hyponatremia and can range from mild headache, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting to convulsions, coma, and death. Treatment options include fluid restriction, oral intake of salt, and hypertonic saline. It is important that spine surgeons recognize this phenomenon early and treat it appropriately and conservatively to prevent possible serious complications.

### Approach to the patient: Hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity, including an increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline, prolonged hospital admissions, and etiology-specific increases in mortality.

In this approach to the patient, we review and compare recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by two case studies. Particular focus is placed on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present two illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to the management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis, and chronicity, along with monitoring during treatment, are critical components in managing severe hyponatremia. It is important to note that calculation errors can occur even with the most reliable formulas; therefore, frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is essential to ensure optimal recovery chances.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: Hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114mqwBU]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, particularly in severely symptomatic patients, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend limiting sodium correction to 8 mEq/L over 24 hours in patients with chronic hyponatremia who are at increased risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. In patients without risk factors, sodium correction should be limited to 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours to minimize the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: Significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Fetzima [^111j9jXB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hyponatremia**: Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs, including Fetzima. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs and SNRIs. Patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted can also be at greater risk. Fetzima should be discontinued in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

- **Sexual dysfunction**: Use of SNRIs, including Fetzima, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In male patients, SNRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SNRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Fetzima and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, as sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history, including the timing of symptoms, is essential.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^111nVwLA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed.

- **Management of hyponatremia**: In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline.
- **Management of hypernatremia**: In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid.
- **Correction in stable patients**: In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to classification, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend classifying hyponatremia based on the documented duration:

- **Situation: Guidance**:
	- **Acute**: < 48 hours
	- **Chronic**: ≥ 48 hours
	- **Chronic (presumably)**: If it cannot be classified unless there is clinical or anamnestic evidence to the contrary.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly concerning the management of overly rapid correction, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of an infusion of 10 mL/kg body weight of electrolyte-free water (such as glucose solutions) over 1 hour. This should be done in consultation with an expert and under strict monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Several studies have confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium level ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes indicate varied frequencies of osmotic demyelination. This variation depends on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. It is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely osmotic demyelination will be identified.

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium level ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day. A choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium level ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium level ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111wqz5y]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Symptoms of osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) typically present in a delayed manner, one or more days after overcorrection occurs. Clinically, patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia may initially improve as the plasma sodium (pNa) rises; however, with the onset of ODS, this may be followed by neurologic deterioration that is progressive and sometimes permanent. ODS symptoms include dysarthria, dysphagia, flaccid quadriparesis that later becomes spastic, horizontal gaze paralysis, "locked-in" syndrome, and coma. Clinical features associated with extrapontine myelinolysis include tremor, ataxia, parkinsonism, dystonia, and catatonia. The two largest contemporary case series at the time of writing, a report of 83 individuals with ODS in Sweden and 45 cases in the United States, reported in-hospital mortality rates of 7.2% and 13%, respectively. After 3 to 6 months of follow-up, around 60% of patients were functionally independent, while the remainder of survivors had persistent functional limitations.

Risk factors for ODS, besides an extremely low initial sodium concentration (e.g. 12 mmol/L in 24 hours), include hypokalemia, alcohol abuse, malnutrition, and advanced liver disease. These factors may impair the ability of glial cells to import or resynthesize organic osmolytes. Reduced endothelial cell membrane concentration of Na-K-ATPase with hypokalemia may also impair the transport of electrolytes, further predisposing glial cells to injury associated with the rapid rise in serum sodium concentration.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice; however, management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with this syndrome are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings. Specifically, it aimed to identify which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and the use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1,524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1,034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, verified through measurement of relevant laboratory parameters, was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a

### Consequences of inadequate management of hyponatremia [^1126XXxi]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Dilutional hyponatremia is a commonly observed disorder in hospitalized patients. It represents an excess of water in relation to prevailing sodium stores and is most often associated with a high plasma level of arginine vasopressin, including that found in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia may be classified as either acute or chronic depending on the rate of decline of serum sodium concentration, and can lead to a wide range of deleterious changes involving almost all body systems. Serious complications of dilutional hyponatremia most frequently involve the central nervous system.

In fact, acute severe hyponatremia is potentially life-threatening and must be treated promptly and aggressively. Chronic hyponatremia often develops in patients with nonrenal diseases and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure, hyponatremia is linked to a poor prognosis and increased length of hospital stay.

Prompt recognition and optimal management of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients may reduce in-hospital mortality and symptom severity, allow for less intensive hospital care, decrease the duration of hospitalization and associated costs, and improve the treatment of underlying comorbid conditions and patients' quality of life. The proper treatment of dilutional hyponatremia, especially when chronic, must avoid increasing serum sodium too rapidly, which can lead to permanent or fatal neurologic sequelae. The treatment of hyponatremia may be facilitated by emerging therapies.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death due to osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder.

In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations, defining strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years following the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts (including all of the original panel members) convened to update the previous recommendations for the optimal management of this disorder.

The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia. These are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent evidence available.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^116WdLtD]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

In chronic hyponatremia of a duration greater than 48 hours, the brain adapts to a lower plasma sodium (pNa) level, with a corresponding reduction in brain tissue osmolality due to an influx of water and export of osmolytes. Chronic hyponatremia was previously considered to be "asymptomatic". However, it is now recognized that while severe symptoms may be absent, it can still be associated with cognitive impairment, falls, fractures, and vulnerability to acute exacerbations of hyponatremia. Clinical features associated with chronic hyponatremia may include nausea, vertigo, confusion, muscle cramps, weakness, headache, restlessness, dysarthria, and hyporeflexia.

There is preclinical evidence suggesting that cellular function, such as enzymatic activity, is compromised when intracellular osmolality is reduced. Furthermore, the intracellular organic osmolytes that become depleted in chronic hyponatremia can play a vital role in neurotransmission and protein synthesis, which may explain the clinical sequelae of chronic hyponatremia.

The evidence linking clinical symptoms to chronic hyponatremia is largely observational, and no prospective interventional study conclusively demonstrates that correction of chronic hyponatremia, which is commonly biochemically mild, can improve these clinical features. The literature is potentially further confounded by the fact that clinical features attributable to hyponatremia are nonspecific and have a relatively high background prevalence in the normonatremic population. Observational studies can never fully adjust for confounding factors.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: Expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can lead to severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including the identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### EffexorXR [^117WEY6s]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs, including Effexor XR. In many cases, hyponatremia appears to result from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs. Additionally, patients taking diuretics or those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider discontinuation of Effexor XR in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and institute appropriate medical intervention.

Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death.

### Vasopressin antagonists: Role in the management of hyponatremia [^111PjRuv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. Serum osmolality and sodium concentration [Na+] are regulated by thirst, the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), and renal water and sodium handling. Hyponatremia is frequently caused by dysregulation of AVP, which accompanies disorders of water retention, such as congestive heart failure (CHF) and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Clinical trials with AVP receptor antagonists have confirmed the important role of AVP in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia and suggest these agents are efficacious in treating hyponatremia associated with SIADH, cirrhosis, and CHF. Acting directly at AVP receptors in the renal tubules, these agents promote aquaresis — the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water — in patients with hyponatremia. In clinical trials, AVP receptor antagonists have been shown to increase the serum [Na+] and urine output while decreasing urine osmolality.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^1156N96o]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, especially concerning the management of mildly symptomatic patients in an acute setting, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend ensuring that the serum sodium concentration is measured using the same technique as the previous measurement. It is also critical to verify that no administrative errors occurred in sample handling.

### Neurological impact of vasopressin dysregulation and hyponatremia [^112tGBbc]. Annals of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently associated with neurological disease, neurosurgical procedures, and the use of psychoactive drugs. Arginine vasopressin (AVP), or antidiuretic hormone, is the principal physiological regulator of water and electrolyte balance. Disruption of the normal AVP response to osmotic stimuli is a common cause of dilutional hyponatremia in neurological disorders. The hyponatremia-induced shift in water from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment can lead to cerebral edema and serious neurological complications, especially if the decrease in serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) is large or rapid. Overly rapid correction of the serum [Na+] may lead to osmotic demyelination and irreversible brain injury.

Fluid restriction is considered first-line treatment, yet the pharmacological agents currently used in the treatment of hyponatremia are limited by inconsistent response and adverse side effects. AVP receptor antagonists represent a new approach to the treatment of hyponatremia by blocking tubular reabsorption of water. They do this by binding to V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in aquaresis. Initial clinical experience with AVP receptor antagonists for hyponatremia has shown that these agents augment free water clearance, decrease urine osmolality, and correct serum [Na+] and serum osmolality. Controlled clinical trials now underway will help elucidate the role of AVP receptor antagonism in the treatment of hyponatremia.

### "Bowel prep hyponatremia" - a state of acute water intoxication facilitated by low dietary solute intake: case report and literature review [^115j5e1F]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal water excretion is largely guided by AVP release, with plasma osmolality being its main determinant. Several non-osmotic stimuli, such as nausea and anxiety, also exist. In a case series involving 40 patients, raised AVP concentration after bowel cleansing but prior to endoscopy was found in 25% of cases. Therefore, hyponatremia in this context has been traditionally regarded as a mere form of excessive AVP release.

The importance of dietary solute intake is a lesser-known facet of renal water excretion. A normal kidney can excrete urine with a concentration ranging from 50 mOsm/kg to 1200 mOsm/kg. Although the diluting capacity decreases with age, it generally allows for a broad range of water intake without the development of dilutional hyponatremia. Up to 20 liters of water may be ingested over a 24-hour period before serum sodium concentration begins to fall. However, this assumes the consumption of a normal diet containing adequate salt and protein. The average Western diet yields approximately 800 mOsm of solutes per day, mainly derived from urea generation through protein metabolism, in addition to dietary electrolytes, primarily sodium and potassium.

### Short-term efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonists for treatment of hyponatremia [^1114eEMA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

We performed a meta-analysis to systematically measure the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonists (VRAs) tested in randomized controlled trials for the treatment of hyponatremia.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and scientific abstracts were searched without language restriction. Two authors independently screened citations and extracted data on patient characteristics, quality of reports, and efficacy and safety endpoints.

- **Results**: Eleven trials were identified (1094 patients). By meta-analysis, VRAs achieved a net increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)](serum)) relative to placebo of 3.3 mEq/L at day 1 (95% confidence interval, 2.7–3.8), and 4.2 mEq/L at day 2 (95% CI, 3.6–4.8), persisting at days 3–5. Larger net increases in [Na(+)](serum) at days 1–4 were observed in euvolemic hyponatremia and with higher doses. VRAs induced a net increase in effective water clearance relative to placebo of 1244 mL at day 1 (95% CI, 920–1567), persisting at days 2 and 4. VRAs were associated with odds ratios of 3.0 for overly rapid correction of [Na(+)](serum) (P < 0.001), 7.8 for the development of hypernatremia (P < 0.001), 3.3 for thirst development (P < 0.001), and 2.2 for postural hypotension (P = 0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Short-term use of VRAs in treating hyponatremia was successful at raising [Na(+)](serum). Additional experience is required to guide their optimal use and minimize safety concerns.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^117PhQQY]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Another alternative therapy for acute severe hyponatremia that is not in wide use, and that we do not recommend, is the use of more highly concentrated sodium chloride (e.g. 23.4% or 29.2% NaCl) via central venous access. This therapy has been investigated as an alternative treatment to mannitol to raise plasma tonicity in traumatic brain injury to reduce cerebral herniation. There are no quality data in hyponatremia to support its use, especially when considering the expected higher risks of overcorrection and the potential adverse sequelae of extravasation with these formulations.

Treating the potentially reversible neurotoxicity of severe hyponatremia may help clarify its contribution to clinical symptomatology (e.g. altered conscious state) in sick patients with multiple potential causes for their symptoms. If symptoms do not improve with the modest pNa increments suggested earlier, alternative or additional causes should be sought.

- **Confirming a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis**: Review of history, medications, and clinical examination can all assist in determining the cause of hyponatremia (see Fig. 8). There are many potential causes of hyponatremia, and SIAD is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Evaluation of urine and serum osmolality and sodium concentrations are some of the most useful investigations in establishing whether the diagnostic criteria for SIAD are met, alongside clinical assessment of volume status (see Table 1).

Measurement of serum osmolality aids in excluding nonhypotonic causes of hyponatremia, such as pseudohyponatremia.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^114dm6hA]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

While there is some preclinical evidence that sex steroids may modulate the secretion of AVP, there is no consistent effect of sex on hyponatremia rates, with some studies reporting a slight male predominance, some a female predominance, and others no effect.

In population-based studies, SIAD is the most common attributed cause of hyponatremia, accounting for 35% to 40% of cases. However, most retrospective studies to determine the etiology of hyponatremia are limited by an incomplete diagnostic workup, with one multicenter registry finding that less than 50% of 3,087 patients with hyponatremia had all appropriate investigations performed. A prospective study of 121 consecutive inpatients with pNa less than 130 mmol/L at a single hospital in Germany, who were assessed by a senior endocrinologist according to a rigorous diagnostic protocol, determined that 35% had SIAD, 32% hypovolemia, 20% hypervolemia (heart failure, cirrhosis, angioedema), 7% thiazide-induced hyponatremia, 4% primary polydipsia, and 2% adrenal insufficiency. Another prospective study at a tertiary neurosurgical referral center in Ireland of 1,323 patients admitted with pNa less than or equal to 130 mmol/L initially classified 573 (43.4%) of these patients as having SIAD, though 22 of these (3.8%) were subsequently reclassified to adrenal insufficiency after completing further investigation.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with the rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalization, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended, and the success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains, including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements following a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to the classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, and doses.

### Complications and management of hyponatremia [^113LDB46]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia causes significant morbidity, mortality, and disability. This review considers the literature of the past 18 months to improve understanding of these complications and to identify therapeutic strategies to prevent them.

- **Recent findings**: Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4–6 mEq/l increase in serum sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination, correction should not exceed 8 mEq/l/day. In high-risk patients, correction should not exceed 4–6 mEq/l/day. Inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures, but it is not known if the correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

- **Summary**: Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease.

### Vasopressin excess and hyponatremia [^112HmCZY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder that frequently is overlooked and undertreated. Although the pathophysiological process of hyponatremia is complex, arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a common etiologic factor. Excess AVP release by osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli, or both, can lead to sodium and water imbalance. Conventional treatment options for hyponatremia, including water restriction and administration of sodium chloride with or without loop diuretics, do not directly address the underlying water retention induced by excess AVP in many cases.

Clinical trials have shown that AVP-receptor antagonists, including lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan, produce aquaresis — the electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water — to correct serum sodium concentration. We review results from recent clinical trials involving AVP-receptor antagonists in the treatment of hyponatremia associated with AVP excess.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^113VBoKn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity, such as salt depletion, is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in the diagnosis of SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values.

- **Low levels of uric acid**: More often seen in SIADH (70%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, this despite dilution.

- **Total CO2 in hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism**: Usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH, despite low urea and uric acid levels.

- **Urine biology**: Can also be helpful in diagnosis of SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; > 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0.5% in 70% of cases) reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare.

- **Measurement of urine osmolality**: Useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat. It could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy because patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.

### Non-functioning pituitary adenomas: Indications for pituitary surgery and post-surgical management [^114fEmSn]. Pituitary (2019). Low credibility.

Transient syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) may occur within the first 3–7 days postoperatively, with an incidence ranging from 4% to 20%. Transient SIADH is due to iatrogenic manipulation of the posterior pituitary gland, resulting in excessive antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release. In rare cases, it may result in severe, life-threatening, acute hyponatremia.

Treatment strategies include fluid restriction, hypertonic saline administration, or vasopressin two receptor antagonist treatment. It is important to avoid excessive administration of intravenous fluids in the postoperative period, and prophylactic fluid restriction is recommended by some during the first 10 days after surgery to reduce SIADH frequency or minimize the degree of hyponatremia due to SIADH.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", which involves early empirical coadministration of both desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection often results from a spontaneous water diuresis following the resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach is that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (either as a bolus or infusion), without having to manage variable outputs.

However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolongation of hyponatremia symptoms — especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (e.g. paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect, as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue.

The only data for this proactive approach originate from an uncontrolled observational study involving 24 patients with plasma sodium (pNa) less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics. These patients were treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline, titrated to achieve a pNa increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium of 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours. Two patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and two patients had an above-target increase.

### Association of endocrine conditions with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: A comprehensive review [^111NrWfP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

- **Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and TCMP**: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a form of euvolemic, hypo-osmolar hyponatremia, characterized by a negative free water clearance with high urine osmolality and low plasma osmolality in the absence of renal, adrenal, and thyroid insufficiency. The causes of SIADH can include malignancy (small-cell lung cancer, lymphoma), central nervous system-related causes (infections, mass, trauma, bleed), iatrogenic (psychoactive drugs, chemotherapy), pulmonary disorders, and, rarely, genetic causes.

	- The clinical presentation and morbidity and mortality associated with SIADH are related to the severity, rapidity of onset, and duration of hyponatremia. Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are usually limited to the central nervous system and typically occur at sodium levels < 125 mEq/L. Cardiac manifestations in hyponatremia are not common, but recently, TCMP has been described in patients with severe hyponatremia in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, adrenal insufficiency, thyroid dysfunction, and SIADH.

	- Hyponatremia has been shown to exist in 32.1% of cases of TCMP. However, many of the cases demonstrating a relationship between hyponatremia and TCMP had confounding factors present such as hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and seizures. Table 5 summarizes all the cases with confirmed diagnoses of SIADH associated with TCMP.

- **Hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)**: Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH have been observed in patients treated with linezolid. In reported cases, the signs and symptoms included confusion, somnolence, generalized weakness, and in severe cases, led to respiratory failure and even death. Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly, patients taking diuretics, and other patients at risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH while taking Zyvox. If signs and symptoms of hyponatremia and/or SIADH occur, discontinue Zyvox and institute appropriate supportive measures.

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zyvox for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 5 mL of the 100 mg/5 mL oral suspension contains 20 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Zyvox for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Zyvox for oral suspension. The other Zyvox formulations do not contain phenylalanine.

- **Development of drug-resistant bacteria**: Prescribing Zyvox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1112hMeE]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A lower initial dose of tolvaptan, 7.5 mg, has become more widely prescribed in recent years as there is some evidence of lower overcorrection risk. In two small trials (each ≤ 12 mmol/L in 24 hours), instances of overcorrection were seen with the 7.5-mg dose; however, with the standard 15-mg dose, 13% to 40% of patients experienced overcorrection. The risk is not completely eliminated, as even an ultra-low dose of 3.75 mg did not prevent overcorrection greater than 10 mmol/L in 24 hours in a study of patients with acute postneurosurgical hyponatremia, with overcorrection rates above 30% for both the 3.75 and 7.5 mg doses in this acute cohort.

Notably, these studies were not designed to determine the degree to which tolvaptan use, rather than autocorrection following resolution of reversible stimuli to AVP secretion, contributed to the overly rapid rise in plasma sodium (pNa), as there was no placebo control group. The ultra-low dose of 3.75 mg is often impractical and inaccurate, as it requires quartering a triangular tablet with formulations in many markets. An alternative approach to achieve an even lower overall dose is to administer 7.5 mg every second day; however, there are no published data to support this, and this strategy does not reduce the risk of overcorrection with the initial dose. The potential for overcorrection on initiation means that, in our experience, tolvaptan is best prescribed as single doses, with ongoing therapy reviewed daily.
