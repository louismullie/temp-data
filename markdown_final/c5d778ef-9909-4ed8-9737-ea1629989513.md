## Question

A previously healthy 39-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a slowly enlarging, painless neck mass that she first noticed 3 months ago. During this period, she has also experienced intermittent palpitations, hair loss, and a weight loss of 4.5 kg (10 lb). There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She appears anxious and fidgety. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 101/min and irregular, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a firm, nontender left anterior cervical nodule that moves with swallowing. Laboratory studies show:\\nTSH 0.4 μU/mL\\nT4 13.2 μg/dL\\nT3 196 ng/dL\\nUltrasonography confirms the presence of a 3-cm solid left thyroid nodule. A thyroid 123I radionuclide scintigraphy scan shows increased uptake in a nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland with suppression of the remainder of the thyroid tissue. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?'
A. Thyroid peroxidase autoantibody-mediated destruction of thyroid tissue
B. Gain-of-function mutations of the TSH receptor
C. Thyroglobulin antibody production
D. Activation of oncogenes promoting cell division

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which mechanism best explains a solitary hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule with overt hyperthyroidism and suppressed extranodular uptake on scintigraphy, and to choose among autoimmune destruction, TSH receptor gain-of-function, thyroglobulin antibodies, and oncogene activation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical phenotype and whether this fits toxic adenoma. Then, I should verify the scintigraphic pattern and what it implies about autonomy. Next, I will review the molecular pathophysiology of autonomous nodules. After that, I need to check each answer option against the established mechanisms. Finally, I will confirm the most likely mechanism and briefly consider management implications to ensure internal consistency.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. A 39-year-old woman with a solitary thyroid nodule, overt hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH, elevated free T4/T3), and adrenergic symptoms (palpitations, anxiety, weight loss) is classic for a toxic adenoma, i.e., an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule, which is a common cause of hyperthyroidism after Graves' disease and typically presents with a single "hot" nodule on scintigraphy with suppression of the surrounding gland [^113EbeYC].

> Wait, let me verify the scintigraphic pattern because that is pivotal. The 123I scan showing increased uptake in the nodule with suppressed uptake in the rest of the thyroid is the hallmark of autonomous function; the hyperfunctioning nodule produces excess hormone, suppresses TSH, and thereby turns off the extranodular thyroid tissue, which is exactly what we see here [^113EbeYC].

> I will now examine the molecular mechanism. Autonomous thyroid nodules harbor somatic gain-of-function mutations in the TSH receptor signaling pathway, most commonly in the TSH receptor gene itself, leading to constitutive cAMP signaling, unchecked follicular cell proliferation, and unregulated thyroid hormone synthesis independent of pituitary TSH; this mechanistically explains the suppressed TSH and the focal "hot" uptake with peripheral suppression on scintigraphy [^113tfUC1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review each option against this framework. Option A, thyroid peroxidase autoantibody–mediated destruction, corresponds to autoimmune thyroiditis, which causes hypothyroidism or transient thyrotoxicosis from gland destruction, not a focal autonomous hot nodule; that pattern does not fit here, so I should exclude it. Option B, gain-of-function mutations of the TSH receptor, aligns perfectly with the pathophysiology of toxic adenoma and the scintigraphic pattern, so this is highly consistent [^113tfUC1]. Option C, thyroglobulin antibody production, is a marker of autoimmune thyroid disease and does not confer autonomous hormone secretion or a hot nodule phenotype, so it does not explain the findings [^111D42yf] [^1118su16]. Option D, activation of oncogenes promoting cell division, is too nonspecific; while autonomous nodules do proliferate, the defining driver in toxic adenoma is constitutive TSH receptor signaling rather than a generic oncogene activation, so this is less precise than option B for the mechanism at hand [^113tfUC1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if this could be Graves' disease with a dominant nodule, but I should double-check that. Graves' disease typically shows diffuse increased uptake on scintigraphy unless there are coexisting nodules, and the uptake pattern here is focal with suppression of the remainder of the gland, which is not the diffuse Graves' pattern; thus, the imaging argues against Graves' as the primary mechanism in this case [^113EbeYC] [^111VhZEC].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize. The combination of a solitary nodule, overt hyperthyroidism with suppressed TSH, and a scintigraphic hot nodule with extranodular suppression is best explained by a somatic gain-of-function mutation in the TSH receptor signaling pathway driving autonomous hormone production and proliferation, i.e., option B [^113tfUC1] [^113EbeYC].

> Finally, I should confirm that this mechanistic choice is clinically coherent with management implications. Toxic adenomas are commonly treated with radioactive iodine ablation or surgery, reflecting their autonomous function and the utility of 131I to target the hyperfunctioning tissue; that therapeutic context further supports the TSH receptor gain-of-function mechanism as the underlying cause in this presentation [^113tfUC1] [^111Q7npZ].

---

The most likely mechanism is **gain-of-function mutations of the TSH receptor** [^113tfUC1] [^113EbeYC], which cause autonomous hormone production, a "hot" nodule on scintigraphy, and suppression of the surrounding thyroid tissue [^1118su16]. This explains the patient's hyperthyroid symptoms, suppressed TSH, and focal uptake on imaging [^111Q7npZ].

---

## Clinical features and laboratory findings

The patient presents with classic features of **hyperthyroidism**, including:

- **Palpitations**: Irregular pulse of 101/min, indicating atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia [^111Q7npZ].
- **Weight loss**: 4.5 kg (10 lb) over 3 months [^111Q7npZ].
- **Hair loss**: Common in hyperthyroidism [^115uZE5W].
- **Anxiety and fidgetiness**: Suggesting increased sympathetic activity [^111Q7npZ].

Laboratory studies show **suppressed TSH** with elevated free T4 and T3, confirming hyperthyroidism [^111Q7npZ].

---

## Imaging findings

Ultrasound reveals a **3-cm solid left thyroid nodule**, and thyroid scintigraphy shows **increased uptake in the left lobe nodule with suppression of the remainder of the thyroid gland**, a classic "hot" nodule pattern [^113EbeYC].

---

## Pathophysiology of toxic thyroid adenoma

Toxic thyroid adenomas arise from **somatic gain-of-function mutations** in the TSH receptor gene or G-protein signaling pathways, leading to:

- **Autonomous hormone production**: The mutated TSH receptor signals independently of TSH, causing continuous thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion [^113tfUC1].
- **Suppression of surrounding tissue**: Elevated thyroid hormone levels suppress TSH secretion, leading to atrophy and decreased function of surrounding thyroid tissue [^113EbeYC].
- **Clinical hyperthyroidism**: Persistent hormone overproduction results in hyperthyroid symptoms, including palpitations, weight loss, and anxiety [^111Q7npZ].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other causes of hyperthyroidism include **Graves' disease** — diffuse autoimmune hyperthyroidism with diffuse uptake on scintigraphy and positive TSH receptor antibodies [^113EbeYC] — and **toxic multinodular goiter**, in which multiple nodules show increased uptake with suppression of surrounding tissue [^113EbeYC]. Thyroiditis causes transient hyperthyroidism with low uptake on scintigraphy [^113GwwCb]. Given the solitary "hot" nodule with suppression of surrounding tissue, a toxic thyroid adenoma is most likely [^113EbeYC].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results are most consistent with a **toxic thyroid adenoma** due to **gain-of-function mutations of the TSH receptor** [^113tfUC1]. This mutation causes autonomous hormone production, leading to hyperthyroidism and suppression of surrounding thyroid tissue [^113tfUC1].

### Hyperthyroidism: a review [^111Q7npZ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Overt hyperthyroidism, defined as suppressed thyrotropin (previously thyroid-stimulating hormone) and high concentration of triiodothyronine (T3) and/or free thyroxine (FT4), affects approximately 0.2% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, defined as low concentrations of thyrotropin and normal concentrations of T3 and FT4, affects approximately 0.7% to 1.4% of people worldwide. Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, osteoporosis, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It may lead to unintentional weight loss and is associated with increased mortality.

Observations

The most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, with a global prevalence of 2% in women and 0.5% in men. Other causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis include toxic nodules and the thyrotoxic phase of thyroiditis. Common symptoms of thyrotoxicosis include anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, unintentional weight loss, diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Patients with Graves disease may have a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, stare, or exophthalmos on examination. Patients with toxic nodules (ie, in which thyroid nodules develop autonomous function) may have symptoms from local compression of structures in the neck by the thyroid gland, such as dysphagia, orthopnea, or voice changes. Etiology can typically be established based on clinical presentation, thyroid function tests, and thyrotropin-receptor antibody status. Thyroid scintigraphy is recommended if thyroid nodules are present or the etiology is unclear. Thyrotoxicosis from thyroiditis may be observed if symptomatic or treated with supportive care. Treatment options for overt hyperthyroidism from autonomous thyroid nodules or Graves disease include antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients at highest risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, such as those older than 65 years or with persistent serum thyrotropin level less than 0.1 mIU/L.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyperthyroidism affects 2.5% of adults worldwide and is associated with osteoporosis, heart disease, and increased mortality. First-line treatments are antithyroid drugs, thyroid surgery, and radioactive iodine treatment. Treatment choices should be individualized and patient centered.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with unknown hyperthyroidism during nonthyroidal surgery-a case report and literature review [^112D3Wmj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our case indicates that a comprehensive preoperative history collection is extremely crucial for underdiagnosed patients, especially for elective surgery. Thyroid diseases can be discovered with a more careful preoperative assessment and TS probably prevented. In reported cases listed in Tables 3, 61% (11/18) patients experienced TS due to unrecognized underlying hyperthyroidism preoperatively. The signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism can be very subtle to clinically overt. Patients with hyperthyroidism commonly experience palpitations, fatigue, tremor, anxiety, disturbed sleep, weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating, tachycardia, and fever. Thyroid nodules or a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, sometimes with a bruit, may be palpable. Up to 25% of patients with Graves' disease present with signs of ophthalmopathy. Other rare extrathyroidal Graves' disease manifestations include pretibial myxedema and acropachy. When patients present with multiple symptoms and signs as mentioned above, hyperthyroidism should be considered as a potential diagnosis. Symptoms that are often overlooked include abdominal discomfort, weight changes, and fatigue. Of note, some non-thyroid diseases and drugs can influence thyroid hormone levels, including gestational trophoblastic disease, McCune-Albright syndrome, teratoma (struma ovarii), TSH-producing pituitary adenomas, and amiodarone. Patients with these diseases have an increased likelihood to develop hyperthyroidism and TS.

### Resistance to thyroid hormone in a patient with coexisting Graves' disease [^112z9J9f]. Thyroid (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder in which an abnormality in the binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor results in end-organ insensitivity to the actions of thyroid hormones. This disorder is sometimes misdiagnosed as Graves' disease due to the presence of a goiter with high Iodine-123 thyroid uptake and high levels of total and free thyroid hormones. Additionally, some patients with RTH may experience palpitations or tachycardia. There is a previous report of a patient with pituitary RTH and concurrent Graves' disease.

Summary

We describe a patient who was found to have a goiter with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism by his primary care physician. Work-up revealed a low thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), high thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, high Iodine-123 thyroid uptake, as well as increased homogenous activity in both thyroid glands on nuclear scan and a suppressed TSH. Diagnosis of Graves' disease was made, and the patient underwent radioactive ablation of the thyroid gland. The patient subsequently developed hypothyroidism and required a much higher dose of levothyroxine than his weight-based estimate of a full replacement dose to maintain euthyroidism. On 325 micog of daily levothyroxine the patient was clinically euthyroid and had a normal TSH although his levels of T3 and T4 were high. Work-up revealed a mutation in the thyroid hormone beta-receptor gene, consistent with diagnosis of RTH.

Conclusions

RTH is often misdiagnosed as Graves' disease. However, these disorders can coexist, and the concurrent presence of both disorders in a patient can present diagnostic challenges. A previous report of a patient with Graves' disease associated with RTH was published before gene sequencing could be used to confirm diagnosis of RTH. We present a patient with Graves' disease and concurrent RTH that was confirmed by gene sequencing, showing a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene.

### Hot and cold: coexistent Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a patient with schmidt's syndrome [^111BfpyK]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 37-year-old housewife presented with generalised fatigue, palpitations and weight loss over the past 3months. Physical examination revealed signs of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function tests confirmed the presence of thyrotoxicosis. Pertechnetate radionuclide imaging of the thyroid showed diffusely increased radiotracer uptake consistent with Graves' disease and a cold nodule in the right lobe. Needle aspiration from the nodule yielded evidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The patient also tested strongly positive for antithyroid peroxidase antibodies. Simultaneous laboratory evaluation revealed primary adrenal failure and probable pernicious anaemia, thus producing a diagnosis of Schmidt's syndrome. The patient was initiated on appropriate medical therapy for endocrinopathy. Graves' disease was treated with radioablation.

### Graves' disease and papillary thyroid carcinoma: case report and literature review of a single academic center [^1155u3xr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

A casual correlation between GD and PTC continues to be controversial. In our study we present a case of GD that proved challenging due to a combination of features. GD presented as minimally symptomatic in a young male in which the only symptom was weight loss, in part intentional, without palpitations, tremors, or gastrointestinal symptoms, normal vitals signs and no goiter. One of the unusual features was the difficultly in treating the high levels of thyroid hormones as patient did not adequately respond to high doses of MMI (60 mg daily for 2 months). Poor compliance to treatment was initially considered however the patient was a family member of a physician who was able to confirm patient was taking medication as prescribed. There are 2 case reports about GD resistant to MMI, in one of them the patient was on 150 mg of MMI with no response and only responded to iodine, steroids and lithium. Another case report described a patient with GD resistant to MMI (requiring 150 mg daily), in this case serum and intrathyroidal MMI concentrations were measured and intrathyroidal MMI concentration was low. The underlying mechanisms of the resistance remain unclear. Hypotheses considered in these cases include malabsorption or liver disease affecting pharmacokinetics of MMI, large thyroid glands impairing uptake, or manifesting greater metabolism and excretion of MMI.

The other unusual finding was that the diagnosis of PTC escaped detection on US with appearance initially as a subacute thyroiditis then as a spongiform nodule and the thyroid uptake and scan did not show a cold area in the respective location, possibly confounded by the superimposed increased uptake due to GD. As the patient was hyperthyroid and the imaging was reassuring, fine needle biopsy was not pursued. Incidental thyroid cancer has also been reported in prior retrospective studies. Keskin et al. reported 8% incidental thyroid cancer cases in patients with GD. The presence of nodules increases the chance of finding cancer, a metanalysis revealed that the presence of at least one nodule is associated with a fivefold increase in thyroid cancer risk. The most common cancer reported in GD is PTC and microcarcinomas are particularly common.

### A case of masked toxic adenoma in a patient with non-thyroidal illness [^113tfUC1]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

A toxic nodule is a solitary, autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. The pathogenesis includes mutations in the TSH receptor leading to enhanced stimulation of thyroid follicular cell proliferation and function. A thyroid nodule generally large enough to be palpable is present with suppressed TSH level, as in the present case. Patients initially have subclinical hyperthyroidism but when the adenoma grows to a significant size, frank hyperthyroidism develops, and elevated serum thyroid hormone levels accompany this condition. Thyrotoxicosis is usually mild. A thyroid nodule appears on ultrasonography as a hypo-echogenic nodule with an atrophic thyroid gland. A thyroid scan is a definitive diagnostic test, demonstrating increased radioiodine uptake in the hyperfunctioning nodule and decreased uptake in the remaining gland. Radio-iodine ablation is usually the treatment of choice. Surgical resection of the adenoma or lobectomy to preserve thyroid function is another treatment option.

4.1 Thyroid Disorder Cases

Amongst the seven cases of Graves disease, six patients were women and the median age at onset was 44 years old (IQR = 10.5 years old, range, 33–58 years old). Four patients had a pituitary adenoma, two had an adrenal adenoma and one had unilateral adrenal hyperplasia. They all presented with classical signs and symptoms of this condition such as weight loss, tachycardia, goitre and/or orbitopathy. The median time to onset was 5 months (IQR = 3.55 months, range 2–27 months). The majority (5/7) were not on steroids at the onset of Graves disease, and six required additional treatment with antithyroid medications.

Of the 34 cases of thyroiditis, 30 patients were women and the median age at onset was 35.5 years old (IQR = 15.5 years old, range 16–80 years old). Twenty‐three patients had a pituitary adenoma, eight had an adrenal nodule and three had adrenal hyperplasia. Twenty patients presented with silent thyroiditis, 11 patients presented with Hashimoto thyroiditis and three patients presented with De Quervain (subacute) thyroiditis with fever, neck pain and malaise. Time to onset ranged from 1 to 9 months, with a median of 4.85 months (IQR = 3 months). Twenty‐three patients were on steroids at the time of onset, and all patients with De Quervain thyroiditis (n = 3) and most patients with transient thyrotoxicosis (n = 13) were managed with increased corticosteroid doses.

Thyroid scintigraphy patterns — A thyroid scan should be obtained if the clinical presentation suggests a TA or TMNG. The pattern of RAIU in GD is diffuse unless coexistent nodules or fibrosis is present. The pattern of uptake in a patient with a single TA generally shows focal uptake in the adenoma with suppressed uptake in the surrounding and contralateral thyroid tissue. The image in TMNG demonstrates multiple areas of focal increased and suppressed uptake.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^111VhZEC]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Determination of etiology — radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) and scan use: Recommendation 1 states that a radioactive iodine uptake should be performed when the clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis is not diagnostic of Graves' disease (GD), and a thyroid scan should be added in the presence of thyroid nodularity; when diagnosis is uncertain, RAIU is indicated (except during pregnancy) to distinguish causes, being usually elevated in GD and normal or high in toxic nodular goiter unless there has been recent iodine exposure, with a diffuse RAIU pattern in GD and, in a single TA, focal uptake in the adenoma with suppressed uptake in surrounding and contralateral thyroid tissue; conversely, when a patient has a symmetrically enlarged thyroid, recent onset of ophthalmopathy, and moderate to severe hyperthyroidism, the likelihood of GD makes further etiologic evaluation unnecessary.

### Does this patient with palpitations have a cardiac arrhythmia? [^115K1Cdr]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Many patients have palpitations and seek advice from general practitioners. Differentiating benign causes from those resulting from clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia can be challenging and the clinical examination may aid in this process.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and cardiac testing for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with palpitations. Data Source, Study Selection, and

Data Extraction

MEDLINE (1950 to August 25, 2009) and EMBASE (1947 to August 2009) searches of English-language articles that compared clinical features and diagnostic tests in patients with palpitations with a reference standard for cardiac arrhythmia. Of the 277 studies identified by the search strategy, 7 studies were used for accuracy analysis and 16 studies for diagnostic yield analysis. Two authors independently reviewed articles for study data and quality and a third author resolved disagreements.

Data Synthesis

Most data were obtained from single studies with small sample sizes. A known history of cardiac disease (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–3.11), having palpitations affected by sleeping (LR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33–3.94), or while the patient is at work (LR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19–3.96) slightly increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. A known history of panic disorder (LR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.01) or having palpitations lasting less than 5 minutes (LR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.63) makes the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia slightly less likely. The presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck (LR, 177; 95% CI, 25–1251) or visible neck pulsations (LR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.25–5.78) in association with palpitations increases the likelihood of a specific type of arrhythmia (atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia). The absence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck makes detecting the same arrhythmia less likely (LR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03–0.19). No other features significantly alter the probability of clinically significant arrhythmia. Diagnostic tests for prolonged periods of electrocardiographic monitoring vary in their yield depending on the modality used, duration of monitoring, and occurrence of typical symptoms during monitoring. Loop monitors have the highest diagnostic yield (34%-84%) for identifying an arrhythmia.

Conclusions

While the presence of a regular rapid-pounding sensation in the neck or visible neck pulsations associated with palpitations makes the diagnosis of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia likely, the reviewed studies suggest that the clinical examination is not sufficiently accurate to exclude clinically significant arrhythmias in most patients. Thus, prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring with demonstration of symptom-rhythm correlation is required to make the diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia for most patients with recurrent palpitations.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) — monitoring and epidemiology (Recommendation 111) advises to monitor thyroid function tests before and within the first 3 months following the initiation of amiodarone therapy and at 3- to 6-month intervals thereafter (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). AIT occurs in up to 6% of patients in iodine-sufficient areas and in up to 10% in iodine-deficient areas, with mechanisms including iodine-induced type 1 AIT related to the high iodine content of amiodarone (37% by molecular weight) and a destructive thyroiditis (type 2 AIT).

Diagnostic radioiodine whole-body scan (WBS) — Recommendation 49: Patients who have undergone lobectomy or total thyroidectomy without RAI should not undergo surveillance diagnostic radioiodine WBS (Good Practice Statement). Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who are at low- and low-intermediate risk of recurrence and who have excellent response to therapy do not require routine diagnostic radioiodine WBS during follow-up (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). Patients with DTC who are at intermediate-high and high risk of recurrence can be evaluated with diagnostic radioiodine WBS to evaluate for iodine-avid disease if there is clinical suspicion for recurrence, and WBS, if undertaken, can be performed with 123I or low activity 131I (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). SPECT-CT radioiodine imaging may be performed in addition to planar imaging to anatomically localize the radioiodine uptake and distinguish between likely cancer and nonspecific uptake (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence).

### A case of simultaneous occurrence of marine-lenhart syndrome and a papillary thyroid microcarcinoma [^1112vrT3]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old Caucasian man was referred because of abnormal thyroid function tests and intermittent atrial fibrillation. He reported of occasional palpitations, episodes of tachycardia (up to 200 bpm), especially under exertion, and excessive sweating. The patient was previously started on bisoprolol 2.5 mg once daily and presented with normofrequent sinus rhythm. On physical examination his thyroid was moderately enlarged (WHO grade Ib) and soft. Thyroid function tests revealed hyperthyroidism with complete suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (< 0.01 μIU/mL, see Table 1 for reference range), elevated FT4 (3.03 ng/dL) and increased total thyroxine (TT4) and total triiodothyronine (TT3) levels (132 and 2.53 ng/mL respectively). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) were negative, but TSH-RAbs were elevated (2.6 IU/L), indicating that the patient suffered from Graves' disease (See Table 1). Upon initial admission the patient showed no clinical signs of Graves' orbitopathy. A thyroid ultrasound showed multiple hypoechoic nodules in both thyroid lobes. The most prominent nodule appeared in anterior caudal position of the right lobe embedded in a diffusely heterogeneous thyroid gland. The lesion measured 1.1 × 0.9 × 2 cm, showed no signs of microcalcification, but was highly vascularized in the Doppler color flow, whereas the rest of the thyroid tissue showed moderate signs of hypervascularization (Figure 1). A 99m Technetium thyroid nuclear scan displayed an orthotopic, V-shaped thyroid with asymmetrical uptake and a hot area in the right lower lobe compatible with the hypoechoic, hypervascularized lesion discovered in ultrasonography (Figure 2). Uptake in the remaining thyroid tissue was comparatively lower but not suppressed, with increased overall uptake (4.29%, reference range: 0.5% – 2%) and almost no detectable background activity. Thus, both signs of Graves' disease and thyroid autonomy were coexisting in our patient hence the diagnosis Marine-Lenhart syndrome.

Adult neck mass — follow-up and patient education by risk: For patients with a neck mass who are not at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should advise patients of criteria that would trigger the need for additional evaluation and should document a plan for follow-up to assess resolution or final diagnosis; for patients deemed at increased risk for malignancy, clinicians or their designees should explain to the patient the significance of being at increased risk and explain any recommended diagnostic tests.

### Bone loss after discontinuation of denosumab: the devil is in the details [^116wcFDd]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

A 47-year-old postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis was treated with denosumab, which was discontinued due to side effects. She was therefore transitioned to a yearly intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid. An increase in bone turnover markers together with bone loss at the lumbar spine was observed before the second infusion, suggesting an overshooting of bone resorption due to denosumab discontinuation. On physical examination, the patient was restless and reported having lost about 10 kg since the last visit. A solitary left inferior thyroid nodule was noted on neck palpation. Circulating thyroid hormone levels were elevated, with suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone. A thyroid scan showed increased uptake in the left inferior nodule with suppression of the remainder of the thyroid gland. A diagnosis of hyperthyroidism due to toxic adenoma was made. The patient was treated with radioactive iodine ablation, with consequent complete normalization of thyroid function. She continued yearly treatment with zoledronic acid. She remained clinically well with no further fractures. Bone turnover markers were appropriately suppressed and bone mineral density increased in the spine and hip. This case illustrates how the overshooting phenomenon following denosumab discontinuation may be compounded by the development of secondary conditions, which can result in suboptimal response to antiresorptive osteoporosis medications.

Neck mass in adults — suspicious history criteria: Clinicians should identify patients with a neck mass who are at increased risk for malignancy when the patient lacks a history of infectious etiology and the mass has been present for ≥ 2 weeks without significant fluctuation or the mass is of uncertain duration; Recommendation based on observational studies with a preponderance of benefits over harm. Supporting details state that in the setting of a neck mass without recent infection, the clinician should establish the duration, that a noninfectious neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is concerning for malignancy, that unknown duration should be considered a persistent mass at increased risk for malignancy, and that the mere presence of a neck mass present ≥ 2 weeks without signs of improvement is suspicious even without other risk factors.

Paraganglioma

Paraganglioma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor arising from the paraganglia, including the paraganglia of the head and neck and the mediastinum. Most of these tumors arise in the fourth and fifth decades of life and clinical presentation is typically dependent on the functionality of the tumor. Functional paragangliomas secrete an excess of catecholamine, with the patient presenting with headache, palpitations, and sweating. Nonfunctioning paragangliomas often present as a slow growing palpable mass or pain related to local growth. Head and neck paragangliomas are typically parasympathetic in origin and non-secretory, including those that arise from the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve. Thoracic/mediastinal paragangliomas can be parasympathetic in origin (if they arise in the anterior mediastinum) or sympathetic (if it arises from the posterior mediastinum). This tumor appears as a well-defined soft tissue mass located along the distribution of a nerve (Fig. 22 a, b). On CT imaging, the lesion will avidly enhance post contrast and demonstrate delayed washout due to the increased vascularity. MRI is the reference exam for the evaluation of paragangliomas. On T1W1, the lesion is solid and isointense, and T2WI demonstrates the classic salt and pepper appearance: the "pepper" appearance is due to the low signal flow voids from the high flow vessels within the lesion, and the "salt" corresponding to the high intensity signal due to areas of hemorrhage (Fig. 22 c). On post contrast images, there is intense enhancement, which may be homogenous or heterogeneous depending on the presence of necrotic tissue. Nuclear medicine imaging can be used to target the tumor-specific catecholamine production, such as an Octreoscan.

The high T2 signal (salt) corresponds to the areas of hemorrhage, and the low signal (pepper) corresponds to the flow voids within the lesion

### Thyrotoxicosis due to ectopic lateral thyroid tissue presenting 5 years after total thyroidectomy [^111bw2Gg]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a patient who, 5 years after total thyroidectomy to treat Graves disease, presented with thyrotoxicosis due to nonmalignant lateral ectopic thyroid tissue.

Method

We describe the laboratory, imaging, and physical findings of the study patient and review the relevant literature.

Results

A 32-year-old white woman with a history of Graves disease presented with recurrent hyperthyroidism 5 years after total thyroidectomy. A radioactive iodine scan was performed, which revealed elevated uptake (40%) and positive imaging in the left mid-neck. Ultrasonography examination of the neck confirmed the absence of any thyroid tissue within the thyroid bed, but documented 2 nodular, hypoechoic left upper-neck masses with punctuate hyperlucency. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed to precisely localize the nodules, which were excised surgically via selective neck dissection. Histopathologic examination revealed chronic lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with focal thyroid hyperplasia and papillary infoldings and no evidence of malignancy.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this represents the first report of ectopic benign thyroid tissue as the sole cause of hyperthyroid symptoms, and this entity should be considered in patients who have undergone thyroidectomy and have persistent hyperthyroidism.

### Ga-trivehexin PET / CT: a promising novel tracer for primary hyperparathyroidism [^114gaPJE]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

We also acknowledge noteworthy findings in our cohort that merit careful consideration, indicating potential variability in the specificity of this novel modality. For instance, a hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule on thyroid scintigraphy showed no 68 Ga-Trivehexin or [99m Tc]Tc-MIBI uptake. However, a normal functioning thyroid nodule showing mild [99m Tc]NaTcO 4 uptake surprisingly exhibited mild 68 Ga-Trivehexin uptake. Another patient presented heterogeneous mild uptake in the thyroid glands which significantly decreased on the delayed images. 68 Ga-Trivehexin uptake in these instances may cause an overlap in imaging characteristics between parathyroid and thyroid tissues underscoring the need for careful interpretation of 68 Ga-Trivehexin PET/CT across different thyroid conditions. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms driving these uptake patterns remain unclear especially given the scarcity of data in the literature. Future studies should focus on these mechanisms, as understanding the molecular basis of integrin receptor expression could not only enhance the accuracy of imaging techniques but also pave the way for novel targeted therapeutic interventions in PHPT. Furthermore, we acknowledge limitations including the relatively small cohort size, potential patient selection bias, and the controlled study design, which preclude definitive sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value assessments.

### Management guidelines for children with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1148mGtb]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Autonomous thyroid nodules in children — diagnosis and management include scintigraphy and surgery: Pediatric patients are occasionally found to have an autonomously functioning nodule (toxic adenoma) diagnosed by a suppressed TSH and increased, nodule-specific uptake on nuclear medicine radioisotope scan (99mTc pertechnetate or iodine-123 [123I]). For pediatric patients with a suppressed TSH associated with a thyroid nodule, thyroid scintigraphy should be pursued, and increased uptake within the nodule is consistent with autonomous nodular function. Surgical resection, most commonly lobectomy, is the recommended approach for most autonomous nodules in children and adolescents, and this carries Recommendation rating: A. In adults, the treatment options for autonomous nodules include 131I ablation, surgical resection, or ethanol injection; because of concerns of the mutagenic effect of low-activity radioiodine and reports that up to one third of patients may be found to have an incidentally discovered DTC associated with autonomous nodules, surgical resection is the usual recommendation for most pediatric patients; however, in asymptomatic patients with an autonomous nodule and subclinical hyperthyroidism, surgery may be deferred, but FNA should be considered if the nodule has features suggestive of PTC.

American Thyroid Association 2016 — clinical situations that favor specific modalities in Graves' hyperthyroidism: RAI therapy is favored for women planning a pregnancy in the future (in more than 6 months following RAI administration, provided that thyroid hormone levels are normal), individuals with comorbidities increasing surgical risk, those with previously operated or externally irradiated necks or lack of access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon, and those with contraindications to antithyroid drugs (ATDs) or failure to achieve euthyroidism with ATDs; patients with periodic thyrotoxic hypokalemic paralysis, right heart failure pulmonary hypertension, or congestive heart failure are also considered good candidates. ATDs are favored for patients with high likelihood of remission (especially women with mild disease, small goiters, and negative or low-titer TRAb), pregnancy, elderly or others with comorbidities increasing surgical risk or limited life expectancy, residents of nursing homes or other care facilities unable to follow radiation safety regulations, those with previously operated or irradiated necks or lacking access to a high-volume thyroid surgeon, patients with moderate to severe active GO, and those needing more rapid biochemical disease control. Surgery is favored for women planning a pregnancy in < 6 months provided thyroid hormone levels are normal, symptomatic compression or large goiters (≥ 80 g), relatively low uptake of RAI, documented or suspected thyroid malignancy (e.g., suspicious or indeterminate cytology), large thyroid nodules especially if greater than 4 cm or if nonfunctioning or hyperfunctioning on 123I or 99mTc pertechnetate scanning, coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery, especially if TRAb levels are particularly high, and patients with moderate to severe active GO.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

CLINICAL UTILITY

Most patients with thyroid disease present with a thyroid nodule. Tools utilized to assess thyroid nodules and to rule out thyroid cancer include: serum thyroid function tests (TSH and thyroid hormone level), thyroid ultrasound (US), radionuclide scintigraphy (low activity I-131, I-123 and/or Tc99m), and fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology (cells) examination. High thyroid hormone levels (T4 or T3) and a low TSH level may indicate a nodule is a benign hyperfunctioning nodule (adenoma), thereby tending to rule out thyroid cancer. In such cases, thyroid imaging (US or scintigraphy) determines whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning whereas thyroid cancers appear under-functioning or "cold" on the scan. Graves' disease and Hashimotos' thyroiditis represent thyroid diseases which occur in children who have autoimmune thyroid disease. In these patients, abnormal thyroid function tests reflect underlying thyroid disease but do not exclude thyroid cancer.

The administration of radioiodine has proved to be an excellent method of destruction of over functioning thyroid tissue (either diffuse or toxic nodular goiter). Radioiodine is concentrated in the thyroid, destroying cells that concentrate it.

Surgical removal is the treatment of choice for thyroid carcinomas. At 2 to 4 months post surgery, a whole-body I-131 scan is performed following cessation of thyroxin drug for 4–6 weeks prior to the scan, thereby causing hypothyroidism; TSH then rises and stimulates iodide uptake. Iodine-containing foods and contrast media are avoided. Patients with significant I-131 uptake are given ablative (100–150 mCi) doses of I-131. For minimal uptake, doses of 30–50 mCi I-131 are given on an outpatient basis. Patients with extra thyroidal uptake from metastatic disease may be given larger doses of greater than 100 mCi.

Postoperative radioiodine (RAI) diagnostic scanning — modalities, timing, and observed associations with ablation outcomes: Iodine radioisotope diagnostic testing may include 131I or 123I diagnostic imaging with or without SPECT-CT and/or RAI uptake measurements, and postoperative RAI planar imaging has been reported to alter clinical management in 25%–53% of patients. A multivariate analysis reported that the use of SPECT or 131I between 4 and 11 days prior to remnant ablation was independently associated with an increased risk of remnant ablation failure, whereas a small retrospective study found that administering 3–5 mCi of 131I for scanning 2–5 days before ablation in 37 patients was associated with improved ablation success compared to no preparatory scanning in 631 patients (therapeutic activity 100–200 mCi). Another retrospective study suggested lower success following 3 mCi versus 1 mCi of 131I, 9 days before therapeutic 100 mCi. Two small RCTs showed no significant impact of 131I scanning compared to 123I scanning on successful remnant ablation. Across reviewed studies, scan timing ranged from about 24 to 72 hours for 131I and was 24 hours for 123I. Use of RAI neck uptake measured 24 hours after 1 mCi of 131I was associated with a lower rate of ablation success than fixed dosing; in another analysis, using 1 mCi of 131I for RAI neck uptake 2 days before remnant ablation was independently associated with increased failure risk, although another study showed that 1 mCi 131I diagnostic scans did not adversely affect ablation success or 3-year recurrence.

Evaluation of the neck mass in adults — strength of action terms and implied obligations are defined for three categories. Strong recommendation indicates that benefits clearly exceed harms with high-quality supporting evidence (grade A or B), and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation indicates that benefits exceed harms but the quality of evidence is not as high (grade B or C), and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option indicates that evidence quality may be suspect (grade D) or well-done studies (grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage among approaches, and clinicians should be flexible in decision making, potentially setting bounds on alternatives; patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Severe thyrotoxicosis induced by thyroid metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma: a case report and review of the literature [^116cXw7g]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old woman who had undergone lung lobectomy because of lung adenocarcinoma presented with thyrotoxicosis, neck swelling, and cervical lymphadenopathy one month after the operation. The total serum triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) levels were markedly elevated to 514 ng/dL and 26.4 microg/dL, respectively, and serum thyrotropin (TSH) was suppressed to less than 0.005 microU/mL. Although the thyroid gland had been normal before surgery, chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a markedly enlarged thyroid gland only 1 month after surgery. 123I uptake for 24 hours was suppressed to 4% in the thyroid gland with no uptake elsewhere including the lung. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the thyroid showed invasion of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, cytologically identical to the cells obtained from sputum and those infiltrating the resected sections of the lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical studies of resected lung tissues did not show positive staining for thyroglobulin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), or surfactant protein A. Clinically, the thyrotoxicosis had spontaneously improved, followed by a hypothyroid state with shrinkage of the thyroid gland after chemotherapy. Despite repeated chemotherapy and the administration of thyroxine for hypothyroidism, the patient died of respiratory failure 9 months after the onset of thyrotoxicosis. From these findings and the clinical course, thyroid metastasis, developing subacutely from lung adenocarcinoma, was diagnosed. We speculate that aggressive invasion of tumor cells into the thyroid gland resulted in highly destructive thyrotoxicosis.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) "is a safe diagnostic tool in pregnancy and may be performed in any trimester". "FNA of thyroid nodules is generally recommended for newly detected nodules in pregnant women with a nonsuppressed TSH", with selection "based upon the nodule's sonographic pattern", and "The timing of FNA, whether during gestation or early postpartum, may be influenced by the clinical assessment of cancer risk or by patient preference", rated "Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence". If TSH suppression persists "beyond 16 weeks gestation", "FNA of a clinically relevant thyroid nodule may be deferred until after pregnancy", and if suppression remains, "a radionuclide scan to evaluate nodule function can be performed if not breastfeeding", rated "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence". Radionuclide testing in pregnancy is discouraged: "Radionuclide scintigraphy or radioiodine uptake determination should not be performed during pregnancy", rated "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence", and since outcomes "do not differ if surgery is performed during or after gestation", "patient preference for timing of FNA… should be considered".

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^115oSHAB]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Endocrine — thyroid and parathyroid ultrasound is motivated by the facts that thyroid nodules are the most common lesions seen in the head and neck and that a major consideration in the evaluation of thyroid nodules is the potential for malignancy. Ultrasound evaluation of a thyroid nodule, frequently coupled with an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA), is the most reliable means to assess for potential malignancy. Hyperparathyroidism is a common clinical entity; while surgical excision via 4-gland exploration can be offered as therapy, directed exploration with excision of an abnormal gland is more frequently performed in patients with preoperative localization, and while sestamibi imaging is commonly used, ultrasound can accurately identify the abnormal gland. Indications for an ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid and parathyroid glands include but are not limited to the following: evaluation of the location and characteristics of palpable neck masses; evaluation of abnormalities detected by other imaging examinations or laboratory studies, eg, areas of abnormal uptake seen on radioisotope thyroid examinations; evaluation of the presence, size, and location of the thyroid gland; evaluation of high-risk patients for occult thyroid malignancy; follow-up of thyroid nodules, when indicated; and evaluation for recurrent disease or regional nodal metastases in patients with proven or suspected thyroid carcinoma.

### Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of thyroid storm [^116v52od]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

The pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is complex, with multiple mechanisms theorised to be involved. The neuroendocrine axis is proposed to be involved, with catecholamine-mediated myocardial damage due to either direct toxicity and/or microvascular dysfunction as well as sensitisation of the myocardial tissue to sympathetic hormones by thyroid hormones exacerbating the catecholaminergic-mediated myocardial tissue damage through synergism. Other possible mechanisms include elevation of circulating catecholamine levels, but this continues to be a controversial theory. Abnormal thyroid hormone concentrations have been reported in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, but the causal association has not been fully established. Rare cases of myocarditis with Graves' disease have been documented as well.

Thyroid hormones have similar effects to catecholamine-mediated sympathetic stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Excess thyroid hormones, such as in Graves' thyrotoxicosis, can lead to increased cardiac stimulation, manifesting clinically with tachyarrhythmia, inotropy and hypermetabolism. Thyroid hormones enhance cellular response to catecholamine action, and in thyrotoxic states lead to increased beta-adrenoreceptor density in humans, with higher physiological concentrations of adrenoceptors located at the cardiac apex. Other thyroid hormone effects are enhancement of beta-adrenergic cell-mediated functions and downstream elevation of cyclic AMP levels. Our case is unique as we observed a mid-ventricular Takotsubo rather than apical ballooning. Normal or low levels of catecholaminergic hormones have been observed in thyrotoxicosis. Therefore, synergistic enhancement of catecholaminergic action by thyroid hormone excess could explain this presentation.

Optimal management of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has not been established, with mainstay of therapy focused on management of complications. Heart failure therapy is often commenced with blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and commencement of cardioselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in haemodynamically stable patients. Recurrent episodes of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy have been reported to occur in 2%–4% of cases. There is no evidence-based therapy to guide prevention of recurrence, although experts recommend long-term beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Long-term follow-up is required as death from all-cause mortality occurred at 5.6%/patient-year, with major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events occurring at 9.9%/patient-year within the International Takotsubo Registry.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia classification by clinical presentation — definitions used include: Asymptomatic defined as "The absence of symptoms that could result from an arrhythmia". Minimal symptoms/palpitations are patient-reported palpitations in the chest, throat, or neck with sensations such as "Heartbeat sensations that feel like pounding or racing", "An unpleasant awareness of heartbeat", or "Feeling skipped beats or a pause". Presyncope is reported with symptoms including dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or "Graying out". Syncope is "Sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone, not related to anesthesia, with spontaneous recovery as reported by the patient or observer", and patients "may experience syncope when supine". Sudden cardiac death is "Death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms", whereas sudden cardiac arrest is the same presentation "in whom medical intervention (e.g., defibrillation) reverses the event".

### Recurrence of Graves' disease in thyroglossal duct remnants: relapse after total thyroidectomy [^115tG83Y]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ectopic thyroid tissue can be found anywhere between the foramen cecum and the normal position of the thyroid gland, most commonly located in the anterior cervical area, the region of the thyroglossal duct. Although thyroid cancer has been described frequently in thyroglossal duct remnants, thyroid dysfunction related to this tissue is rare. We report a patient with recurrent Graves' disease arising in a thyroglossal duct remnant.

Summary

A 40-year-old woman with a history of total thyroidectomy for Graves' disease, presented with a slowly enlarging midline neck mass in association with clinical signs of hyperthyroidism. Serum-free triiodothyronine (6.6 pg/mL) and serum-free thyroxine (2.2 ng/dL) were elevated (normal range, 2.3–4.2 pg/mL and 0.9–1.8 ng/dL, respectively), and thyroid-stimulating hormone was suppressed (< 0.01 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.35–5.50 mIU/mL). Neck ultrasonography showed a solid mass, localized at the infrahyoid area; radionuclide scanning confirmed an increased uptake at the same level. A 4 cm solid mass was removed by the Sistrunk technique. Microscopic examination revealed marked follicular hyperplasia, with tall cells, small follicles, scant, and scalloped colloid, in association with patchy lymphocytic infiltrate consistent with Graves' disease.

Conclusions

There appears to be no reason why thyroid cells within thyroglossal duct remnants should not be influenced by the thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins of Graves' disease. Thyrotoxicosis resulting from this must be very rare, however, as were unable to find reports of patients with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves' disease in thyroglossal duct remnants. Although some thyroid tissue can be found within the thyroglossal duct in 1.6% to 40% of normal adults, the risk of thyroid dysfunction from this is far too low to justify new therapeutic approaches.

### EANM practice guideline / SNMMI procedure standard for RAIU and thyroid scintigraphy [^1118su16]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). High credibility.

Thyroid scintigraphy interpretation — normal patterns and nodule characterization: Adequate interpretation requires knowledge of the current hormonal status, particularly of TSH concentration, comparison with clinical examination, and integration with ultrasonography results. The isthmus may, or may not, be visualized and a pyramidal lobe can be recognized in about 10% of patients, with tracer activity normally evenly distributed in the thyroid; salivary glands and gastric mucosa are also visualized due to NIS expression. Gray-scale documentation is preferable. Thyroid nodules are classified by tracer uptake relative to extranodular tissue: hypofunctioning "cold" nodules show reduced uptake, isofunctioning "warm" nodules show roughly equivalent uptake, and hyperfunctioning "hot" nodules show increased uptake; autonomously functioning thyroid nodules are often termed "hot" because they produce thyroid hormones in the absence of TSH-stimulating activity. Radiotracer uptake (123I- or 99mTcO4−) characterized as less than, equal to, or more than salivary activity offers a rough approximation of overall thyroid function, but accurate assessment of iodine uptake and kinetics can only be obtained by performing a RAIU test; uptake within a thyroglossal duct remnant and/or a pyramidal lobe is frequently seen in Graves' disease.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Thyquidity) [^115M3xAR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.

The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Oral levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^113pjYXt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Based on the course and the clinical presentation of the present case, a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis could be established. The disappearance of the thyroid nodule following prednisone treatment further confirms the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis following presentation with a thyroid hot nodule. Here, the appearance of the hot thyroid nodule was unusual in that it did not show the usual pattern of low uptake during radioisotope scanning. This case demonstrates that subacute thyroiditis may present as a solitary painful hot nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and ESR and should, therefore, be considered in the differential diagnosis of such lesions.

The mechanism of 99 mm-Tc localization in subacute thyroiditis is not known. Tonami et al. reported two cases of subacute thyroiditis in which thyroid scintigrams with 201TI chloride showed increased radionuclide activity in the affected areas but decreased activity in the affected areas following thyroid scintigrams with 99 m-Tc. It was presumed that this is primarily due to increased membrane permeability in the inflammatory lesion without the apparent destruction of the thyroid gland, which is typically indicated by normal thyroglobulin levels and thyroid function in the patient. Therefore, the present case suggests the clinical and pathological heterogeneity of subacute thyroiditis.

In conclusion, this case demonstrates that subacute thyroiditis should be considered as a differential diagnosis following presentation with a solitary painful thyroid hot nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and ESR. Additionally, this case emphasizes the heterogeneous pattern of thyroid imaging in subacute thyroiditis.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^1111yPW2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

A thyroid ultrasound examination revealed a dyshomogeneous and hypoechoic mass (1.5 × 0.8 cm) in the left thyroid lobe that exhibited an irregular and poorly defined border (Figure 1 A). Thyroid scintigraphy with 99 m-Tc demonstrated a focal accumulation of radiotracer uptake in the lower part of the left thyroid lobe but a normal uptake and configuration of the middle and upper portion of the left lobe and the right lobe (Figure 1 B). Fine-needle aspiration biopsy from the nodule in the lower left lobe revealed multinuclear giant cells consistent with subacute thyroiditis (Figure 2). Subsequently, localized subacute thyroiditis was suspected and the patient was put on prednisone (30 mg/day) for 10 days, which resulted in a rapid resolution of the neck pain. Within a week, the patient's fatigue had disappeared and the tender thyroid nodule had regressed. Prednisone was gradually withdrawn and ultimately stopped after 2 months at which time palpation did not demonstrate a cervical mass. Repeated ultrasound screening revealed a disappearance of the hypoechoic nodule (Figure 3 A) and follow-up scintigraphy analysis found the thyroid exhibited an even distribution of radionuclide in both lobes (Figure 3 B).

### Mechanisms of disease: mechanism-based classification of neuropathic pain-a critical analysis [^112f5xFE]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Classification of neuropathic pain according to etiology or localization has clear limitations. The discovery of specific molecular and cellular events following experimental nerve injury has raised the possibility of classifying neuropathic pain on the basis of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Application of this approach in the clinic is problematic, however, owing to a lack of precise tools to assess symptoms and signs, and difficulties in correlating symptoms and signs with mechanisms. Development and validation of diagnostic methods to identify mechanisms, together with pharmacological agents that specifically target these mechanisms, seems to be the most logical and rational way of improving neuropathic pain treatment.

### Palpitations: evaluation, management, and wearable smart devices [^117FV3aX]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Palpitations are a common symptom described by patients as a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart, a pounding chest, irregular or skipped heartbeats, or a pounding sensation in the neck. They are associated with a low mortality rate; however, recurrent palpitations have been shown to impair quality of life and increase health care use. Common triggers are cardiac disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, medication or illicit drug use, or psychosomatic disorders. A detailed history, physical examination, directed laboratory studies, and 12-lead electrocardiography are often sufficient to identify the etiology of palpitations. Additional testing may be indicated to include echocardiography, cardiac stress testing, electrocardiogram monitoring, or electrophysiologic studies to distinguish whether symptoms correlate with cardiac arrhythmia or structural or ischemic heart disease. Management of palpitations is based on the suspected etiology. In most cases of cardiac-induced palpitations, the treatment can include reassurance, education, trigger avoidance, or use of atrioventricular nodal blockers. Tachyarrhythmias may require cardiac ablation. Patients who have palpitations with no arrhythmia causality and no cardiac disease should be reassured; however, screening for psychosomatic disorders should be considered. Wearable smart devices with ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring technologies are currently available to consumers; these tools have shown diagnostic accuracy for detection of arrhythmias, allowing patients to have greater participation in their health care.

### Mechanisms of disease: pre-eclampsia [^116ACsTK]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2005). Medium credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, a syndrome of pregnant women, is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Despite active research, the etiology of this disorder remains an enigma. Recent work has, however, provided promising explanations for the causation of the disorder and some of its phenotypes. Evidence indicates that the symptoms of hypertension and proteinuria, upon which the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is based, have several underlying causes. Nevertheless, the treatment of pre-eclampsia has not changed significantly in over 50 years. This review describes the most recent insights into the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia from both basic and clinical research, and attempts to provide a unifying hypothesis to reconcile the abnormalities at the feto-placental level and the clinical features of the maternal syndrome. The novel findings outlined in this review provide a rationale for potential future prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for pre-eclampsia.

### Novel insights into the aetiology and pathophysiology of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations [^113pubUN]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Exacerbations are a cardinal feature of the natural history of moderate and severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Patients with frequent exacerbations have significantly lower quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality rates. Although the effect of COPD exacerbations on lung function has been questioned in the past, recent evidence suggests that exacerbations accelerate long-term decline in lung function, specifically in smokers. The mechanism of this acceleration remains largely unknown.

Treatment decisions for COPD patients are frequently made according to exacerbation rates. In the ATS/ERS guidelines it is stated that patients with frequent exacerbations should be initiated a trial of inhaled steroids. Systemic steroids should be administered during acute COPD exacerbations, both in the inpatient and outpatient setting. These treatment strategies indicate the central role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of exacerbations.

Although evidence for increased inflammation on COPD exacerbations has been reviewed previously, there has been little focus on why inflammation increases and which the consequences of this increase are. Investigating further these important questions may help establish a cause and effect relationship between inflammation and COPD exacerbations. The primary aim of this review is to summarize emerging explanations for why inflammation is increased during COPD exacerbations. For practical purposes an attempt is made to categorize aetiological factors of increased inflammation into extrinsic or intrinsic, as it can be seen in table 1. A secondary aim is to try to explain how increased inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of COPD exacerbations.

### Theophylline [^116htB6T]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action:

Theophylline has two distinct actions in the airways of patients with reversible obstruction; smooth muscle relaxation (i.e., bronchodilation) and suppression of the response of the airways to stimuli (i.e., non-bronchodilator prophylactic effects). While the mechanisms of action of theophylline are not known with certainty, studies in animals suggest that bronchodilation is mediated by the inhibition of two isozymes of phosphodiesterase (PDE III and, to a lesser extent, PDE IV) while non-bronchodilator prophylactic actions are probably mediated through one or more different molecular mechanisms, that do not involve inhibition of PDE III or antagonism of adenosine receptors. Some of the adverse effects associated with theophylline appear to be mediated by inhibition of PDE III (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, headache, and emesis) and adenosine receptor antagonism (e.g., alterations in cerebral blood flow).

Theophylline increases the force of contraction of diaphragmatic muscles. This action appears to be due to enhancement of calcium uptake through an adenosine-mediated channel.

Serum Concentration-Effect Relationship:

Bronchodilation occurs over the serum theophylline concentration range of 5 to 20 mcg/mL. Clinically important improvement in symptom control has been found in most studies to require peak serum theophylline concentrations > 10 mcg/mL, but patients with mild disease may benefit from lower concentrations. At serum theophylline concentrations > 20 mcg/mL, both the frequency and severity of adverse reactions increase. In general, maintaining peak serum theophylline concentrations between 10 and 15 mcg/mL will achieve most of the drug's potential therapeutic benefit while minimizing the risk of serious adverse events.

### Mechanisms of disease: neuropathic pain – a clinical perspective [^112iDoAG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain syndromes-pain after a lesion or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system-are clinically characterized by spontaneous and evoked types of pain, which are underpinned by various distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In some patients, the nerve lesion triggers molecular changes in nociceptive neurons, which become abnormally sensitive and develop pathological spontaneous activity. Inflammatory reactions of the damaged nerve trunk can induce ectopic nociceptor activity, causing spontaneous pain. The hyperactivity in nociceptors induces secondary changes in processing neurons in the spinal cord and brain, so that input from mechanoreceptive A-fibers is perceived as pain. Neuroplastic changes in the central pain modulatory systems can lead to further hyperexcitability. The treatment of neuropathic pain is still unsatisfactory, and a new hypothetical concept has been proposed, in which pain is analyzed on the basis of underlying mechanisms. The increased knowledge of pain-generating mechanisms and their translation into symptoms and signs might eventually allow a dissection of the mechanisms that operate in each patient. If a precise clinical phenotypic characterization of the neuropathic pain is combined with a selection of drugs that act on those mechanisms, it should ultimately be possible to design optimal treatments for individuals. This review discusses the conceptual framework of the novel mechanism-based classification, encouraging the reader to see neuropathic pain as a clinical entity rather than a compilation of single disease states.

### Thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma: diagnostic and management considerations in a 15-year-old with a large submental mass [^113QavAz]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 15-year old boy presented with a 2-year history of a painless slowly enlarging submental neck mass. Head and neck imaging showed a multicystic mass with a central solid component that was closely applied to the hyoid bone. Core needle biopsy under general anaesthesia revealed a papillary thyroid neoplasm. The mass was resected and frozen section histology confirmed papillary carcinoma. Intraoperatively, enlarged cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy with parathyroid reimplantation were performed. On histological examination, the thyroid gland was not involved. The patient recovered uneventfully from the surgery and is planned for radioactive iodine therapy and thyroxine suppression, with subsequent follow-up with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroglobulin for surveillance. We review the literature and discuss challenges in the diagnosis and surgical management of this rare entity in the paediatric age group.

### Post-COVID-19 condition: clinical phenotypes, pathophysiological mechanisms, pathology, and management strategies [^111uKNmq]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Post‐COVID‐19 condition (PCC), also known as long COVID, is a complex multiple organ system condition that can develop and persist for months after acute COVID‐19. PCC encompasses a wide range of symptoms, resulting in heterogeneous clinical manifestations. These manifestations likely arise from diverse underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, which, in turn, are influenced by risk factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities. To this end, characterising clinical phenotypes of PCC is essential for deepening our understanding of its (potentially) distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and for advancing diagnostic and patient‐tailored management strategies. PCC is thought to result from a complex interaction of various pathophysiological mechanisms, leading to functional and structural pathological alterations across multiple organ systems. Investigating these alterations is critical to improving our currently incomplete understanding of PCC's complex pathophysiology. This review provides an overview of the main clinical phenotypes of PCC, characterises these phenotypes by examining symptoms and signs, as well as the associated risk factors. The main hypothesised pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed by outlining the current knowledge on PCC pathology, focussing on the most commonly affected organ systems. Current PCC management includes supportive care such as physiotherapy and the repurposing of existing drugs primarily targeting persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 (e.g. antivirals, monoclonal antibodies) and immune dysfunction (e.g. antiinflammatory drugs, immunomodulators). To date, prevention of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection remains critical, which can be achieved through effective public health measures and vaccination strategies. Finally, this review highlights current knowledge gaps and proposes future research directions to advance the understanding and treatment of PCC. © 2025 The Author(s).

### Inflammasomopathies: mechanisms and disease signatures [^1112y1aP]. Trends in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammasomes form in response to infection, cellular stress, or damage. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in inflammasome receptors have been identified as the underlying cause of severe inflammatory diseases, termed 'inflammasomopathies'. Recently, molecular interrogation of these diseases revealed several distinctions at the level of the tissue affected, the inflammatory mediators that drive disease progression, and the contribution of programmed cell death. In this review we discuss key emerging differences across inflammasomopathies and the distinct inflammatory patterns seen in patients. We discuss how programmed cell death influences the progression of inflammasomopathies and the role of plasma membrane rupture. Understanding the molecular disease signatures across inflammasomopathies provides crucial insights into identifying and treating the underlying disease and opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

American Thoracic Society statement — conclusions on dyspnea indicate progress in understanding mechanisms but persistent gaps in treatment: since the original consensus statement in 1999 there has been substantial progress in research into mechanisms of dyspnea, but there has been little progress in treatment; despite advances in therapy for cardiopulmonary disorders, there are millions of patients who are severely disabled by breathlessness; the duty to alleviate suffering must remain a top priority, and the document aims to summarize what has been achieved and what remains to allow patients to enjoy breathing.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^113GwwCb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, giant-cell thyroiditis, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, is a spontaneously remitting inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland. Subacute thyroiditis is generally caused by viral infection and is the most common cause of a painful thyroid. Patients with subacute thyroiditis usually have a history of antecedent viral infection and subsequently suffer from neck pain, thyroid tenderness, fever, and fatigue. Upon physical examination, the thyroid of the patient is often tender and diffusely enlarged.

In most cases, a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is usually self-evident and can be made based on patient history, physical and laboratory findings, and the clinical course of the disease. In some cases, in addition to the clinical course and features, fine needle aspiration cytology, ultrasound, and scintigraphy analyses may support the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. For example, thyroid radioisotope scanning generally demonstrates a low uptake of Technetium-99 m (99 m-Tc) or 131I. However, patients with subacute thyroiditis sometimes present with puzzling clinical features that can escape early recognition. Here, a patient with subacute thyroiditis, who presented with a solitary painful thyroid nodule in the absence of typical laboratory test characteristics that would suggest subacute thyroiditis and whose 99 m-Tc thyroid scan revealed a hot nodule in the left lobe of thyroid, is described. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of a hot nodule in a patient with subacute thyroiditis has not been previously reported.

### The adult neck mass… [^115WEk1y]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

When an adult patient presents with a neck mass, malignancy is the greatest concern. Although differentiating benign and malignant masses can be difficult, a methodical approach will usually result in an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This article reviews the differential diagnosis of neck masses in adults and provides a framework for clinical decision-making. Normal Anatomy Accurate diagnosis of a neck mass requires a knowledge of normal structures. With practice and experience, normal variations in anatomy can be distinguished from true pathology without the need for additional diagnostic testing or subspecialist consultation. History A careful medical history can provide important clues to the diagnosis of a neck mass. 1 The patient's age and the size and duration of the mass are the most significant predictors of neoplasia. 1 The patient's age is most important, because the risk of malignancy becomes greater with increasing age.
2.

The occurrence of symptoms and their duration must also be determined. Acute symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, and cough, suggest adenopathy resulting from an upper respiratory tract infection. Chronic symptoms of sore throat, dysphagia, change in voice quality, or hoarseness are often associated with anatomic or functional alterations in the pharynx or larynx. Recent travel, trauma to the head and neck, insect bites, or exposure to pets or farm animals suggests an inflammatory or infectious cause for a neck mass. A history of smoking, heavy alcohol use, or previous radiation treatment increases the likelihood of malignancy. A review of associated medical conditions and previous treatments is useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis and formulating an appropriate treatment plan. Physical Examination The skin on the head and neck should be inspected for premalignant or malignant lesions resulting from chronic sun exposure.

The otologic examination may show a sinus or fistula associated with a branchial anomaly. Evidence of chronic sinusitis or pharyngitis suggests reactive adenopathy as the most likely cause of a neck mass. For initial assessment and serial examination, the size of the mass may be measured using calipers or a tape measure. Lateral Neck Branchial anomalies are the most common congenital masses in the lateral neck. These masses, which include cysts, sinuses, and fistulae, may be present anywhere along the sternocleidomastoid muscle. 3 The masses are typically soft, slow-growing, and painless. A history of infection, spontaneous discharge, and previous incision and drainage is not uncommon. 8 Chronic inflammation may result in a mass within the submandibular or parotid glands. Treatment is usually conservative unless pain is severe enough to justify surgical excision. Cervical adenitis is probably the most common cause of an inflammatory mass in the neck.

This condition is characterized by painful enlargement of normal lymph nodes in response to infection or inflammation.
9. Infection Both bacterial and viral infections can cause neck masses. Occasionally, the lymph node becomes necrotic, and an abscess forms. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species are the organisms most commonly cultured from neck abscesses. 10 In many instances, however, the infection is polymicrobial. A neck abscess usually requires intravenous antibiotic therapy, and surgical drainage may be necessary. Typical and atypical mycobacterial infections are less common infectious causes of neck masses. Mycobacterial infection generally presents as a single enlarged node that is rarely tender or painful. Tuberculous infection generally presents in older patients with a history of tuberculosis exposure and a positive purified protein derivative tuberculin skin test. Therapy with antituberculous antibiotics for six to 12 months is the treatment of choice.

### Lymphadenopathy: differential diagnosis and evaluation… [^111wbXA4]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The cause of lymphadenopathy is often obvious: for example, the child who presents with a sore throat, tender cervical nodes and a positive rapid strep test, or the patient who presents with an infection of the hand and axillary lymphadenopathy. In other cases, the diagnosis is less clear. Lymphadenopathy may be the only clinical finding or one of several nonspecific findings, and the discovery of swollen lymph nodes will often raise the specter of serious illness such as lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or metastatic cancer. 1 Lymphadenopathy refers to nodes that are abnormal in either size, consistency or number. There are various classifications of lymphadenopathy, but a simple and clinically useful system is to classify lymphadenopathy as "generalized" if lymph nodes are enlarged in two or more noncontiguous areas or "localized" if only one area is involved.

Distinguishing between localized and generalized lymphadenopathy is important in formulating a differential diagnosis. In primary care patients with unexplained lymphadenopathy, approximately three fourths of patients will present with localized lymphadenopathy and one fourth with generalized lymphadenopathy. 2, 3. Epidemiology Our understanding of the epidemiology of lymphadenopathy in family practice is limited by the scarcity of relevant literature. Only one study 4 provides reliable population-based estimates. Findings from this Dutch study revealed a 0. 6 percent annual incidence of unexplained lymphadenopathy in the general population. Of 2, 556 patients in the study who presented with unexplained lymphadenopathy to their family physicians, 256 were referred to a subspecialist and 82 required a biopsy, but only 29 had a malignancy.

This low prevalence of malignancy is supported by the results of two case series 2, 3 from family practice departments in the United States, in which none of 80 patients and three of 238 patients with unexplained lymphadenopathy were diagnosed with malignancy. In contrast, the prevalence of malignancy in lymph node biopsies performed in referral centers is 40 to 60 percent, 5 a statistic that has made its way into many textbooks. Such assertions overestimate the probability of malignancy in patients with lymphadenopathy because they exclude the 97 percent of patients with lymphadenopathy who do not undergo a biopsy. In primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0. 4 percent risk in patients younger than age
40.

In other cases, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of the history and physical examination alone; however, the clinical evaluation may strongly suggest a particular cause. Confirmatory testing should be performed in order to correctly identify the patient's illness. A subset of patients will either have unexplained lymphadenopathy after the initial clinical evaluation or have a presumptive diagnosis that is made in the "diagnostic" or "suggestive" branches of the algorithm and is not confirmed by test results or by the clinical course. In patients with unexplained localized lymphadenopathy and a reassuring clinical picture, a three- to four-week period of observation is appropriate before biopsy. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy and a worrisome clinical picture or patients with generalized lymphadenopathy will need further diagnostic evaluation that often includes biopsy (.
