## Question

A 29-year-old woman presents with severe episodic abdominal pain, neuropathic limb pain, and dark urine; labs show hyponatremia. She is discharged with a diagnosis of porphyria, type not yet determined pending confirmatory testing. Which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing this encounter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing when a 29-year-old woman is discharged with a diagnosis of porphyria, type not yet determined, pending confirmatory testing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it fits acute hepatic porphyria. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workflow and where this encounter sits in that pathway. Next, I will check ICD-10-CM coding principles for unspecified diagnoses and confirm the exact code. Finally, I will consider whether any alternative or additional codes are warranted and ensure the coding aligns with payer expectations and clinical reality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. Severe episodic abdominal pain, neuropathic limb pain, dark urine, and hyponatremia in a woman of childbearing age are classic for an acute hepatic porphyria attack, and hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality during attacks, which supports the working diagnosis of acute hepatic porphyria pending biochemical confirmation [^1156YDba] [^117XEehd].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pathway before jumping to coding. The AGA recommends initial biochemical testing with random urine ALA, PBG, and creatinine to establish acute hepatic porphyria, followed by genetic testing to confirm the specific type; until the type is confirmed, the diagnosis remains "acute hepatic porphyria, unspecified" from a coding standpoint, which fits this scenario of "porphyria, type not yet determined" [^1156YDba] [^114KEd39] [^116SAXmM].

> I should confirm the ICD-10-CM coding principle here. When the specific type of porphyria is not yet established, it is appropriate to use an unspecified code; I initially thought of E80.29 for "other porphyria", but hold on, that's not correct because that code implies a known, specified porphyria other than the major types, whereas here the type is genuinely undetermined pending confirmatory testing, so the correct choice is the unspecified code for porphyria [^116SAXmM].

> Let me double-check the exact ICD-10-CM code. The correct unspecified porphyria code is E80.20, which covers porphyria, unspecified, and accurately reflects the clinical situation of confirmed porphyria without a specified subtype at discharge [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I should also code the hyponatremia separately? I need to check whether hyponatremia in this context is integral to the porphyria attack or warrants a distinct code. Given that hyponatremia is a recognized feature of acute porphyria attacks and is managed as part of the acute episode, it is generally not coded separately unless it is unusually severe or the principal reason for a distinct intervention; thus, I should not add a separate hyponatremia code here unless documentation specifically supports it as a separate focus of care [^1156YDba] [^113b4CQf].

> Hold on, I should verify payer guidance on unspecified codes. Pediatric and specialty guidance emphasizes that when sufficient clinical detail is not yet available, unspecified codes are appropriate and should not be summarily denied solely for lack of specificity; this supports using E80.20 now and updating to a more specific code once genetic results return [^116SAXmM].

> Final answer: Use ICD-10-CM code E80.20 for "Porphyria, unspecified" for this encounter, and plan to update to a specific acute hepatic porphyria subtype once confirmatory biochemical and genetic testing are completed [^116SAXmM] [^1156YDba] [^114KEd39].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a 29-year-old woman with suspected porphyria, type not yet determined, is **E80.20** (Porphyria, unspecified). This code should be used when the specific type of porphyria has not been confirmed by biochemical or genetic testing. Once the exact type is identified, update the code to the specific porphyria (e.g. E80.21 for acute intermittent porphyria, E80.22 for hereditary coproporphyria, E80.23 for variegate porphyria, or E80.29 for other porphyria). Hyponatremia may be coded separately as E87.1 if clinically significant and documented, but the primary diagnosis remains E80.20 until the porphyria type is confirmed.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic approach

The patient's presentation — severe episodic abdominal pain, neuropathic limb pain, dark urine, and hyponatremia — is **classic for acute hepatic porphyria** (AHP) [^1156YDba], which includes acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), variegate porphyria (VP), and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase porphyria (ALADP) [^116USxJe]. Diagnosis relies on **biochemical testing** of urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) and delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), with genetic testing to confirm the specific type [^1156YDba] [^114KEd39].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding for unspecified porphyria

When the specific type of porphyria is not yet determined, the appropriate ICD-10-CM code is **E80.20** (Porphyria, unspecified). This code is used when:

- The clinical presentation is consistent with porphyria, but the specific type has not been confirmed.
- Biochemical or genetic testing is pending or inconclusive.
- The healthcare provider has documented porphyria without specifying the type.

---

## Specific ICD-10-CM codes for confirmed porphyria types

Once the specific type of porphyria is confirmed, the diagnosis code should be updated accordingly:

| **Porphyria type** | **ICD-10-cm code** |
|-|-|
| Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) | E80.21 |
| Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) | E80.22 |
| Variegate porphyria (VP) | E80.23 |
| Other porphyria (including ALADP) | E80.29 |

---

## Coding for hyponatremia

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disturbance in acute porphyria attacks [^113b4CQf] and may be coded separately if clinically significant. The ICD-10-CM code for hyponatremia is **E87.1** (Hyponatremia). This code should be used only if the hyponatremia is documented as a clinically significant finding requiring evaluation or treatment.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough clinical documentation. The following elements should be included in the medical record:

- Clinical suspicion of porphyria based on symptoms (abdominal pain, neuropathic pain, dark urine).
- Laboratory results (urinary PBG, ALA, electrolytes).
- Documentation of pending confirmatory testing (biochemical or genetic).
- Specific mention of hyponatremia if present and clinically significant.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

For a 29-year-old woman with suspected porphyria, type not yet determined, the appropriate ICD-10-CM code is **E80.20** (Porphyria, unspecified). This code should be used until confirmatory testing identifies the specific porphyria type, at which point the code should be updated. Hyponatremia may be coded separately as E87.1 if clinically significant and documented. Accurate documentation and coding are essential for appropriate clinical management, billing, and follow-up care.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the acute porphyrias [^117WEns6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The acute porphyrias, 4 inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis, cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms that mimic many other acute medical and psychiatric conditions. Lack of clinical recognition often delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. We review the clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and genetics of the acute porphyrias and provide recommendations for diagnosis and treatment on the basis of reviews of the literature and clinical experience. An acute porphyria should be considered in many patients with unexplained abdominal pain or other characteristic symptoms. The diagnosis can be rapidly confirmed by demonstration of a markedly increased urinary porphobilinogen level by using a single-void urine specimen. This specimen should also be saved for quantitative measurement of porphobilinogen, 5-aminolevulinic acid, and total porphyrin levels. Intravenous hemin therapy, started as soon as possible, is the most effective treatment. Intravenous glucose alone is appropriate only for mild attacks (mild pain, no paresis or hyponatremia) or until hemin is available. Precipitating factors should be eliminated, and appropriate supportive and symptomatic therapy should be initiated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment greatly improve prognosis and may prevent development of severe or chronic neuropathic symptoms. We recommend identification of at-risk relatives through enzymatic or gene studies.

### Neurovisceral porphyrias: what a hematologist needs to know [^114wTKd8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The acute or inducible hepatic porphyrias comprise four inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis. They usually remain asymptomatic for most of the lifespan of individuals who inherit the specific enzyme deficiencies but may cause life-threatening attacks of neurovisceral symptoms. Failure to consider the diagnosis frequently delays effective treatment, and inappropriate diagnostic tests and/or mistaken interpretation of results may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. The four disorders are ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria. Other conditions that clinically and biochemically may mimic acute porphyria include lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia type I. The diagnosis of one of these acute porphyric syndromes should be considered in many patients with otherwise unexplained abdominal pain, severe constipation, systemic arterial hypertension, or other characteristic symptoms. Critical to the rapid diagnosis of the three most common of these disorders is demonstration of markedly increased urinary porphobilinogen (PBG) in a single-void urine specimen. The treatment of choice for all but mild attacks of the acute porphyrias is intravenous hemin therapy, which should be started as soon as possible. Intravenous glucose alone is recommended only for mild attacks (no weakness or hyponatremia) or until hemin is available.

### Acute porphyrias [^113b4CQf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Porphyrias are a group of eight metabolic disorders characterized by defects in heme biosynthesis. Porphyrias are classified into two major categories: 1) the acute or inducible porphyrias and 2) the chronic cutaneous porphyrias. The acute hepatic porphyrias are further classified into acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and porphyria due to severe deficiency of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (ALADP).

Discussion

AIP is the most common, and ALADP is the least common acute porphyria. The clinical presentations of acute porphyrias are nonspecific. There are no pathognomonic signs or symptoms. The most frequent presenting symptom is abdominal pain, but pain in the chest, back, or lower extremities may also occur. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality during acute attacks, and hypomagnesemia is also common. Both are risk factors for development of seizures, which occur in ∼ 20–30% of acute attacks.

Conclusion

Once suspected, the diagnosis of porphyria can be rapidly established by checking random urinary porphobilinogen. Initial management of acute porphyria includes discontinuation of all potentially harmful drugs and management of symptoms. Acute attacks should be treated emergently with intravenous heme and glucose to avoid considerable morbidity and mortality. Acute attacks last a few days, and the majority of patients are asymptomatic between attacks. Prognosis is good if the condition is recognized early and treated aggressively.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^114mT8JX]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute hepatic porphyria:

- **Definition**: Acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by an abnormal accumulation of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors, primarily delta-ALA, in the body due to deficiencies in certain enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute hepatic porphyrias are caused by defects in one of the eight enzymes involved in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This leads to the accumulation of organic compounds called porphyrins, specifically in the liver.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of acute hepatic porphyrias is estimated at about 1 in 1,600 Caucasians.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations are often neurological and can result from severe episodes of acute attacks. These include an acute, predominantly motor axonal neuropathy resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropsychiatric syndromes, seizures, encephalopathy, and cerebrovascular disorders. Severe abdominal pain is also a common symptom. If left untreated, potential long-term complications, including chronic hypertension, CKD, and HCC, develop.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can be good with early diagnosis and management, which includes avoiding identifiable triggers, controlling pain, and administering intravenous hemin during acute attacks.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^116eDWpp]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 1: Women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain without a clear etiology after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP.

Approximately 90% of patients with symptomatic AHP are women and attacks are rare before onset of menses or after menopause in these patients. Among symptomatic patients with AHP, > 90% experience only 1 or a few acute attacks in their lifetimes. Attacks are often precipitated by inducing factors that increase heme production in the liver. An estimated 3%–5% of patients with symptomatic AHP experience frequent recurrent attacks, typically defined as 4 or more attacks per year. These attacks are often not associated with identifiable triggers, although some attacks during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycles are believed to be triggered by progesterone. In addition to the acute attack symptoms described, > 50% of patients who experience recurrent attacks report chronic neurologic symptoms, and 35% have received a diagnosis of neuropathy. These patients have a markedly impaired quality of life, and are at higher risk of long-term complications of AHP, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)and chronic renal failure. ALA and PBG levels in patients experiencing recurrent attacks may be elevated at baseline between attacks. It remains unclear whether chronic symptoms are due to persistently elevated ALA or incomplete recovery from neurologic injury sustained during acute attacks.

Some individuals who cany an AHP pathogenic variant have elevated ALA and PBG but have never experienced acute attacks. This group of asymptomatic high excretors may be at increased risk for an induced acute attack, chronic renal or hepatic injuiy, and/or HCC relative to mutation carriers with normal ALA. Diagnosis of AHPs is frequently delayed, with an average of 15 years from onset of symptomatic AHP to diagnosis in the United States and Europe. Accordingly, AHP should be considered in any patient, especially any woman of childbearing age, who presents with unexplained recurrent, severe abdominal pain.

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^1111PrgK]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, the current case series provides several insights into the clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic features of AIP presenting with acute quadriparesis. All patients with acute porphyric neuropathy manifested with abdominal pain and electrolyte impairment in the form of hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia. Albeit all but one patient in our series were initially diagnosed as GBS, highlighting the challenges in early clinical recognition of AIP. The distinctive clinical signs seen in half of our patients are allodynia with preservation of large fiber sensory modalities. Distinctive electrophysiologic findings are predominantly axonal motor polyneuropathy with sparing of motor nerve conduction velocities and distal latencies. Early discriminative NCS findings in acute porphyric neuropathy may include relative sparing of tibial motor responses but this can only be confirmed by larger studies comparing initial nerve conduction abnormalities in AIP, GBS, and other disorders manifesting with acute motor axonal polyneuropathy. Furthermore, studies exploring characteristic patterns of sensory fiber affection (sparing of large sensory fiber modalities with allodynia and impaired pain sensation) can guide clinicians in differentiating AIP from other disorders manifesting with acute, severe, polyneuropathy.

### Unusual pain disorders-what can Be learned from them? [^111s114h]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

It is of utmost importance to consider porphyrias when related symptoms and findings appear — not least due to the fact that the wrong medication can lead to a dramatic exacerbation of the disease. Clinical features are dependent on the type of porphyria. The striking, principle symptom of patients with acute porphyrias is severe abdominal pain that might present itself as an "acute abdomen" but remains without peritonism. Other manifestations are predominantly neurological, psychological and autonomic. Cutaneous porphyrias on the other hand lead to either blistering or nonblistering photosensitivity (overlap of clinical symptoms in HCP and VP).

The following section will focus on pain in acute porphyrias.

Acute porphyrias – ie AIP, HCP, VP and delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP) – can be life-threatening and occur episodically in the form of attacks. Among abdominal pain, patients show nausea, vomiting and constipation. Motor neuropathies as well as neurovisceral and neuropathic pain are among the neurological manifestations. The affection of proximal muscles (mostly of the upper extremities) is common but tetraplegia, lethal respiratory and bulbar paralysis do also occur. Neuropathic symptoms like tickling or numbness were found to be characteristic for the chronic state of the condition in a study with 19 patients. In a review on AIP with focus on pain, it is reported that pain in the chest, head, neck and limbs were among the most common clinical manifestations affecting 50–52% of the patients. The involvement of cranial nerves was reported in 35–55% of the patients and peripheral neuropathy in 10–40%. Sensory loss was present in 9–38%. The authors discussed several mechanisms that, secondary to heme deficiency or to the accumulation of neurotoxic substances such as ALA, might contribute to the development of central and peripheral sensitisation and neuropathic and neurovisceral pain. For instance, a demyelination due to the release of free radicals is discussed. An affection of central and peripheral nociceptive transmission by increased levels of brain tryptophan and increased turnover of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (resulting from a decreased activity of the heme-dependent enzyme liver tryptophan pyrrolase) was another hypothesis posed by the authors.

Acute hepatic porphyria biochemical testing patterns — In the small population of patients with AHP with recurrent acute attacks, urine ALA and PBG are typically elevated even at baseline between attacks. By contrast, when testing is performed in patients with sporadic AIP when they are asymptomatic, 15%–44% can have normal urine ALA and PBG values; the same, or even higher, percentages are likely true for HCP and VP, and in these patients, confirmatory testing may require repeat testing during an acute attack.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^1157YYp3]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) — epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management are outlined as follows: acute intermittent porphyria is the most common AHP with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 100,000; the major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging, occurring mainly in women in their childbearing years, and AHP should be considered especially in women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes; patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP; the cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics; diagnosis can be confirmed after initial treatment by testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD; AHP is associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risks including systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma; and liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

2 PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients were included in EXPLORE B if they had AHP (diagnosis of AIP, VP, HCP, or ADP made by a porphyria specialist based on history of clinical manifestations of AHP, biochemical evidence of an AHP attack, and molecular confirmation of a pathogenic genetic variant or decreased hydroxymethylbilane synthase activity) and met one of the following criteria: (1) experienced ≥ 1 attack (requiring increased pain medication, antiemetic, or carbohydrate intake, hemin administration, or hospitalization for symptoms and signs of acute porphyria, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation, tachycardia, and hypertension, or hyponatremia) in the prior 12 months; (2) were receiving hemin prophylaxis at an average of ≥ 1 time per month over the 12 months prior to baseline; or (3) were receiving GnRH prophylaxis. Patients were excluded if they were participating in a clinical trial with an investigational product or if they were not considered by the study investigator to be appropriate candidates for the study.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published December 15, 2021 Lead poisoning should be considered in any patient presenting with signs and symptoms of porphyria. It mimics the clinical presentation of acute intermittent porphyria with abnormal urinary porphyrin levels. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What causes the clinical features of porphyria. A: Porphyria refers to a group of metabolic disorders that involve the heme biosynthetic pathway. Eighty percent of heme is produced in the bone marrow, where it combines with globin to form erythroid cells. The remainder of heme is produced in the liver and in cells outside the liver to make cytochrome P450 enzymes and other proteins. Heme synthesis begins in the mitochondria with succinyl–coenzyme A and glycine. It involves eight steps, each with a unique enzyme that advances the precursor products along the pathway.

The enzyme that initiates the synthesis pathway, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, differs in the liver and bone marrow, as does the regulatory feedback control. Disruptions in the pathway resulting from enzyme deficiencies cause precursors to accumulate. The accumulation of porphyrin precursors or porphyrins leads to the clinical features of porphyria. Q: Describe the classic presentation of acute intermittent porphyria. A: Acute intermittent porphyria is caused by a partial deficiency in the third enzyme of heme synthesis, PBG deaminase. Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder, although it has a low penetrance; less than 10% of persons with a pathogenic mutation have symptoms.

The classic presentation of acute intermittent porphyria occurs in young women, with symptoms of fatigue, difficulty concentrating, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Common laboratory findings in patients with acute intermittent porphyria include hyponatremia and mild elevations in liver-enzyme levels. A: During attacks of acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria, the urinary PBG level is expected to be elevated, at 20 to 300 mg per gram of creatinine, accompanied by elevations in the levels of ALA and total urinary porphyrin. An elevation in the ALA level but not the PBG level suggests ALA dehydratase deficiency, which is associated with ALA dehydratase–deficiency porphyria, lead poisoning, and hereditary tyrosinemia. ALA dehydratase inhibition can fully explain the elevations in the levels of urinary ALA, coproporphyrin, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin that are seen in persons with lead poisoning.

A: Lead poisoning causes a range of nonspecific symptoms, depending on the blood lead level. Adults with blood lead levels between 30 and 50 μg per deciliter can have mild symptoms, including fatigue, irritability, and headache. More severe symptoms are seen with high lead levels and can include anemia, constipation, colicky abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy; if the level is higher than 100 μg per deciliter, cerebral edema, encephalopathy, coma, or death can occur. The primary strategy for the management of lead poisoning is removal of the source of exposure. Chelation therapy is recommended for all adult patients with a blood lead level of 100 μg per deciliter or higher, for most adult patients with a blood lead level of 80 μg per deciliter or higher, and for some adult patients with symptoms of lead poisoning and a blood lead level of 50 μg per deciliter or higher.

### Porphyria: often discussed but too often missed [^11247Kmy]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is often overlooked. We describe a patient with this condition who had all the 'bells and whistles', in whom the diagnosis was only made after considerable delay. Far from an esoteric condition haunting examination candidates, AIP is an important cause of a broad spectrum of neurological symptoms. Its early recognition allows the astute clinician to prevent potentially devastating sequelae. We provide practical guidance on the investigation and management of this complex disorder. With a 'back to basics' approach to the underlying genetics and biochemistry, we hope to dispel some of the confusion that may obstruct a timely diagnosis.

Acute intermittent porphyria as a mimic of cyclic vomiting syndrome — acute intermittent porphyria occurs infrequently and generally does not present before puberty. It can present with recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain, mimicking CVS, but usually has 1 or more symptoms of anxiety, depression, hallucination, seizures, cranial nerve weakness, and paresis of the extremeties. The diagnosis can be confirmed by finding an increased urinary d-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in a spot urine during the episode.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^1156v3af]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

Acute hepatic porphyrias — initial biochemical diagnosis: Best Practice Advice 2 states that initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring ALA, PBG, and creatinine in a random urine sample, with during acute attacks both ALA and PBG elevated at least 5-fold the upper limit of normal; the levels are high enough that a random urine sample is sufficient and a 24-hour urine collection is not recommended, and ALA and PBG excretion should be normalized to that of creatinine.

Acute hepatic porphyria genetic confirmation — Best Practice Advice 3 states that genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing. Once biochemical tests indicate AHP, confirmation of the specific type is usually established by genetic testing, and when whole-gene sequencing is performed, 95%–99% of cases can be identified; first-degree family members should be screened with genetic testing once the familial pathogenic variant has been identified and those who are mutation carriers should be counseled.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^113oyWV2]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

### Clinical features and outcomes of acute intermittent porphyria presenting with acute quadriparesis: a case series and follow-up study [^115rZs82]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

First line testing for suspected AIP is through measuring PBG, ALA, and total porphyrins (with or without fractionation) from a random urine sample of ~10 mL normalized to creatinine. Timing of analysis should coincide with an acute attack, although persistent elevations of metabolites have been reported months to years following an acute episode of AIP. Urine PBG levels during an attack are in orders of 2–10 times above normal, in association with elevated urine total porphyrins. Hereditary coproporphyria and variegate porphyria will have similar biochemical results and can only be differentiated from AIP through testing of fecal porphyrins or by genetic testing. Accurate differentiation of various porphyrias is essential for appropriate family counseling on avoidance of triggers.

Definitive diagnosis of AIP is through identification of pathogenic variants in the HMBS gene, located on chromosome 11q24.1–q24.2 with over 500 identified mutations. Prevalence in European populations ranges from 1:1600 to 1:2000 with low disease penetrance, reported at less than 1% in the general population but can be as high as 52% in specific Spanish populations. Up to 90% of subjects with HMBS gene mutations are clinically asymptomatic, highlighting the role of other genes and environmental factors (diet or medications) in precipitating episodes of acute intermittent porphyria. Therefore, the diagnosis of AIP requires a combination of clinical and biochemical laboratory findings rather than reliance on the presence of HMBS gene mutations alone.

Three patients in the present study harbored splice site mutations ([c.826‐2A > T] in two patients and [c.706‐2A > T] in one patient). A missense mutation (c.275T > C) and nonsense mutation (c.874C > T) were detected in one patient each. All mutations are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ClinVar with the exception of patient three, who carries a deletion that results in a premature stop codon, previously reported in a patient originally from Saudi Arabia and presenting with severe abdominal pain, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and lower limb weakness. Further studies are needed to understand the genetic susceptibility factors underlying penetrance of AIP in Arab populations.

Despite the consistent report of abdominal pain and presence of electrolyte disturbances in all patients, there were substantial delays in diagnoses, with all but one patient misdiagnosed as GBS. CSF analysis was within normal limits in three patients tested, although cyto‐albuminologic dissociation has been reported in AIP and adds further to the diagnostic overlap with GBS.

### Acute intermittent porphyria, rasmussen encephalitis, or both? [^117Cctfc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

A case of a young woman who suffers from refractory epilepsy in the form of Rasmussen encephalitis and acute intermittent porphyria is presented. The patient developed refractory partial seizures with progressive hemispheric atrophy in the first decade. Both her serum and cerebrospinal fluid contained significantly elevated levels of anti-GluR3B antibodies. Her serum also contained anti-NR2A antibodies (directed against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor). Seven years later, acute intermittent porphyria was diagnosed as she developed an acute episode of abdominal pain, dark urine, and hyponatremia. For several years, all attempts to discontinue porphyrinogenic antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital and valproate resulted in seizure worsening. During a major acute intermittent porphyria crisis, brain edema and coma developed, allowing the discontinuation of phenobarbital. On recovery, atrophy of the right hemisphere ensued. Several etiologic hypotheses are presented. Double insults, porphyria, and an autoimmune process are suggested for the development of Rasmussen encephalitis in this patient. The authors recommend testing for porphyria in cases of Rasmussen encephalitis and other intractable seizures.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: recommendations for evaluation and long-term management [^116XvCtm]. Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The acute hepatic porphyrias are a group of four inherited disorders, each resulting from a deficiency in the activity of a specific enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. These disorders present clinically with acute neurovisceral symptoms which may be sporadic or recurrent and, when severe, can be life-threatening. The diagnosis is often missed or delayed as the clinical features resemble other more common medical conditions. There are four major subgroups: symptomatic patients with sporadic attacks (< 4 attacks/year) or recurrent acute attacks (≥ 4 attacks/year), asymptomatic high porphyrin precursor excretors, and asymptomatic latent patients without symptoms or porphyrin precursor elevations. Given their clinical heterogeneity and potential for significant morbidity with suboptimal management, comprehensive clinical guidelines for initial evaluation, follow-up, and long-term management are needed, particularly because no guidelines exist for monitoring disease progression or response to treatment. The Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health's Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, which consists of expert centers in the clinical management of these disorders, has formulated these recommendations. These recommendations are based on the literature, ongoing natural history studies, and extensive clinical experience. Initial assessments should include diagnostic confirmation by biochemical testing, subsequent genetic testing to determine the specific acute hepatic porphyria, and a complete medical history and physical examination. Newly diagnosed patients should be counseled about avoiding known precipitating factors. The frequency of follow-up depends on the clinical subgroup, with close monitoring of patients with recurrent attacks who may require treatment modifications as well as those with clinical complications. Comprehensive care should include subspecialist referrals when needed. Annual assessments include biochemical testing and monitoring for long-term complications. These guidelines provide a framework for monitoring patients with acute hepatic porphyrias to ensure optimal outcomes. (Hepatology 2017;66:1314–1322).

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^113YmcQt]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria acute attack management — Best Practice Advice 4 states that acute attacks of AHP that are severe enough to require hospital admission should be treated with intravenous hemin, given daily, preferably to a high-flow central vein. The currently approved treatment for acute attacks is intravenous hemin infusion, usually given once daily at a dose of 3–4 mg/kg body weight, typically for 4 days, and symptom relief typically requires 48–72 hours. A random urine for ALA, PBG, and creatinine should be collected before the start of hemin; due to lack of available rapid ALA or PBG tests, initiation of hemin can be made on empirical grounds in patients with confirmed AHP. Because of potential thrombophlebitis from hemin, it is best given into a high-flow central vein via a peripherally inserted central catheter or central port, and hemin bound to human serum albumin is preferred due to heme stabilization and less irritation to veins.

### Guide to porphyrias. A historical and clinical perspective [^113orjtC]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders of heme biosynthesis classified as neurovisceral, cutaneous, or mixed. A deficiency of any of the 8 enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway can lead to a variety of clinical symptoms. Classification depends on the defective enzyme. Porphyrias often are misdiagnosed because patients have vague symptoms. However, acute forms of porphyria can be life-threatening, so it is important to make an accurate diagnosis and initiate proper medical management. We discuss the history, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of porphyrias and then briefly describe the 8 types of porphyrias and their distinguishing features.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^111iFHfg]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 2: Initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring ALA, PBG, porphyrins, and creatinine in a random urine sample.

Diagnosis of symptomatic AHP requires biochemical testing. The hallmark of acute attacks is significantly elevated ALA and PBG in the urine or plasma. In all AHP except ALAD porphyria, PBG is elevated. During acute attacks, both ALA and PBG are elevated at least 5-fold the upper limit of normal. The levels are high enough that a random urine sample is sufficient and a 24-hour urine collection is not recommended. To adjust for differences in the degree of urinary concentration, ALA and PBG excretion should be normalized to that of creatinine. It is important to note that because ALA and PBG are porphyrin precursors, they are not included in tests of porphyrins, which typically measure porphyrins in urine or stool that have been separated and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Urine porphyrins should not be used alone as a screening test for AHP. Mild and nondiagnostic elevations in urinary porphyrins (secondary porphyrinurias) are often incorrectly interpreted as indicating AHP and lead to erroneous overdiagnosis.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^115tiqUF]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 3: Genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing.

Once the biochemical tests indicate AHP, confirmation of the specific type of AHP is usually established by genetic testing, with sequencing of the 4 genes ALAD, HMBS, CPOX, and PPOX leading to ALAD, AIP, HCP, and VP, respectively. When whole-gene sequencing is performed, 95%–99% of cases can be identified. First-degree family members should be screened with genetic testing once the familial pathogenic variant has been identified in the patient with AHP to identify patients at risk for acute attacks. Those who are mutation carriers should be counseled.

Although genetic testing is the gold standard for confirmation of diagnosis, it is not recommended for initial screening. Most carriers of pathogenic variants in AHP genes do not experience symptomatic acute attacks in their lifetimes. The estimated phenotypic penetrance of symptomatic disease is approximately 1% of AIP gene carriers, with a penetrance of > 20% in families with symptomatic patients.HCP and VP are reported to have lower penetrance than AIP. Even among patients with a confirmed pathogenic variant, attribution of clinical symptoms often benefits from biochemical confirmation (Table 2).

### Hemin (panhematin) [^111CrAvQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dosing

PANHEMATIN should only be used by or in consultation with physicians experienced in the management of porphyrias.
Before PANHEMATIN therapy is begun, the presence of acute porphyria must be diagnosed using the following criteria:
Presence of clinical symptoms suggestive of acute porphyric attack.
Quantitative measurement of porphobilinogen (PBG) in urine. The single-void urine sample should be refrigerated or frozen without additives and shielded from light for subsequent quantitative δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), PBG, and total porphyrin determinations. (Note: the classical Watson-Schwartz or Hoesch tests are considered to be less reliable).
Clinical benefit from PANHEMATIN depends on prompt administration. For mild porphyric attacks (mild pain, no vomiting, no paralysis, no hyponatremia, no seizures), a trial of glucose therapy is recommended while awaiting hemin treatment or if hemin is unavailable. For moderate to severe attacks, immediate hemin treatment is recommended. Symptoms of severe attacks are severe or prolonged pain, persistent vomiting, hyponatremia, convulsion, psychosis, and neuropathy. In addition to treatment with PANHEMATIN, consider other necessary measures such as the elimination of triggering factors.
The dose of PANHEMATIN is 1 to 4 mg/kg/day of hematin for 3 to 14 days based on the clinical signs. The standard dose in clinical practice is 3 to 4 mg/kg/day. In more severe cases this dose may be repeated no earlier than every 12 hours. Do not exceed 6 mg/kg of hematin in any 24 hour period. After reconstitution each mL of PANHEMATIN contains the equivalent of approximately 7 mg of hematin (see dosage calculation table below).

Monitor urinary concentrations of the following compounds during PANHEMATIN therapy. Effectiveness is demonstrated by a decrease in one or more of the following compounds.

ALA - δ-aminolevulinic acid

PBG - porphobilinogen

Uroporphyrin

Coproporphyrin

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of acute hepatic porphyrias: expert review [^115UQbwQ]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

The acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP) are rare, inborn errors of heme-metabolism and include acute intermittent porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, and porphyria due to severe deficiency of 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase. Acute intermittent porphyria is the most common type of AHP, with an estimated prevalence of patients with symptoms of approximately 1 in 100,000. The major clinical presentation involves attacks of severe pain, usually abdominal and generalized, without peritoneal signs or abnormalities on cross-sectional imaging. Acute attacks occur mainly in women in their childbearing years. AHP should be considered in the evaluation of all patients, and especially women aged 15–50 years with recurrent severe abdominal pain not ascribable to common causes. The screening tests of choice include random urine porphobilinogen and δ-aminolevulinic acid corrected to creatinine. All patients with elevations in urinary porphobilinogen and/or δ-aminolevulinic acid should initially be presumed to have AHP. The cornerstones of management include discontinuation of porphyrinogenic drugs and chemicals, administration of oral or intravenous dextrose and intravenous hemin, and use of analgesics and antiemetics. Diagnosis of AHP type can be confirmed after initial treatment by genetic testing for pathogenic variants in HMBS, CPOX, PPOX, and ALAD genes. AHP is also associated with chronic symptoms and long-term risk of systemic arterial hypertension, chronic renal and liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients who have recurrent acute attacks (4 or more per year) should be considered for prophylactic therapy with intravenous hemin or subcutaneous givosiran. Liver transplantation is curative and reserved for patients with intractable symptoms who have failed other treatment options.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Women aged 15–50 years with unexplained, recurrent severe abdominal pain without a clear etiology after an initial workup should be considered for screening for an AHP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Initial diagnosis of AHP should be made by biochemical testing measuring δ-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and creatinine on a random urine sample. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of AHP in patients with positive biochemical testing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Acute attacks of AHP that are severe enough to require hospital admission should be treated with intravenous hemin, given daily, preferably into a high-flow central vein. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In addition to intravenous hemin, management of acute attacks of AHP should include pain control, antiemetics, management of systemic arterial hypertension, tachycardia, and hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia, if present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Patients should be counseled to avoid identifiable triggers that may precipitate acute attacks, such as alcohol and porphyrinogenic medications. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Prophylactic heme therapy or givosiran, administered in an outpatient setting, should be considered in patients with recurrent attacks (4 or more per year). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Liver transplantation for AHP should be limited to patients with intractable symptoms and significantly decreased quality of life who are refractory to pharmacotherapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Patients with AHP should be monitored annually for liver disease. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with AHP, regardless of the severity of symptoms, should undergo surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma, beginning at age 50 years, with liver ultrasound every 6 months. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Patients with AHP on treatment should undergo surveillance for chronic kidney disease annually with serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Patients should be counseled on the chronic and long-term complications of AHP, including neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and need for long-term monitoring.

### Pivmecillinam (Pivya) [^113uhY7x]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Acute Porphyria

PIVYA is contraindicated in patients suffering from porphyria as pivmecillinam has been associated with acute attacks of porphyria [see Contraindications (4.3)]. These episodes may be life-threatening, and include symptoms and signs such as anxiety, confusion, limb or abdominal pain, hyponatremia, seizures, and muscle weakness.

5.5 Clostridioides difficile -Associated Diarrhea

Clostridioides difficile-a ssociated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents, including PIVYA, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial drugs alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B that contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use. Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplement, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.6 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing PIVYA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or for prophylaxis is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

5.7 Interference with Newborn Screening Test

Treatment of a pregnant individual with PIVYA prior to delivery may cause a false positive test for isovaleric acidemia in the newborn as part of newborn screening. Prompt follow-up of a positive newborn screening result for isovaleric acidemia is recommended.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: recommendations for diagnosis and management with real-world examples [^115oRaSL]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a group of four rare inherited diseases, each resulting from a deficiency in a distinct enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Characterized by acute neurovisceral symptoms that may mimic other medical and psychiatric conditions, lack of recognition of the disease often leads to a delay in diagnosis and initiation of effective treatment. Biochemical testing for pathway intermediates that accumulate when the disease is active forms the basis for screening and establishing a diagnosis. Subsequent genetic analysis identifies the pathogenic variant, supporting screening of family members and genetic counseling. Management of AHP involves avoidance of known exogenous and hormonal triggers, symptomatic treatment, and prevention of recurrent attacks. Here we describe six case studies from our own real-world experience to highlight current recommendations and challenges associated with the diagnosis and long-term management of the disease.

### ED presentation of acute porphyria [^116NxQAr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common complaint for visits to ED. Among the causes of abdominal pain, the acute porphyria may confuse emergency physicians. With wide range of unspecific symptoms and signs, acute porphyria is rarely considered as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in ED. Some patients even receive unnecessary surgery. There are 32 patients who visited the ED of National Taiwan University Hospital because of acute porphyric attacks over the past 13 years. Ten patients (3 males and 7 females) were diagnosed with acute porphyria for the first time at ED. The onset of age ranged from 17 to 55 years (mean, 32 years). All of our patients presented with abdominal pain but without fever, dermatologic, and neurologic symptoms that are typically presented in acute porphyria. On the average, most of them repeatedly sought for medical help because of persistent symptoms for 4 times before being definitely diagnosed and thus receiving the optimal treatment. Meanwhile, all patients needed at least 2 kinds of analgesic, and most of them needed narcotic analgesia for pain control before diagnosis. The most commonest point of tenderness is over epigastrium (7 of 10 patients). The laboratory and image studies of our patients were of no diagnostic value for acute porphyria, except for Watson-Schwartz test. In summary, our study revealed that when a patient after puberty with repetitive visits because of severe abdominal pain without reasonable causes and needs narcotics for pain control, acute porphyria should be taken into consideration.

Both ALA and PBG can be measured with high sensitivity and specificity. – Unfortunately, these tests are performed at large reference laboratories only, and results often require 1–2 weeks to be reported. Rapid, qualitative urine PBG tests have been available since the 1950s (Hoesch or Watson-Schwartz test), but their clinical use has been limited due to lack of use by most hospitals. Recently, a new rapid test for PBG was approved in the United States (Teco Diagnostics).

For most patients with AHP, those who experience only a few acute attacks in their lifetimes, testing for urine ALA, PBG, and creatinine is most useful during an acute attack. Unless the patient has been treated with intravenous hemin, testing for ALA and PBG can be performed days after the acute attack. Studies of patients with AIP found that ALA and PBG can remain elevated in urine for months to years after an acute attack. However, ALA and PBG levels can fall quickly after an acute attack in patients with HCP or VP. When testing is performed in patients with sporadic AIP when they are asymptomatic, 15%–44% can have normal urine ALA and PBG values. The same, or even higher, percentages are likely true for HCP and VP. In these patients, confirmatory testing may require repeat testing during an acute attack.

In the small population of patients with AHP with recurrent acute attacks, urine ALA and PBG are typically elevated even at baseline between acute attacks. In patients who have frequent symptoms suggestive of acute attacks, normal ALA and PBG levels likely rule out AHP as the etiology of the symptoms.

### Acute hepatic porphyrias: current diagnosis&management [^112XDm11]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Each of the four acute hepatic porphyrias is due to mutation of an enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. The accumulation of pathway intermediates that occur most notably when these diseases are active is the basis for screening and establishing a biochemical diagnosis of these rare disorders. Measurement of enzyme activities and especially DNA testing also are important for diagnosis. Suspicion of the diagnosis and specific testing, particularly measurement of urinary porphobilinogen, are often delayed because the symptoms are nonspecific, even when severe. Urinary porphyrins are also measured, but their elevation is much less specific. If porphobilinogen is elevated, second line testing will establish the type of acute porphyria. DNA testing identifies the familial mutation and enables screening of family members. Management includes removal of triggering factors whenever possible. Intravenous hemin is the most effective treatment for acute attacks. Carbohydrate loading is sometimes used for mild attacks. Cyclic attacks, if frequent, can be prevented by a GnRH analogue. Frequent noncyclic attacks are sometime preventable by scheduled (e.g. weekly) hemin infusions. Long term complications may include chronic pain, renal impairment and liver cancer. Other treatments, including RNA interference, are under development.

### Acute porphyrias in the USA: features of 108 subjects from porphyrias consortium [^114WDjwZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Recent descriptions of the clinical and laboratory features of subjects with acute porphyrias in the US are lacking. Our aim was to describe clinical, biochemical, and genetic features of 108 subjects.

Methods

Between September 2010 and December 2012, 108 subjects with acute porphyrias (90 acute intermittent porphyrias, 9 hereditary coproporphyrias, 9 variegate porphyrias) were enrolled into an observational study. Genetic testing was performed at a central genetic testing laboratory and clinical information entered into a central database. Selected features were compared with data for adults in the US.

Results

Most subjects (88/108, 81%) were female, with self-reported onset of symptoms in the second through fourth decades of life. The most common symptom was abdominal pain. Appendectomies and cholecystectomies were common before a diagnosis of porphyria. The diagnosis was delayed by a mean of 15 years. Anxiety and depression were common, and 18% complained of chronic symptoms, especially neuropathic and other pains. The incidences of systemic arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, seizure disorders, and psychiatric conditions were markedly increased. Mutations of the known causative genes were found in 102/105 of those tested, with novel mutations being found in 37, including in 7/8 subjects with hereditary coproporphyria. Therapy with intravenous hematin was the most effective therapy both for treatment of acute attacks and for prevention of recurrent attacks.

Conclusions

Acute porphyrias often remain undiagnosed for more than a decade after first symptoms develop. Intravenous hematin is the treatment of choice, both for treatment of acute attacks and for prevention of recurrent attacks.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published August 4, 2021 Classic symptoms and signs of acute intermittent porphyria include severe, episodic abdominal pain and constipation, transient psychiatric manifestations, hyponatremia, and discolored urine. Read the NEJM Clinical Problem-Solving Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: What causes acute intermittent porphyria. A: Porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders that result from defects in enzymes within the heme biosynthetic pathway. The most common are porphyria cutanea tarda, acute intermittent porphyria, and erythropoietic protoporphyria, in that order. Acute intermittent porphyria results from mutations in HMBS, the gene encoding hydroxymethylbilane synthase, which plays an integral role in heme synthesis. The disease manifests as acute attacks in which the heme pool in the liver is used up, leading to a buildup of δ-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen.

Q: What type of cancer screening is recommended in patients with any form of acute porphyria. A: Owing to the reported association between acute intermittent porphyria and hepatocellular carcinoma, experts recommend annual screening with hepatic ultrasonography as well as screening for alpha-fetoprotein starting at 50 years of age in patients with any form of acute porphyria. A: Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare disease. The disease has incomplete penetrance. The typical patient is a woman between the ages of 18 and 45 years. In a case series of 108 persons with acute intermittent porphyria, common symptoms included abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and anxiety and depression. Although symptoms were intermittent and acute in 55% of the patients, approximately 18% reported nearly constant symptoms, including chronic abdominal pain.

Common but nonspecific laboratory findings associated with the onset of an acute intermittent porphyria attack include hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, mild elevations of aminotransferase levels, and mild leukocytosis. In a cohort study from Sweden, researchers reported a significantly increased risk of diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder among persons with acute intermittent porphyria. Given the challenges of diagnosing acute intermittent porphyria, patients may receive a misdiagnosis with primary psychiatric conditions. A: Treatment of flares starts with intravenous administration of dextrose, which inhibits transcription of the gene encoding transhepatic 5′-aminolevulinate synthase 1. A high-carbohydrate diet has also been suggested in case reports, and parenteral opioids are sometimes used in managing pain.

However, up to 50% of patients may not report substantive improvement with opioids, and frequent or long-term use of opioids can have adverse effects, including the development of dependence. Hematin, administered intravenously, is also recommended; this treatment effectively bypasses the defective HMBS gene. Uncontrolled studies have suggested benefit, which may take up to 3 days; one small, placebo-controlled trial did not show clear evidence of benefit regarding symptoms of intermittent porphyria, but the trial was underpowered. Givosiran, an RNA interference therapy targeting ALAS1 messenger RNA, was recently approved for the prevention of porphyria flares on the basis of benefit reported in a phase 3 randomized trial in which givosiran significantly reduced the mean annual attack rate from 12. 5 to
3. 2 as compared with placebo.

### Phenobarbital sodium (Sezaby) [^113Uhj4A]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Phenobarbital-associated hypersensitivity reactions may include symptoms and signs such as rash, fever, facial or limb edema, and lymphadenopathy.

SEZABY is contraindicated in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity to phenobarbital or other barbiturates. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine) and hydantoins (e.g., phenytoin) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to SEZABY. If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions are present in a patient treated with SEZABY, the patient should be evaluated immediately and SEZABY should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

5.8 Exacerbation of Porphyria

SEZABY may precipitate acute attacks in patients with acute porphyrias. These episodes may be life-threatening, and include symptoms and signs such as anxiety, confusion, limb or abdominal pain, hyponatremia, seizures, and muscle weakness. Therefore, SEZABY is contraindicated in patients with acute porphyrias [see Contraindications (4)].

5.9 Infusion Site Reactions

SEZABY is highly alkaline [see Description (11)]. Therefore, extreme care should be taken to avoid perivascular extravasation or intra-arterial injection. Extravascular injection may cause local tissue damage with subsequent necrosis; consequences of intraarterial injection may vary from transient pain to gangrene of the limb. Any evidence of pain, swelling, discoloration, or temperature change in the limb warrants stopping the injection.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^115hK1Fz]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### Modern diagnosis and management of the porphyrias [^115hdYKZ]. British Journal of Haematology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the molecular understanding of the porphyrias now offer specific diagnosis and precise definition of the types of genetic mutations involved in the disease. Molecular diagnostic testing is powerful and very useful in kindred evaluation and genetic counselling when a disease-responsible mutation has been identified in the family. It is also the only way to properly screen asymptomatic gene carriers, facilitating correct treatment and appropriate genetic counselling of family members at risk. However, it should be noted that DNA-based testing is for the diagnosis of the gene carrier status, but not for the diagnosis of clinical syndrome or severity of the disease, e.g. an acute attack. For the diagnosis of clinically expressed porphyrias, a logical stepwise approach including the analysis of porphyrins and their precursors should not be underestimated, as it is still very useful, and is often the best from the cost-effective point of view.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^111rqzvb]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients

Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 years were eligible if they had a diagnosis of AIP, HCP, or VP made by a porphyria specialist. Diagnosis was based on a history of clinical manifestations of AHP (such as acute attacks of abdominal, back, or limb pain), biochemical evidence of an AHP attack (≥ 1 documented urine or plasma PBG level > 4 times the upper reference limit), and presence of a pathogenic genetic mutation. If no mutation had been identified by sequencing of relevant heme biosynthesis genes, patients were eligible if they had an AIP, HCP, or VP diagnosis made by a porphyria specialist, documented PBG elevation, and either decreased hydroxymethylbilane synthase activity in erythrocytes or increased fecal coproporphyrins with a ratio of coproporphyrin III/coproporphyrin I > 4 with or without elevation of fecal protoporphyrin.

Eligible patients had to be experiencing recurrent attacks defined by meeting one of the following: ≥ 3 porphyria attacks within 12 months before the baseline visit, monthly (or more frequent) prophylactic hemin treatment (regardless of attack frequency), or prophylactic gonadotropin‐releasing hormone analog treatment (regardless of attack frequency). At least one of the prior attacks had to require hemin or treatment at a hospital or in a health care setting (e.g. clinic or infusion center). Patients were excluded if they were actively participating in a clinical trial of an investigational product. Patients could also be excluded if they were not considered a good candidate for participation as judged by a study investigator.

### Sensitivity of international classification of diseases codes for hyponatremia among commercially insured outpatients in the United States [^114wvLUG]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, there has been only one published study of the validity of ICD-9-CM codes for the diagnosis of hyponatremia. Movig et al compared inpatient hospital discharge records with inpatient laboratory data and reported a sensitivity of 30% for even the strictest definition of hyponatremia (≤ 115 mmol/L). Positive predictive value for laboratory results showing serum sodium ≤ 135 mmol/L was 91.7%. The study did not address the validity of coding for hyponatremia outside the inpatient setting. Therefore, we sought to examine the validity of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for the identification of hyponatremia in an outpatient managed care population.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^112jDLPm]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition". Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition", and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition".
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition", and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition".

### Clinical guide and update on porphyrias [^115Gr7EN]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Physicians should be aware of porphyrias, which could be responsible for unexplained gastrointestinal, neurologic, or skin disorders. Despite their relative rarity and complexity, most porphyrias can be easily defined and diagnosed. They are caused by well-characterized enzyme defects in the complex heme biosynthetic pathway and are divided into categories of acute vs non-acute or hepatic vs erythropoietic porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyrias (acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) manifest in attacks and are characterized by overproduction of porphyrin precursors, producing often serious abdominal, psychiatric, neurologic, or cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria can present with skin photosensitivity. Diagnosis relies on measurement of increased urinary 5-aminolevulinic acid (in patients with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficient porphyria) or increased 5-aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen (in patients with other acute porphyrias). Management of attacks requires intensive care, strict avoidance of porphyrinogenic drugs and other precipitating factors, caloric support, and often heme therapy. The non-acute porphyrias are porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic protoporphyria, X-linked protoporphyria, and the rare congenital erythropoietic porphyria. They lead to the accumulation of porphyrins that cause skin photosensitivity and occasionally severe liver damage. Secondary elevated urinary or blood porphyrins can occur in patients without porphyria, for example, in liver diseases, or iron deficiency. Increases in porphyrin precursors and porphyrins are also found in patients with lead intoxication. Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda benefit from iron depletion, hydroxychloroquine therapy, and, if applicable, elimination of the hepatitis C virus. An α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analogue can reduce sunlight sensitivity in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Strategies to address dysregulated or dysfunctional steps within the heme biosynthetic pathway are in development.

Methods

Data collection

In this single-centre retrospective longitudinal observational cohort study, all patients with AIP attending the clinic of the Porphyria Center in the Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) between 1960 and 2016 were included. The diagnosis AIP was based on either a known HMBS gene mutation, or on positive biochemistry (defined as a delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) level at least four times the upper limit of normal) in combination with a decreased porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGd) enzyme activity measured in either erythrocytes or lymphocytes.

Data were collected by R. A.N. and J.G.L. from patients' electronic and paper records, and from self-reported questionnaires (Suppl. file 1). The patient charts and file data were first reviewed. When the retrospective data was unclear (e.g. due to old, poorly hand-written notes), a consensus was formed which was entered in the final database, or the data was discarded.

AIP patients with a proven diagnosis were eligible for inclusion. A confirmed acute porphyric attack was defined as an episode of abdominal pain in parallel with a significant rise in urinary ALA and PBG levels (≥ 4 times upper limit of normal) which necessitated a verified visit or admission to a hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Hospitalisations were defined as hospitalisations with a confirmed acute porphyric attack.

We collected data on (1) porphyria symptoms and long-term complications, (2) employment status, (3) hospitalisation episodes, hospitalisation days, amount and frequency of heme infusions (heme arginate, Normosang®, Orphan Europe), (4) heme dosage schedules, duration of prophylactic heme therapy, complications of heme therapy, placement of a Port-A-Cath® (PAC, Smiths Medical), oral contraception use, therapy with GnRH analogues, analgesia dependence and the age and cause of death. The annualised attack rate was defined as the number of attacks in all observed years of follow up, counting the number of confirmed acute porphyric attacks and dividing by the number of follow up years.

The medical ethics committee of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, approved prospective and retrospective data collection for this study (MEC 2014–593). Patients were asked to sign informed consent during visits to the outpatient clinic. Also, they have approved the use of anonymous retrospective medical data without informed consent.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^113ub5ko]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^1144eE85]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision) is the next major revision of the ICD by the World Health Organization (WHO). ICD-11 differs dramatically from historical versions, as it is based on an underlying semantic network of terms and meaning, called the Foundation. To function as a mutually exclusive and exhaustive statistical classification, ICD-11 creates derivative linearizations from the network that is a monohierarchy with residual categories such as Not Elsewhere Classified. ICD-11 also introduces the widespread post-coordination of terms, which allows for highly expressive representation of detailed patient descriptions. Phenotyping features are included in many subchapters or the signs and symptoms chapter. Composite phenotype descriptions of specific presentations or syndromes can be represented though post-coordination. Rare diseases are well represented in the Foundation, though not all appear in the relatively shallow linearization hierarchies.

### Key terms and definitions in acute porphyrias: results of an international Delphi consensus led by the European porphyria network [^113ehAbS]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute porphyrias are a group of rare inherited disorders causing acute neurovisceral attacks. Many terms used frequently in the literature and clinical practice are ambiguous, which can lead to confusion in the way patients are managed, studied, and reported in clinical studies. Agreed definitions are a necessary first step in developing management guidelines and will facilitate communication of results of future clinical research. The Delphi method was used to generate consensus on key terms and definitions in acute porphyria. The process started with a brainstorming phase offered to all members of the European Porphyria Network followed by two Delphi rounds among international experts in the field of porphyria (the Acute Porphyria Expert Panel). A consensus of 75% or more was defined as the agreement threshold. A total of 63 respondents from 26 countries participated in the brainstorming phase, leading to the choice of nine terms and definitions. A total of 34 experts were invited to take part in the Delphi rounds. Seven of the initial nine terms and definitions which entered the first Delphi round achieved the threshold for agreement. Following a second Delphi round, all nine definitions achieved agreement. Agreement on the definitions for nine important terms describing acute porphyrias represents a significant step forward for the porphyria community. It will facilitate more accurate comparison of outcomes among porphyria centres and in clinical trials and provide a strong framework for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^116FM4wi]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

One hundred fifteen patients (85%) withdrew before completing the 36‐month study period, primarily because of termination of the study by the sponsor (40%), patients leaving to enroll in another study (ENVISION) (15%), or patients leaving to receive givosiran outside of a clinical study (12%) (Figure 1). Of the 136 enrolled patients, 83 (61%), 37 (27%), and 21 (15%) completed 12, 24, and 36 months of the study period, respectively. Patients spent a median (range) duration of 14.6 (2.0–41.5) months in the study. Mean (SD) age of patients at enrollment was 41.0 (12.6) years. Most patients were female (90%), and most were white (85%) (Table 1). Most patients had AIP (90%), followed by VP (8%) and HCP (1%).

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^113FDxNv]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Systematically testing human HMBS missense variants to reveal mechanism and pathogenic variation [^116avJjA]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

The fact that AIP is a rare disorder, with attacks that are typically episodic and have nonspecific neurovisceral symptoms, can delay clinical recognition and intervention. In a symptomatic individual, biochemical diagnosis of AIP is based on demonstrating highly elevated plasma or urine levels of ALA and PBG, after excluding other acute porphyrias by analysis of porphyrin markers in urine and feces. Where a suspected AIP attack is not reported to clinicians in a timely fashion, however, biochemical diagnosis may be more complicated. Both in the latter scenario and more generally, sequencing the three acute porphyria genes (HMBS, CPOX [MIM:], and PPOX [MIM:]) to identify a causative variant in an individual with an acute porphyria can be useful. Sequencing has further utility in confirming diagnoses and identifying the HMBS variant causing AIP, which facilitates screening of healthy family members to identify individuals who are at-risk for AIP (i.e. have latent AIP). Those identified with latent AIP can then be recommended lifestyle and medication measures to reduce the risk of acute attacks and be monitored for development of long-term complications such as primary liver cancer. In recent years, HMBS has been included in gene panels both for inborn error of metabolism and familial liver cancer and has also been suggested to be a tumor-suppressor gene.

Out of the 472 clinical HMBS variants reported in ClinVar, 166 (35%) have been annotated as a "variant of uncertain significance" (VUSs), and most (69%) of these VUSs are missense variants. The increasing role of sequencing-based diagnostics underlines the importance of providing better tools for variant classification, especially for missense variants. Functional assays can provide strong evidence for clinical variant interpretation, but where they are performed at all, they are typically resource intensive. Moreover, functional assays are typically "reactive", performed only after (and often years after) the first clinical presentation of a variant. By contrast, computational methods can predict the impact of all missense variants "proactively", in advance of the first clinical presentation. Although computational predictors are steadily improving, this type of evidence is considered weak at best under current American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines.

### Ready or not! here comes ICD-10 [^114Brojh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) is a new system that is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on 16 January 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of 1 October 2013. While ICD-9 and ICD-10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains more than 141 000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the < 20 000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion and expense. Published statistics illustrate that there are instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 distinct ICD-10 codes. Also, there are multiple instances where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of healthcare whereas detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25 000 to $50 000.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^116WiGdk]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — coding and documentation: Women who meet the criteria for rUTI should have this diagnosis added to their problem list to help alert other providers and ensure best practices, and the International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is important for correct classification; the ICD-10 code of "positive urine culture" can be used instead of UTI or asymptomatic bacteriuria when a urine culture is positive but the clinical criteria are not met for a UTI.

### EXPLORE: a prospective, multinational, natural history study of patients with acute hepatic porphyria with recurrent attacks [^116JUmnR]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute hepatic porphyria comprises a group of rare genetic diseases caused by mutations in genes involved in heme biosynthesis. Patients can experience acute neurovisceral attacks, debilitating chronic symptoms, and long-term complications. There is a lack of multinational, prospective data characterizing the disease and current treatment practices in severely affected patients.

Approach and Results

EXPLORE is a prospective, multinational, natural history study characterizing disease activity and clinical management in patients with acute hepatic porphyria who experience recurrent attacks. Eligible patients had a confirmed acute hepatic porphyria diagnosis and had experienced ≥ 3 attacks in the prior 12 months or were receiving prophylactic treatment. A total of 112 patients were enrolled and followed for at least 6 months. In the 12 months before the study, patients reported a median (range) of 6 (0–52) acute attacks, with 52 (46%) patients receiving hemin prophylaxis. Chronic symptoms were reported by 73 (65%) patients, with 52 (46%) patients experiencing these daily. During the study, 98 (88%) patients experienced a total of 483 attacks, 77% of which required treatment at a health care facility and/or hemin administration (median [range] annualized attack rate 2.0 [0.0–37.0]). Elevated levels of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 messenger ribonucleic acid levels, δ-aminolevulinic acid, and porphobilinogen compared with the upper limit of normal in healthy individuals were observed at baseline and increased further during attacks. Patients had impaired quality of life and increased health care utilization.

Conclusions

Patients experienced attacks often requiring treatment in a health care facility and/or with hemin, as well as chronic symptoms that adversely influenced day-to-day functioning. In this patient group, the high disease burden and diminished quality of life highlight the need for novel therapies.

### Sensitivity of international classification of diseases codes for hyponatremia among commercially insured outpatients in the United States [^113qjCpX]. BMC Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

In contrast, the positive predictive value of outpatient claims for hyponatremia was also low (63% for serum sodium < 136 mmol/L). This finding may reflect the fact that hyponatremia is a chronic condition for some patients and is therefore likely to be noted on outpatient professional claims despite the fact that there are no observable laboratory claims within ± 15 days to support the diagnosis. The data used here, however, do not include sufficient detail to validate this hypothesis.

Although the impact of medications known to cause hyponatremia was not significant in the multivariable model, there was a trend toward less ICD-9-CM documentation of laboratory-identified hyponatremia in the presence of this factor. Outpatient claims for medications known to cause hyponatremia were observed within 60 days before through 15 days after 25% of all laboratory claims indicating hyponatremia. This finding suggests that some clinicians may choose not to code hyponatremia when it may be the result of drug therapy. Other results of the multivariable model also suggest that ICD-9-CM coding of laboratory-identified hyponatremia may be especially poor for patients with peripheral vascular disease or diabetes. Claims for members with these conditions were more than 40% less likely to have an ICD-9-CM code for hyponatremia.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^1149aNAt]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Hemin (panhematin) [^1168uToU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A physician-assessed clinical response was achieved for all acute attacks in 81 (73%) of 111 patients. Ninety-four patients (85%) of 111 had ≥ 1 clinical response and 17 patients (15%) of 111 had no response. Among 31 of 40 patients who received hemin prophylaxis for > 1 month, 21 (68%) did not require subsequent hemin treatment for acute attacks.

Case Reports

In 234 courses, patients received hemin therapy as normally prescribed by their physicians with the majority dosed between the recommended range of 3 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day for at least one course of treatment. In these patients, hemin treatment was administered immediately in 33% of recipients, within 1 day of symptom onset in 50%, and within 3 days in 75%. These groups were not mutually exclusive. Most patients [108/111 (97.3%)] received a dose of at least 3 mg/kg/day and only 3 patients (2.7%) received a dose of hemin less than 2 mg/kg/day. There were 6 patients (5.4%) who were administered doses exceeding 6 mg/kg/day for 1 or more treatment courses.

Observational Patient Reported Outcomes Study

An observational study investigated patient reported outcomes in 108 patients with acute porphyrias.7Out of 108 patients, 90 patients were with AIP and reported the following:

55% percent reported having received hemin during acute attacks, and 74% of these patients assessed PANHEMATIN therapy as very successful in the treatment of abdominal pain and other symptoms.
50% reported having received treatment with opiates during an acute attack, and 44% of these patients reported that opiates were effective.

Hemin therapy effectiveness was assessed along with glucose infusions, high carbohydrate diets, and pain medications on a scale from zero being least effective to 10 highly effective. Hemin infusions received a 7.9, glucose infusions a 4.4 (p = 0.0781), high carbohydrate diets a 4.7 (p = 0.0021), and pain medications a 4.2 (p = 0.0049).

### Systematically testing human HMBS missense variants to reveal mechanism and pathogenic variation [^114sNdZp]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we observed no significant correlation between functional impact scores and either age of disease onset or disease severity, we do not wish to suggest that this question is closed, absent more data and an accepted objective framework for classifying AIP severity. It would be interesting to investigate whether the functional impact scores are more predictive of age of onset or severity after stratifying by the presence or absence of known triggers.

The HMBS variant effects maps we provide could have immediate value in several clinical scenarios. First and most importantly, where an individual has been diagnosed with AIP on the basis of clinical and biochemical data but has an HMBS missense variant that would otherwise be classified as a VUS, a more definitive classification of the variant could enable cascade screening to identify family members with latent AIP. Second, where an individual has highly elevated ALA and PBG but does not have access to a laboratory capable of ruling out the two other acute porphyrias, identification of a definitively classified HMBS variant can establish the correct diagnosis. Third, where an individual has a clinical history consistent with AIP but timely measurements of porphyrin precursors in urine or plasma were not obtained or were inconclusive. Fourth, where an HMBS missense variant is revealed, e.g. through direct-to-consumer genome sequencing, and the client wishes to know if they should be vigilant for symptoms of AIP or avoid its known triggers. In each of these scenarios, a resulting diagnosis of AIP or latent AIP could have the cascading benefit of helping to identify additional cases of AIP or latent AIP in at-risk relatives, thereby increasing the number of individuals for whom vigilance, prevention, or therapy is supported.

In addition to providing a resource for the understanding of HMBS variation, this study also provides proof of principle for broader application of variant effect mapping to other genes associated with acute hepatic porphyria.

In conclusion, we strengthen the evidence that systematic proactive experimental evaluation of missense variant effects on human enzymes can reveal sequence-structure-function relationships and yield clinically relevant insights with potential to guide personalized clinical decisions.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^116Vtydx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.
