## Question

urea breath test versus egd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a comparison and decision framework between the urea breath test (UBT) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori and for post-treatment confirmation of eradication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk triage that determines noninvasive testing versus upfront endoscopy. Then, I should compare test performance and pre-analytic factors that alter accuracy. Next, I will map evidence-based decision rules to common scenarios, consider special circumstances and the need for susceptibility testing, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways and controversies.

> Let me first confirm how we triage patients by risk and indication because that drives whether we start with UBT or go straight to EGD. For uninvestigated dyspepsia without alarm features, test-and-treat with a noninvasive test is recommended in patients under about 60 years, whereas older age or alarm symptoms should prompt EGD; I initially thought the age cut-off might be 50, but I should correct that to < 60 years in ACG/CAG 2017, acknowledging variability across guidelines and regions [^114VG6H4]. I need to ensure we also remember that all patients with peptic ulcer disease should be tested for H. pylori and that EGD is necessary when malignancy, complicated ulcer, or high-risk lesions are suspected, including patients with gastric MALT lymphoma or after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, and that patients with gastric premalignant conditions or autoimmune gastritis warrant H. pylori testing and often endoscopic staging biopsies for surveillance strategy planning [^113uFeCT] [^114s86Z8] [^1162qAAE] [^116ov7Qz] [^111PiWC7] [^1114MVkz].

> Next, I should review UBT performance and practicalities. The 13C-UBT is a highly accurate, noninvasive test; in pretreatment settings sensitivities and specificities commonly exceed 90–95%, and with optimized low-dose protocols the 15 mg 13C-UBT achieved 100% post-treatment sensitivity and 98.9% specificity in a randomized study, supporting its role as the preferred test-of-cure when performed under appropriate washout conditions [^112Cniuv]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on alternatives; when UBT is unavailable, a locally validated monoclonal stool antigen assay is a reasonable substitute, though accuracy may be slightly lower and varies by assay and local validation, which I should confirm when advising a site-specific pathway [^116MLFEb] [^1175pAKJ]. I need to ensure I remember that post-eradication testing should be delayed at least 4 weeks after therapy completion and done off PPIs to avoid false negatives [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU].

> I will now examine EGD-based modalities and their strengths and limitations. Rapid urease testing (RUT) and histology are accurate in many settings if sampling is adequate from both antrum and corpus, and EGD uniquely provides visualization for ulcers, neoplasia, and mapping biopsies for OLGA/OLGIM staging when indicated; however, they require sedation, facilities, and are more resource-intensive and susceptible to PPI-related false negatives without proper washout, which I should double-check before scheduling endoscopy [^114pRzfP] [^114mFbpG] [^114PKkEA] [^116jqUr8]. Let me verify biopsy strategies and downstream testing: paired antrum and corpus biopsies increase RUT yield and can be repurposed for PCR-based detection and clarithromycin resistance mutations, while formal culture from both sites improves recovery and enables full susceptibility testing, albeit with logistical burdens and variable success rates [^114Ss8xW] [^1136pjX5] [^115VwXCF] [^111Zk8i3].

> Hold on, I should lay out the decision rules clearly. In uninvestigated dyspepsia without alarm features and under about 60 years, start with noninvasive testing, typically UBT, treat if positive, and reserve EGD for nonresponders or evolving red flags; a randomized trial showed noninvasive UBT management was as effective and safe as EGD with testing, with only about 8% later needing endoscopy, which reassures me about safety in low-risk triage [^114VG6H4] [^112XzUDW]. For test-of-cure, I need to ensure a UBT or stool antigen is done at least 4 weeks post-therapy and after holding PPIs, antibiotics, and bismuth for the recommended washout intervals; UBT is preferred when available, and serology should be avoided for cure confirmation because antibodies persist [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU]. If alarm features, older age, suspected ulcers or cancer, or high-risk lesions are present, proceed directly to EGD with appropriate biopsies rather than relying on noninvasive testing [^113uFeCT] [^114s86Z8].

> But wait, what if special circumstances alter test performance. In acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, I initially assumed biopsy tests would be fine, but I should correct that: RUT, histology, and culture have reduced sensitivity, whereas UBT generally retains higher sensitivity and specificity in this setting, though performance is still imperfect; repeating testing after stabilization can be prudent [^113h5Rx8]. Let me consider postsurgical anatomy: after partial gastrectomy, UBT sensitivity falls to roughly 0.77, so EGD with histology and RUT may be preferred for accurate diagnosis in the postoperative stomach, which I should verify when operative history is present [^115z8uKn]. In children and pregnancy, I need to ensure use of 13C-UBT (not 14C) with pediatric protocols and adjusted cutoffs, given high accuracy even in very young children, and avoid radiation exposure in pregnancy [^114qvoLJ] [^1173KbMT]. Hmm, wait a minute — PPIs are not the only culprits; H2 blockers like ranitidine can also yield false-negative UBTs, so I should review acid suppression history and timing before testing [^115PquBZ].

> I should confirm when antimicrobial susceptibility is needed and how to obtain it. After treatment failure or in areas with high macrolide resistance, EGD with biopsies for culture or molecular testing provides actionable susceptibility data to guide salvage regimens; reuse of RUT biopsy material for PCR can streamline this without extra biopsies, but I need to verify local lab capabilities and shipping logistics because culture yield and turnaround can be limiting [^111Zk8i3] [^114Ss8xW] [^1136pjX5] [^115VwXCF]. Let me reconsider one nuance: although very high post-treatment UBT delta values may correlate with clarithromycin resistance, that signal is not definitive, so I should avoid overinterpreting UBT semiquantitative outputs when precise susceptibility is required [^1136pjX5].

> Next, I should review operational and cost considerations without overpromising. Point-of-care and continuous-measurement UBT devices can deliver results within 6–14 minutes, supporting efficient outpatient workflows, whereas biopsy-based testing often has delayed final readouts; however, UBT requires specialized analyzers, and endoscopy requires suites, sedation, and pathology resources, so local availability may tilt strategy one way or the other [^113KRouR] [^116rgzps]. I should double-check the economic narrative: while test-and-treat pathways can reduce unnecessary endoscopy in low-risk patients as seen in trial settings, real-world adoption of open-access UBT has sometimes coincided with increased endoscopy volumes, reflecting complex demand dynamics and triage practices, so institutional data should be consulted [^112XzUDW] [^1175uEUt].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm. For low-risk uninvestigated dyspepsia under about 60 years without alarm features, perform UBT off PPIs, antibiotics, and bismuth; treat if positive and confirm eradication ≥ 4 weeks after therapy with UBT or stool antigen where UBT is unavailable, while reserving EGD for nonresponders or evolving alarms; I need to ensure serology is avoided for test-of-cure due to persistence of antibodies [^114VG6H4] [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU] [^116MLFEb]. For alarm features, older age thresholds per local guideline, suspected peptic ulcer complications, MALT lymphoma, or post-resection early gastric cancer, proceed directly to EGD with biopsies for diagnosis, staging, and H. pylori testing; if initial therapy fails or resistance is likely, add culture and/or PCR for susceptibility on antrum and corpus samples to guide salvage [^113uFeCT] [^114s86Z8] [^116ov7Qz] [^115VwXCF] [^1136pjX5]. For autoimmune gastritis or other premalignant conditions, test and eradicate H. pylori using nonserologic methods, and plan endoscopic mapping biopsies and surveillance per premalignant risk, which I should confirm with local protocols [^1114MVkz] [^111PiWC7].

> Finally, key takeaways and cautions. UBT is the preferred noninvasive test for initial diagnosis in low-risk patients and for post-treatment confirmation given its high accuracy and patient acceptability, provided adequate medication washout is observed; stool antigen is an acceptable alternative where UBT is unavailable, but I should verify local assay performance [^112Cniuv] [^1175pAKJ] [^116MLFEb]. EGD is indispensable when cancer or complicated ulcer disease is suspected, when endoscopic staging is needed, or when antimicrobial susceptibility must be obtained after treatment failure; access to molecular and culture testing is improving, but pre-analytic and logistical factors still affect yield and turnaround, which I must keep in mind when planning salvage therapy [^111Zk8i3] [^115VwXCF] [^1136pjX5]. I should double-check that we avoid serology for active diagnosis and especially for test-of-cure in modern pathways, aligning with Choosing Wisely and infectious-disease framing of H. pylori management to ensure we confirm active infection and eradication appropriately [^111RYmTc] [^111Zk8i3].

The urea breath test (UBT) is a **non-invasive, highly accurate** [^112Cniuv] method for detecting active H. pylori infection, with sensitivity and specificity typically > 90% [^11782447] [^117K2j2x]. It is **preferred for initial diagnosis and post-eradication confirmation** in patients without alarm features or when endoscopy is not indicated [^114VG6H4] [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU]. EGD is **invasive and comprehensive**, allowing direct visualization with biopsy and histology for H. pylori detection and assessment of mucosal pathology [^116jqUr8]; it is indicated for alarm symptoms, refractory dyspepsia, or suspected complications [^114VG6H4] [^113uFeCT]. UBT can yield false negatives after recent PPI, antibiotic, or bismuth use [^114LFUCU] [^115QeLvf], whereas EGD carries procedural risks and higher costs [^112XzUDW] [^117JeknJ]. The choice depends on clinical context, patient factors, and resource availability [^111Zk8i3].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy

**UBT** shows sensitivity and specificity > 90% for active H. pylori infection [^112Cniuv] [^117K2j2x], while **EGD** relies on histology and rapid urease testing (RUT) from biopsies to provide high accuracy [^116jqUr8], with histology as the gold standard [^114pRzfP].

---

## Clinical indications

| **Clinical scenario** | **Preferred test** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection in patients without alarm symptoms | UBT | Non-invasive, accurate, and patient-friendly [^114VG6H4] [^112XzUDW] |
| Post-eradication confirmation of H. pylori infection | UBT | Non-invasive and reliable for confirming eradication [^115gTief] [^114LFUCU] |
| Patients with alarm symptoms (e.g. weight loss, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding) | EGD | Allows direct visualization and biopsy of mucosal lesions [^113uFeCT] |

## Advantages and limitations

### Urea breath test (UBT)

Advantages include non-invasiveness, high accuracy [^112Cniuv], patient-friendliness with rapid results [^112XzUDW], and suitability for initial diagnosis and post-eradication testing [^114VG6H4] [^115gTief], whereas **Limitations** include risk of false negatives with recent PPI, antibiotic, or bismuth use [^114LFUCU] [^115QeLvf], limited availability in some settings [^117JeknJ], and inability to provide mucosal visualization or biopsy [^111Zk8i3].

---

### Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)

Advantages include direct mucosal visualization, biopsy capability, and comprehensive evaluation of gastrointestinal pathology [^116jqUr8] [^114pRzfP]; **Limitations** include invasiveness, higher cost, procedural risks (e.g. bleeding, perforation), and patient discomfort [^112XzUDW] [^114s86Z8].

---

## Patient comfort and safety

**UBT** is **non-invasive** with minimal discomfort and no procedural risks, whereas **EGD** is **invasive**, may cause discomfort, and carries procedural risks (e.g. bleeding, perforation) [^112XzUDW].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

**UBT** is generally **more cost-effective** for initial diagnosis and post-eradication testing due to lower costs and non-invasiveness [^115CckPZ], whereas **EGD** typically incurs **higher costs** because of its invasiveness, procedural risks, and the need for specialized equipment and personnel [^112XzUDW] [^117JeknJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines **recommend UBT** for initial diagnosis and post-eradication confirmation in patients without alarm symptoms or suspected complications [^114VG6H4] [^115gTief], and **EGD** for those with alarm symptoms, refractory dyspepsia, or suspected complications (e.g. ulcers, malignancy) [^113uFeCT] [^116jqUr8].

---

## Summary table: UBT vs. EGD

| **Parameter** | **UBT** | **EGD** |
|-|-|-|
| Invasiveness | Non-invasive | Invasive |
| Accuracy | High (> 90%) [^112Cniuv] | High (histology gold standard) [^116jqUr8] |
| Patient comfort | High [^112XzUDW] | Lower [^112XzUDW] |
| Procedural risks | Minimal [^112XzUDW] | Moderate (bleeding, perforation) [^114s86Z8] |
| Cost-effectiveness | High [^115CckPZ] | Lower [^117JeknJ] |
| Clinical indications | Initial diagnosis, post-eradication testing [^114VG6H4] [^115gTief] | Alarm symptoms, refractory dyspepsia, suspected complications [^113uFeCT] |

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114LFUCU]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Statement 7: Posteradication treatment testing must be performed. If gastroscopy is not required, a urea breath test is recommended for posteradication treatment testing. If the urea breath test is unavailable, the monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative if locally validated.

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high. In line with Maastricht VI guidelines, testing for H. pylori eradication should be performed at least 4–6 weeks following the completion of any therapy for H. pylori. This period of time is required to exclude the possibility of bacterial suppression leading to false negative results. The UBT is recommended for posteradication testing where available. The monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative (see statement 2). As antibodies to H. pylori persist for months following infection, serology is not recommended for eradication confirmation. If endoscopy is performed, biopsy sampling should be performed as described in statements 3–5.

Statement 8: Proton pump inhibitors significantly reduce the accuracy of the recommended H. pylori tests; therefore, proton pump inhibitors should be stopped 14 days before testing unless PCR testing is available.

Recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high. PPIs should be avoided 2 weeks before diagnostic testing by the UBT, stool antigen test, histology, the RUT, or culture as they decrease the bacterial load, thus increasing the risk of false negative results. However, the working group notes that as PPIs are now available over the counter, many patients do not avoid PPIs before H. pylori testing.

### Accuracy of breath tests using low doses of 13C-urea to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection: a randomised controlled trial [^112Cniuv]. Gut (2006). High credibility.

The 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection is a non-invasive method based on the organism's urease activity. Since its first description, the method has been extensively modified. However, only the dose of 13C-urea and the measurement equipment are directly related to the cost of the test.

- **Aims**:
	(1) To assess the diagnostic accuracy before eradication therapy of three UBTs using 25, 15, and 10 mg of 13C-urea, respectively; and
	(2) To determine diagnostic performance in the post-eradication setting, showing the highest values for sensitivity and specificity with the lowest dose of 13C-urea.

- **Methods**:
	- Three hundred consecutive patients were randomized to be tested with one of the three UBTs. All patients underwent upper endoscopy with biopsies. A total of 222 more patients were enrolled to evaluate the second aim. Infected patients were offered treatment and asked to return 4–6 weeks after the end of therapy to perform endoscopic follow-up and to carry out 13C-UBT.

- **Results**:
	- In the pretreatment setting, 13C-UBT 25 mg had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91.8–100) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 93.7–100); 13C-UBT 15 mg had a sensitivity of 96.1% (95% CI 86.8–98.9) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 92.6–100); and 13C-UBT 10 mg had a sensitivity of 89.1% (95% CI 77–95.3) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 93.3–100). As the test with the best performance and the lowest dose of 13C-urea was 13C-UBT 15 mg, it was evaluated after treatment, reporting a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 79.6–100) and a specificity of 98.9%.

### Diagnostic approach to-related gastric oncogenesis [^11782447]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The principal noninvasive testing method in use is the urea breath test (UBT), which is a safe, readily available, accurate, and cost-effective method for H. pylori testing, with the highest sensitivity (up to 94%). Like all noninvasive methods, it is suitable for patients who have contraindications for conventional endoscopy and subsequent biopsy specimens. Patients are given a test meal enriched with carbon (13 C or 14 C), supplemented with substances such as citric acid or dietary supplements, which inhibit gastric emptying to extend the time in the stomach. The concentration of CO2 is then measured in the exhaled air.

- **Mass spectrometry**: Exhaled 13 CO2 is estimated by mass spectrometry, which yields quick, in-office results, while 14 CO2 must be processed by a nuclear medicine laboratory. 13 C is preferred for children and pregnant women because it is harmless, even though the radiation exposure of 14 C is comparable to a person's daily radiation exposure.

- **False results**: False-positive results can occur in the presence of a microbiome capable of producing urease, such as Helicobacter heilmannii, due to urease activity; contamination with oral flora; and/or in achlorhydria due to the lack of inhibition of bacterial growth other than H. pylori species (e.g. Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus). False-negative test results can occur through a reduction in H. pylori gastric diversity, which is reported for antibiotics, bismuth compounds, and PPIs. Specifically, decreased sensitivity occurs in the setting of active gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection by means of reduced-dose ¹³C-urea breath test and early sampling of exhaled breath [^1173KbMT]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the reduced-dose ¹³C-urea breath test (¹³C-UBT) and early sampling of exhaled breath for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection in children and adolescents.

- **Methods**: Patients up to 20 years old who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with gastric biopsies were included. The ¹³C-UBT was performed following a 4-hour fasting period with sampling at four time points: baseline (T₀), and 10, 20, and 30 minutes (T₁₀, T₂₀, and T₃₀) after ingesting 25 mg ¹³C-urea diluted in 100 mL of apple juice. Infection status was defined by positive culture or concomitant positive histology and rapid urease test, while absence was confirmed by negative results on all three tests. Exhaled breath samples were analyzed with an isotope-selective infrared spectrometer, and a receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis defined delta over baseline (DOB) cutoff values.

- **Results**: A total of 129 patients aged between 2.1 and 19 years (median 11.6 years; mean age ± standard deviation 11.5 ± 3.8 years; female to male ratio 85:44) were included. The prevalence of infection was 41.1%. Sensitivity (S) and specificity (Sp) were calculated at different time points: at T₁₀ (cutoff DOB 2.55‰), S was 94.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.9–98.5) and Sp was 96.8% (95% CI 93.4–100); at T₂₀ (DOB 2.5‰), S was 96.2% (95% CI 92.9–99.5) and Sp was 96.1% (95% CI 93.7–99.8); and at T₃₀ (DOB 1.6‰), S was 96.2% (95% CI 92.9–99.5) and Sp was 94.7% (95% CI 90.8–98.6).

Low-dose ¹³C-U analysis concluded in the study with high sensitivity and specificity across all time points.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^114mFbpG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

There has been significant technical progress in diagnostic tools for GI diseases. Advanced endoscopy with image-enhanced modalities and magnification allows diagnosis of gastritis with a high degree of accuracy, even before histological confirmation. Furthermore, non-invasive diagnostic tests such as the [13 C]-urea breath test, fecal antigen test, and serological parameters serve as surrogate markers of H. pylori gastritis and indicators of gastritis severity. Classification systems for grading gastritis, such as the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM), have also been proposed, in addition to the internationally accepted Sydney System, and their utility needs to be evaluated and agreed upon.

In 2013, the Japanese government insurance policy approved eradication therapy for H. pylori-positive gastritis after endoscopic examination, to exclude more serious diseases such as ulcer and cancer, in line with the Japanese guidelines for H. pylori management. However, no global consensus has been published on when to recommend eradication therapy for H. pylori gastritis and how to follow up after eradication.

Since the global awareness of gastritis is still confounded by a number of controversial issues as described above, a meeting was set up in Kyoto to achieve global consensus on H. pylori gastritis; to attempt conceptual changes in gastritis classification in general; to agree on diagnosis and management strategies with special reference to FD and cancer prevention.

### Management of helicobacter pylori infection [^111iiweC]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the cause of most peptic ulcer disease and a primary risk factor for gastric cancer. Eradication of the organism results in ulcer healing and reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence and complications. Testing and treatment have no clear value in patients with documented non-ulcer dyspepsia; however, a test-and-treat strategy is recommended for patients with undifferentiated dyspepsia who have not undergone endoscopy.

In the office setting, initial serology testing is practical and affordable, with endoscopy reserved for patients with alarm symptoms for ulcer complications or cancer, or those who do not respond to treatment. Treatment involves 10- to 14-day multidrug regimens, including antibiotics and acid suppressants, combined with education about avoidance of other ulcer-causing factors and the need for close follow-up. Follow-up testing (i.e. urea breath or stool antigen test) is recommended for patients who do not respond to therapy or those with a history of ulcer complications or cancer.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^112sHfyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

For those with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection following unsuccessful eradication attempts, there is no evidence-based guideline on appropriate follow-up. The IHPWG consensus is that endoscopic surveillance with ESGE-recommended mapping biopsies for precancerous changes should be considered at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed treatment.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: low.

Mainly due to poor patient compliance and the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, H. pylori treatment failure has become more common, leading to challenges in H. pylori management. Over decades, H. pylori gastritis may progress through a cascade of precancerous stages from intestinal metaplasia, followed by dysplasia and finally carcinoma. Evidence-based recommendations on the management of persistent H. pylori infection following multiple eradication attempts are lacking. While biomarkers for precancerous changes are under investigation, none can currently be recommended for routine clinical use. The IHPWG consensus recommends endoscopic surveillance with the European Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/management of epithelial precancerous conditions and lesions in the stomach mapping biopsies for precancerous changes at an interval of 5–10 years from the last failed H. pylori eradication attempt to monitor for signs of mucosal progression. In addition, the development of new symptoms at any stage during follow-up, especially any alarm symptoms, should trigger further assessment.

### Accuracy of Helicobacter pylori diagnostic tests in patients with bleeding peptic ulcer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113h5Rx8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of different tests aimed at detecting Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

- **Selection of studies**: The study focused on assessing the accuracy of H. pylori diagnostic methods in patients with UGIB.

- **Search strategy**: The researchers conducted electronic bibliographical searches to identify relevant studies.

- **Data extraction**: Data were independently extracted by two reviewers.

- **Data synthesis**: Meta-analyses of the different tests were performed by combining the sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of the individual studies.

- **Results**: Studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+ and LR- (95% confidence interval (CI)) for the different methods were as follows:

- **Rapid urease test** (16 studies/1,417 patients): Sensitivity 0.67 (0.64–0.70), specificity 0.93 (0.90–0.96), LR+ 9.6 (5.1–18.1), and LR- 0.31 (0.22–0.44).
- **Histology** (10 studies/827 patients): Sensitivity 0.70 (0.66–0.74), specificity 0.90 (0.85–0.94), LR+ 6.7 (2.5–18.4), and LR- 0.23 (0.12–0.46).
- **Culture** (3 studies/314 patients): Sensitivity 0.45 (0.39–0.51), specificity 0.98 (0.92–1.00), LR+ 19.6 (4–96), and LR- 0.31 (0.05–1.9).
- **Urea breath test** (8 studies/520 patients): Sensitivity 0.93 (0.90–0.95), specificity 0.92 (0.87–0.96), LR+ 9.5 (3.9–23.3), and LR- 0.11 (0.07–0.16).
- **Stool antigen test** (6 studies/377 patients): Sensitivity 0.87 (0.82–0.91), specificity 0.70 (0.62–0.78), LR+ 2.3 (1.4–4), and LR- 0.2 (0.13–0.3).
- **Serology** (9 studies/803 patients): Sensitivity 0.88 (0.85–0.90), specificity 0.69 (0.62–0.75), LR+ 2.5 (1.6–4.1), and LR- 0.25 (0.19–0.33).

The conclusion of the study indicated that biopsy-based methods, such as the rapid urease test, histology, and culture, have low sensitivity but high specificity in patients with UGIB. The accuracy of these methods varies, underlining the need for careful selection depending on the clinical context.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the management of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116jqUr8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Helicobacter pylori infection, especially in relation to the choice of diagnostic test, the ACG 2007 guidelines recommend obtaining a rapid urease test during endoscopy. This is considered an accurate and inexpensive method for identifying H. pylori infection in patients not taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within 1–2 weeks, or an antibiotic or bismuth within 4 weeks of endoscopy.

### Diagnostic performance of urea breath test, rapid urea test, and histology for Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with partial gastrectomy: a meta-analysis [^115z8uKn]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulceration and particularly residual stomach cancer in the postoperative stomach. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of different commonly used tests for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection in patients after partial gastrectomy.

- **Methods**: A systematic literature search was conducted by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect databases with relevant keywords. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were conducted for the performance of the different tests, including sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios (LRs), diagnostic odds ratio, and the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. The meta-analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc software.

- **Results**: Studies showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR-, and diagnostic odds ratio for the different methods were:
	- Urea breath test (9 studies): Sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72–0.82), specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85–0.93), LR+ of 6.32 (95% CI, 3.22–12.42), LR- of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17–0.43), and diagnostic odds ratio of 27.86 (95% CI, 13.27–58.49).
	- Rapid urease test (7 studies): Sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.84), specificity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90–0.97), LR+ of 10.21 (95% CI, 5.94–17.54), LR- of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.22–0.36), and diagnostic odds ratio of 49.02 (95% CI, 24.24–99.14).
	- Histology (3 studies): Sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88–0.97), specificity of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73–0.93), LR+ of 5.88 (95% CI, 3.26–10.60), LR- of 0.09 (95% CI, 0.05–0.15), and diagnostic odds ratio of 97.28 (95% CI, 34.30–275.95).

### Gastroscopic real-time 13c-urea breath test [^116rgzps]. Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Biopsy-based Helicobacter urease testing (HUT) may constitute a hazard in patients with bleeding disorders, those receiving anticoagulant therapy, and those with communicable diseases. In addition, definitive test results may not immediately be available. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of breath testing for H. pylori during gastroscopy (gastroscopic breath testing, GBT) in comparison with the standard HUT in a prospective, randomized, and controlled study.

- **Patients and methods**: A total of 119 patients were randomly allocated to undergo H. pylori testing with either HUT (n = 61) or GBT (n = 58) with 75 mg of 13C-labeled urea by endoscopic instillation. Breath samples were continuously analyzed using molecular correlation spectroscopy, displaying real-time results. The procedure time and time until definitive test results were obtained (mean plus or minus standard deviation) were recorded.

- **Results**: H. pylori was detected in 10 of 49 patients (20.4%) with HUT and in 16 of 53 (30.2%) with GBT. Contraindications to biopsy prevented HUT in 12 of 61 patients. GBT results could not be obtained in one of the 58 patients due to respiratory disease and in four for technical reasons. Slightly less time was required to carry out HUT than GBT (121 ± 30 s vs. 164 ± 36 s; P < 0.001). Definitive test results were available within 14.0 ± 2.2 min using GBT in comparison with 19.6 ± 9.1 h for HUT (P < 0.001). GBT prolonged the time spent by the patient in the endoscopy room by only 5.6 min in comparison with HUT (45.1 ± 8.5 min).

### Serology is more sensitive than urea breath test or stool antigen for the initial diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori gastritis when compared with histopathology [^111qzqmz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). High credibility.

To assess the concordance and performance characteristics of Helicobacter pylori laboratory tests compared with histopathology, an evaluation was conducted over a 12-year period, involving 2,560 cases within a health system. The study analyzed diagnostic performance, adjusting for treatment and consensus histopathologic diagnoses among pathologists. Additionally, markers of access to care, such as test cancellation frequency and turnaround time, were assessed. Costs and performance of candidate noninvasive testing algorithms were modeled as a function of disease prevalence.

Serum H. pylori IgG demonstrated a higher sensitivity (0.94) than both urea breath and stool antigen tests (0.64 and 0.61, respectively). An advantage in access to care for serology was evidenced by a lower cancellation rate. Interobserver variability was higher (κ = 0.34) among pathologists for cases with discordant laboratory tests than for concordant cases (κ = 0.56). A model testing algorithm utilizing serology for first-time diagnoses minimizes diagnostic error.

Although H. pylori serology has modestly lower specificity than other noninvasive tests, its superior sensitivity and negative predictive value support its use as a noninvasive test to rule out H. pylori infection. Reflexive testing with positive serology, followed by either a stool antigen or urea breath test, may optimize diagnostic accuracy in low-prevalence populations.

### Histological examination of ulcer margin for diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers [^1156GirJ]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Biopsy of the ulcer margin is routinely performed to exclude malignancy in patients with gastric ulcers, but its utility in diagnosing Helicobacter pylori infection has not yet been fully studied. A cohort of 50 patients with gastric ulcers was prospectively examined. Three tests, including histology, the rapid urease test, and the urea breath test, were performed on all patients for diagnosing H. pylori infection. Six biopsied specimens from the margin of the gastric ulcer and one specimen each from the antrum and body of the non-ulcer part were obtained for histology using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) stain. The criterion used for defining H. pylori infection was a positive result in at least two of the three tests. H. pylori infection was diagnosed in 27 (54%) of the patients.

- **Diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy**: The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the histological examination of the ulcer margin were 92.6%, 95.7%, 96.2%, 91.7%, and 94%, respectively. The addition of one specimen from the antrum or body, or a combination of the two specimens, did not increase the diagnostic yields of those for histological examination of the ulcer margin alone. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for the rapid urease test were 96.3%, 100%, 100%, 95.8%, and 98%, respectively. The corresponding values for the urea breath test were 88.9%, 87%, 88.9%, 87%, and 88%.

We performed Giemsa stain for the three patients with false-negative and false-positive results in the histological examination of the ulcer margin using H&E stain, and all were [The sentence is incomplete and thus omitted].

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management of infections [^111Zk8i3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The diagnosis of H. pylori infection requires tests that can confirm active infection. Serology tests are excluded because they cannot differentiate between active infection and past infection markers, known as serologic scars. Tests used to detect active infection include the urea breath test, stool antigen test, histology with (immune)-staining, culture, and molecular tests identifying H. pylori DNA in specimens like stools or gastric biopsies.

- **Endoscopy and susceptibility testing**: The availability of susceptibility testing plays a crucial role, as it helps determine not only the presence of an infection but also the antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Traditionally, this process involved endoscopy to collect gastric mucosa biopsies, followed by culture and susceptibility testing, which many laboratories did not provide. Despite gastroenterologists being prepared to perform endoscopies, the scarcity of laboratories willing to conduct these tests was a significant barrier. In the past year, however, this has improved in the United States with most major diagnostic laboratories now offering H. pylori culture and susceptibility testing.

- **Challenges and limitations**: Despite easier access to culture and susceptibility testing, the requirement for endoscopy remains unchanged. Obtaining and processing gastric biopsies is both time-consuming and costly. Additionally, effective results are not always guaranteed since positive outcomes are obtained in fewer than 100% of cases, especially when specimens must be shipped to distant locations.

There is a need for practical, rapid, less expensive, and non-invasive alternatives to current diagnostic methods to improve treatment outcomes for H. pylori infections.

### Comparison of three stool antigen assays with the 13C-urea breath test for the primary diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and monitoring treatment outcome [^116MLFEb]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The urea breath test (UBT) is the gold-standard non-invasive test for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection; however, the lack of availability of the UBT due to the high cost of the test and the need for expensive analytical instrumentation limits the usefulness of this method. Stool antigen assays may offer an alternative non-invasive method for diagnosing infection.

- **Objective**: To compare the accuracy of three stool antigen assays (HpSA, IDEIA HpStAR, and ImmunoCard STAT) against the UBT for the primary diagnosis of H. pylori infection and for monitoring treatment outcomes.

- **Methods**: A total of 102 patients attending two gastroenterology day-case clinics for the investigation of dyspepsia were included. Each patient provided breath and stool samples for analysis. Patients who tested positive for H. pylori by the validated UBT were prescribed triple therapy and invited to return for repeat breath and stool sample analysis 6 weeks post-treatment.

- **Results**: Of the 102 patients tested, 48 were diagnosed with H. pylori infection by the UBT. The HpSA assay interpreted 38 of these as positive (79% sensitive). Of the 54 UBT-negative patients, the HpSA assay interpreted all 54 as negative (100% specific). The IDEIA HpStAR assay correctly identified 44 patients as positive (92% sensitive) and 50 as negative (92.5% specific). The ImmunoCard STAT assay interpreted 38 patients as positive (79% sensitive) and 52 as negative (96.3% specific).

- **Conclusion**: The findings indicate that the IDEIA HpStAR stool antigen kit is the most accurate assay of the three tested.

### Initial treatment with lansoprazole in young dyspeptic patients with negative urea breath test result: A randomized controlled trial with 12-month follow-up [^115hvdyr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). High credibility.

Although empirical antisecretory drug therapy is recommended for young dyspeptic patients without alarming features, the effectiveness of this approach remains undetermined. We evaluated the long-term effects of an initial 12-week course of lansoprazole in young dyspeptic patients without Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.

- **Methods**: Patients who were less than 45 years and presented with at least three months of dyspepsia in the absence of alarming features were eligible. They were offered a (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) to determine H. pylori status, and all symptomatic patients with negative UBT were randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Those who had previous endoscopy or positive UBT were excluded. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as worsening of global dyspeptic symptoms while on study medication. Patients were followed up for 26 weeks for global dyspeptic symptoms as determined by a 7-point Likert scale. Quality-of-life assessment (SF-36), the need for endoscopy, and utilization of other health-care services were monitored for 52 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 157 dyspeptic patients were randomized. At the end of 12-week treatment, the proportion of patients with treatment failure was similar in the lansoprazole (33.3%) and placebo (30.3%) groups (P = 0.74). Patients' global assessment of their dyspeptic symptoms was comparable at all time points measured. There was also no significant difference in the SF-36 mental and physical summary scales. At the end of 52 weeks, there was no difference in the proportion…

### The usefulness of capsulated 13C-urea breath test in diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^115DDHyv]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

H. pylori infection and peptic ulcerations, along with their complications such as bleeding, are causally related. However, the methods available for confirming active H. pylori in bleeding situations lack accuracy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the 13C-urea breath test (UBT) in diagnosing H. pylori infection in bleeding patients.

- **Patients and methods**: Eighty-one patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and 258 matched controls without bleeding were enrolled in the study. The UBT was performed using low-dose capsulated 13C-urea, and IgG antibodies to H. pylori were determined by ELISA.

- **Results**: The UBT performed in bleeding patients was positive in 77.7% of cases. In this group, anti-Hp IgG was positive in 79% of cases. Among them, gastroscopy showed 40.7% with bleeding duodenal ulcer, 38% with bleeding gastric ulcer, and 86% with hemorrhagic gastritis. UBT was positive in 90.9%, 77.4%, and 52.97% of cases, respectively, and it was not statistically different from that in non-bleeding controls for duodenal and gastric ulcers and gastritis. All patients with blood or "coffee grounds" in the stomach had both UBT and serology positive.

- **Conclusion**: The UBT is a simple and non-invasive method that can be successfully applied in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding to detect active H. pylori infection prior to emergency endoscopy.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114pRzfP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Statement 3**: A combination of histology, taken from the antrum and corpus, and a rapid urease test is recommended for invasive Helicobacter pylori testing.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: high.

While histological examination of biopsy samples requires highly trained personnel, it allows for the accurate detection of bacteria, staging of gastritis, and examination of focal lesions. To account for the patchy distribution of H. pylori, histological sampling should include two antrum biopsies (2–3 cm in front of the pylorus) and two corpus biopsies, which should be submitted in separate containers. Antral biopsies should be taken even if the mucosa looks healthy. An additional biopsy from the incisura is taken for gastritis histological staging when the OLGA (operative link on gastric atrophy) and OLGIM (operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia) protocols are followed. Any focal lesions should be sampled. Histochemical staining of the biopsy samples with hematoxylin and eosin or Giemsa identifies most cases of H. pylori. Immunohistochemical staining is recommended in cases of chronic active gastritis where H. pylori has not been detected by histochemistry alone. In cases of normal histology, immunohistochemical staining is not required.

The rapid urease test (RUT) is easy to perform, enables a quick diagnosis, and allows for the immediate prescription of H. pylori eradication therapy. Stomach biopsies are placed into a urea-containing medium within the well of a slide. If H. pylori is present within the tissue sample, the bacterial urease will break down the urea to generate response reagents.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^115QeLvf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

When an endoscopy is performed, the rapid urease test (RUT) should be preferred as the first diagnostic test for H. pylori detection. Two biopsies should be taken, one from the antrum and one from the corpus. A positive test permits the immediate initiation of treatment.

- **Recommendation grade**: B; evidence level: 2b; agreement level: 86%.

Interventional methods for H. pylori diagnosis demand biopsies taken during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy when indicated (see previous statements). The invasive methods which may be used for H. pylori diagnosis include RUT, histology, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To increase the sensitivity and reduce the time to positivity of RUT, it is preferable to put two biopsies into the reactive medium of RUT, one from the antrum and one from the corpus. Biopsies have to be taken from normal-appearing mucosa, avoiding areas of ulceration and obvious intestinal metaplasia (IM), where H. pylori is scarce or absent.

Recent use of antibiotics and/or bismuth compounds (4 weeks), as well as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (2 weeks), increases the false-negative results. Recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding also reduces RUT sensitivity. False positive results due to other urease-containing organisms (e.g. Proteus spp.) are extremely rare, except in cases of hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria. While a negative RUT cannot exclude the presence of H. pylori, a positive test permits immediate treatment initiation.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^114Ss8xW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Statement 4**: A corpus and antrum biopsy sample should be taken for the rapid urease test.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

A biopsy from the antrum and corpus should be taken for the rapid urease test (RUT) to account for the patchy distribution of H. pylori, which can occur due to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. Emerging evidence from abroad and from Ireland suggests that testing the antrum and corpus biopsies, either separately or combined within the same test, significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy of the RUT. Additionally, the combined approach reduces the reaction time of the test, resulting in a more rapid diagnosis.

Accumulating evidence also supports the reuse of RUT biopsy samples for DNA isolation and the diagnosis of H. pylori infection by molecular methods such as PCR. This eliminates the need to take additional biopsies specifically for PCR and provides the opportunity to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by analyzing the H. pylori DNA for resistance-associated mutations (see statement 6). Another advantage of molecular methods for the detection of H. pylori is that they are less affected by PPI use than other H. pylori detection methods. Studies evaluating the feasibility and accuracy of reusing rapid urease test biopsies for PCR-based H. pylori detection and antimicrobial sensitivity testing are warranted in the Irish healthcare setting.

### Evolving concepts in Helicobacter pylori management [^115mknV7]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection worldwide and the most significant risk factor for gastric cancer, which remains a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. H. pylori and gastric cancer continue to disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority and immigrant groups in the United States. The approach to H. pylori case-finding thus far has relied on opportunistic testing based on symptoms or high-risk indicators, such as racial or ethnic background and family history. However, this approach misses a substantial proportion of individuals infected with H. pylori who remain at risk for gastric cancer because most infections are clinically silent.

Moreover, individuals with chronic H. pylori infection are at risk for gastric preneoplastic lesions, which are also asymptomatic and only reliably diagnosed using endoscopy and biopsy. Thus, to significantly impact gastric cancer prevention, a systematic approach is needed to better identify individuals at the highest risk of both H. pylori infection and its complications, including gastric preneoplasia and cancer.

The approach to H. pylori eradication must also be optimized given sharply decreasing rates of successful eradication with commonly used therapies and increasing antimicrobial resistance. With growing acceptance that H. pylori should be managed as an infectious disease and the increasing availability of susceptibility testing, there is now momentum to abandon empirical therapies that have demonstrated inadequate eradication rates. Molecular-based susceptibility profiling facilitates this transition.

### A test-and-treat policy does not save endoscopy workload in a non-referral hospital [^1175uEUt]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the impact that a test-and-treat policy with open-access urea breath testing (UBT) has had on the referral rates for endoscopy in a district hospital, we examined any changes in the proportion of serious pathology detected endoscopically after adopting the policy.

- **Methods**: Analysis of data on all open-access endoscopy referrals was conducted over a 12-month period before (October 1994 to September 1995) and two years after (October 1997 to September 1998) the introduction of the UBT service. This analysis was compared with a sister hospital that had not provided a UBT service. Results of patients attending the UBT service during the study period were also examined.

- **Results**: A total of 798 patients attended for endoscopy (18% aged over 40 years) in the pre-UBT year compared with 1905 patients (16% aged over 40 years) in the post-UBT year. The standardized referral ratios were significantly higher for both age groups in the post-UBT year: 210 in the 40 years group (95% CI 233 to 257), with six percent in the over 40 years group (P < 0.01). The total number of open-access endoscopies increased steadily over the three years, despite the introduction of the UBT service. This trend was mirrored in our sister hospital. A total of 457 patients attended the UBT service during the 12 months.

### Non-invasive diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection [^117K2j2x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been implicated in several malignancies and non-malignant conditions, including peptic ulcers, non-ulcer dyspepsia, reoccurring peptic ulcer bleeding, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and colorectal adenomas. The confirmatory diagnosis of H. pylori is typically conducted via endoscopic biopsy, followed by histopathological examination using hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stain or special stains such as Giemsa stain and Warthin-Starry stain. Special stains are more accurate than the H & E stain. There is significant uncertainty about the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive tests for the diagnosis of H. pylori.

- **Objectives**: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen test, used alone or in combination, for diagnosis of H. pylori infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic people, allowing eradication therapy for H. pylori to commence.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Science Citation Index, and the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Database on 4 March 2016. We screened references in the included studies to identify additional studies and also conducted citation searches of relevant studies, most recently on 4 December 2016. We did not restrict studies by language or publication status, or whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^1175pAKJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

The urea breath test is the recommended noninvasive test for Helicobacter pylori. If the urea breath test is unavailable, the monoclonal stool antigen test is an alternative noninvasive test if locally validated. The recommendation is strong, and the quality of evidence is high.

For the UBT, the patient ingests a solution containing 13 C-labelled (or less commonly 14 C-labelled) urea. The urease enzyme produced by H. pylori in infected patients converts the labelled urea to ammonia and labelled carbon dioxide, which is detected in a breath sample. Bacterial antigens are present in the stool of individuals with active H. pylori infection, and the stool antigen test is an immunoassay that detects these antigens in stool samples. Serological testing can also detect IgG antibodies to H. pylori in the blood.

The UBT is considered the most accurate noninvasive test for H. pylori due to its high sensitivity and specificity values, making it the recommended noninvasive test in the Irish healthcare setting. European guidelines recommend citric acid as the test meal because it slows gastric emptying and increases the distribution of the substrate as well as the contact time with H. pylori urease. It is recommended that patients fast in advance of the UBT.

For stool antigen testing, potential options include laboratory-based enzyme immunoassays and, more recently, rapid immunochromatography-based tests for point-of-care diagnosis. Regarding laboratory-based tests, mAb-based assays are superior to polyclonal-based tests. While studies evaluating rapid near-patient immunochromatography-based tests are ongoing, these advances hold promise for the future of rapid diagnostics.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115XoXg7]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Failure of eradication is common and allows mucosal damage to progress. Therefore, eradication should always be confirmed, preferably using a non-invasive test such as a urea breath test or a validated monoclonal-based stool antigen test. For patients requiring endoscopic follow-up, such as after endoscopic removal of a gastric adenoma, histological assessment can be used. Confirmation of cure also provides an early warning system for the increasing antibiotic resistance in a population, which will manifest as increasing rates of treatment failure.

- **Which patients need long-term follow-up after eradication**: H. pylori eradication may not completely eliminate the risk of gastric cancer. Patients who remain at risk, as defined by the extent and severity of atrophy, should be offered endoscopic and histological surveillance.

	- **Grade of recommendation**: Strong
	- **Evidence level**: High
	- **Consensus level**: 97.3%

Long-term follow-up, such as regular endoscopic surveillance, should be based on estimating the risk of developing gastric cancer after H. pylori eradication, i.e. risk stratification. Cancer risk correlates with the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, and risk stratification should be confirmed using validated histological risk scoring systems such as OLGA or OLGIM. In areas with proven expertise in endoscopic scoring, a system such as that of Kimura and Takemoto can be used initially, although histological confirmation is still recommended.

### Posttreatment 13C-urea breath test is predictive of antimicrobial resistance to H. pylori after failed therapy [^115At1XN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We tested whether a 13C-urea breath test can predict antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

- **Methods**: Seventy patients who had failed triple eradication therapy and 108 untreated H. pylori-infected patients were given a 13C-urea breath test, endoscopy for culture of H. pylori, and assessment of clarithromycin resistance. The patients who had failed triple therapy then received one week of quadruple therapy to eradicate residual H. pylori.

- **Results**: The posttreatment value of the 13C-urea breath test, expressed as excessive delta13CO2 per mL (ECR), was higher in patients with residual H. pylori with clarithromycin resistance than in those without (23.8 vs 10.6; P < .05). The eradication rate of quadruple therapy was higher in patients with low ECR than in those with high ECR (93.8% vs 73.3%; P < .05).

- **Conclusion**: The posttreatment value of the 13C-urea breath test is predictive of clarithromycin resistance in residual H. pylori after failed triple therapy and predicts the efficacy of the rescue regimen. The value of the noninvasive test is promising for primary care physicians who need to select a rescue regimen without susceptibility testing.

### Molecular resistance testing of Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsies [^1136pjX5]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate simultaneous diagnosis of infection and molecular resistance testing of Helicobacter pylori, gastric biopsies were obtained from 26 rapid urease-positive and 51 rapid urease-negative test kits used to diagnose H pylori infection. Following glass bead-assisted DNA isolation, amplification of H pylori 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), glmM, and 23S rDNA target genes was performed.

Helicobacter pylori DNA was successfully amplified from 100% (26/26) of urease-positive and 3.9% (2/51) of urease-negative gastric biopsies. Subsequent restriction enzyme-mediated digestion of 23S rDNA amplification products revealed that 17% (4/24) of urease-positive and H pylori DNA-positive biopsy specimens contained point mutations (A2142G or A2143G) associated with clarithromycin resistance. Helicobacter pylori DNA from gastric biopsies was successfully amplified 8 weeks following rapid urease testing.

Helicobacter pylori genotyping may be used to detect macrolide-resistant H pylori in individuals prior to initiation of therapy or in patients refractory to anti-H pylori therapy. Two urease-negative specimens yielded Helicobacter DNA distinct from that of H pylori and indicated the need for further investigations of Helicobacter species present in the human stomach.

### ACG clinical guideline: Diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^115jkK6F]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically with respect to indications for testing and atrophic gastritis, ACG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining testing for H. pylori infection with a nonserological test in patients with autoimmune gastritis. This should be followed by eradication treatment if the test is positive and post-treatment testing to confirm eradication.

### Sensitivity of a novel stool antigen test for detection of Helicobacter pylori in adult outpatients before and after eradication therapy [^113D7tke]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

We investigated whether a novel monoclonal stool antigen test for detection of Helicobacter pylori performs with the same accuracy as the (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) for adult outpatients in the setting of a private office. The two tests showed identical levels of sensitivity when used to identify H. pylori-infected patients before and after eradication therapy.

### Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori: Improving the sensitivity of CLOtest by increasing the number of gastric antral biopsies [^112Pm5yo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The rapid urease CLOtest is commonly used during endoscopy to diagnose the presence of Helicobacter pylori. The aim of this study was to determine whether the sensitivity of the CLOtest can be improved by increasing the number of gastric antral biopsies from one to four.

- **Methods**: The study included 100 adult patients who were referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and tested positive for H. pylori infection on C urea breath test, considered the "gold standard". These patients were randomly divided into four equal groups (groups 1 to 4) and underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients in group 1 had one gastric antral biopsy during endoscopy, whereas those in groups 2, 3, and 4 had two, three, and four biopsies, respectively. The biopsies were placed in the rapid urease CLOtests, which were incubated at room temperature for up to 24 hours and read for positive results at 1, 6, and 24 hours.

- **Results**: About half of the patients (52%) had a positive CLOtest in group 1, compared to 68% in group 2, 76% in group 3, and 96% in group 4 (group 1 vs. group 4, P < 0.01). After 1 hour of incubation, 96% of the patients in group 4 had a positive CLOtest, compared to 40% in group 3, 12% in group 2, and 4% in group 1.

- **Conclusions**: Increasing the number of gastric antral biopsies from one to four significantly improves the sensitivity of the CLOtest, eliminates sampling error, and hastens the time needed for the test to become positive for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

### A novel 13c-urea breath test device for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection: Continuous online measurements allow for faster test results with high accuracy [^113KRouR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of a novel laptop-sized 13C-urea breath test analyzer that continuously measures expired breath and to use its advantages to decrease testing time.

- **Methods**: One hundred and eighty-six subjects (mean age of 47.8 years) were tested simultaneously by the BreathID system (Oridion, Israel) and by the traditional IRMS. BreathID continuously measured the expired breath for a ratio of 13CO(2):12CO(2). This value was expressed as delta over baseline (DOB) and displayed graphically on a screen in real time.

- **Results**: One hundred and one subjects were positive and 85 were negative for H. pylori by isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The correlation for the BreathID system at 30 minutes was 100% for positive cases and 98% for negative cases. Analysis of the continuous curves generated by the BreathID for all patients allowed the definition of different DOB thresholds for a positive or negative result at shorter time intervals. Thus, after six minutes, a conclusive test result could be obtained for 64% of subjects, and after ten minutes for 92% of subjects.

- **Conclusions**: The 13C-urea breath test utilizing the technology of molecular correlation spectrometry is an accurate method for determining infection by H. pylori. The advantage of continuous measurements can shorten testing time without compromising accuracy.

### Comparison of three stool antigen tests for Helicobacter pylori detection [^114ctLpy]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Active Helicobacter pylori infection can be diagnosed by invasive (biopsy-based) or non-invasive methods, such as stool antigen testing.

- **Aims**: To compare three stool antigen enzyme immunoassay kits - Premier Platinum Hp SA, FemtoLab Cnx, and Hp Ag - with biopsy-based methods for the detection of H. pylori in previously undiagnosed patients.

- **Methods**: One hundred and eleven adults with dyspepsia referred for endoscopy provided a stool sample for testing and had biopsies taken. Patients were considered H. pylori positive if two out of three invasive tests were positive or if culture alone was positive.

- **Results**: The sensitivities and specificities of the Premier Platinum Hp SA, FemtoLab Cnx, and Hp Ag stool antigen kits when compared with biopsy-based diagnosis were 63.6%, 88.0%, and 56.0% and 92.6%, 97.6%, and 97.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: FemtoLab Cnx may be considered as an alternative to urea breath testing in the initial diagnosis of patients with dyspepsia who do not require immediate endoscopy. Stool testing has the potential advantages of being simple to perform, relatively cheap, and samples can be submitted directly from primary care.

### Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection: Noninvasive methods compared to invasive methods and evaluation of two new tests [^116T2P38]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommending Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment without performing endoscopy in certain patients highlight the importance of noninvasive tests. Our aim was to determine the accuracy of two new tests: the antigen stool test and Helicoblot 2.1 (an immunoblot used on serum), as well as the 13C urea breath test and ELISA serology in comparison to invasive tests for the pretreatment diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

Helicobacter pylori infection was diagnosed prospectively in 104 untreated patients using eight different tests. Invasive tests included culture, urease test (CLOtest), histology, and PCR; noninvasive tests included the 13C urea breath test, IgG serology (Pyloriset EIA-G), immunoblot (Helicoblot 2.1), and antigen stool detection (Premier Platinum HpSA). A predefined gold standard based on biopsy tests was used to define H. pylori status, as well as an empirical approach.

There was no statistically significant difference between the different tests. The sensitivity of the noninvasive tests ranged between 88.9% and 95.6% (stool test: 88.9%, 95% CI: 82.7–95.1, and Helicoblot 2.1: 95.6%, 95% CI: 91.5–99.6), and the specificity ranged between 92.6% and 98.1% (stool test: 94.4%, 95% CI: 84.6–98.8, and Helicoblot 2.1: 92.6%, 95% CI: 91.5–96.2) when a predefined gold standard was used.

Most tests had sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values greater than 90%. The noninvasive tests are accurate for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Helicoblot 2.1 performed as well as the best ELISA kit. The HpSA is a promising option.

### Simplified 13c-urea breath test for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116d65jt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The U.S. standard 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) has proven to be extremely reliable but entails several complicated performance requirements and a test period of approximately one hour. The aim of this study was to compare the standard 13C-UBT with a simplified version incorporating modifications of the test meal, duration of fasting, amount of 13C-urea, method of breath collection, and duration of the test.

This randomized, three-way crossover study evaluated the standard U.S. 13C-UBT, which includes 125 mg of 13C-urea and a pudding test meal, with the final breath sample taken 30 minutes after urea ingestion. This was compared with a formulation containing 75 mg of 13C-urea, a 2.5-g citric acid test meal (UBT-Lite), and a final breath sample taken by direct exhalation into tubes 15 minutes after urea ingestion. The study also compared the effect of prior meals versus fasting on the test outcome with the UBT-Lite.

A total of 259 subjects were enrolled in the trial, and 249 completed all three urea breath tests. There was excellent agreement between the three versions of the UBT, with over 98% of subjects having concordant results. Using predetermined criteria, there was substantial equivalence between the tests. Neither solid nor liquid food up to one hour before performing the UBT-Lite affected the outcome.

The UBT-Lite formulation of the 13C-UBT proved to be an improved version of the U.S. standard 13C-UBT, offering less expensive ingredients, shorter test duration, and a simplified breath test collection method, without sacrificing accuracy.

### Where are we with gastric cancer screening in Europe in 2024 [^117JeknJ]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

Aspects related to non-invasive testing in screening settings

Non-invasive tests are crucial for the detection of H. pylori. The optimal non-invasive method for H. pylori assessment would be the 13C-urea breath test (UBT); however, the cost could be a limiting factor. A locally validated monoclonal stool antigen test (SAT) could serve as an alternative, offering slightly lower accuracy. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the use of H. pylori IgG antigen detection in serum is a viable option if a positive result is confirmed by another test, such as UBT. The limitations of these approaches are noted, although they are summarized in a missing table.

Non-invasive testing for precancerous gastric lesions is an attractive method and has been considered in numerous guidelines. The Maastricht VI/Florence guideline suggests that gastric functional serology (including pepsinogens I–II and gastrin levels), anti-intrinsic factor, and antiparietal cell autoantibodies may provide clinically valuable information concerning the likelihood of gastric mucosal atrophy and its etiology. The use of serology for gastritis as a supplementary approach is further endorsed by the RE.GA. IN consensus, despite pepsinogen testing having a 59% sensitivity for atrophic gastritis.

In the GISTAR pilot study, the sensitivity of pepsinogens for atrophic gastritis ranged from 18.4% to 31.1%, depending on the test and cut-off point, while specificity remained acceptable. Our study in patients with gastric cancer showed decreased levels of pepsinogens in only 32.4% of the patients.

### Validation of the string test for the recovery of Helicobacter pylori from gastric secretions and correlation of its results with urea breath test results, serology, and gastric pH levels [^112i6C8A]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The efficacy of the string culture test to isolate *Helicobacter pylori* from gastric secretions of 28 volunteers was studied. With the urea breath test (UBT) as the "gold standard", the string culture test showed a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 100%. The results of the string culture did not correlate with the UBT results, with serum antibody levels, or with the pH levels of gastric secretions.

### High accuracy of noninvasive tests to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection in very young children [^114qvoLJ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To validate the (13)C-urea-breath-test (UBT) and stool antigen test (HpSA) in children aged 5 years or younger, these tests were compared against invasive histologic study and rapid urease testing or culture.

- **Study design**: In a single-center study spanning 7.5 years, all consecutive children aged 5 years or younger undergoing endoscopy underwent UBT and HpSA testing.

- **Results**: Among 184 children (median age 2.2 years, range 0.2–5.5), 30 were Helicobacter pylori-positive (16.3%). Sensitivity and specificity of UBT were 93.3% (95% CI: 77.9%-99.2%) and 95.5% (90.9%-98.2%), with a cutoff of 5 per thousand. Specificity increased to 98.1% (94.4%-99.6%) with a cutoff of 8 per thousand. Sensitivity and specificity of HpSA were 93.3% (77.9%-99.2%) and 98.7% (95.4%-99.8%).

- **Conclusion**: The accuracy of noninvasive tests in this single-center study was satisfactory. Specifically, the specificity of UBT improved with a cutoff at 8 per thousand, and the sensitivity of HpSA was high when determined locally, avoiding transportation after long or inadequate storage that could impair results.

### Negative effect of ranitidine on the results of urea breath test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori [^115PquBZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

In analogy with proton pump inhibitors, H2-antagonists may also be responsible for false-negative results on the urea breath test for detecting Helicobacter pylori. In this study, we assessed the frequency and duration of false-negative urea breath tests in patients given different doses of ranitidine.

- **Methods**: A total of 120 consecutive dyspeptic patients infected with H. pylori, based on concomitant positive results of CLO-test, histology, and urea breath test, were recruited for this prospective, open, parallel-group study performed in an urban university gastroenterological clinic. They were randomized to receive an acute treatment with either ranitidine 300 mg once a day in the evening, ranitidine 300 mg once a day in the morning, ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d., or ranitidine 300 mg b.i.d. for 14 days. The urea breath test was performed on day 14 while patients were still taking ranitidine and on day 21, 1 week after the completion of therapy. The test was repeated on day 28 in those patients who were still negative on day 21. Duplicate breath samples were collected after the ingestion of 75 mg 13C-urea plus citric acid. A delta value > 5/1000 was considered positive.

- **Results**: Of 118 patients infected with H. pylori, 15 (13%) had a negative urea breath test on day 14. The false-negative results were equally distributed among the four groups of ranitidine dosage. Nine of these patients reverted to positive at 7 days, and the remaining six at 14 days after the completion of therapy.

- **Conclusions**: Our study shows that ranitidine negatively affects the results of the urea breath test.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^115VwXCF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Statement 5: If Helicobacter pylori cultures are required, a corpus and an antrum biopsy should be taken.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

The culture of H. pylori from biopsy specimens enables diagnosis and provides the opportunity for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). While culture is very specific, it is time-consuming and requires expertise in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Culture success rates range from as low as 55% to up to 93%. Culture success is influenced by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, the biopsy collection medium, sample transport conditions, and contamination of the samples with other microorganisms.

Dedicated biopsies should be taken from both the antrum and the corpus to increase culture success. This recommendation has been supported locally by a study carried out at Tallaght University Hospital showing that H. pylori was successfully cultured in a significantly higher number of cases when combined antrum and corpus biopsy sampling was used compared with a single antrum biopsy [64.4% (n = 94/146) vs. 49.3% (36/73); P = 0.04]. In support of a combined biopsy protocol, differences in the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of H. pylori isolated from the corpus compared with the antrum have been reported. Thus, sampling from both sites avoids resistant H. pylori being missed by the collection of only a single sample from one site of the stomach.

To prevent contact with air and desiccation, biopsy specimens for culture should be transported in leak-proof containers containing a dedicated transport medium (e.g. Portagerm pylori, bioMérieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France).

### The most important diagnostic modalities for Helicobacter pylori, now and in the future [^113dDnyM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

- **Diagnostic methods**: Helicobacter pylori infection plays a central role in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases, and its accurate diagnosis and successful eradication are crucial in a wide range of circumstances. Currently, serology is recommended for initial screening, followed by histology and/or culture to confirm the diagnosis before treatment. Since H. pylori is developing greater resistance to certain antibiotics, culture is becoming increasingly important in some populations to test for susceptibility to antibiotics. To confirm eradication after treatment, the urea breath test is used, which is presently the best non-invasive test to determine eradication.

- **New approaches**: Considerable efforts are being made to improve diagnostic methods, and a host of new or improved approaches can be expected in the near future. For general screening, tests are being developed that use whole blood and can be used by general practitioners to provide rapid results in a cost-effective manner. The evidence so far suggests that these new 'office' tests are not as accurate as laboratory tests, but they are nevertheless important for general diagnostic purposes. Serological tests for cagA antibodies and immunoblot tests are also under development. New biopsy-based tests include the development of a true rapid urease test which will give accurate results in one hour. Polymerase chain reaction/DNA enzyme immunoassay detection is another field receiving attention. Non-invasive direct tests of the future are likely to include the use of the polymerase chain reaction.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the 13C-urea breath test for childhood Helicobacter pylori infection: A multicenter Japanese study [^115UmZNa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

In adults, the 13C-urea breath test (UBT) has been widely used as a noninvasive test for Helicobacter pylori infection due to its high sensitivity and specificity. However, this test is less established in pediatric practice. The optimum cutoff value and test protocol for the 13C-UBT in the pediatric population remain to be established. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the 13C-UBT for children and determine its optimum cutoff value.

- **Methods**: A total of 220 Japanese children aged 2–16 years (mean = 11.9) who underwent upper GI endoscopy and gastric biopsies were studied. Endoscopic diagnoses included gastritis (n = 131), gastric ulcer (n = 15), duodenal ulcer (n = 72), and combined ulcer (n = 2). H. pylori infection status was confirmed by biopsy tests, including histology, urease test, and culture. For the 13C-UBT, breath samples were obtained at baseline and at 20 minutes after ingestion of 13C-urea without a test meal and analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. A cutoff value was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve based on biopsy tests. In 26 children (seven infected and 19 noninfected), paired breath samples were also measured by nondispersive infrared spectrometry (NDIRS).

- **Results**: Biopsy tests showed that 89 children (40%) were infected with H. pylori and 131 were not. There were no statistical differences in mean delta 13C values at 20 minutes between male and female H. pylori-infected and noninfected patients.

### Helicobacter pylori antigen stool test and 13C-urea breath test in patients after eradication treatments [^113zfXcR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend either the urea breath test (UBT) or the Helicobacter pylori antigen stool test (HpSA) for monitoring H. pylori infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between the two tests in patients after treatment.

After eradication treatments, patients were tested with both UBT and HpSA. Cut-off values for UBT were positive (≥ 5 per thousand), indeterminate (3.01–4.99 per thousand), and negative (< 3.00 per thousand). For HpSA, the cut-off values were positive (≥ 0.160), indeterminate (0.159–0.140), and negative (< 0.140). Patients with either discordant or indeterminate tests underwent repeat endoscopy with multiple gastric biopsies for rapid urease test (RUT), culture, histology, and immunohistochemistry to detect H. pylori and assess the ratio between coccoid and bacillary forms.

A total of 458 patients were studied. Of these, 422 (92.2%) had concordant tests, three (0.6%) had indeterminate tests (one on UBT and two on HpSA), and 33 (7.2%) had discordant tests. A total of 28 patients (25 with discordant and three with indeterminate tests) underwent endoscopy. The HpSA was inaccurate in 24 cases (18 false negatives, four false positives, and two indeterminate results), whereas the UBT was inaccurate in four cases (two false positives, one false negative, and one indeterminate result). Biopsy-based tests showed no bacillary or coccoid forms in all five endoscoped patients who were negative on UBT and positive on HpSA.

### Randomised trial of endoscopy with testing for Helicobacter pylori compared with non-invasive H pylori testing alone in the management of dyspepsia [^112XzUDW]. BMJ (2002). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of non-invasive testing for Helicobacter pylori with that of endoscopy (plus H pylori testing) in the management of patients referred for endoscopic investigation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

- **Design**: Randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 12 months.

- **Setting**: Hospital gastroenterology unit.

- **Participants**: 708 patients aged under 55 referred for endoscopic investigation of dyspepsia, randomised to non-invasive breath test for H pylori or endoscopy plus H pylori testing.

- **Main outcome measure**: Glasgow dyspepsia severity score at one year. Use of medical resources, patient oriented outcomes, and safety were also assessed.

Results showed that in 586 patients followed up at 12 months, the mean change in dyspepsia score was 4.8 in the non-invasive H pylori test group and 4.6 in the endoscopy group (95% confidence interval for difference -0.7 to 0.5, P = 0.69). Only 8.2% of patients followed up who were randomised to breath test alone were referred for subsequent endoscopy. The use of non-endoscopic resources was similar in the two groups. Reassurance value, concern about missed pathology, overall patient satisfaction, and quality of life were similar in the two groups. The patients found the non-invasive breath test procedure less uncomfortable and distressing than endoscopy with or without sedation. No potentially serious pathology requiring treatment other than eradication of H pylori was missed.

The conclusion of the study was that in this patient group, non-invasive testing for H pylori is as effective and safe as endoscopy and less uncomfortable and distressing.

### Non-invasive techniques for the diagnosis of helicobacter pylori infection [^115CckPZ]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection can be diagnosed by invasive techniques requiring endoscopy and biopsy, including histologic examination, culture, and polymerase chain reaction, as well as non-invasive techniques such as serology, urea breath tests, and the detection of H. pylori antigen in stool specimens. However, recent studies have demonstrated that a strategy of 'testing and treating' for H. pylori in uninvestigated young dyspeptic patients under 50 years old in primary care is safe and reduces the need for endoscopy.

Indeed, a number of clinical guidelines recommend non-invasive testing in dyspeptic patients, followed by treatment of H. pylori in primary care, based on clinical and economic analyses. Several non-invasive tests are currently available on the market. The choice depends on the clinical circumstances, the likelihood ratio of positive and negative tests, the cost-effectiveness of the testing strategy, and the availability of the tests. Nevertheless, two non-invasive tests are commonly used: the urea breath test and the stool antigen test.

### Low adherence to society guidelines for the management of Helicobacter pylori among pediatric gastroenterologists [^113RLjG1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

The revised ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2016 guideline on the diagnosis and management of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection discourages a "test and treat" strategy. Instead, upper endoscopy (EGD) is recommended when a valid clinical indication is present. Similarly, new treatment recommendations for first-line therapies strongly encourage obtaining antimicrobial susceptibility before treatment. We conducted this study to assess the effect of revised guidelines on clinical practice at our center.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of patients with H. pylori infection diagnosis was conducted using serology, stool antigen test, urea breath test, or EGD at Boston Children's Hospital between January 2013 and July 2019. We compared demographic and clinical data between the initial guideline and the 2016 revision (January 2013 to November 2016) and the period after the revised guideline (December 2016 to July 2019).

- **Results**: Two hundred and fifty-six patients were included. EGD was the initial diagnostic test in 49% (50/103, pre-revised guideline) and in 52% (79/153, post-revised guideline). Biopsy culture was sent in 3% of patients for both periods (3/103 and 4/153, respectively). PPI-clarithromycin-amoxicillin triple therapy was the most common regimen in both periods. Clarithromycin use was lower in the post-revised guideline period (P = 0.003), whereas the opposite was noted for metronidazole and tetracycline (P = 0.009 and P = 0.02, respectively). There was no significant difference in eradication rate between periods (86% vs. 81%).

- **Conclusions**: Low adherence to the updated H. pylori guideline recommendations was observed.

### A new semiquantitative method of quantifying Helicobacter pylori in antigen stools [^1159Fdix]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The stool antigen test for Helicobacter pylori, a noninvasive assay, is emerging as a strong competitor to the urea breath test (UBT). Although the UBT delta value is a semiquantitative indicator of H. pylori intragastric load, until now the H. pylori stool antigen test has been used only as a qualitative investigation. We report the results of a study aimed at obtaining a semiquantitative measurement of bacterial amounts in stools.

We studied 15 patients with dyspepsia using H. pylori positivity at histology, the rapid urease test, UBT, and the H. pylori stool antigen test. The result of the stool antigen test was expressed by a numerical value obtained by applying the principle of "standard points" to the absorbance units at spectrophotometric reading. This measurement was validated by testing probe sampling of H. pylori stool antigen with known pure and stool-mixed bacterial amounts. A numerical result for H. pylori stool antigen was correlated with the UBT delta for each patient using Pearson's r test.

Finally, a Student t test was performed to investigate possible differences in UBT and H. pylori stool antigen test values between anti-CagA-positive and anti-CagA-negative patients. We obtained a curve of saturation with both known amounts of pure and stool-mixed bacteria. Pearson's r test showed a significant correlation between UBT delta values and H. pylori stool antigen measurement (r = 0.77; p < 0.001). Urea breath test delta and H. pylori stool antigen test values were significantly higher in anti-CagA-positive patients. Our data suggest that a numerical approach…

### An explainable artificial intelligence system for diagnosing infection under endoscopy: A case-control study [^111jviBi]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Patients and esophagogastroduodenoscopy protocol: We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with gastric biopsies or H. pylori breath test at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU) between June 2020 and July 2021. We included 1826 patients (881 H. pylori positive and 945 H. pylori negative) for the development of EADHI. Exclusion criteria include: (1) patients with a history of gastric cancer, peptic ulcer, gastric surgery, or submucosal tumor, and (2) patients who received H. pylori eradication, antibiotics within a month, or proton pump inhibitor within 2 weeks of H. pylori breath test.

	- EGD was performed using a standard endoscope (GIF-HQ290, GIF-H260; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; EG-L590ZW; Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured during high-definition, white-light examination of the antrum, angularis (retroflex), body (forward and retroflex), and fundus (retroflex). Gastric biopsies were performed in the antrum and body at the endoscopist's discretion.
