## Question

In an asymptomatic 60-year-old with stage V CKD and an eGFR around 9 ml/min, should dialysis be started now or deferred, based on IDEAL?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dialysis should be started now or deferred in an asymptomatic 60-year-old with stage V CKD and an eGFR around 9 mL/min/1.73 m², and how the IDEAL trial informs that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether any absolute indications for dialysis are present. Then, I should verify what IDEAL actually compared and what it found. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions and how they translate to this case. After that, I need to check for potential pitfalls in relying on eGFR alone and consider access planning. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline monitoring and shared decision-making steps, making sure I anchor each point to the best available evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. The patient is asymptomatic, with stage V CKD and an eGFR near 9 mL/min/1.73 m², and there is no mention of volume overload, refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, malnutrition, or cognitive impairment, which means there are no classic absolute indications to start dialysis at this time, and the question is truly about elective timing rather than urgent initiation [^112zpA2J] [^1156Ex7r].

> I need to verify what IDEAL actually tested. IDEAL randomized 828 adults with progressive CKD and eGFR 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m² to an early-start strategy at eGFR 10–14 versus a late-start strategy at eGFR 5–7 or when symptoms developed; importantly, the achieved eGFRs at initiation were about 12.0 versus 9.8 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively, and there was no difference in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, infections, or quality of life, with higher costs in the early-start group [^11661q3F] [^111XxbJh] [^11527Sap].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm how this applies to an eGFR of 9. The achieved late-start mean in IDEAL was 9.8, which is very close to this patient's 9, and still there was no survival disadvantage to waiting, which supports deferral in the absence of symptoms or other indications; moreover, a substantial fraction of the late-start group actually initiated earlier due to symptoms, underscoring that clinical triggers, not a fixed eGFR, should drive timing [^11661q3F] [^111snNxz].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. KDIGO 2024 recommends initiating dialysis based on a composite of symptoms, signs, volume/BP control, nutrition, cognition, and GFR, and explicitly notes that these indications often, but not invariably, emerge when GFR is between 5 and 10 mL/min/1.73 m²; it does not endorse starting solely on eGFR in an asymptomatic patient, which fits this case [^112zpA2J] [^1156Ex7r]. The Canadian Society of Nephrology similarly endorses an intent-to-defer approach unless symptoms or other indications arise, again arguing against early initiation purely on eGFR [^113FHXAT].

> Wait, let me verify the eGFR caveat. eGFR at low levels is imprecise and can be biased by body composition, hydration, and assay issues; relying on eGFR alone risks starting dialysis too early in some patients, particularly when muscle mass is low or volume status is abnormal, so I should avoid using a numeric eGFR threshold to mandate initiation in the absence of clinical indications [^114UeM3b] [^1164PVLh] [^114GFCgM].

> I should double-check the practical implications. Even though we defer dialysis now, we need to ensure access planning is underway because preemptive preparation reduces catheter use and complications; guidelines suggest planning for access when GFR is below 15–20 or when 2-year kidney failure risk exceeds 40%, which is appropriate here given the patient's trajectory and age [^115D4Az1] [^111N2QnR] [^112Pi7WE].

> Let me synthesize. Based on IDEAL and contemporary guidelines, there is no survival or quality-of-life benefit to starting dialysis at an eGFR around 9 mL/min/1.73 m² in an asymptomatic patient, and doing so increases time on dialysis and costs; therefore, dialysis should be deferred and the patient monitored closely for evolving symptoms, volume/BP issues, nutrition, and cognition, with dialysis initiated if and when clinical indications emerge or if eGFR approaches the symptomatic range with concerning labs or function [^11661q3F] [^112zpA2J] [^115PkCBP].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is explicit. I will track weight, edema, and blood pressure for volume status; electrolytes including potassium and bicarbonate; phosphate and calcium for bone-mineral disorder; hemoglobin for anemia trajectory; and albumin and dietary intake for nutrition, while also screening for fatigue, pruritus, nausea, cognitive changes, and sleep disturbance; if symptoms or labs worsen, I should reassess the need to start dialysis and document shared decision-making with the patient about goals, modality preferences, and access plans [^112zpA2J] [^1156Ex7r] [^116je8Wb].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers to start now despite being asymptomatic? I should explain that randomized data show no benefit to early start and that deferral is safe with close follow-up, while acknowledging that some observational cohorts have explored very low eGFR thresholds and found no clear advantage to ultra-late starts; ultimately, the decision should be individualized through shared decision-making that weighs burdens of dialysis, patient values, and the lack of outcome benefit from starting early [^11661q3F] [^116uGhUp] [^112zpA2J].

---

Based on the IDEAL trial, **early dialysis initiation at eGFR 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m² offers no survival or quality-of-life benefit** compared with waiting until symptoms or eGFR 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m² [^11661q3F] [^11527Sap]. For an asymptomatic 60-year-old with stage V CKD and eGFR ~9 mL/min/1.73 m², **dialysis should be deferred** unless uremic symptoms, refractory volume overload, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis emerge [^112zpA2J]. Continue close monitoring and prepare access, but **do not start dialysis solely based on eGFR** [^114UeM3b].

---

## Summary of the IDEAL trial

- **Design**: Multicenter RCT comparing early (eGFR 10–14) vs late (eGFR 5–7 or symptoms) dialysis initiation [^11661q3F].
- **Population**: 828 adults with progressive CKD and eGFR 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m² [^11661q3F].
- **Primary outcome**: No difference in all-cause mortality (37.6% early vs 36.6% late; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83–1.30) [^11661q3F].
- **Secondary outcomes**: No differences in cardiovascular events, infections, or quality of life; early start had higher costs and longer dialysis exposure [^113FHXAT] [^11527Sap].

---

## Clinical implications of the IDEAL trial

The IDEAL trial demonstrates that **early initiation does not improve survival or quality of life** and increases dialysis burden and costs [^11661q3F] [^113FHXAT]. Accordingly, **symptom-guided initiation is preferred** over eGFR-based thresholds [^112zpA2J].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines align with IDEAL, recommending **symptom-based initiation**:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | Initiate dialysis based on symptoms, signs, QoL, preferences, GFR, and labs; typically GFR 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m² if symptomatic [^112zpA2J] [^1156Ex7r] |
| KDOQI 2015 | Do not rely on eGFR alone; base initiation on uremic symptoms and patient preferences [^114UeM3b] |
| Canadian Society of Nephrology 2014 | Adopt intent-to-defer; avoid early initiation unless indicated [^115PkCBP] |

---

## Application to the clinical scenario

In an asymptomatic 60-year-old with eGFR ~9 mL/min/1.73 m², **defer dialysis** and continue close monitoring. Initiate only if uremic symptoms, refractory volume overload, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis develop [^112zpA2J] [^1156Ex7r].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of deferring dialysis

### Benefits

Potential benefits of deferring dialysis include **preservation of residual kidney function** and fewer dialysis-related complications (e.g. infections, cardiovascular events) [^115NHERS]. Deferral also reduces treatment burden and improves quality of life by avoiding dialysis and its lifestyle restrictions [^116uGhUp].

---

### Risks

Potential risks include **progression of uremic symptoms** and electrolyte or acid-base disturbances (e.g. hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis). Deferral may also delay access maturation, increasing catheter use if urgent dialysis is needed [^116je8Wb].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If deferring dialysis, **monitor**:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, nausea, pruritus, cognitive changes, dyspnea [^112zpA2J].
- **Labs**: Potassium, bicarbonate, phosphate, hemoglobin, albumin [^notfound].
- **Volume status**: Weight, blood pressure, edema [^114GFCkm].
- **Access planning**: Consider AV fistula when risk of KRT is > 40% over 2 years or eGFR < 15–20 mL/min/1.73 m² [^115D4Az1] [^111N2QnR].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on IDEAL and current guidelines, **dialysis should be deferred** in this asymptomatic 60-year-old with eGFR ~9 mL/min/1.73 m². Continue monitoring and prepare access, but initiate dialysis only if clinical indications arise [^11661q3F] [^112zpA2J].

The study IDEAL was published by Cooper BA and colleagues in 2010 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the IDEAL study, the trial question was: what is the role of early initiation of dialysis in patients with stage V CKD? In the IDEAL study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the IDEAL study, the population was: 828 patients (286 female, 542 male). The inclusion criteria were patients ≥ 18 years of age with progressive CKD and an eGFR between 10.0 and 15.0 mL/min/1.73 m² of body-surface area. The key exclusion criteria were younger than 18 years of age, estimated GFR < 10.0 mL/min, plans to receive a kidney transplant from a live donor within the next 12 months, recently diagnosed cancer that was likely to affect survival, or unable to provide written informed consent. In the IDEAL study, the interventions were: n = 404 early dialysis initiation (initiation of dialysis when the estimated GFR was 10.0–14.0 mL/min) n = 424 late dialysis initiation (initiation of dialysis when the estimated GFR was 5.0–7.0 mL/min). In the IDEAL study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in all-cause death (37.6% vs. 36.6%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.3). In the IDEAL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events (10.9/100 py vs. 8.8/100 py; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.56) Borderline significant increase in the incidence of infectious events (12.4/100 py vs. 14.3/100 py;). In the IDEAL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in frequency of adverse events. In the IDEAL study, the conclusion was: in patients ≥ 18 years of age with progressive CKD and an eGFR between 10.0 and 15.0 mL/min/1.73 m² of body-surface area, early dialysis initiation was not superior to late dialysis initiation with respect to a all-cause death.

### When should we commence dialysis? The story of a lingering problem and today's scene after the IDEAL study [^115oBr66]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Over the last 15–20 years, there has been an increasing trend for dialysis to be commenced earlier in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The drivers for initiation of dialysis at higher levels of renal function are complex but were primarily based on the assumption that by improving solute and water clearances with earlier dialysis, morbidity, mortality and quality of life would be improved. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial definitively demonstrated that elective earlier initiation of dialysis was not associated with improved clinical outcomes or quality of life. Indeed, no subset of patients was found to benefit from earlier dialysis. Observational data suggests that patients who commence dialysis with higher levels of renal function are more likely to have significant comorbidity that results in higher mortality rates compared to patients who remain clinically well and biochemically stable and are able to defer the initiation of dialysis till later in the course of CKD. However, patients who are able to defer dialysis should have appropriate access created so as to avoid the use of temporary catheters and to facilitate initiation using the preferred dialysis modality. Estimates of glomerular filtration rates in Stage 5 CKD have been poorly validated and should not be used as the key determinant influencing the commencement of dialysis. The results of the IDEAL trial have influenced guidelines internationally and provide clinicians, patients and health care providers with important information to drive clinical decision making and rational service planning.

### When to initiate dialysis – is early start always better? [^116EFhQ9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The question when to initiate dialysis is attracting increasing attention. In recent years, there has been a tendency to initiate dialysis earlier in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in an attempt to achieve better patient outcomes. However, several observational studies and one randomized controlled trial have found no benefit for early dialysis initiation. On the contrary, they have found that starting dialysis with a higher eGFR is associated with increased mortality. These studies need to be carefully interpreted in light of their reliance on eGFR to estimate kidney function at dialysis initiation. The decision to start dialysis should not be based solely on a predefined eGFR value, but more importantly on a careful clinical assessment of the individual patient.

### Initiation of dialysis should be timely: neither early nor late [^1125Gsji]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last decade, individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States are starting maintenance dialysis therapy at progressively higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Moreover, several observational studies have demonstrated an association of a higher risk of death with higher serum creatinine-based estimates of GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. In contrast, studies in which renal function has been measured by timed urinary collection show either a lower risk of death or no significant association with higher GFR at the time of initiation of dialysis. There are numerous potential sources of bias in such observational studies, particularly in those that use serum creatinine-based eGFR. The only randomized controlled clinical trial to have examined this question did not demonstrate either benefit or harm with initiation of dialysis at higher level of renal function. Thus, the data to date suggest that eGFR should not be the sole consideration when assessing the need for initiating maintenance dialysis in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Given the high societal costs of starting renal replacement therapy earlier in the course of the disease, these considerations also suggest that dialysis can be safely be postponed in otherwise asymptomatic individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease. By the same token, dialysis should not be denied to individuals who could clearly benefit from renal replacement therapy simply because the GFR is too high (viz., volume overload, refractory hyperkalemia). Finally, there is a compelling need to reexamine the symptoms that could be attributed to uremia and clearly improve upon initiation of dialysis to better guide clinical decision-making.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^112hrgHs]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, more than 3 million people with kidney failure need maintenance dialysis treatment for survival. These numbers are expected to double by 2030. The societal and individual burden of kidney failure treated by dialysis is high: for instance, the US Medicare fee-for-service spending for beneficiaries with kidney failure was $36.6bn in 2018. The mean annual healthcare costs per haemodialysis patient are $93 191 in the US, and similar numbers are reported for European countries. Dialysis treatment also places a large burden on patients' daily lives. Determining the optimal timing of dialysis is therefore of substantial importance.

Despite extensive previous literature, evidence on whether an optimal glomerular filtration rate to start dialysis exists, and if so where it lies, is lacking. Previous observational studies that attempted to investigate multiple estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strategies have been limited by insufficient power, immortal time bias, or lead time and selection biases. In 2010 the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial showed that a strategy to start dialysis at an eGFR of 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m² was not superior to one of waiting until symptoms develop or eGFR is 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m². This is reflected in subsequent guidelines, which recommend starting dialysis when symptoms and signs attributable to kidney failure arise rather than at a specific kidney function. However, IDEAL compared only two strategies, from which an optimal eGFR cannot be derived. In addition, the achieved eGFR separation in IDEAL was 1.8 (9.0 v 7.2) mL/min/1.73 m² by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. That a kidney function outside this range exists at which starting dialysis is associated with better outcomes therefore remains possible, and uncertainty on this question among providers persists.

### Timing of initiation of dialysis: time for a new direction? [^1163RDqo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The past 15 years have seen tremendous growth in the initiation of dialysis at higher levels of kidney function in the setting of mixed evidence and at great societal economic cost. We review recent data on the early dialysis initiation trend, the clinical and economic impact of early dialysis initiation and the future implications for the management of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

The percentage of patients who initiate dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 10 ml/min/1.73m(2) is now greater than 50%, including 20% who initiate with an eGFR above 15 ml/min/1.73m(2). The drivers behind these findings are probably diverse but recent literature does not seem to support a higher symptom burden among the ageing CKD population as the major cause. The Initiating Dialysis Early And Late (IDEAL) trial provides guidance on the safety of waiting for symptoms or lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate prior to beginning dialysis. In addition, economic analyses based on the IDEAL and US Renal Data System findings suggest that significant cost savings could be achieved by reversing the early initiation trend.

Summary

These findings should help clinicians and policy makers looking to rein in costs while maintaining the quality of CKD care.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115Evmzi]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, and there is an increasing number of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients start dialysis annually. The decision on optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis is a common problem faced by nephrologists. During 1980s-2000s, extensive observational studies have been attempted to investigate the optimal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the start of dialysis. In 2010 a randomized controlled trial named "trial Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL)" showed that a strategy of early dialysis initiation (target eGFR: 10–14 mL/min/1.73m2) was not superior to late initiation (waiting until symptoms develop or eGFR is 5–7 mL/min/1.73m2). Since then, clinical practice guidelines suggest that the decision of initiate maintenance dialysis should be guided primarily by clinical constellation of signs and symptoms attributable to uremic syndrome. However, symptoms or signs of uremia are varied and complex, mainly depends on clinical judgment; what's more, typical uremic symptoms such as pericarditis and encephalopathy in patients without volume overload often occur at a very low GFR, these conditions are often combined with severe metabolic disorders and/or organ damages; the exact optimal timing of dialysis for ESKD patients remains unknown.

Therefore, the aim of our study is to systematically review the available evidence with regard to the optimal initiation of maintenance dialysis in ESKD patients.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^113nZ98B]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

In the absence of evidence on an optimal eGFR level, decision making may be influenced by other factors. Large between country variation exists in the mean eGFR at start of dialysis, from approximately 5 mL/min/1.73 m² in Taiwan to 8.5 mL/min/1.73 m² in the UK and 11 mL/min/1.73 m² in the US. Some health systems in the US even start at a mean eGFR of 16–17 mL/min/1.73 m², which may be partly explained by potential financial incentives and differences in patient case mix (for example, diabetes, sodium intake, and overweight). This broad heterogeneity may lead to differences in outcomes and healthcare costs.

Ideally, this complex question would be studied in a multi-armed randomised trial. However, such a trial is unlikely to be conducted because the sample size needed is large and recruitment is problematic: IDEAL recruited 828 patients over eight years. In the absence of trial evidence, clinical decisions could be aided by well conducted observational studies that explicitly mimic the strict design criteria of a multi-armed trial. We therefore used novel analytical methods to investigate the effects of different dialysis initiation strategies based on eGFR levels, using data from a nationwide cohort of non-dialysis dependent patients with advanced chronic kidney disease under the care of a nephrologist. In other words, our study investigated what would happen if the decision to start dialysis was based on eGFR only.

### Dialysis initiation: what's the rush? [^115NHERS]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The recent trend to early initiation of dialysis (at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m²) appears to have been based on conventional wisdoms that are not supported by evidence. Observational studies using administrative databases report worse comorbidity-adjusted dialysis survival with early dialysis initiation. Although some have concluded that the IDEAL randomized controlled trial of dialysis start provided evidence that patients become symptomatic with late dialysis start, there is no definitive support for this view. The potential harms of early start of dialysis, including the loss of residual renal function (RRF), have been well documented. The rate of RRF loss (renal function trajectory) is an important consideration for the timing of the dialysis initiation decision. Patients with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may have sufficient RRF to be maintained off dialysis for years. Delay of dialysis start until a working arterio-venous access is in place seems prudent in light of the lack of harm and possible benefit of late dialysis initiation. Prescribing frequent hemodialysis is not recommended when dialysis is initiated early. The benefits of early initiation of chronic dialysis after episodes of congestive heart failure or acute kidney injury require further study. There are no data to show that early start benefits diabetics or other patient groups. Preemptive start of dialysis in noncompliant patients may be necessary to avoid complications. The decision to initiate dialysis requires informed patient consent and a joint decision by the patient and dialysis provider. Possible talking points for obtaining informed consent are provided.

Few, if any, doubt that renal transplantation should be the first choice of renal replacement therapy whenever this option is possible. But, at which level of remaining kidney function should patients start on dialysis and which dialysis modality should be used? Several studies published in 2010 addressed these questions and will influence dialysis initiation strategies worldwide for years to come.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^113oy7qS]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Dialysis initiation timing in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — study results: The IDEAL randomized controlled trial comparing an early-start group (eGFRCG 10–14 ml/min per 1.73 m2) versus a late-start group (eGFRCG 5–7 ml/min per 1.73 m2) reported HR with early initiation, 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83–1.30; P = 0.75. Post hoc IDEAL analyses found no statistical difference between early and late start groups for cost and quality of life, and no statistically significant change in cardiac structure and function over 12-month follow-up. In an observational cohort of 81,176 subjects aged 20–64 years without diabetes and no comorbidity other than hypertension, unadjusted 1-year mortality by MDRD eGFR at dialysis initiation ranged from 6.8% in the reference group (eGFR < 5.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2) to 20.1% in the highest eGFR group (= 15.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2). In 35,665 subjects with serum albumin concentrations of 3.5 g/dl or higher before hemodialysis initiation, 1-year mortality was 4.7% and the adjusted HR for mortality was 1.27 for eGFR 5.0–9.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 1.53 for eGFR 10.0–14.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and 2.18 for eGFR 15.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2 compared with the reference group of GFR < 5.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2. In a CKD G4–G5 cohort analysis, the maximum 5-year mortality risk reductions were 5.1%, resulting in a better survival of only 1.6 months over a 5-year period at the expense of starting dialysis 4 years earlier.

Background

In clinical practice, there is considerable variation in the timing of the initiation of maintenance dialysis for patients with stage V chronic kidney disease, with a worldwide trend toward early initiation. In this study, conducted at 32 centers in Australia and New Zealand, we examined whether the timing of the initiation of maintenance dialysis influenced survival among patients with chronic kidney disease.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients 18 years of age or older with progressive chronic kidney disease and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 10.0 and 15.0 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area (calculated with the use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation) to planned initiation of dialysis when the estimated GFR was 10.0 to 14.0 mL per minute (early start) or when the estimated GFR was 5.0 to 7.0 mL per minute (late start). The primary outcome was death from any cause.

Results

Between July 2000 and November 2008, a total of 828 adults (mean age, 60.4 years; 542 men and 286 women; 355 with diabetes) underwent randomization, with a median time to the initiation of dialysis of 1.80 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60 to 2.23) in the early-start group and 7.40 months (95% CI, 6.23 to 8.27) in the late-start group. A total of 75.9% of the patients in the late-start group initiated dialysis when the estimated GFR was above the target of 7.0 mL per minute, owing to the development of symptoms. During a median follow-up period of 3.59 years, 152 of 404 patients in the early-start group (37.6%) and 155 of 424 in the late-start group (36.6%) died (hazard ratio with early initiation, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; P = 0.75). There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of adverse events (cardiovascular events, infections, or complications of dialysis).

Conclusions

In this study, planned early initiation of dialysis in patients with stage V chronic kidney disease was not associated with an improvement in survival or clinical outcomes.

IDEAL Study — randomized timing of dialysis initiation in 32 centers in Australia and New Zealand among 828 adults with creatinine clearance 10 to 15 mL/min/1.73 m² to early start (10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²; n = 404) or late start (5–7 mL/min/1.73 m²; n = 424). During follow-up, 19% assigned early started later and 76% assigned late started early; mean creatinine clearance at initiation was 12.0 and 9.8 mL/min (eGFR, 9.0 vs 7.8 mL/min/1.73 m²) with a median difference in time to start of 5.6 months. There were no significant differences in time to death, cardiovascular (CV) or infectious events, dialysis complications, peritoneal dialysis (PD) subgroup analyses, total health care costs, or cardiac structure/function. Separation between groups was limited due to earlier-than-planned starts for symptoms or uremia, and only 6% had prior congestive heart failure compared with one-third of incident U.S. dialysis patients.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^114PSMWG]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Studies examining the timing of dialysis in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compare early versus late initiation defined by eGFRCG 10–14 ml/min per 1.73 m² versus 5–7 ml/min per 1.73 m², with outcomes including mortality, cost, quality of life, and cardiac structure/function. In the randomized controlled trial (IDEAL), the hazard ratio for mortality with early initiation was 1.04 (95% CI 0.83–1.30; P = 0.75). Post hoc analyses reported no statistical difference between early start vs. late start group for costs/quality of life and no statistically significant change in cardiac structure and function over 12 months or between groups. In an observational cohort of 81,176 subjects with kidney failure aged 20–64 years without diabetes and with no comorbidity other than hypertension, the unadjusted 1-year mortality by MDRD eGFR at dialysis initiation ranged from 6.8% at eGFR < 5.0 ml/min per 1.73 m² to 20.1% at eGFR = 15.0 ml/min per 1.73 m². Among 35,665 subjects with serum albumin concentrations of 3.5 g/dl or higher before hemodialysis initiation, 1-year mortality was 4.7%, and adjusted hazard ratios for mortality versus GFR < 5.0 ml/min per 1.73 m² were 1.27 for eGFR 5.0–9.9 ml/min per 1.73 m², 1.53 for 10.0–14.9 ml/min per 1.73 m², and 2.18 for 15.0 ml/min per 1.73 m².

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^114ETzW2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Currently, clinical practice guidelines recommend that: decision to initiate maintenance dialysis primarily depends on clinical signs and symptoms which may be attributed to uremic syndrome. In this regard, the Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group suggested that the decision is usually occurring within the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m2″. The Additionally, the Canadian Society of Nephrology suggested that in the absence of these factors, the eGFR should only serve as a sole criterion for the initiation of dialysis if it is 6 mL/min/1.73m2 or less";. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy proposes that patients endure under conservative treatment until the GFR < 8 mL/min/1.73m2, even if symptoms of renal failure are observed and hemodialysis is recommended to be initiated prior to a GFR of 2 mL/min/1.73 m2. Our present systematic review included 13 studies of the last 5 years which investigated optimal dialysis initiation in ESKD patients, 9 of the 13 studies mainly focused on the optimal GFR of maintenance dialysis initiation; 7 studies used eGFR, 1 study used mGFR, 1 study used both. Compared to previous studies, wider range of GFR values and more detailed data stratification were applied in the study design and data processing stages; 7 studies taken GFR ≤ 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 or even lower into account, the lowest data range was mGFR < 4.3 mL/min/1.73m2 and the highest range was eGFR 15–16 mL/min/1.73 m2. 5 studies showed none association between GFR and mortality or other adverse outcomes, 2 studies showed dialysis initiation at higher GFR levels were with poor prognosis, and 2 studies showed higher GFR levels with better prognosis. However, it's worth noting that Fu et al. observed a parabolic relation between eGFR and mortality, with the lowest mortality risk at eGFR15-16 mL/min/1.73m2; compared with dialysis initiation at eGFR6-7 mL/min/1.73m2, initiation at eGFR15-16 mL/min/1.73m2 was associated with a 5.1% lower absolute 5 year mortality risk and 2.9% lower risk of a major adverse cardiovascular; this 5.1% absolute risk difference corresponded to a mean postponement of death of 1.6 months over 5 years of follow-up, and dialysis would need to be started 4 years earlier; so they concluded that "although very early dialysis initiation was associated with a modest reduction in mortality and cardiovascular events, this may not outweigh the burden of a substantially longer period spent on dialysis. In recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence of elderly population, which, along with advances in dialysis technology and increasing survival of maintenance dialysis patients, lead to an increasing proportion of elder dialysis patients. Two studies researched timing of dialysis initiation in elderly ESKD patients, and they both concluded that eGFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality and quality of life. So to summarize, most studies proved that GFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality, timing of dialysis initiation should not be based on GFR both in all maintenance dialysis population and in elderly, which is consistent with present clinical guidelines.

### The EQUAL study: a European study in chronic kidney disease stage 4 patients [^113dosie]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

The timing of the start of dialysis in elderly patients is driven by the desire to optimize the quantity and quality of life. Limited data exist on how the level of renal function, and uraemic signs and symptoms can be used to determine when dialysis should be initiated in elderly patients. EQUAL, an international prospective cohort study, aims to address these issues. To this end, it will enroll 3500 patients > 65 years of age with CKD of various aetiologies under the care of nephrologists. These patients will be followed until death, discharge from the nephrology clinic to primary care or until the end of the observation period after 4 years of follow-up. At the time of enrollment, patients must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or lower, but should not yet be on dialysis. Standardized data collection will include demographics, lifestyle, comorbidities, uraemic signs and symptoms, nutritional status, medication and routine blood and urine biochemistry. It will also comprise quality of life data, information on decision making including patients preferences and patients satisfaction.

Initiating hemodialysis and frequency/duration — evidence signals: Despite lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials about the optimal time to start kidney replacement therapy, there has been a trend, which has leveled off since 2010, in the United States toward earlier initiation of dialysis at higher levels of kidney function; results of the IDEAL (Initiating Dialysis Early and Late) trial published in 2010 constitute the best evidence regarding timing of dialysis initiation, and observational and controlled nonrandomized studies had suggested that more frequent and/or longer dialysis improves the patient's quality of life, controls uremic symptoms, and decreases hospitalization and mortality, prompting the Frequent Hemodialysis Network daily and nocturnal trials to test these hypotheses.

### Kidney function and symptom development over time in elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: results of the EQUAL cohort study [^114fpkS4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

In a medical speciality like rheumatology, decision-making often involves evaluation of symptom burden. As an example, the disease activity score, including symptoms, is used in decision-making regarding treatment initiation but also to evaluate the effect of treatment. Also, in clinical nephrology, there is a fundamental knowledge that symptom evaluation is important. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend the initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) when symptoms are present, which is often although not invariably in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) range between 5 and 10 mL/min/m 2. From a clinical point of view, it could be expected that symptoms increase while kidney function deteriorates in patients with CKD. Surprisingly, however, evidence for this association is lacking. This is important, as in general there is a lack of association between kidney function and symptoms in cross-sectional studies. The interplay between kidney function and symptoms remains unclear for the question when to start dialysis, as also illustrated by the Initiating Dialysis Early And Late (IDEAL) study, where patients were randomized to an early versus late start dialysis based upon estimated GFR (eGFR). In this study, physical symptoms played an important role in deciding if and when to initiate dialysis. A large proportion of patients randomized to the late starting group started earlier due to the presence of uraemic symptoms. Thus, even though symptom burden was demonstrated to play a major role in the decision-making for dialysis initiation in the IDEAL study, the longitudinal association between change in kidney function and change in symptoms over time in patients with advanced CKD was never empirically investigated.

To fill this gap, we aimed to study the association between kidney function decline and symptom development (i.e. symptom number and severity) over time in patients with advanced CKD. To replicate findings of existing literature, we also studied the cross-sectional association between the level of kidney function and symptoms at baseline, and to expand on this, we explored the association between the level of kidney function and symptom development.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116U4h93]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy — initiation timing and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) note that it is difficult to make a recommendation for initiating kidney replacement therapy (KRT) based solely on a specific level of GFR; several studies concluded there is no statistically significant association between renal function at the time of initiation of KRT and subsequent mortality, others suggested that worse kidney function at initiation of KRT is associated with increased mortality or morbidity, and when corrections are made for lead-time bias, there is no clear survival advantage to starting dialysis therapy earlier. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) Study is described as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing outcomes in patients starting dialysis with a Cockcroft-Gault GFR of 10 to 14 versus 5 to 7 mL/min/1.73 m². In 2000, the NKF KDOQI CPG on Nutrition in CKD advocated that — in patients with CKD and estimated GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis — if protein-energy malnutrition develops or persists despite vigorous attempts to optimize protein-energy intake and there is no apparent cause for it other than low nutrient intake, initiation of KRT should be recommended. The page also states that average GFR at initiation has increased in all age groups since 1995, increasing most in the oldest patients.

### Protocol for a prospective, cluster randomized trial to evaluate routine and deferred dialysis initiation (RADDI) in Chinese population [^117Fn6Je]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The timing of when to initiate dialysis for progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has not been well established. There has been a strong trend for early dialysis initiation for these patients over the past decades. However, the perceived survival advantage of early dialysis has been questioned by a series of recent observational studies. The only randomized controlled trial (RCT) research on this issue found the all-cause mortality, comorbidities, and quality of life showed no difference between early and late dialysis starters. To better understand optimal timing for dialysis initiation, our research will evaluate the efficacy and safety of deferred dialysis initiation in a large Chinese population.

Methods

The trial adopts a multicenter, cluster randomized, single-blind (outcomes assessor), and endpoint-driven design. Eligible participants are 18–80 years old, in stable CKD stages 4–5 (eGFR > 7 ml/min /1.73 m²), and with good heart function (NYHA grade I or II). Participants will be randomized into a routine or deferred dialysis group. The reference eGFR at initiating dialysis for asymptomatic patients is 7 ml/min /1.73 m² (routine dialysis group) and 5 ml/min/1.73 m² or less (deferred dialysis group) in each group. The primary endpoint will be the difference of all-cause mortality and acute nonfatal cerebro-cardiovascular events between the two groups. The secondary outcomes include hospitalization rate and other safety indices. The primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed by appropriate statistical methods.

Discussion

This study protocol represents a large, cluster randomized study evaluating deferred and routine dialysis intervention for an advanced CKD population. The reference eGFR to initiate dialysis for both treatment groups is targeted at less than 7 ml/min/1.73m 2. With this design, we aim to eliminate lead-time and survivor bias and avoid selection bias and confounding factors. We acknowledge that the study has limitations. Even so, given the low-targeted eGFR values of both arms, this study still has potential economic, health, and scientific implications. This research is unique in that such a low targeted eGFR value has never been studied in a clinical trial.

Trial registration

The trial has been approved by ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial registration ID). The date of registration was April 22, 2015.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^116uGhUp]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Our findings provide novel evidence on the optimal timing of dialysis initiation and show that even with maximum eGFR separations, the range of plausible effects is likely to be small. The modest increase in observed survival for initiation at higher eGFR comes at the expense of earlier dialysis initiation. Our results provide an insight into this trade-off: the maximum 5.1% absolute mortality reduction translated into a postponement of death of only 1.6 months over a five year follow-up period, whereas dialysis would need to be started on average four years earlier. For many patients, the modest survival benefit may not outweigh this increased time on dialysis. Our results further suggest that in the absence of symptoms or strong indications, initiation of dialysis may be postponed until lower eGFR values are reached (intent to defer), without a large increase in mortality or cardiovascular events. From a societal perspective, the higher costs associated with earlier dialysis initiation make these strategies even less desirable. Current position papers highlight the importance of individualised decision making in deciding whether and when to start dialysis, taking into account outcomes, quality of life, and patients' preferences. Our findings should not be used to suggest a single eGFR cut-off to start dialysis in all patients. Rather, our finding of similar survival across the range of eGFR at which dialysis is usually considered (eGFR 5–14 mL/min/1.73 m²) should be a reassuring addition to the evidence base for clinicians: these data provide no support for any strategy other than starting dialysis on the basis of symptoms and patients' preferences, which is widespread clinical practice, recommended by guidelines, and a patient centred approach. Our study compared different dialysis initiation strategies based on eGFR only: patients who did not adhere to their assigned strategy (that is, started too early or too late on the basis of their eGFR value) were censored in our analyses at the moment of nonadherence. Hence, our study did not investigate whether other parameters, such as volume overload or symptoms, should be taken into consideration when starting dialysis. This requires further study. Neither did our study investigate the effects of dialysis initiation versus comprehensive conservative management in patients with kidney failure. Conservative care has been proposed as a reasonable alternative to maintenance dialysis for selected older patients with comorbidities or poor functional status. Whether differences exist in survival and quality of life between dialysis and conservative management is unknown and is being investigated in the ongoing randomised PREPARE for Kidney Care Study.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114W85y1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Main text

Current nephrology guidelines recommend an age-neutral approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) management based upon the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Nephrology referrals are recommended for patients with estimated glomerulofiltration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, abrupt sustained fall in eGFR (Acute Kidney Injury – AKI), albumin to creatinine ratio of > 300 mg/gm. or rapid progression of renal failure, as defined by a sustained decline in renal function of > 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year. This approach may need to be modified, as there are large differences in prognosis and the trajectory of illness for older and younger adults with similar levels of eGFR. As compared with younger adults, older adults with advanced kidney disease lose their renal function more slowly, have multiple other comorbidities, and face a substantially higher competing risk of death (from comorbidities) before being required to make a decision regarding the initiation of dialysis.

Dialysis initiation trends have led to earlier initiation, that is, starting dialysis at higher levels of eGFR. Because of this trend, many older adults who may have otherwise died from non-renal failure issues are faced with a decision regarding dialysis. Between 1996 and 2009 the percent of "early", at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2, US dialysis starts in older adults increased from 25% to 62%. Several recent observational studies using US and other countries' dialysis registry data and one randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate a survival benefit for "early start" dialysis. These studies provide support for recent guidelines, which recommend deferring dialysis until patients have low levels of eGFR (≤ 6 ml/min/1.73 m 2) unless a patient is symptomatic at a higher eGFR level. Although there is agreement that a patient's symptoms should be the primary determinant for starting dialysis, eGFR remains a primary consideration for many nephrologists and symptoms that drive the decision to start dialysis are generally non specific and not life threatening.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^1124n9ZC]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

One randomised trial (IDEAL) and various observational studies have investigated the timing of dialysis. In a sensitivity analysis, we compared the same treatment arms as in the IDEAL trial to benchmark our analytical methods. In IDEAL, the achieved eGFR in the early and late arms were 7.2 and 9.0 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. In our study, mean eGFR for late (eGFR 5–7) and intermediate (eGFR 7–10) start were 6.0 and 8.3 mL/min/1.73 m², respectively. In this comparison, we observed hazard ratios of 0.97 (0.94 to 0.99) for mortality and 1.00 (0.97 to 1.04) for major adverse cardiovascular events. These findings are congruent with those of IDEAL: 1.04 (0.83 to 1.30) and 1.23 (0.97 to 1.56), respectively.

Previous observational studies have investigated the timing of dialysis initiation, but they have been criticised for the presence of immortal time, selection/survivor, and lead time biases. For example, some reports found a strong protective effect of late dialysis initiation, which conflicts with findings from IDEAL. In our sensitivity analyses, we showed that such findings may have been due to either immortal time bias or selection/survivor bias. Our study design based on cloning, censoring, and weighting prevents these biases by explicitly emulating a target trial, and aligning eligibility and treatment strategies at baseline. Although one previous observational study applied a similar design to ours, it did not adjust for time varying covariates and was limited in sample size.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^112ApcNp]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Sensitivity analyses

We pre-specified several analyses to test the robustness of our main results. Firstly, we emulated the IDEAL trial comparing early initiation (eGFR 10–14) versus late initiation (eGFR 5–7) on mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events to validate our analytical methods. We added a third "intermediate initiation" arm (eGFR 7–10), which includes the mean achieved eGFR in the early initiation arm in IDEAL. Secondly, we did stratified analyses by age (≥ 70 v < 70 years), sex, presence of diabetes, eGFR at baseline (10–15 v 15–20 mL/min/1.73 m 2), presence of ischaemic heart disease, and presence of heart failure. Thirdly, we investigated the influence of adjustment for measured confounders on our point estimates by sequentially adjusting for baseline and time varying confounders. Fourthly, we compared results when using non-truncated weights. Fifthly, we excluded patients with cancer at baseline. Sixthly, we used a different analytical method for the competing event of kidney transplantation. We modelled the direct effect of dialysis initiation strategies on mortality, not mediated through kidney transplantation, by adding additional inverse probability of censoring weights. Intuitively, this models the effect of dialysis initiation strategies in a hypothetical world in which no kidney transplantations occur. Seventhly, we additionally adjusted for time dependent measures of urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and plasma potassium in our analyses. This analysis was restricted to the 4286 patients with these measurements available. Although these laboratory values are routinely measured in this population, reporting them to the Swedish Renal Registry was not mandatory until 2015. Because some physicians chose to report this information, whereas others did not, we assumed that these data were missing completely at random. Eighthly, we censored patients who chose conservative treatment (that is, patients explicitly chose treatment of kidney failure without dialysis). We used additional inverse probability of censoring weights to account for informative censoring. Intuitively, this models the effect of dialysis initiation strategies in a hypothetical world in which no patients choose conservative management. Lastly, we analysed our data by using the "from initiation" and "from threshold" method analogous to previous observational studies, to show that immortal time bias and selection/survivor bias give an artificial survival advantage to late dialysis initiation. A detailed description of these methods and how bias arises is provided in the supplementary methods. Owing to computational efficiency and lower power with 15 strategies, we did subgroup and sensitivity analyses using three dialysis initiation strategies only.

### Timing of commencement of maintenance dialysis and mortality in young and older adults in Singapore [^1137T8vM]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal timing of dialysis initiation remains uncertain, with some observational studies finding a lower risk of death with early initiation of dialysis and others showing either a survival advantage of late dialysis initiation or comparable mortality risk between early and late initiation. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study, the only randomized controlled trial to date comparing survival between early (target eGFR: 10 to 14 ml/min) and late (target eGFR: 5 to 7 ml/min) dialysis initiation, did not find a significant difference in mortality risk. In this trial, 76% patients in the late-start group started dialysis before the eGFR reached the target of < 7.0 mL per minute. The mean eGFR on starting dialysis was 9.8 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in the late-start group compared with 12.0 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 in the early-start group. Thus, the association between very low eGFR at initiation (ie < 7 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and mortality could not be assessed in that study. Furthermore, it has been reported that among patients with stage 3 CKD and initial eGFR levels < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, younger patients were more likely to experience an annual decline in eGFR of > 3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 than older patients. However, previous studies including IDEAL did not examine if age can modify mortality risk associated with the timing of dialysis.

The purpose of this observational study was to explore the association between timing of initiation of maintenance dialysis with regard to eGFR levels at initiation and mortality risk among adult patients in Singapore. We also sought to explore whether age may affect the association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and risk of mortality in patients with ESRD. We examined these relationships after accounting for sociodemographic factors, co-morbidities, and nutritional status. Furthermore, since reduced renal function contributes directly to anemia and abnormalities of bone and mineral metabolism biomarkers, which have been shown to be independent predictor of mortality in ESRD patients, we also explored if these biomarkers were potential mediators for any observed association between eGFR at initiation of dialysis and mortality.

### Protocol for a prospective, cluster randomized trial to evaluate routine and deferred dialysis initiation (RADDI) in Chinese population [^11213CwM]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Optimal timing for chronic dialysis initiation in ESKD patients is currently unknown. The transition period from the pre–ESKD phase to the ESKD phase of CKD is critical for patients. In our previous study, we found that mortality rates in the first 2 months were highest for new chronic dialysis starters (41.9 and 16.6 per 100 patient-years). Determining optimal timing for dialysis initiation is of great importance. This study protocol represents a large, randomized study evaluating the efficacy and safety of deferred and routine dialysis intervention for an advanced CKD Chinese population. The IDEAL study demonstrated no significant difference in survival between treatment groups. However, the average GFR were 12.0 ml/min/1.73m 2 in the early start group and 9.8 ml/min/1.73m 2 in the late start group, which were relatively higher than those recommended in recently released guidelines. In China, because of limited medical resources, dialysis is routinely started for ESKD patients at a much lower eGFR. In our study, the reference eGFR for initiating dialysis is 7 ml/min/1.73m 2 or lower. No interventional study has targeted such a low reference eGFR to date. This study will improve our understanding of the timing of chronic dialysis.

### Factors affecting the decision to initiate dialysis: a national survey of United States nephrologists [^112XH9PB]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The percentage of patients initiating dialysis at an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 9 mL/min/1.73 m2 decreased between 2000 and 2018 in the USA. Clinical practice guidelines recommend basing the decision to initiate dialysis primarily on uremic signs and symptoms rather than on a particular level of kidney function. However, what signs and symptoms currently practicing nephrologists consider "uremic", how they weigh eGFR and other factors in the decision to initiate dialysis have not been reported.

Methods

The study was an online survey of 255 US nephrologists, conducted between August and October 2021.

Results

Nearly half of respondents (49.8%) had an absolute lower eGFR (8.4 [95% CI: 7.6, 9.2] mL/min/1.73 m2) at which they would initiate dialysis in an asymptomatic patient. The top 5 symptoms that would trigger a recommendation to initiate dialysis were loss of appetite/nausea/vomiting (17%), low eGFR (10%), shortness of breath (10%), declining physical ability/function (9%), and generalized weakness (9%). Poor nutritional status and physical function decline were considered very important in the decision to initiate dialysis by 64% and 55% of respondents, respectively. Nephrologists surveyed significantly shortened the time to dialysis initiation in response to declining physical function in an otherwise asymptomatic (hypothetical) patient.

Conclusions

Nearly half of nephrologists sometimes based their decision to initiate dialysis on eGFR alone. The eGFR threshold at which they did so was lower than has been examined in randomized controlled trials of dialysis initiation. Initiatives designed to safely delay dialysis through aggressive medical management could focus on modifiable factors that are the most important drivers of the decision to initiate dialysis.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^1171YSBF]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

For major adverse cardiovascular events, the absolute risk was lowest between eGFR 17–18 and eGFR 11–12 and then progressively increased between eGFR 11–12 and eGFR 4–5 (supplementary table G; fig 2, bottom). Compared with eGFR 6–7, risk differences varied between an increase of 1.5% and a decrease of 3.3% (fig 2, bottom), and hazard ratios between 1.04 and 0.91, respectively. For eGFR 15–16, the absolute risk was 2.9% (0.2% to 5.5%) lower and the hazard ratio was 0.94 (0.91 to 0.98). When we took eGFR 11–12 as the reference group, risk differences varied between an increase of 4.7% for eGFR 4–5 and a decrease of 0.2% for eGFR 12–13 (supplementary table H). The five year differences in restricted mean survival time varied between −0.3 and 0.7 months (supplementary table E).

Supporting and sensitivity analyses

In our analysis mirroring the GFR thresholds from the IDEAL trial, early dialysis initiation (eGFR 10–14) was associated with a 3.3% (1.3% to 5.3%) lower five year mortality risk and 3.6% (1.0% to 6.0%) lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with late initiation (eGFR 5–7), with hazard ratios of 0.96 (0.94 to 0.99) and 0.96 (0.93 to 1.00), respectively (supplementary table I; fig 4). We found similar results when comparing late versus intermediate (eGFR 7–10) dialysis initiation, in keeping with the achieved eGFR at initiation in the earlier arm of IDEAL. Compared with late dialysis initiation, intermediate initiation was associated with a 2.7% (0.7% to 4.6%) lower five year mortality risk, corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.97 (0.94 to 1.00).

### Kidney function and symptom development over time in elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: results of the EQUAL cohort study [^117N4PMS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Although healthcare providers are aware of the symptom burden in patients with advanced CKD, and evaluation of symptoms is rated as important in the KDIGO guidelines, the evidence behind this recommendation is 'not graded'. This complicates anticipating treatment choices and advising when to initiate dialysis for symptom relief. Our results seem to suggest that repeated thorough assessment of both symptom burden and severity, in addition to the monitoring of kidney disease progression, is important throughout the pre-dialysis period, for instance using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs). Current research such as the Symptom monitoring WIth Feedback Trial (SWIFT) in Australia/New Zealand and OPTimising routine collection of electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes into disease registries (OPT-ePRO) in the UK are investigating the effectiveness of routinely capturing PROMs in renal care. The underlying purpose is to improve symptom control, to reduce symptom number and severity, and to prepare for end-stage kidney disease care. Developing better treatments to reduce symptoms of CKD is also suggested as the main research priority by patients. Future research should focus on which CKD-related symptoms possibly increase the most with kidney function deterioration. Additionally, uraemic signs and symptoms were rated as the most important factor guiding the timing of dialysis initiation in an international survey. The important role of physical symptoms in deciding when to start dialysis was also seen in the IDEAL study. Furthermore, each additional sign or symptom has been shown to be associated with a higher odds for earlier dialysis initiation [odds ratio of 1.16 (95% CI 1.06; 1.28) per symptom] in nursing home residents. For future research, it would be interesting to investigate whether the increase in symptom burden is associated with time to dialysis initiation or hospitalization; a longer follow-up would be needed in order to provide enough events. Ultimately, a clinical decision rule, including kidney function decline and symptom development, may be useful to decide what the optimal timing is for dialysis initiation. Of course, we have to keep in mind that non-specific symptoms could be related to other comorbid conditions or illnesses precipitating early dialysis initiation among some providers.

To conclude, we showed that a faster kidney function decline associates with a more progressive increase in both overall symptom number and severity in patients with advanced CKD. Considering the modest association, our results seem to suggest that repeated thorough assessment of symptom development during outpatient clinic visits, in addition to the monitoring of kidney function decline, is important for clinical decision-making.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^113BjXZQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Commentary and clinical utility for timing dialysis — The evidence available to inform recommendations about the timing of initiation of dialysis remains limited, and the KDOQI Work Group agrees that initiation of dialysis should be informed by multiple dimensions of a patient's health and livelihood, with symptoms assessed regularly and considered during the shared decision-making process of determining the time to initiate dialysis; the KDIGO guidelines continue to expound on considering initiation of dialysis as "early" or "late" defined by eGFR, but a consideration may be to abandon the labels of early or late and recognize that 1 factor (eg, eGFR) is insufficient, and if no difference in outcomes based on the timing of initiation has been identified, then the reason for characterizing initiation as early or late comes into question; the final practice point is revised to emphasize the role of vascular access planning and introduces the consideration of kidney failure risk prognosis, with preliminary research aligning with a 2-year risk of > 40% and reporting that the combination of eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and risk ≥ 20% have a strong association with dialysis initiation and use of a vascular access, and the guidelines suggest that the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calculating the risk of kidney failure although implementation of the KFRE within the EHR remains variable across health systems.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^114UeM3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Guideline 1.2 — starting kidney replacement therapy should not rely on an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) number alone but on symptoms and preferences: Symptoms of uremia are nonspecific, and attempts should be made to evaluate for other, sometimes reversible, causes of symptoms, and uremic symptoms can be subtle, with patients adapting to lower levels of functioning without clearly expressing symptoms. The decision to initiate KRT should not be based on estimated GFR (eGFR) level alone, and the balance among the benefits, risks, and disadvantages of initiating or not initiating dialysis should be evaluated, taking into account education received and preferences expressed by the patients and/or their caregivers. While no specific numeric threshold is endorsed, the Work Group noted there likely is a floor GFR below which KRT is required, and that there is a level at which delaying for KRT initiation versus electing for conservative care becomes imperative.

### Dialysis initiation in patients with chronic coronary disease and advanced chronic kidney disease in ISCHEMIA-CKD [^113Q51LW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In the current study, lower baseline eGFR, diabetes, hypertension, and Hispanic ethnicity were significant predictors of dialysis initiation. The eGFR value at the time of dialysis initiation was not available. In ISCHEMIA‐CKD, the timing of dialysis initiation was left to the treating physicians according to guideline recommendations and local standard of care, although an element of anticipation anxiety and enhanced vigilance could have played a role. There is no minimum eGFR that provides an absolute indication to begin dialysis in the absence of signs or symptoms attributable to kidney failure. However, eGFR of < 5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 represents a critical cutoff for dialysis start. The IDEAL (Initiating Dialysis Early and Late) study, which is the only randomized, controlled study that examined mortality related to the time of dialysis initiation, found no difference in survival between early (eGFR 8–13 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) or late (eGFR 3–5 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) initiation of dialysis. In that study, the median time to dialysis initiation was 1.8 versus 7.4 months in the early‐ and late‐start groups, respectively. Contributing factors for dialysis initiation are as follows: (1) comorbid conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease; (2) older age; (3) timing of referral of patients with CKD to a nephrologist; and (4) the preference of the nephrologist, as there is large variability in individual practices. Finally, we found variations in progression to dialysis initiation by racial/ethnic background.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^113dTXV6]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, older adults with advanced CKD are likely to die from non-renal failure related conditions before they are faced with a decision concerning dialysis. Exceptions to this scenario are patients who lose renal function rapidly and have limited comorbidities. In the US, older adults initiate dialysis early (at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2) and have a high comorbidity burden. Other countries, including Canada and New Zealand, have much lower rates of renal replacement therapy for older adults compared to the US. Although dialysis initiation guidelines emphasize the presence of renal failure symptoms as justification to start dialysis, many older adults start dialysis preemptively, in the face of non-specific, often comorbidity related symptoms. These new dialysis patients are generally not informed about non-dialysis, conservative management options. To remedy this situation, an interdisciplinary team effort by health care providers, should consist of early and repeated discussions with patients and their families regarding a patient's preferences and goals in the context of the potential benefits and harms of dialysis initiation. Conservative management may be a reasonable choice for patients whose primary goal is to maintain their independence and to avoid the time, pain, and discomfort related to dialysis, as well as for patients with poor functional status and a predicted post dialysis initiation projected survival of less than three months. Future studies should examine knowledge, attitudes and decision support interventions that could benefit older adults and their providers when making decisions regarding management of advanced CKD. As well, more data is needed on outcomes of conservative and dialytic management and characteristics of older adults who would benefit from each of these approaches.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^115NqB8h]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Dialysis initiation rates among older adults, aged 75 years or greater, are increasing at a faster rate than for younger age groups. Older adults with advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2) typically lose renal function slowly, often suffer from significant comorbidity and thus may die from associated comorbidities before they require dialysis. A patient's pattern of renal function loss over time in relation to their underlying comorbidities can serve as a guide to the probability of a future dialysis requirement. Most who start dialysis, initiate treatment "early", at an estimated glomerulofiltration rate (eGFR) > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and many initiate dialysis in hospital, often in association with an episode of acute renal failure. In the US older adults start dialysis at a mean e GFR of 12.6 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and 20.6% die within six months of dialysis initiation. In both the acute in hospital and outpatient settings, many older adults appear to be initiating dialysis for non-specific, non-life threatening symptoms and clinical contexts. Observational data suggests that dialysis does not provide a survival benefit for older adults with poor mobility and high levels of comorbidity. To optimize the care of this population, early and repeat shared decision making conversations by health care providers, patients, and their families should consider the risks, burdens, and benefits of dialysis versus conservative management, as well as the patient specific symptoms and clinical situations that could justify dialysis initiation. The potential advantages and disadvantages of dialysis therapy should be considered in conjunction with each patient's unique goals and priorities. In conclusion, when considering the morbidity and quality of life impact associated with dialysis, many older adults may prefer to delay dialysis until there is a definitive indication or may opt for conservative management without dialysis. This approach can incorporate all CKD treatments other than dialysis, provide psychosocial and spiritual support and active symptom management and may also incorporate a palliative care approach with less medical monitoring of lab parameters and more focus on the use of drug therapies directed to relief of a patient's symptoms.

### Cost-effectiveness of initiating dialysis early: a randomized controlled trial [^113FHXAT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Planned early initiation of dialysis therapy based on estimated kidney function does not influence mortality and major comorbid conditions, but amelioration of symptoms may improve quality of life and decrease costs.

Study Design

Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease and a Cockcroft-Gault estimated glomerular filtration rate of 10–15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were randomly assigned to start dialysis therapy at a glomerular filtration rate of either 10–14 (early start) or 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (late start).

Setting & Population

Of the original 828 patients in the IDEAL (Initiation of Dialysis Early or Late) Trial in renal units in Australia and New Zealand, 642 agreed to participate in this cost-effectiveness study. STUDY PERSPECTIVE & TIMEFRAME: A societal perspective was taken for costs. Patients were enrolled between July 1, 2000, and November 14, 2008, and followed up until November 14, 2009.

Intervention

Planned earlier start of maintenance dialysis therapy.

Outcomes

Difference in quality of life and costs.

Results

Median follow-up of patients (307 early start, 335 late start) was 4.15 years, with a 6-month difference in median duration of dialysis therapy. Mean direct dialysis costs were significantly higher in the early-start group ($10,777; 95% CI, $313 to $22,801). Total costs, including costs for resources used to manage adverse events, were higher in the early-start group ($18,715; 95% CI, -$3,162 to $43,021), although not statistically different. Adjusted for differences in baseline quality of life, the difference in quality-adjusted survival between groups over the time horizon of the trial was not statistically different (0.02 full health equivalent years; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.14).

Limitations

Missing quality-of-life questionnaires and skewed cost data, although similar in each group, decrease the precision of results.

Conclusion

Planned early initiation of dialysis therapy in patients with progressive chronic kidney disease has higher dialysis costs and is not associated with improved quality of life.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in acute kidney injury and acute-on-chronic renal failure [^1129jrwE]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

The decision to provide dialytic support and choosing the ideal moment to initiate therapy are common impasses for physicians treating patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Although renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been extensively used in clinical practice for more than 30 years, there is a paucity of evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal utilization of RRT in AKI. In the absence of traditional or urgent indications, there is no consensus on whether dialysis should be offered and when it should be started. The lack of agreed-upon parameters to guide the decision, the fear of the risk of the procedure, and the possible contribution to worse prognosis with RRT have resulted in a considerable variation in practice among physicians and centers. In this review, we summarize the evidence evaluating time of initiation of RRT and discuss possible approaches for future trials in addressing this issue.

### Has the time come for age-adapted glomerular filtration rate criteria to define chronic kidney disease: how soon is now? [^111abLXY]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The conventional definition of chronic kidney disease (CKD) primarily relies on the identification of albuminuria or a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For many years, a straightforward eGFR threshold of < 60ml/min/1.73 m 2 has been widely adopted as the standard for defining CKD. Nonetheless, this criterion fails to consider the natural aging process of the kidney, and this oversight may affect the accurate diagnosis of kidney disease particularly at the extremes of age.

Recent Findings

The fixed eGFR threshold of < 60ml/min/1.73 m 2 for defining CKD misses crucial opportunities for risk prevention. Studies have revealed that the eGFR threshold at which the risks for adverse long-term health outcomes such as mortality, cardiovascular events, and kidney failure begin to rise varies substantially by age. Specifically, this threshold is lower for the elderly and higher for young adults. Consequently, this results in the over-diagnosis of kidney disease in the elderly and the under-diagnosis of kidney disease in young adults.

Summary

To address these limitations of the current CKD definition, we discuss a number of proposed age-adapted eGFR criteria and weigh their pros and cons against the current, simple, and universally accepted approach.

### Timing of dialysis initiation: when to start? Which treatment? [^116hxVwj]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

During the late 1990s early initiation of dialysis was introduced on a large scale and between 1996 and 2008, the percentage of patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 10 mL/minute starting dialysis rose from 25% to 54% in the United States. However, several subsequent studies showed no survival benefit for patients commencing dialysis earlier. One possible explanation for the negative results could be that eGFR may be a flawed index; s-creatinine is lower in patients with muscle wasting or fluid overload and these vulnerable patients with high comorbidity burden often start "early", i.e., at higher eGFR. Another explanation could be that dialysis is in fact harmful; dialysis initiation with conventional thrice weekly in-center hemodialysis clearly associates with increased initial mortality risk especially when using temporary dialysis catheters. Interestingly, patients starting on peritoneal dialysis (PD) appear to have better initial outcomes. More attention should be given to finding new objective mortality-predictive markers of uremia, reducing the use of temporary hemodialysis catheters, and increasing the use of PD as initial dialysis modality. PD may not only provide better initial dialysis outcomes but may also preserve renal function and vessels for vascular access for the benefit of better long-term outcomes.

### Initiation of dialysis at higher GFRs: is the apparent rising tide of early dialysis harmful or helpful? [^113VaaTU]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Over the past decade a trend of increasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the initiation of dialysis for treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been noted in the United States. In 1996, only 19% of patients began dialysis therapy with an eGFR of greater than 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 (denoted as 'early start'), but by 2005 the fraction of early start dialysis patients had risen to 45%. This review examines US dialysis data, national guidelines, and publications relevant to the early start phenomenon. It is not known whether early start of dialysis is beneficial, harmful or neutral with respect to the outcome of dialysis treatment for ESRD. Available data indicate that mortality while on dialysis therapy may be higher in those subjects with early start. Comorbidities present at the time of dialysis initiation do not appear to be a major driving force for early start patients. As well, residual kidney function in these patients is a major contributor to total urea or creatinine clearance. This can be a positive factor for patient outcomes and might be compromised by early start. Finally, we estimate the dollar cost of early start to the US Medicare-supported ESRD program. Properly designed, prospective and randomized studies may help to clarify the benefit or harm of early start of dialysis for ESRD.

### How do older patients with advanced kidney disease, and their family members, understand kidney function and failure? A qualitative study [^111zkF2a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Defining the reasons and optimal timing for dialysis initiation for older patients is challenging, requiring consideration of individual patients' circumstances and preferences. Potential benefits of earlier treatment initiation, such as initiation of chosen modality, must be weighed against the potential for receipt of dialysis that provides neither quality nor quantity of life benefit. A focus on eGFR may compel older patients to prepare for dialysis without consideration of wider factors which can have a significant personal impact, such as symptoms, quality of life, treatment burden and end-of-life wishes.

Optimal communication depends on clinicians having skills and resources to facilitate complex discussions; however nephrologists describe challenges explaining disease, treatment and prognostic complexity within available consultation time, and currently available patient information documents may misrepresent treatment options. One approach may be for clinicians to routinely discuss with patients and document the goals of dialysis initiation – both in advance of, and at the time of, starting. Such would reframe the 'need' as the 'reason' to start dialysis. This might empower patients to share the decision about whether such a time has come, and to judge whether initiation has been successful. It may also help patients – and clinicians – to nuance understanding of the associations between kidney failure (as defined by eGFR thresholds), kidney replacement therapy, and death. People can live for many months or even years after reaching kidney failure, without kidney replacement therapy. Dialysis only ever provides a finite extension to life, and must be started before death from kidney failure. Older people, and others at high risk of competing mortality need accurate, unbiased information which conveys the reality that life extension cannot be presumed with dialysis initiation, in conjunction with compassionate and supportive input from their clinical teams. Research involving consultation observation may help to identify how communication influences patient understanding and decision-making, and inform approaches that could be included in interventions.

### Routine screening for CKD should be done in asymptomatic adults… selectively [^116xNfYh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

CKD is an important public health problem associated with substantial morbidity, impaired quality of life, shortened life expectancy, and excessive health care costs. Given its long preclinical latency, screening of asymptomatic individuals for CKD has been considered as a potentially useful means of early detection, with a goal of reducing CKD progression and its complications. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians that recommended against screening for CKD in asymptomatic adults without risk factors has reignited debate regarding CKD screening. Despite the lack of randomized controlled trial evidence showing benefits of CKD screening, even among individuals at increased risk for CKD, such as those with diabetes or hypertension or who are of certain high-risk racial or ethnic groups, a thoughtful and selective approach to CKD screening seems to be cost-effective and clinically valuable. CKD screening is recommended by several nephrology professional societies and appropriate in at-risk asymptomatic individuals with the intent of identifying and managing CKD, diagnosing the etiology of CKD, limiting or preventing CKD progression and its associated cardiovascular disease risk, and minimizing risk of AKI, inappropriate drug dosing, and nephrotoxic injury.

### Effects of a knowledge-translation intervention on early dialysis initiation: a cluster randomized trial [^1114msvM]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial, published in 2009, found no clinically measurable benefit with respect to risk of mortality or early complications with early dialysis initiation versus deferred dialysis start. After these findings, guidelines recommended an intent-to-defer approach to dialysis initiation, with the goal of deferring it until clinical symptoms arise.

Methods

To evaluate a four-component knowledge translation intervention aimed at promoting an intent-to-defer strategy for dialysis initiation, we conducted a cluster randomized trial in Canada between October 2014 and November 2015. We randomized 55 clinics, 27 to the intervention group and 28 to the control group. The educational intervention, using knowledge-translation tools, included telephone surveys from a knowledge-translation broker, a 1-year center-specific audit with feedback, delivery of a guidelines package, and an academic detailing visit. Participants included adults who had at least 3 months of predialysis care and who started dialysis in the first year after the intervention. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who initiated dialysis early (at eGFR > 10.5 ml/min per 1.73 m²). The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients who initiated in the acute inpatient setting.

Results

The analysis included 3424 patients initiating dialysis in the 1-year follow-up period. Of these, 509 of 1592 (32.0%) in the intervention arm and 605 of 1832 (33.0%) in the control arm started dialysis early. There was no difference in the proportion of individuals initiating dialysis early or in the proportion of individuals initiating dialysis as an acute inpatient.

Conclusions

A multifaceted knowledge translation intervention failed to reduce the proportion of early dialysis starts in patients with CKD followed in multidisciplinary clinics.

### Controversies in timing of dialysis initiation and the role of race and demographics [^116LZGwm]. Seminars in Dialysis (2013). Low credibility.

Dialysis remains the predominant form of renal replacement therapy in the United States, but the optimal timing for the initiation of dialysis remains poorly defined. Not only clinical factors such as signs/symptoms of uremia, co-existing cardiovascular disease, and presence of diabetes but also key demographic characteristics including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomics have all been considered as potential modifying factors in the decision for the timing of dialysis initiation. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) suggests that dialysis be initiated when signs/symptoms attributable to kidney failure such as serositis, acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities, pruritus, poorly controlled volume status or blood pressure, deteriorating nutritional status despite dietary intervention, or cognitive impairment are visible or noted. These signs/symptoms typically occur when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is in the range of 5–10 ml/minute/1.73 m(2), although they may occur at higher levels of GFR. We review recent data on the timing of dialysis initiation, their implications for managing patients with late-stage CKD, and the important role of considering key demographics in making patient-centered decisions for the timing of dialysis initiation.

### Release of apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM) from pentameric IgM in serum predicts prognosis after hemodialysis initiation [^113D8Mja]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The number of dialysis patients is increasing worldwide every year. As chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses, a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the accumulation of various uremic toxins that should be excreted by the kidney occur, leading to various biological and clinical dysfunctions including the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Ultimately, CKD progresses to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), necessitating kidney replacement therapy (KRT; hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or kidney transplantation.

However, the optimal timing of the initiation of dialysis for CKD patients and the prognosis assessment in ESKD patients remain contentious issues. Numerous studies have reported that decisions regarding the commencement of dialysis cannot be solely based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine (Cre) levels, with eGFR and Cre at the time of dialysis initiation not being strongly associated with prognosis –. Notably, the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study, a randomized control trial, found that initiating dialysis early (at higher eGFR levels of 10–14 mL/min/1.73) did not lead to better survival or improvements in secondary outcomes such as CVD events, infections, and complications of dialysis, when compared to a later start (at lower eGFR levels of 5–7 mL/min/1.73). Consequently, most current guidelines recommend that the decision to initiate dialysis should be based on the patient's symptoms and signs related to ESKD, rather than on eGFR values. As a result, there are essentially no objective and widely available biomarkers that accurately predict the optimal timing of starting dialysis or reliably assess prognosis after dialysis initiation in patients with CKD.

### Trends in timing of dialysis and incidence of end-stage kidney disease… [^112F4G2E]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The likelihood of receiving dialysis at eGFR levels of 10 to 24 mL/min/1. 73 m2 generally increased over time. Consistent with this, after publication of the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late trial — a randomized clinical trial showing no significant difference in death or other outcomes with earlier vs later initiation of dialysis10 — a rapid drop in early dialysis initiation was observed in Canada. 11 Although early dialysis initiation was defined in that study as dialysis initiation at eGFR higher than 10. 5 mL/min/1. 73 m2, there was no information regarding how the number of patients with chronic kidney disease in the underlying population with eGFR higher than
10. 5 mL/min/1. 73 m2 may have changed during the relevant period. By contrast, among patients with very low index eGFR, we observed stable or decreased unadjusted and adjusted odds of initiating dialysis over time.

These patterns were similar among the subset of patients with elective dialysis starts. Ferguson et al11 showed that after publication of the IDEAL trial in 2010, which found no systematic clinical benefit for initiation of earlier vs later dialysis, there was an immediate decrease in the proportion of early dialysis starts in Canada. However, Ferguson et al did not have data on the underlying at-risk Canadian population. By contrast, a major strength of our study is that we captured the underlying at-risk population whose distribution of eGFR was known. Following publication of the IDEAL trial, there have also been calls for starting dialysis later. 37 The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence now recommends waiting until an eGFR of 5 to 7 mL/min/1. 73 m2 or the presence of symptoms affecting daily life before starting dialysis.

38 Furthermore, the Japanese Society of Nephrology guidelines recommend patients "endure under conservative treatment until the GFR is < 8 mL/min/1. 73 m2 even when the symptoms of renal failure are observed. "39.

Guidance to clinicians — framework and when to obtain mGFR: A framework is described beginning with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests, with an algorithm that starts from an initial test using eGFRcr and then decisions for supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR; healthcare providers should consider both potential sources of error in eGFR and whether the clinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR, as the level of accuracy needed for potentially toxic medications or narrow therapeutic window therapies may exceed the capability of any eGFR equation, and in such cases, mGFR should be performed, ideally reassessed every time such a treatment is initiated or adjusted.

### Dialysis for chronic kidney failure: a review [^116mWRLn]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

More than 3.5 million people worldwide and 540 000 individuals in the US receive maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for the treatment of chronic kidney failure. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 40% after initiation of maintenance dialysis.

Observations

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis remove metabolic waste and excess body water and rebalance electrolytes to sustain life. There is no recommended estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) threshold for initiating dialysis, and patient-clinician shared decision-making should help determine when to initiate dialysis. Persistent signs and symptoms of uremia (eg, nausea, fatigue) and volume overload (eg, dyspnea, peripheral edema), worsening eGFR, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia inform the timing of therapy initiation. A randomized clinical trial reported no mortality benefit to starting dialysis at higher eGFR (10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²) vs lower eGFR (5–7 mL/min/1.73 m²) levels. Observational data suggested no differences in 5-year mortality with use of hemodialysis vs peritoneal dialysis. Cardiovascular (eg, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) and infection-related complications of maintenance dialysis are common. In the US, hemodialysis catheter-related bloodstream infections occur at a rate of 1.1 to 5.5 episodes per 1000 catheter-days and affect approximately 50% of patients within 6 months of catheter placement. Peritonitis occurs at a rate of 0.26 episodes per patient-year and affects about 30% of individuals in the first year of peritoneal dialysis therapy. Chronic kidney failure-related systemic complications, such as anemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypertension, often require pharmacologic treatment. Hypotension during dialysis, refractory symptoms (eg, muscle cramps, itching), and malfunction of dialysis access can interfere with delivery of dialysis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In 2021, more than 540 000 patients in the US received maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for treatment of chronic kidney failure. Five-year survival rate after initiation of maintenance dialysis is approximately 40%, and the mortality rate is similar with hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Decisions about dialysis initiation timing and modality are influenced by patient symptoms, laboratory trajectories, patient preferences, and therapy cost and availability and should include shared decision-making.

### Reporting the eGFR and its implication for CKD diagnosis [^1164PVLh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The process of diagnosing chronic kidney disease using the estimated GFR involves several pitfalls. The estimated GFR laboratory report should be requested only by practitioners who are familiar with how to interpret the result. Until a more reliable method is available to estimate the GFR, the current chronic kidney disease classification should be revised by reducing the central role of the GFR cutoff levels.

### Starting renal replacement therapy: is It about time? [^115hGhWA]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies of the timing of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have primarily defined "early" versus "late" initiation of dialysis using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-based criteria. Our objective was to determine the theoretical time that could be spent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 prior to reaching a conservative eGFR threshold of 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to the actual time spent in CKD stage 5 by risk factors of interest.

Methods

Eight-hundred and seventy Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants with CKD stage 5 who started renal replacement therapy (RRT) were included for retrospective study. We used mixed models to estimate the person-specific trajectory of renal function. We then used these individual trajectories to estimate the amount of time that would be spent in CKD stage 5 (between eGFR of 15 and 5 mL/min/1.73 m2) and compared this estimate to the actual time spent in CKD stage 5 prior to ESRD (between eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ESRD).

Results

We found the median observed time between eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 to RRT was 9.6 months, but the median predicted time between eGFR of 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 to eGFR of 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 was 17.7 months. Some of the largest differences between the predicted and actual amount of time spent in CKD stage 5 were noted among those with systolic blood pressure < 140 mm Hg (9.7 months longer predicted compared to actual), proteinuria < 1 g/g (9.1 months), and serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL (9.0 months).

Conclusion

We found marked differences between the actual and predicted time spent in CKD stage 5 based on risk factors of interest. We believe that placing timing of dialysis initiation in the perspective of time is novel and may identify subgroups of patients who may derive particular benefit from a more concerted effort to delay RRT.

### Association between the publication of the initiating dialysis early and late trial and the timing of dialysis initiation in Canada [^115wt9bj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Published in 2010, the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) randomized clinical trial, which randomized patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 10 and 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 to planned initiation of dialysis with an estimated GFR between 10 and 14 mL/min/1.73 m2 (early start) or an estimated GFR between 5 and 7 mL/min/1.73 m2 (late start), concluded that early initiation was not associated with improved survival or clinical outcomes.

Objective

To assess the association between the IDEAL trial results and the proportion of early dialysis starts over time.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis used data from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register to study adult (≥ 18 years of age) patients with incident chronic dialysis between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, in Canada, which has a universal health care system. Patients from the province of Quebec were excluded because its privacy laws preclude submission of deidentified data without first-person consent. The patients included in the study (n = 28 468) had at least 90 days of nephrologist care before starting dialysis and a recorded estimated GFR at dialysis initiation. Data analyses were performed from November 2016 to January 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the proportion of early dialysis starts (estimated GFR > 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m2), and the secondary outcomes included the proportions of acute inpatient dialysis starts, patients who started dialysis using a home modality, and patients receiving hemodialysis who started with an arteriovenous access. Measures included the trend prior to the IDEAL trial publication, the change in this trend after publication, and the immediate consequence of publication.

Results

The final cohort comprised 28 468 patients, of whom 17 342 (60.9%) were male and the mean (SD) age was 64.8 (14.6) years. Before the IDEAL trial, a statistically significant increasing trend was observed in the monthly proportion of early dialysis starts (adjusted rate ratio, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001–1.004; P = 0.004). After the IDEAL trial, an immediate decrease was observed in the proportion of early dialysis starts (rate ratio, 0.874; 95% CI, 0.818–0.933; P < .001), along with a statistically significant change in trend between the pretrial and posttrial periods (rate ratio, 0.994; 95% CI, 0.992–0.996; P < .001). No statistically significant differences were found in acute inpatient dialysis initiations, the proportion of patients receiving home dialysis as the initial modality, or the proportion of arteriovenous access creation at hemodialysis initiation after the IDEAL trial publication.

Conclusions and Relevance

The publication of the IDEAL trial appeared to be associated with an immediate and meaningful change in the timing of dialysis initiation in Canada.

### Referral criteria for chronic kidney disease: implications for disease management and healthcare expenditure-analysis of a population-based sample [^114B3r2Q]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a prevalence of approximately 9% in adults worldwide. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is used to grade kidney function in stages G1-G5. Due to age-dependent decline of kidney function, the prevalence of CKD stages 3–5 increases with age and reaches up to 45% in the age group 75–84 years. GFR and proteinuria can be used to grade the severity of CKD and monitor the decline of kidney function. The majority of CKD patients are older than 60 years with early stage CKD and are mainly consulting in primary care, where the prevalence is estimated to be nearly 30%. Only a few patients progress to ESRD (end stage renal disease) requiring dialysis. Referral to specialist care more than one to six months prior to initiation of dialysis was found to reduce mortality and hospitalisation, and improve preparation of dialysis.

Internationally, there are numerous clinical practice guidelines and recommendations on management of CKD, with varying referral criteria to specialist nephrology services, reflecting differences in health care systems. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO, 2012), the British guideline from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2014) guideline and the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians (DEGAM, 2019) recommend referral from stage 4 (GFR < 30 ml/min) onwards. They also recommend referral with an GFR of 30–59 ml/min and varying additional criteria. The German Societies of Nephrology (DGfN) and Internal Medicine (DGIM) issued a short manual with recommendations in 2015 recommending referral with an eGFR < 45 ml/min. In 2021 the NICE guideline was updated and suggested the use of kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) to estimate the 5-year risk of needing renal replacement therapy. A risk of 5% is suggested as a threshold for referral.

### Care practices for patients with advanced kidney disease who forgo maintenance dialysis… [^117LKxw6]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings describe an all-or-nothing approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease in which initiation of dialysis served as a powerful default option with few perceived alternatives. Stronger efforts are needed to develop a more patient-centered approach to caring for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease that is capable of proactively supporting those who do not wish to start dialysis. /min/1. 73 m2 separated by at least 90 days in the VA between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009, and were followed up from the date of their second estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 mL/min/1. 73 m2 during this time frame through death or October 1,
2011.

Contemporary clinical practice guidelines favor moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach and toward a more patient-centered approach to care for patients with advanced CKD in which all clinical decisions are responsive to and uphold what matters most to individual patients. 22 To support a more patient-centered approach, clinical guidelines stress the importance of early. and ongoing discussion of treatment options and maximizing choice around treatment modality to include home dialysis, time-limited trials of dialysis, and palliative dialysis, as well as alternatives to dialysis, such as conservative management. 23–26 However, our results indicate that among this subgroup of patients with advanced CKD who did not initiate dialysis, the goals, values, and preferences of individual patients did not weigh heavily in clinicians' approaches to decision making regarding dialysis.

The picture that emerged from our analysis was a crisis-oriented approach to decision making for dialysis in which patients' expressed desire not to pursue dialysis was often not honored until late in the course of illness, by which time they were facing a choice between dialysis or death. Rather than create preemptive plans to support patients' wishes not to undergo dialysis, clinicians tended to initially respond with encouragement and expectation for patients to change their minds and start dialysis. This study of a national cohort of patients with advanced CKD not treated with dialysis provides an important window on decision making regarding dialysis in a large US health system. Our findings describe an all-or-nothing approach to care for patients with advanced CKD in which dialysis serves as a powerful default with few perceived alternatives.

Regardless of whether patients had to resist clinicians' recommendations to undergo dialysis or were not considered candidates for dialysis, their goals and values did not seem to figure prominently in the decision making process.

### Tough choices: dialysis, palliative care, or a third option for elderly ESRD [^116WQR9b]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Dialysis should not be presumed to be the treatment of choice for all elderly chronic kidney disease stage 5 patients. Nondialysis active medical management, as an alternative to dialysis or palliative care, is a reasonable alternative in select cases. Early referral of CKD 5 elderly patients may lead to early initiation of dialysis, which may not be advantageous; it also provides an opportunity to institute active management as a treatment alternative. The informed decision to proceed with dialysis must involve both an assessment of evidence-based outcomes applicable to the patient, and allowance of patient preference. Prognostic tools are increasingly sought to aid in decision-making for elderly CKD 5 patients. Chronological age alone is not a sufficient predictor of benefit from dialysis treatments, according to observational studies and limited clinical trial data. The survival advantage of dialysis appears to be lost in patients with high levels of comorbidity. Establishing patient preference is an imperfect process, and many patients appear to regret their decision to undergo dialysis. With active medical management, efforts shift from prolonging life to emphasis on symptom control, dietary and medical treatment, and quality of life. Patient survival time can be remarkably long.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^115iNCP1]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Quality and risk of bias

For quality assessment, the Newcastle–Ottawa score of these 13 studies was 6 to 7. A detailed overview of the characteristics of the 13 studies is displayed in Table 1. In the absence of RCT studies, observational studies on timing of dialysis initiation face immortal time bias, selection/survivor bias, and lead time bias. Some studies provided strategies in the study design, data collection and statistical analysis phases to eliminate these biases; specifically, as follows: propensity score matching (PSM), survival time counted from the time of dialysis initiation and/or from a common starting point (for example: GFR 20 mL/min/1.73m2), target trial emulation using cloning, censoring and weighting. By applying these methods, well conducted observational studies could provide strong evidences for clinical decisions. The possible causes of heterogeneity among study results were regional and ethnic discrepancy, and different types of dialysis, especially the disparate definitions of early dialysis. For example, some studies defined early dialysis in terms of GFR levels, while other studies are defined by a comprehensive determination of laboratory indicators (such as hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and so on) and/or clinical symptoms (including acute heart failure, pulmo-nary edema or hypertension that was difficult to control with medication).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112TrEDp]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease risk stratification by eGFR and albuminuria across age groups — based upon the risk relationships of eGFRcr-cys and ACR categories with all complications, the existing CKD staging is appropriate among both younger and older adults. Some authors have suggested that the GFR threshold for CKD of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 should be raised to 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for younger adults and lowered to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for older adults, but the higher lifetime progression risks in younger adults with GFR 60–89 ml/min per 1.73 m2 can be addressed in their management without changing the definition of CKD, and efforts should be directed at people with higher risk with GFR levels > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to prevent the incidence of CKD or further reductions in GFR. Among older adults, the findings of consistently elevated RR for older adults with CKD G3a, A1, as defined by eGFRcr-cys, support the inclusion of this large group in the CKD population; these elevated RRs are referenced to a group defined as eGFR 90–104 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and ACR < 10 mg/g.

### The transition clinic in chronic kidney disease care [^114GFCgM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

DIALYSIS INITIATION

RRT should be initiated if there are uraemic symptoms, electrolyte disturbances, fluid retention, hypertension and deterioration in nutritional status that is insufficiently treated with other medical treatments. This often occurs when GFR is in between 5 and 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late study showed that there is no benefit from starting dialysis early in terms of eGFR; patient survival and quality of life were no better in the early group compared with the late start group. Still, many patients started with more preserved renal function, when eGFR is > 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Furthermore, elderly patients with advanced stage CKD are more likely to initiate dialysis during an episode of acute kidney injury. By monitoring the patient closely through frequent laboratory testing and clinical examinations (fluid retention, blood pressure and patient-reported symptoms) when eGFR is dropping, it is possible to tailor dialysis initiation to when both the patient and nephrologist feel the timing is optimal. It is important to remember that although eGFR may be accurate on a population level, it could be biased for an individual, especially in those with poor functional capacity, low muscle mass, overhydration and low-protein intake. Thus eGFR may remain constant while the true GFR is declining. If there is a discrepancy between patient-reported uraemic symptoms and eGFR, then it could be helpful to assess GFR through other estimating equations (e.g. cystatin C) or tracer methods (iohexol and Cr51-EDTA).

In summary, in patients with progressive and advanced stage CKD, referral to a transition clinic may help provide timely patient education, advance care planning and dialysis and kidney transplantation preparation. To help with limited resources, decision-making could benefit from a risk-based approach. The transition clinic could consist of nurse-led clinics to better monitor patient symptoms and tailor dialysis education and planning to the patients' preferences in collaboration with specialists in both PD and HD. The overall aim for the transition clinic should be to start dialysis in the right patient at the right time with a working access and with the patient feeling involved and satisfied with the decision.

### EGFR: is it ready for early identification of CKD? [^116rp1zq]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with serum creatinine simply provides the information for which the serum creatinine was ordered in the first place. Mass or universal screening is not the purpose of eGFR reporting. Furthermore, such mass screening does not seem justified. Rather, testing of high-risk groups with eGFR and urinary albumin is useful. Population estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States that use the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging system lead to disturbingly high estimates. Many of these people are elderly with marginally depressed GFRs and for whom there are no known therapeutic implications. However, an even more disturbing fraction of people with serious and progressive renal disease are not diagnosed, counseled, or treated. Reporting of eGFR is only one tool in attempting to rectify this latter problem. Nephrologists need to educate patients and their primary care colleagues in the use of this tool.

### The impact of dialysis therapy on older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: a nationwide population-based study [^1151vtES]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has several strengths. First, we present the largest currently available database for older patients with advanced CKD and their dialysis outcomes, with an extended follow-up period. Second, previous studies found that late or no referral to a nephrologist may be associated not only with an increased risk of short-term mortality, but also with incomplete understanding of dialysis in decision making. Subjects in our study were referred early to nephrologists, with a median interval of 192 days between enrollment and dialysis. This characteristic eliminated selection bias because patients were placed under nephrologists' care with the intent of initiating dialysis.

Our results provide objective information to facilitate dialysis decision making among older patients, their family members and physicians; however, some limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, decisions about whether to receive dialysis may depend on patient preferences (family support, financial constraints and the will to live), but examination of this complex process was beyond the scope of the current study. Second, information on several potential confounding factors, including obesity, nutritional condition, psychosocial function, performance status and indication for dialysis initiation, were not available in the NHIRD database. Estimated GFRs at dialysis initiation were also not recorded, whereas the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) Study showed no significant survival difference between early initiation (estimated GFRs: 10.0 to 14.0 mL per minute) and late initiation (estimated GFRs: 5.0 to 7.0 mL per minute) of dialysis. Third, our study was subject to the inherent limitations of its retrospective and observational design. However, randomized control trials investigating this issue are not possible because of the potential of violating medical ethics. Finally, we based the diagnosis of advanced CKD on ESA prescriptions, resulting in the exclusion of patients with advanced CKD who never received such prescriptions (that is, those who had no obvious renal anemia). The results of the study cannot be generalized to all older patients with advanced CKD.

### Effect of early initiation of dialysis on cardiac structure and function: results from the echo substudy of the IDEAL trial [^112iNfhH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormalities of cardiac structure and function are common in patients undergoing dialysis, and cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality in this group. Heart failure is a common clinical manifestation of cardiovascular disease and is preceded by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are variable reports about the impact of dialysis on LVH, both deleterious and beneficial. Our study investigated whether the timing of the initiation of dialysis therapy had an impact on cardiac structure and function.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting & Participants

This is a cardiac substudy involving 182 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease in the IDEAL (Initiating Dialysis Early and Late) trial.

Intervention

The IDEAL trial randomly assigned patients on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, to start dialysis therapy early (GFR, 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m²), with the others starting late (GFR, 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m²).

Outcomes & Measurements

Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and 12 months after randomization. Primary outcomes were change in left ventricular mass indexed for height (LVMi) between baseline and 12 months, left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular systolic annular velocity, ratio of mitral inflow velocity (E) to mitral annular velocity (Ea) (E/Ea), and left atrial volume indexed for height (LAVi).

Results

LVMi at baseline was elevated, but similar in both groups, with no significant change within or between groups at 12 months. E/Ea and LAVi were increased at baseline, consistent with significant diastolic dysfunction; there were no differences between groups at 12 months and no changes were observed for left ventricular volumes, left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and other echocardiographic parameters.

Limitations

Small multicenter study using echocardiography.

Conclusions

Advanced cardiac disease in these patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease did not progress during the 12-month study period and planned early initiation of dialysis therapy did not result in differences in any echocardiographic variables of cardiac structure and function.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^113ydHR6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Dialysis initiation decision-making — assessment of uremic signs and symptoms guides decision-making, but the Work Group highlights uncertainty and favors individualized timing. The page states that basing initiation on signs and/or symptoms associated with uremia is inherently challenging because uremia is a nonspecific constellation of symptoms and signs that can have other causes, and it encourages providers to be diligent in their search for reversible causes of symptoms prior to dialysis initiation. It notes that at least one cross-sectional comparison suggests the range as well as the prevalence of symptoms in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and those undergoing hemodialysis are similar, questions which symptoms would be expected to improve with kidney replacement therapy, and observes that decline in well-being may be slow without a discrete appearance of uremic symptoms, with many patients adapting to lower function or intake. Overall, the Work Group favored an individualized approach to timing dialysis initiation and states that the current body of data does not allow a prescriptive approach for timing dialysis initiation.

### Timing of dialysis initiation in transplant-naive and failed transplant patients [^117TBWVD]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Over the past two decades, most guidelines have advocated early initiation of dialysis on the basis of studies showing improved survival in patients starting dialysis early. These recommendations led to an increase in the proportion of patients initiating dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2), from 20% in 1996 to 52% in 2008. During this period, the percentage of patients starting dialysis with an eGFR ≥ 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2) increased from 4% to 17%. However, recent studies have failed to substantiate a benefit of early dialysis initiation and some data have suggested worse outcomes for patients starting dialysis with a higher eGFR. Several reasons for this seemingly paradoxical observation have been suggested, including the fact that patients requiring early dialysis are likely to have more severe symptoms and comorbidities, leading to confounding by indication, as well as biological mechanisms that causally relate early dialysis therapy to adverse outcomes. Patients with a failing renal allograft who reinitiate dialysis encounter similar problems. However, unique factors associated with a failed allograft means that the optimal timing of dialysis initiation in failed transplant patients might differ from that in transplant-naive patients with chronic kidney disease. In this Review, we discuss studies of dialysis initiation and compare risks and benefits of early versus late initiation and reinitiation of dialysis therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — risk-enhancing status and statin use in dialysis and non‑dialysis patients — is outlined as follows: CKD is a risk-enhancing factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and in intermediate-risk patients its presence favors initiation of statin therapy; reduced eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g) are independently associated with elevated ASCVD risk with a graded increase and an observed threshold around 75 mL/min/1.73 m2; for adults requiring dialysis, initiation of a statin is not recommended, whereas among those already taking a statin it may be reasonable to continue; in SHARP, > 30% of persons transitioned to dialysis and proportional effects on major atherosclerotic events were similar in dialysis and non‑dialysis groups, and trials show absolute benefit from statin use across eGFR stages.

### Screening for chronic kidney disease: unresolved issues [^114hisDh]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2003). Low credibility.

End-stage renal disease is epidemic in the United States. As a measure to control this epidemic, it has been recommended that individuals who are at risk for CKD be tested for undetected kidney disease during routine health care encounters. There are generally accepted criteria against which screening recommendations for CKD control and prevention programs should be judged. If detection strategies are to be adopted for the screening of kidney disease, then CKD must represent a significant public health problem, be characterized by a clear natural history with a detectable asymptomatic period, outcomes should be improved by early treatment, and acceptable screening tests should be available. Health systems must provide adequate and appropriate follow-up medical care for individuals with newly detected CKD. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of screening needs to be demonstrated and the effectiveness of screening as a means of achieving reductions in CKD should be proven in randomized trials.

### Considerations in the optimal preparation of patients for dialysis [^116je8Wb]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2012). Medium credibility.

Every year, more than 110,000 Americans are newly diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and in the overwhelming majority, maintenance dialysis therapy is initiated. However, most patients, having received no predialysis nephrology care or dietary counseling, are inadequately prepared for starting treatment; furthermore, the majority of patients do not have a functioning permanent dialysis access. Annualized mortality in the USA in the first 3 months after starting dialysis treatment is approximately 45%; this high rate is possibly in part due to inadequate preparation for renal replacement therapy. Data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns study suggest that similar challenges exist in many parts of the world. Implementation of strategies that mitigate the risk of adverse consequences when starting dialysis are urgently needed. In this Review we present a step-by-step approach to tackling inadequate patient preparation, which includes identifying individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are most likely to need dialysis in the future, referring patients for education, timely placement of dialysis access and timely initiation of dialysis therapy. Treatment with dialysis might not be appropriate for some patients with progressive CKD; these individuals can be optimally managed with nondialytic, maximum conservative management.

KDIGO 2024 screening algorithm for diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults — identify adults at risk for CKD and test for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ± other markers of kidney damage. If GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and/or other markers of kidney damage are present, then after 3 months or earlier if evidence of chronicity measure eGFRcr-cys if not performed and available, stage according to GFR and ACR, establish underlying cause, estimate risk of progression, and initiate treatment. If testing has not been performed, test for GFR or ACR and exclude acute kidney injury (AKI)/acute kidney disease (AKD); if AKI/AKD present, follow AKI/AKD guidance. If GFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and ACR < 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and no other markers of kidney damage are present, CKD not present and timing of retesting is based on individual characteristics such as risk of progression; ACR and GFR are still required to determine stage and estimate risk of progression.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^116c6UZw]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

The remaining six studies all showed that the early start of dialysis had no association with the prognosis of survival, of which three from Chinese HD patients. Liu et al. demonstrated that after adjusting for effectors of age, gender, diabetes, type of vascular access at initiation, clinical signs, and/or symptoms at the initiation of dialysis, and serum albumin, there was no significant difference in survival rate between the 3 groups (< 4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 was used as the reference, in comparison with 4–8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [p = 0.681] and > 8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [p = 0.403]). Chang et al. also found the fully adjusted hazards ratios of mortality for the late (3–5indicators) and very late (6–7 indicators) groups were 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.76–1.24) and 0.83 (0.61–1.15) compared with the standard (met 0–2 uremic indicators) group. The 7 uremic indicators that reached the predefined threshold in case period, namely hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, potassium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate. So the study concluded that it is safe to defer dialysis initiation among patients with CKD having an eGFR of < 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 even when patients having multiple biochemical uremic burdens. Zhang et al. in a prospective observational cohort study indicated that Charlson comorbidity index, cerebrovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were significantly associated with mortality, but not eGFR at the dialysis initiation by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Furthermore, stratified analyses confirmed elevated eGFR that had no advantage on long‑term prognosis. Therefore, the long‑term prognosis of patients with high eGFRs prior to hemodialysis was not improved.

### When to initiate dialysis: effect of proposed US guidelines on survival [^113KrqDY]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines from the US National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative recommend an earlier start of dialysis treatment than has been common practice. Their implementation would have a substantial effect on patients' daily lives and would increase costs. The guidelines are largely opinion-based, because evidence is still lacking.

Methods

As part of a prospective multicentre study in the Netherlands, we included, between January, 1997, and May, 1999, all new patients with end-stage renal disease, for whom data were available on residual renal function 0–4 weeks before the start of dialysis. We recorded date of death or censoring until August, 2000.

Findings

94 (37%) of 253 patients started dialysis treatment later than recommended by the US guideline. There was an increased mortality risk for these patients compared with those who started dialysis on time, although it was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio 1.66 [95% CI 0.95–2.89]). The adjusted difference in estimated survival time after 3 years on dialysis treatment was 2.5 months (1.1–4.0) in favour of timely starters. Conversely, the average delay in dialysis initiation for late starters, the extra time free of dialysis, was at least 4.1 months.

Interpretation

Although we observed a gain in survival time with a timely start of dialysis, it is probably a reflection of initiating dialysis earlier in the disease. We question the benefit of putting this guideline into daily practice, given the current clinical evidence and the effects it would have on patients and dialysis resources.

### Age-adapted eGFR thresholds underestimate the risks beyond kidney failure associated with CKD in older populations [^113WRrdQ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Current guidelines define a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls persistently below a fixed threshold of 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, regardless of age. This approach has been criticized as it does not account for physiological aging, nor the lifetime risk of end‐stage kidney disease, which becomes less likely with increasing age due to the rising risks of death from other causes. Alternative, age‐adapted CKD thresholds were formally proposed by a group of experts in nephrology and GFR measurement in 2019, suggesting that the GFR threshold for diagnosis be increased to 75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in persons younger than 40 years, retained at 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for those aged 40–64 years and lowered to 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 for those aged 65 years and older.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and additional specific interventions to modify risk — lipid management: In adults aged ≥ 50 years with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (G3a–G5), "we recommend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A)". In adults aged ≥ 50 years with CKD and eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (G1–G2), "we recommend treatment with a statin (1B)". In adults aged 18–49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, "we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the following (2A): known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), diabetes mellitus, prior ischemic stroke, or estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction > 10%". Practice points include to "Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool", to choose statin-based regimens to "maximize the absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol", that in adults with CKD aged 18–49 "a lower (i.e., < 10%)" 10-year risk threshold "may also be appropriate" for statin initiation, to "Consider prescribing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors" when indicated, and to "Consider a plant-based "Mediterranean-style" diet" alongside lipid-modifying therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Background

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a general health risk factor worldwide with a higher prevalence in individuals older than 60 years old. The CKD refers to a type of kidney disease in which the kidneys lose more than 50% of normal function and is defined as the presence of kidney damage or an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 persisting at least for 3 months.

Patients with CKD experience different stages of the disease (one to five), which is figured out based on the eGFR level. Stages 3 to 5 of CKD have considerable negative effects on patients' activities of daily living, health status, nutrition, and water and electrolyte hemostasis, which can cause uremic syndrome (uremia) and result in death if not treated. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is the final stage of CKD and is defined as an irreversible decrease in kidney function as there is a need for a regular course of long-term hemodialysis or a kidney transplant to sustain life.

The ESRD is one of the major public health problems worldwide, and it can cause considerable financial stress for the societies and health systems. Based on the National Health and Morbidity Survey reports, the prevalence of CKD has increased from 9.1% in 2011 to 15.5% in 2018. The incidence and prevalence of ESRD have also increased notably over the last 25 years and the number of ESRD patients is estimated to reach 51,000 in 2020 and 106,000 in 2040. In Iran, the prevalence and incidence rate of ESRD is about 357 and 57 per million each year, respectively. According to the health statistics, the number of CKD patients in Iran was more than 55,000 in 2016, out of which 27,500 received Hemodialysis (HD) and 1600 received Peritoneal Dialysis (PD).

Risk prediction model use — benefits, potential harms, and outcome selection — is framed as follows: "Assessing risk of progression can aid in optimizing healthcare delivery services, facilitate the earlier identification of individuals for disease-modifying therapy, help with planning for modality education and identify goals of care planning", and there are "limited but supportive studies" versus care guided by isolated eGFR. Potential harms arise from "inappropriate use in the settings of AKI or AKD or in younger individuals with CKD G1–G2… low risk of kidney failure in the next 5 years". For such people, "more proximal outcomes such as 40% decline in eGFR or lifetime risk were judged to be more appropriate", and "healthcare providers should be cognizant of the impact of biological and analytical variability in albuminuria and eGFR values" on predicted risk.

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

Evaluation of chronic kidney disease (CKD) — Practice Point 1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Early detection of any chronic disease, including CKD, provides greater opportunities to reduce morbidity as treatments can be initiated earlier in the disease course, and because treatments for CKD provide benefits in reducing risk for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CKD progression, strategies that promote early detection of CKD should improve kidney and non–kidney-related outcomes. Knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisions beyond initiating treatments specifically for CKD, and initial testing of blood and urine to detect CKD is important, with confirmatory testing if initial findings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria. Interviews with people who have CKD have provided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if they received a diagnosis of CKD, and if a familial form of kidney disease is suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person may allow detection in other family members.

Screening algorithm for diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults — testing begins by identifying adults at risk for CKD and proceeding to "Test for GFR* and ACR ± other markers of kidney damage†". If initial testing finds "GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 or ACR ≥ 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and/or other markers of kidney damage present", then "Test for GFR or ACR if not performed and exclude AKI/AKD", and if "AKI/AKD present: follow AKI/AKD guidance". Persistent abnormality "after 3 months or earlier if evidence of chronicity" leads to CKD confirmation; next steps include "Measure eGFRcr-cys if not performed and available" and then "Stage according to GFR and ACR, establish underlying cause, estimate risk of progression, initiate treatment". If instead "GFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 and ACR < 30 mg/g [3 mg/mmol] and no other markers of kidney damage present", then "CKD not present; timing of retesting based on individual characteristics such as risk of progression".

Practice Point 2.2.3 — A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of > 40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinical considerations. Based on current evidence, a threshold of > 40% risk or an eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is acceptable to use for initiating vascular access referral, while lower risk thresholds, such as > 20%, can optimize sensitivity, can be used to initiate modality education, and may be appropriate for prereferral vascular access planning or referral for transplantation in centers with longer wait times. The Work Group noted that the KDOQI vascular access guideline (2019) currently recommend a risk-based threshold > 50% or eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 for initiation of vascular access planning, and waiting until eGFR falls below 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 may lead to inappropriate overuse of central venous catheters at dialysis initiation.

### Early vs late start of dialysis: it's all about timing [^117R3ZeZ]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now well recognized as an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality, particularly when dialysis is needed. The wide variation in dialysis utilization contributes to a lack of consensus on what parameters should guide the decision to start dialysis. While the association of early initiation of dialysis with survival benefit was first demonstrated four decades ago, few studies in the modern era of dialysis have addressed time of dialysis initiation. Though listed as one of the top priorities in research on AKI, timing of dialysis initiation has not been included as a factor in any of the large, randomized controlled trials in this area.

Detailed justification — timing evidence and access maturation indicate that a well-conducted simulation study supports an eGFR referral of 15–20 mL/min/1.73m2, that increasing postcreation procedure rates occur when time away from starting dialysis is beyond 6 to 9 months without a greater proportion initiating with an AVF, that the average time to cannulation is 132 days for AVF that do not fail and the corresponding AVF that failed to mature was 35.9%, and that a 6- to 9-month time frame from dialysis initiation would allow time to create a new AV access to be used for dialysis start should the first one fail.
