## Question

Adverse effects of taking nitroglycerin and Viagra

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse effects of taking nitroglycerin and Viagra (sildenafil) together. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism that makes the combination dangerous. Then, I should verify the clinical magnitude and time course of the interaction. Next, I will review authoritative labeling and guideline contraindications. After that, I need to consider special populations and emergency scenarios. Finally, I will synthesize practical counseling and a bottom-line recommendation, making sure I double-check any numeric intervals before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, which degrades cGMP, thereby increasing cGMP and producing vasodilation; nitroglycerin is a nitric oxide donor that increases cGMP via sGC, so the two agents converge on the same pathway and produce additive vasodilation, which can precipitate severe hypotension, syncope, and ischemia; this is why all FDA labels list concomitant nitrates as a contraindication for sildenafil and vice versa [^111gSLEJ] [^115y8YDV] [^114fpsVc].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical magnitude. In a randomized crossover study of men with stable coronary disease, after sildenafil, the median maximum tolerated IV nitroglycerin dose was markedly lower (about 80 vs 160 mcg/min), and only 25% tolerated the highest NTG dose compared with 59% after placebo, indicating a clinically meaningful attenuation of nitrate tolerance and greater hypotension with coadministration; symptoms included dizziness and mild to moderate hypotension, consistent with the expected interaction [^115YBP7t]. In tadalafil studies, coadministration with sublingual nitroglycerin produced larger mean maximal decreases in standing systolic BP (around 28–36 mmHg depending on dose) and more subjects with standing SBP less than 85 mmHg, reinforcing the class effect and its time course [^1128TgoN] [^115u4K6Q].

> Hold on, I should verify the time course before quoting numbers. Initially, I thought the interaction might be negligible by 4 hours based on older summaries, but wait, that 4-hour figure comes from preliminary or limited data and is not the conservative, label-aligned interval; the FDA labeling and contemporary cardiology guidelines advise avoiding nitrates for at least 24 hours after sildenafil or vardenafil and at least 48 hours after tadalafil, reflecting the longer half-life of tadalafil and the uncertainty around earlier time points; I should correct myself and align with the 24- and 48-hour rules rather than the 4-hour claim [^114Za4J5] [^115JUaJB] [^1124cuoK].

> I need to check the strength of evidence and guidelines. Multiple high-credibility sources converge: FDA labeling for sildenafil and nitroglycerin products repeatedly state the combination is contraindicated due to risk of severe hypotension; the 2023 AHA/ACC chronic coronary disease guideline explicitly advises against concomitant PDE5 inhibitors and nitrates and specifies the 24- and 48-hour washout windows; the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline directs clinicians to avoid nitrates within 24 hours of sildenafil/vardenafil and 48 hours of tadalafil, underscoring emergency care implications [^111gSLEJ] [^115y8YDV] [^114Za4J5] [^113PUmRb] [^1124cuoK].

> But wait, what if the patient already took both drugs and now presents with chest pain. I should confirm emergency management principles. In acute coronary syndromes, if a PDE5 inhibitor was used recently, nitrates should be withheld and alternative analgesics (e.g., morphine or fentanyl) considered; if nitroglycerin is absolutely necessary in a life-threatening scenario, it should be given only with close hemodynamic monitoring and readiness to treat profound hypotension, recognizing that the interaction is unpredictable in dose and timing; supportive measures for nitrate-induced hypotension include Trendelenburg positioning, IV fluids, and vasopressors as needed, though evidence is limited and this remains a risk–benefit judgment call [^113PUmRb] [^1124cuoK] [^115y8YDV].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. Older adults, those with hepatic or severe renal impairment, and patients on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors have higher sildenafil exposure, which could prolong and intensify the interaction; in these settings, the 24-hour rule may be insufficient, and an even longer nitrate avoidance window is prudent when feasible; patients with autonomic dysfunction, volume depletion, or fixed outflow obstruction (e.g., aortic stenosis) are at heightened risk of symptomatic hypotension even without nitrates, so the combination is particularly hazardous in these groups [^112xxrQv] [^1132EEQy] [^11121TpE].

> I should double-check patient counseling points. Patients should be told that sildenafil and nitrates must never be mixed, including recreational "poppers" (amyl nitrite), and that if they take sildenafil and develop chest pain, they should not self-administer nitroglycerin; instead, they should call 911 and inform responders about recent PDE5 inhibitor use; conversely, patients on chronic nitrates should not be prescribed sildenafil, and clinicians should explicitly reconcile medications before initiating therapy [^113C6q21] [^111yWj82] [^116A5Cmr].

> Let me synthesize the adverse effects. The primary adverse effect is severe, potentially life-threatening hypotension with manifestations including dizziness, syncope, blurred vision, nausea, diaphoresis, and reflex tachycardia; in patients with coronary disease, this can precipitate myocardial ischemia or infarction, and in heart failure or valvular disease it can worsen hemodynamic compromise; although rare case reports describe myocardial infarction temporally associated with sildenafil even without nitrates, causality is confounded by sexual activity and underlying plaque vulnerability, so the dominant, reproducible risk with the combination remains profound hypotension and its sequelae [^115y8YDV] [^116FnZpS] [^116EtQyd] [^115dNwYx].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the practical recommendation. Do not coadminister nitroglycerin and sildenafil; if sildenafil was taken, avoid nitrates for at least 24 hours, and if tadalafil was taken, avoid nitrates for at least 48 hours; in emergencies, prioritize alternatives to nitrates and, if nitrates are absolutely necessary, administer with invasive hemodynamic monitoring and immediate access to fluids and vasopressors, recognizing that the interaction is unpredictable and potentially catastrophic; this is a contraindication, not merely a precaution, and should be treated as a medication safety red flag in all settings [^111gSLEJ] [^114Za4J5] [^113PUmRb] [^1124cuoK].

Taking nitroglycerin and Viagra (sildenafil) together is **contraindicated** because both drugs cause vasodilation and can cause severe, life-threatening hypotension [^111gSLEJ] [^115y8YDV]. This combination can lead to dizziness, syncope, shock, and even myocardial ischemia or death [^114VUgBV] [^113PUmRb]. If a patient takes sildenafil, **nitrates should be avoided for at least 24 hours** [^114Za4J5]; if nitrates are urgently needed, use only with close hemodynamic monitoring and supportive care [^115YBP7t]. Patients should be counseled to never combine these medications and to inform healthcare providers if either has been used recently [^113C6q21].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and interaction

Both nitroglycerin and sildenafil act on the **nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway**, causing vasodilation [^117KMpsY]. Nitroglycerin is a direct NO donor that increases cGMP and relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reducing preload and afterload [^117KMpsY]. Sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which degrades cGMP, thereby increasing cGMP and enhancing vasodilation [^117KMpsY]. When combined, they produce **additive vasodilation** that can cause profound hypotension [^111gSLEJ].

---

## Clinical evidence of adverse effects

Clinical studies and case reports consistently document **severe hypotension** when nitroglycerin and sildenafil are coadministered:

- **Severe hypotension**: Additive vasodilation can cause dramatic blood pressure drops, leading to dizziness, syncope, and shock [^111gSLEJ] [^115y8YDV].
- **Myocardial ischemia**: Profound hypotension can reduce coronary perfusion, precipitating ischemia or infarction, especially in patients with coronary artery disease [^113PUmRb] [^116EtQyd].
- **Syncope and shock**: Multiple reports describe patients experiencing syncope, circulatory collapse, and shock requiring emergency intervention [^111TRuUQ] [^113PUmRb].
- **Death**: Fatal outcomes have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

---

## Severity and onset of adverse effects

The interaction is **rapid and dose-related**, with hypotension typically occurring within minutes to hours after coadministration. The severity depends on doses, timing, and individual susceptibility, but even therapeutic doses can cause life-threatening hypotension [^111TRuUQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major cardiology and urology guidelines uniformly **contraindicate coadministration**:

- **Contraindication**: Sildenafil is absolutely contraindicated with nitrates due to the risk of severe hypotension [^111gSLEJ] [^112Z1nAm].
- **Washout period**: After sildenafil, avoid nitrates for at least 24 hours; after tadalafil, avoid for 48 hours due to its longer half-life [^114Za4J5] [^113PUmRb].
- **Emergency management**: If nitrates are urgently needed after sildenafil, use only with close hemodynamic monitoring and supportive care (fluids, vasopressors) [^115YBP7t] [^113PUmRb].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **particularly high risk** of severe hypotension with this combination:

- **Coronary artery disease**: Reduced coronary perfusion during hypotension increases ischemia risk [^113PUmRb].
- **Heart failure**: Hemodynamic compromise is exacerbated by additive vasodilation [^114mT5Fi].
- **Elderly patients**: Greater susceptibility to hypotension and falls [^notfound].
- **Patients on antihypertensives**: Additive effects increase hypotension risk [^115nib9P].

---

## Clinical management and counseling

Healthcare providers should:

- **Counsel patients**: Emphasize the contraindication and ensure patients disclose all medications, including over-the-counter and recreational drugs [^113C6q21].
- **Emergency protocols**: Train staff to recognize and manage severe hypotension from this interaction, including fluids and vasopressors [^115y8YDV].
- **Alternative therapies**: Consider non-nitrate antianginals (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers) in patients who may need erectile dysfunction therapy [^notfound].

### Safety of intravenous nitroglycerin after administration of sildenafil citrate to men with coronary artery disease: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial [^115YBP7t]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Although contraindicated, there are situations when a patient who has recently taken a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil) might need intravenous nitroglycerin (NTG) treatment. This study determined if, and at what dose, intravenous NTG could be administered safely to men with coronary artery disease who had recently ingested sildenafil.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial.

Setting

Four clinical practice sites in Canada, Scotland, and the United States.

Patients

A total of 34 men (≥ 35 yrs) with a history of angina pectoris and coronary artery disease (> 50% stenosis of at least one coronary artery), most of whom were taking antihypertensives.

Interventions

Sildenafil (100 mg) or placebo (single dose; crossover after 3–7 days) followed 45 mins later by escalating doses of intravenous NTG (160 microg/min maximum).

Measurements and Main Results

After sildenafil, there were slightly greater maximum (supine) blood pressure decreases and heart rate increases (e.g., 4 to 6 mm Hg [systolic] and ≤ 1 beat/min, at NTG doses of ≤ 80 microg/min) than after placebo. The median maximum tolerated NTG dose (range) was 80 (0–160) microg/min for sildenafil vs. 160 (20–160) microg/min for placebo (adjusted mean ± se, 77 ± 7 vs. 127 ± 7; p < .0001; analysis of variance), and NTG 160 microg/min was tolerated by eight (25%) and 19 (59%) men, respectively (p = .0008). Treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild/moderate hypotension, headache, and dizziness, which are often associated with NTG alone. Sildenafil and metabolite plasma concentrations were lower than previously reported in healthy men.

Conclusions

With close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, men with stable coronary artery disease who have taken sildenafil may tolerate intravenous NTG (≤ 160 microg/min) with low starting dosage and gradual upward titration. The hemodynamic response might be different in subgroups not specifically examined in the study (e.g., men presenting with acute coronary symptoms). The explanation for the lower than expected plasma concentrations remains uncertain.

Figure 1: Mean Change from Baseline in Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure, Healthy Volunteers.

Effects of Sildenafil citrate on Blood Pressure When Nitroglycerin is Subsequently Administered: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 100 mg oral dose given to healthy normal volunteers, the plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are approximately 2 ng/mL (compared to peak plasma levels of approximately 440 ng/mL). In the following patients: age > 65 years, hepatic impairment (e.g., cirrhosis), severe renal impairment (e.g., creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), and concomitant use of erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose have been found to be 3 to 8 times higher than those seen in healthy volunteers. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely co-administered at this time point [see Contraindications (4.1)].

### A 4-year update on the safety of sildenafil citrate (viagra) [^115qjgFr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for erectile dysfunction. Despite its established safety profile, concern about its cardiovascular safety persists among some physicians and the general public. This concern has stemmed primarily from sporadic reports of adverse events published in the literature and sensationalized by the media. However, the only absolute contraindication for sildenafil is concurrent use of nitrates. Because sildenafil has been on the market for 4 years and under clinical investigation for even longer, we can now evaluate its long-term safety in men who have been taking the drug for several years. We review this issue from 3 perspectives. First, we reassess the overall safety profile of sildenafil by reviewing the initial controlled clinical trials and open-label studies. We present new data from patients who have been exposed to sildenafil for up to 4.5 years. We also evaluate the results from independent postmarketing studies. Second, we review the cardiovascular-specific results from the clinical trials, long-term extension, and postmarketing studies. Lastly, we review the specific effects on the visual system based on findings from studies conducted during drug development and post marketing.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^114R4Ujm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion.

The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.

### Cardiovascular safety of sildenafil citrate (viagra): an updated perspective [^113CyeaR]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) relaxes vascular smooth muscle, resulting in modest reductions in blood pressure that are insufficient to stimulate a reflex increase in heart rate. These blood pressure reductions are similar for healthy men and men with coronary artery disease (CAD) or who use antihypertensive drugs. Sildenafil does not affect the force of cardiac contraction, and cardiac performance is unaffected. Sildenafil is mildly vasodilating in the coronary circulation and does not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. During exercise and recovery, sildenafil does not cause clinically significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters in men with CAD, and it has no negative effects on coronary oxygen consumption, ischemia, or exercise capacity. Clinical trial data from > 13,000 patients, 7 years of international postmarketing data, and observational studies of > 28,000 men in the United Kingdom and 3813 men in the European Union reveal that (1) there are no special cardiovascular concerns when sildenafil is used in accordance with product labeling and (2) the risk for serious events such as myocardial infarction or death is not increased. However, because safety has not been established in patients with recent serious cardiovascular events, hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, or retinitis pigmentosa, physicians should consult their current local prescribing information before prescribing sildenafil for these patients. Among men with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil, the adverse event profile is similar overall to that in men with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is similar between those with and without CAD, and it is similar between those who take and those who do not take antihypertensive drugs (regardless of the number or class). In a controlled interaction study of sildenafil and amlodipine, the mean additional reduction in supine blood pressure was 8 mm Hg systolic and 7 mm Hg diastolic. Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients who take alpha-blockers because coadministration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some individuals. When sildenafil is coadministered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy before initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Also, in the absence of information specific to mixed alpha/beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, similar care should be taken as for alpha-blockers. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated. Before prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying CVD could be affected adversely by resuming sexual activity. Management recommendations based on cardiovascular risk, from the Second Princeton Consensus Conference, are presented.

Chronic coronary disease — phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and nitrates guidance states that "Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should not be used concomitantly with nitrate medications, often used to treat CCD, because of the potential for severe hypotension". "Sildenafil and vardenafil have half-lives of ∼4 hours". "Tadalafil is long-acting and has a half-life of 17.5 hours". "Patients on sildenafil or vardenafil should avoid taking nitroglycerine for ≥ 24 hours (≥ 48 hours for tadalafil)".

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)

Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil with regular and/or intermittent use of nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of sildenafil with use of guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat [see Contraindications (4.3)].

Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should advise patients of the potential for sildenafil to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications. Concomitant administration of sildenafil and an alpha - blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when sildenafil is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, dizziness, nausea) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) [^112Z1nAm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients with:

Concomitant use of organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, because of the greater risk of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Concomitant use of riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, including sildenafil, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of riociguat.
Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of the oral suspension. Hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reaction, has been reported in association with the use of sildenafil.

Use with organic nitrates or riociguat. (4)
History of hypersensitivity reaction to sildenafil or any component of the oral suspension. (4)

### Nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin in dextrose) [^116Jv8TQ]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions:

The vasodilating effects of nitroglycerin may be additive with those of antihypertensives (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants) and may cause increased hypotensive effects\.

Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications).

Concomitant use of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with riociguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, can cause hypotension and is contraindicated (see Contraindications).

Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used in combination.

Nitroglycerin at higher dosages may interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Intravenous nitroglycerin can induce heparin resistance.

Administration of Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection through the same infusion set as blood can result in pseudoagglutination and hemolysis. Do not mix Nitroglycerin in 5% Dextrose Injection with any other medication of any kind.

### Nitroglycerin [^115y8YDV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.2)

7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates.

Nitroglycerin sublingual tablets are contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.

The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion.

7.2 Ergotamine

Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroMist) [^1111y5s7]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

Use of a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5 inhibitors), such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil (4.1)
Use of the soluble guanylate stimulator riociguat (4.1)
Severe anemia (4.2)
Increased intracranial pressure (4.3)
History of hypersensitivity to NitroMist or to other nitrates or nitrites (4.4)

4.1 PDE5 Inhibitor Use

Administration of NitroMist is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), as PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use NitroMist in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use can cause hypotension [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7.1)].

4.2 Severe Anemia

NitroMist is contraindicated in patients with severe anemia.

4.3 Increased Intracranial Pressure

NitroMist is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure.

4.4 Hypersensitivity

NitroMist is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to it or to other nitrates or nitrites. Skin reactions consistent with hypersensitivity have been observed with organic nitrates.

### Nitroglycerin (nitroglycerin transdermal delivery system) [^1151PMcw]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of Nitroglycerin Transdermal Delivery System by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion.

The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.

A cardiovertor/defibrillator should not be discharged through a paddle electrode that overlies a Nitroglycerin Transdermal Delivery System patch. The arcing that may be seen in this situation is harmless in itself, but it may be associated with local current concentration that can cause damage to the paddles and burns to the patient.

### Sildenafil (Sildenafil citrate) [^111gSLEJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

Administration of sildenafil tablets to patients using nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form. Sildenafil citrate was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates (4.1, 7.1, 12.2)
Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of tablet (4.2)
Administration with guanylate cyclase (GC) stimulators, such as riociguat (4.3)

4.1 Nitrates

Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1, 12.2)], sildenafil citrate was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form either regularly and/or intermittently is therefore contraindicated.

After patients have taken sildenafil citrate, it is unknown when nitrates, if necessary, can be safely administered. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely co-administered at this time point [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

4.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Sildenafil tablets is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to sildenafil, as contained in sildenafil tablets, 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg and sildenafil tablets, 20 mg, or any component of the tablet. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including rash and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

4.3 Concomitant Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Do not use sildenafil tablets in patients who are using a GC stimulator, such as riociguat. PDE5 inhibitors, including sildenafil citrate, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.

### Pharmacology and drug interaction effects of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors: focus on α-blocker interactions [^113Q9QyU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Currently, 3 phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor agents are available worldwide for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED): sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil. Each of these agents is effective across a broad range of etiologies, including vasculogenic ED in men. Because PDE5 enzyme is found within the vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of systemic arteries and veins, PDE5 inhibitors are mild vasodilators associated with small (and in general, clinically insignificant) decreases in blood pressure. However, because of the synergistic decrease in blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) in the presence of organic nitrates, these 3 agents are contraindicated in patients receiving organic nitrates. The duration of interaction between a PDE5 inhibitor and nitrate administration depends on the specific drug being studied. The interaction between sildenafil or vardenafil and nitroglycerin is no longer observed by 24 hours. A preliminary study with sildenafil and sublingual nitroglycerin suggested the interaction is no longer observable by 4 hours. The interaction between tadalafil and nitroglycerin has dissipated by 48 hours after tadalafil administration. This is consistent with the longer elimination half-life of the drug. When PDE5 inhibitors are administered to patients with hypertension who are taking most antihypertensive agents (eg, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics), there are usually small additive decreases in blood pressure without a significant increase of adverse events. Some patients develop orthostatic hypotension when PDE5 inhibitors are used in conjunction with an alpha-blocker (typically for hypertension or for urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy). Precautions are necessary for all 3 of the PDE5 inhibitors regarding this potential interaction. Some studies suggest that the interaction is less relevant clinically if the patient has been undergoing long-term alpha-blocker therapy. Several analyses have suggested that PDE5 inhibitors do not increase myocardial infarction rates or death rates compared with placebo controls or expected rates from age-matched populations. In contrast, recent studies have shown that PDE5 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for a host of cardiovascular diseases. In general, these agents, when used appropriately, are highly safe and effective.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Ergotamine: increased bioavailability of ergotamine. Avoid concomitant use. (7.2)

7.1	PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators

NITROSTAT is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates.

NITROSTAT is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.

The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion.

7.2	Ergotamine

Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible.

### Sildenafil citrate: a therapeutic update [^117QZbxF]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998, sildenafil citrate has been used by millions of men for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our understanding of its efficacy, safety, contraindications, and drug interactions.

Objective

This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of sildenafil, its adverse effects and drug interactions, and socioeconomic factors involved in its use, with a focus on specific patient populations (prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, spinal cord injuries, neurologic disorders).

Methods

Clinical studies, case reports, and commentaries and editorials concerning sildenafil published in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, using the terms sildenafil, Viagra, and erectile dysfunction.

Results

Sildenafil has demonstrated effectiveness in men with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy, radiation therapy, diabetes mellitus, certain neurologic disorders, and drug therapy (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). It has not been as effective in women with sexual dysfunction, with the exception of SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction. Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction (eg, esophageal motility dysfunction) may also respond to sildenafil. In the general population, sildenafil is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile; however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking nitrate therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with sildenafil therapy. In addition, patients taking drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme, which metabolizes sildenafil, may experience increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of sildenafil.

Conclusions

Sildenafil is an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in men. The decision to prescribe this agent should include such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance, patient access, drug distribution pathways, and prescription drug coverage.

5.6 Adverse Reactions with the Concomitant Use of Ritonavir

The concomitant administration of the protease inhibitor ritonavir substantially increases serum concentrations of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). If sildenafil citrate is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of sildenafil are limited. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of sildenafil (200 to 800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse reactions in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in sildenafil dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.7 Combination with other PDE5 Inhibitors or Other Erectile Dysfunction Therapies

The safety and efficacy of combinations of sildenafil tablets, 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg with other PDE5 Inhibitors, including sildenafil tablets, 20 mg or other pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatments containing sildenafil, or other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Such combinations may further lower blood pressure. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.

5.8 Effects on Bleeding

There have been postmarketing reports of bleeding events in patients who have taken sildenafil citrate. A causal relationship between sildenafil citrate and these events has not been established. In humans, sildenafil citrate has no effect on bleeding time when taken alone or with aspirin. However, in vitro studies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor). In addition, the combination of heparin and sildenafil citrate had an additive effect on bleeding time in the anesthetized rabbit, but this interaction has not been studied in humans.

The safety of sildenafil citrate is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.

5.9 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases

The use of sildenafil citrate offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), may be considered.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of VIAGRA with regular and/or intermittent use of nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of VIAGRA with use of guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat [see Contraindications (4.3)].

Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should advise patients of the potential for VIAGRA to augment the blood pressure lowering effect of alpha-blockers and anti-hypertensive medications. Concomitant administration of VIAGRA and an alpha-blocker may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some patients. Therefore, when VIAGRA is co-administered with alpha-blockers, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating VIAGRA treatment and VIAGRA should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Patients who experience symptoms (e.g., angina pectoris, dizziness, nausea) upon initiation of sexual activity should be advised to refrain from further activity and should discuss the episode with their physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Novel phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: assessing hemodynamic effects and safety parameters [^1138h5D7]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The relaxing effect of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors on vascular smooth muscle has attracted much attention, especially in persons with cardiovascular disease. The results of early studies showed that sildenafil slightly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressures and has no effect on heart rate, while being safe and well tolerated. Studies also indicate that sildenafil does not contribute to the development of myocardial infarction or ischemia. Similar benign effects on hemodynamics and cardiac events have also been demonstrated for tadalafil and vardenafil. None of the PDE5 inhibitors adversely affects total exercise time or time to ischemia during exercise testing in men with stable angina. It is key to avoid concomitant administration of nitrates with any of the PDE5 inhibitors, because this combination can cause increased vasodilation and a subsequent drop in blood pressure. Sildenafil has an alpha-blocker precaution; tadalafil is contraindicated with alpha blockers except for 0.4 mg tamsulosin; vardenafil is contraindicated with alpha blockers.

### Drug-drug interactions in the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^117KMpsY]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

The NO Pathway: PDE5 Inhibitors and Riociguat

Endothelial NO induces vasodilation in vascular smooth muscle cells and inhibits platelet aggregation through the activation of sGC and the subsequent increase in production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The production of endothelial NO is reduced chronically in patients with PAH. Therapeutic agents that act on the NO pathway increase intracellular cGMP concentrations ultimately targeting vasodilation of the pulmonary vasculature and PAH symptoms. PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP in pulmonary smooth muscle and also is involved in platelet aggregation.PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil and tadalafil, prevent the breakdown of cGMP and demonstrate antiplatelet activity. Riociguat, a guanylate cyclase stimulator, sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO and directly stimulates sGC receptors, leading to an increase in cGMP.

Considering these mechanisms of action, concomitant use of NO agents with medications that have hypotensive or antiplatelet effects may have compounding additive adverse effects (Table 3). Studies have shown that PDE5 inhibitors generally are safe with most antihypertensives and vasodilating medications, apart from nitrates and some α-adrenergic blockers. Organic nitrates such as nitroglycerin, amyl nitrate, and isosorbide mononitrate are associated with significant risk of life-threatening hypotension when combined with a PDE5 inhibitor or guanylate cyclase stimulator, and therefore are contraindicated. If use of an organic nitrate is mandatory, at least 24 h of separation must elapse between the last dose of sildenafil, and at least 48 h must elapse after the last dose of tadalafil. Given the ubiquitous use of nitrates and the potential for patients with PAH to demonstrate chest pain, it is important to counsel all patients taking sildenafil, tadalafil, or riociguat to warn providers in emergency medical services to avoid nitrates. Nonuroselective α-adrenergic blockers such as doxazosin have demonstrated significant hypotension when used with sildenafil, with decreases in BP of up to 15 mm Hg systolic and 22 mm Hg diastolic. Close monitoring of patients receiving α-adrenergic blockers with NO agents is recommended.

Effects of Avanafil on Blood Pressure When Administered with Nitrates

In a clinical pharmacology trial, a single dose of avanafil 200 mg was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. The use of avanafil in patients taking any form of nitrates is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)].

A trial was conducted to assess the degree of interaction between nitroglycerin and avanafil, should nitroglycerin be required in an emergency situation after avanafil was taken. This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, 3-way crossover trial of healthy males from 30 to 60 years of age. Subjects were divided among 5 trial groups with the trial group being determined by the time interval between treatment with trial drug and glyceryl trinitrate administration. Subjects were assigned to trial groups sequentially and hemodynamic results from the previous group were reviewed for serious adverse events (SAEs) before the next group received treatment. Each subject was dosed with all 3 study drugs (avanafil 200 mg, sildenafil citrate 100 mg, and placebo) in random order. Subjects were administered a single dose of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG) at pre-specified time points, following their dose of trial drug (0.5, 1, 4, 8 or 12 hours). Overall, 14 (15%) subjects treated with placebo and 28 (28%) subjects treated with avanafil, had clinically significant decreases in standing SBP, defined as greater than or equal to 30 mmHg decrease in SBP, after glyceryl trinitrate administration. Mean maximum decreases are shown in Table 5.

### Is the sildenafil product information adequate to facilitate informed therapeutic decisions? [^1134nrw6]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal therapeutics and the prevention of adverse drug effects begin with complete information. When new drugs are released, the manufacturer's product information is the main and often only readily available source of drug information and, therefore, greatly influences treatment strategies. Thus, it is vital that the information in the package insert is not only complete, but also as relevant as possible for the great diversity of patients that physicians encounter.

Objective

To review the product information for sildenafil for comprehensiveness and accuracy, with respect to whether the information is sufficient to facilitate optimal therapeutics and to prevent avoidable adverse events in the wide diversity of patients with erectile dysfunction seen in clinical practice.

Data Sources

Sildenafil package inserts, unpublished information provided by the manufacturer, Food and Drug Administration reports, and articles retrieved through MEDLINE through March 2000.

Data Synthesis

Deficiencies or inaccuracies persist in the sildenafil product information regarding sildenafil's effects on blood pressure; potential drug interactions with cimetidine, protease inhibitors, some antihypertensive drugs, alcohol, and drugs that may competitively inhibit cytochrome P450 pathways; and recommended sildenafil doses for older patients.

Conclusions

For physicians to practice optimal therapeutics, adequate, clinically relevant drug information is required. Several brief changes and additions in the sildenafil product information would assist physicians in making therapeutic decisions regarding the use of sildenafil in a very diverse patient population and in avoiding preventable adverse events.

### Erectile dysfunction and heart failure: the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [^114SnHHc]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Safety of PDE-5 inhibitors in HF patients

Common adverse effects of PDE-5 inhibitors are generally related to either the vasodilatory (for example, headache or flushing) or gastrointestinal (for example, dyspepsia or reflux) effects. Less commonly described adverse affects are visual complaints (for example, blue-green color tinge or blurry vision) or myalgias. 32 Nitrates are contraindicated during PDE-5 inhibitor use due to hypotension. As sildenafil and vardenafil have approximately 4 h half-lives, nitrates should be avoided for at least 24 h. 33 Tadalafil has a half-life of 17.5 h that prolongs the risk of severe hypotension with concomitant use of nitrates. Kloner et al. 34 demonstrated that nitrates should be avoided for 48 h after tadalafil use. If a patient should develop hypotension secondary to concomitant use of nitrates and PDE-5 inhibitors, then treatment recommended by the American College of Cardiology consensus statement should include placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position, fluid administration and possible further blood pressure support with α- and β-adrenergic agonists or an intraaortic balloon pump. 26, 32

Patients with HF are not exempt from the above adverse effects of PDE-5 inhibitors. However, does the impaired left ventricular function put HF patients at increased risk for adverse effects with PDE-5 inhibitors? Katz et al. 29 evaluated the safety of flexible dosing of sildenafil in 137 HF patients for 12 weeks. Among them, 60% of the treatment group and 48% of the placebo group developed adverse events; only 3 and 5%, respectively, were serious adverse events. Only two patients from each group discontinued treatment secondary to the adverse event. In a study by Webster et al. 30 there were no reports of any adverse effects among 35 HF patients receiving sildenafil treatment over a 6-week period. In a study by Freitas et al. 31 only 1 of 12 HF patients complained of mild headache and visual change associated with sildenafil treatment over a 4-week period. These studies demonstrated that it was safe to treat stable HF patients with sildenafil for their ED, and that their reduced left ventricular function did not put them at increased risk for adverse effects. However, it is important to note that these patients did not have HF secondary to aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Vasodilating medications, including the PDE-5 inhibitors, are generally avoided in patients with aortic stenosis or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy because of a possible increase in outflow gradient and hypotension.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116e3MF3]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction medications — phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in HF: Prevalence of erectile dysfunction is high and nitrate interactions are contraindicated. At least 75% of men with HF reported erectile dysfunction, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil are selective cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and these agents may increase the hypotensive effects of nitrates and are contraindicated with concomitant nitrates; similar caution applies with other phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone.

### Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^112ons39]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.6 Adverse Reactions with the Concomitant Use of Ritonavir

The concomitant administration of the protease inhibitor ritonavir substantially increases serum concentrations of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). If VIAGRA is prescribed to patients taking ritonavir, caution should be used. Data from subjects exposed to high systemic levels of sildenafil are limited. Decreased blood pressure, syncope, and prolonged erection were reported in some healthy volunteers exposed to high doses of sildenafil (200–800 mg). To decrease the chance of adverse reactions in patients taking ritonavir, a decrease in sildenafil dosage is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Drug Interactions (7.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.7 Combination with Other PDE5 Inhibitors or Other Erectile Dysfunction Therapies

The safety and efficacy of combinations of VIAGRA with other PDE5 Inhibitors, including REVATIO or other pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatments containing sildenafil, or other treatments for erectile dysfunction have not been studied. Such combinations may further lower blood pressure. Therefore, the use of such combinations is not recommended.

5.8 Effects on Bleeding

There have been postmarketing reports of bleeding events in patients who have taken VIAGRA. A causal relationship between VIAGRA and these events has not been established. In humans, VIAGRA has no effect on bleeding time when taken alone or with aspirin. However, in vitro studies with human platelets indicate that sildenafil potentiates the antiaggregatory effect of sodium nitroprusside (a nitric oxide donor). In addition, the combination of heparin and VIAGRA had an additive effect on bleeding time in the anesthetized rabbit, but this interaction has not been studied in humans.

The safety of VIAGRA is unknown in patients with bleeding disorders and patients with active peptic ulceration.

5.9 Counseling Patients About Sexually Transmitted Diseases

The use of VIAGRA offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases, including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), may be considered.

### Time course of the interaction between tadalafil and nitrates [^115u4K6Q]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine the time course of nitrate interaction with tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor with a half-life (t₁/₂) of 17.5 h.

Background

The PDE5 inhibitors augment the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of nitrates, yet the time course of this interaction is unclear. Recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend that nitrates be withheld for 24 h after taking sildenafil (t₁/₂ = 4 h).

Methods

Male subjects (n = 150) received seven consecutive daily doses of placebo or tadalafil (20 mg). On day 7 and beyond, subjects received repeated doses of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) after the last dose of placebo or tadalafil. After a 10- to 21-day washout period, subjects crossed over to either placebo or tadalafil, and nitrate dosing was repeated.

Results

In response to nitroglycerin at 4, 8, and 24 h, standing systolic BP fell below 85 mm Hg in more subjects on tadalafil compared with placebo (p < 0.05), with no difference in the response to nitroglycerin at 48, 72, and 96 h (p > 0.2). Similar observations were made for standing diastolic BP < 45 mm Hg, decrease in systolic BP > 30 mm Hg, and decrease in diastolic BP > 20 mm Hg. Nitroglycerin also evoked greater mean maximal decreases in standing systolic BP at 8 and 24 h after taking tadalafil versus placebo (p < 0.02), with no significant difference at 48, 72, or 96 h (p > 0.49).

Conclusions

The hemodynamic interaction between tadalafil and sublingual nitroglycerin lasted 24 h, but was not seen at 48 h and beyond. Similar to other PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil should not be administered in combination with organic nitrates.

### Cardiovascular effects of tadalafil [^1128TgoN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

To determine the effects of tadalafil on the cardiovascular system, safety assessments were performed on a database of > 4000 subjects who received tadalafil in > 60 clinical pharmacology, phase 2, phase 3, and open-label studies. In healthy subjects, tadalafil resulted in small changes in blood pressure, which are not believed to be clinically relevant. Daily administration of tadalafil 20 mg for 26 weeks in healthy male subjects or patients with mild erectile dysfunction resulted in blood pressure changes similar to those observed after placebo administration. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), tadalafil administration before nitrate administration resulted in small decreases in blood pressure. The resulting mean maximal change in standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) after coadministration of sublingual nitroglycerin in patients with chronic stable angina was -36 mm Hg for tadalafil 5 mg, -31 mm Hg for tadalafil 10 mg, and -28 mm Hg for placebo. In addition, a larger number of men had a standing SBP < 85 mm Hg after coadministration of sublingual nitroglycerin and tadalafil 5 mg (p < 0.001 vs placebo) or tadalafil 10 mg (p < 0.01 vs placebo) compared with coadministration with placebo. In patients with chronic stable angina taking doses of isosorbide mononitrate on a long-term basis, the mean maximal change in standing SBP was -23 mm Hg for placebo, -23 mm Hg for tadalafil 5 mg, and -26 mm Hg for tadalafil 10 mg. In a study of older subjects (≥ 55 years of age) with no overt evidence of CAD, the resulting mean maximal change in standing SBP after coadministration of sublingual nitroglycerin was -25 mm Hg for tadalafil 10 mg, -29 mm Hg for sildenafil 50 mg, and -25 mm Hg for placebo. Cardiac mortality rates in tadalafil studies are consistent with the expected rate in this male population. Across all studies, the incidence rate of myocardial infarction was low in tadalafil-treated patients (0.43 per 100 patient-years) compared with patients who received placebo (0.6 per 100 patient-years), and the incidence rate was comparable to that observed in the age-standardized male population (0.60 per 100 patient-years). The incidence rate of presumed thrombotic strokes in tadalafil studies (0.27 per 100 patient-years) is comparable to the expected rate in this patient population. The data presented herein suggest that tadalafil can be safely used by healthy subjects and by patients with cardiovascular diseases. As with sildenafil, the use of tadalafil is contraindicated in patients receiving nitrate therapy because of the potential for significant hypotensive effects.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^115ezzeR]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure — phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (sildenafil) use is characterized by limited evidence in HF, potential hemodynamic benefits, short‑term tolerability, and a nitrate contraindication. Few patients with HF were enrolled in controlled trials with sildenafil, and thus, the efficacy and safety of this drug in patients with HF are not known, although patients with HF appear to tolerate short‑term administration of the drug without difficulty; however, sildenafil should not be given to patients taking nitrates, who may experience profound hypotension due to potentiation of vasodilator effects.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

Administration of VIAGRA to patients using nitric oxide donors, such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form. VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates (4.1, 7.1, 12.2)
Known hypersensitivity to sildenafil or any component of tablet (4.2)
Administration with guanylate cyclase (GC) stimulators, such as riociguat (4.3)

4.1 Nitrates

Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1, 12.2)], VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form either regularly and/or intermittently is therefore contraindicated.

After patients have taken VIAGRA, it is unknown when nitrates, if necessary, can be safely administered. Although plasma levels of sildenafil at 24 hours post dose are much lower than at peak concentration, it is unknown whether nitrates can be safely co-administered at this time point [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

4.2 Hypersensitivity Reactions

VIAGRA is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any component of the tablet. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including rash and urticaria [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

4.3 Concomitant Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Do not use VIAGRA in patients who are using a GC stimulator, such as riociguat. PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, may potentiate the hypotensive effects of GC stimulators.

Sildenafil is a drug used for male erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil's fatal cardiac effects except due to hypotension with simultaneous nitrate use have not been reported. We reported in this case a 70-year-old man admitted to the emergency service with chest pain, which occurs in an hour after sildenafil use. Electrocardiogram showed inferoposterior ST-segment elevation. In angiography, total circumflex artery occlusion has been seen.

### Cardiac safety in clinical trials of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors [^117GSwhc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Those safe and effective agents were originally developed for their cardiovascular effects and were incidentally found to enhance erections. Since the introduction of the first PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in 1998, there has been concern about the effects of these agents on the heart and their safety in patients with cardiovascular disease. The concerns focused on the effects on blood pressure and heart rate, cardiac electrophysiology, and cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials. Since there are currently three PDE5 inhibitors, attention has been given to class effects as well as unique individual safety and adverse events. Since these drugs are mild vasodilators, all three have blood pressure-lowering effects. These effects are usually mild and produce few symptoms. When combined with the nitric oxide donor nitroglycerine, however, blood pressure drops may be profound and life threatening. All three agents are contraindicated with nitrates. Cardiac electrophysiology effects, especially as manifested by changes in the QT interval, have been studied. None of the three agents are dangerously associated with QTc prolongation, although vardenafil has a warning for patients at risk for QTc prolongation. In evaluating cardiovascular adverse events in clinical trials, no signal to danger can be convincingly cited. Indeed, with the vasodilator effects of these drugs, many studies point to the improved exercise tolerance and coronary dilation in patients taking PDE5 inhibitors. PDE5 inhibitors are effective in treating ED, and their safety profile is excellent. There do not appear to be significant cardiovascular safety issues in the man with satisfactory cardiac and performance status.

2.1 Dosage Information

For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg taken, as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, VIAGRA may be taken anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day.

Based on effectiveness and toleration, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg.

2.2 Use with Food

VIAGRA may be taken with or without food.

2.3 Dosage Adjustments in Specific Situations

VIAGRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form is therefore contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

When VIAGRA is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating VIAGRA treatment and VIAGRA should be initiated at 25 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

2.4 Dosage Adjustments Due to Drug Interactions

Ritonavir

The recommended dose for ritonavir-treated patients is 25 mg prior to sexual activity and the recommended maximum dose is 25 mg within a 48 hour period because concomitant administration increased the blood levels of sildenafil by 11-fold [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Consider a starting dose of 25 mg in patients treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, or saquinavir) or erythromycin. Clinical data have shown that co-administration with saquinavir or erythromycin increased plasma levels of sildenafil by about 3 fold [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effect of sildenafil citrate on blood pressure and heart rate in men with erectile dysfunction taking concomitant antihypertensive medication. sildenafil study group [^117BKMQe]. Journal of Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the acute effect of sildenafil citrate on blood pressure and heart rate in men with erectile dysfunction taking concomitant antihypertensive medication.

Design

Post-hoc subanalysis of five, 12- or 24-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

Setting

Private-practice and academic urology clinics.

Patients

A total of 1685 men with erectile dysfunction of ≥ 6 months duration, of whom 667 (sildenafil n = 406, placebo n = 261) were taking antihypertensive medication (diuretic, beta-blocker, alpha-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and/or calcium antagonist). Of the patients taking antihypertensive medication, 608 (91%) completed the studies (374 of 406 receiving sildenafil, 234 of 261 receiving placebo).

Interventions

The last dose of oral sildenafil (25–200 mg) or placebo was taken at home on the morning of the final clinic visit. Patients taking antihypertensive medication maintained usual dosing schedules.

Main Outcome Measurements

Sitting systolic (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate at baseline and after dosing with sildenafil or placebo (end-of-treatment visit).

Results

Mean changes from baseline in SBP/DBP for men taking antihypertensive medication were -3.6/-1.9 mmHg for those receiving sildenafil and -0.8/-0.1 mmHg for those receiving placebo compared with -2.2/-2.0 mmHg and -0.1/0.4 mmHg, respectively, for men not taking antihypertensive medication. Mean changes from baseline in heart rate for men taking antihypertensive medication were -0.6 beats/min after sildenafil and 0.9 beats/min after placebo compared with 0.4 beats/min and -0.6 beats/min, respectively, for patients not taking antihypertensive medication. Differences in SBP, DBP, and heart rate between the patients taking and those not taking antihypertensive medication were small.

Conclusions

The acute, short-term effects of oral sildenafil on blood pressure and heart rate in men with erectile dysfunction were small and not likely to be clinically significant in those taking concomitant antihypertensive medication.

### Effect of sildenafil in patients with erectile dysfunction taking antihypertensive therapy. sildenafil study group [^111wwxHF]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Oral sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED), which is a common complaint for patients with hypertension and those taking antihypertensive agents. This post hoc subanalysis assessed the efficacy and safety of sildenafil in men with ED who were receiving concomitant antihypertensive medication. Efficacy was assessed in 3414 men (1218 of whom were taking antihypertensive medication) who received sildenafil (5 to 200 mg) or placebo for 6 weeks to 6 months in 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. The significant improvements in erectile function demonstrated by sildenafil-treated patients were comparable in patients taking and those not taking antihypertensive medication. Safety was assessed in 3975 men (1094 of whom were taking one or more antihypertensive agent, classified as a diuretic, beta-blocker, alpha1-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker), who received sildenafil or placebo in 18 double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. For patients taking sildenafil and antihypertensive medication, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events (34%) was similar to that for sildenafil-treated patients not taking any antihypertensive agent (38%). The incidences of the most common adverse events and of adverse events potentially related to blood pressure decreases (eg, hypotension, dizziness, and syncope) were similar in both sildenafil groups. The number of antihypertensive medications taken from among the five classes had no effect on the adverse event profile of sildenafil. Sildenafil is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for ED in patients taking concomitant antihypertensive medication, including those on multidrug regimens.

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5-I) — tadalafil for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is the most studied; an RCT and several uncontrolled studies showed improvement after daily use of 5 mg tadalafil. In a randomized trial, 140 young men (aged 45 or younger) with moderate to severe CP/CPPS and concomitant erectile dysfunction (ED) received either 5 mg daily tadalafil or placebo for 6 weeks; when compared to placebo, the tadalafil group was significantly better at 6 weeks for NIH-CPSI total, urinary, and QOL subscores, while post-treatment pain subscores did not differ significantly. Compared to baseline, 51% of the tadalafil group versus 5% of the placebo group reported ≥ 25% score reduction. Safety guidance states tadalafil should not be used concomitantly with nitrates; concomitant use of medications such as nonselective α-adrenergic antagonists and cytochrome P450 inhibitors should be assessed for possible drug interactions; and potential adverse events include back pain, dyspepsia, headache, and dizziness.

7.1 Nitrates

Administration of sildenafil citrate with nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form is contraindicated. Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway, sildenafil citrate was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2 Alpha-blockers

Use caution when co-administering alpha-blockers with sildenafil citrate because of potential additive blood pressure-lowering effects. When sildenafil citrate is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil citrate treatment and sildenafil citrate should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.3 Amlodipine

When sildenafil citrate 100 mg was co-administered with amlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.4 Ritonavir and other CYP3A4 inhibitors

Co-administration of ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, greatly increased the systemic exposure of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). It is therefore recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg of sildenafil citrate in a 48 hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Co-administration of erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in a 160% and 182% increases in sildenafil Cmaxand AUC, respectively. Co-administration of saquinavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, resulted in 140% and 210% increases in sildenafil Cmaxand AUC, respectively. Stronger CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole or itraconazole could be expected to have greater effects than seen with saquinavir. A starting dose of 25 mg of sildenafil citrate should be considered in patients taking erythromycin or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as saquinavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^116A5Cmr]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) safety and counseling — men taking nitrates regularly should not use PDE5i medications, and in men with mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment or men with spinal cord injury, PDE5i should be used with caution at least initially at lower doses; in men with severe renal or liver disease, use of PDE5i is generally not recommended. Given that incorrect use of PDE5i accounts for a large percentage of treatment failures, men should be carefully instructed in appropriate use, including that sexual stimulation is necessary and that more than one trial may be required, and initial doses may be titrated up or down until the optimal dose is identified.

7.1 Nitrates

Administration of sildenafil with nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form is contraindicated. Consistent with its known effects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway, sildenafil was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Contraindications (4.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.2 Alpha-blockers

Use caution when co-administering alpha-blockers with sildenafil because of potential additive blood pressure-lowering effects. When sildenafil is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.3 Amlodipine

When sildenafil 100 mg was co-administered with amlodipine (5 mg or 10 mg) to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

7.4 Ritonavir and other CYP3A4 inhibitors

Co-administration of ritonavir, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, greatly increased the systemic exposure of sildenafil (11-fold increase in AUC). It is therefore recommended not to exceed a maximum single dose of 25 mg of sildenafil in a 48 hour period [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) [^115nib9P]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Hearing Loss

Physicians should advise patients to stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and seek prompt medical attention in the event of sudden decrease or loss of hearing. These events, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness, have been reported in temporal association to the intake of PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to the use of PDE5 inhibitors or to other factors [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.5 Hypotension when Co-administered with Alpha-blockers or Anti-hypertensives

Alpha-blockers

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including VIAGRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may occur. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting).

Consideration should be given to the following:

Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors. Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor.
In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
In those patients already taking an optimized dose of a PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.
Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other anti-hypertensive drugs.

Anti-hypertensives

VIAGRA has systemic vasodilatory properties and may further lower blood pressure in patients taking anti-hypertensive medications.

In a separate drug interaction study, when amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg, and VIAGRA, 100 mg were orally administered concomitantly to hypertensive patients mean additional blood pressure reduction of 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic were noted [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Sildenafil and adjunct vasodilators in perioperative pulmonary hypertension (PH) may reduce rebound after iNO withdrawal and enhance pulmonary vasodilation; oral sildenafil attenuates rebound PH after iNO withdrawal and shortens the time to extubation and intensive care, dipyridamole has also been used to attenuate rebound, and intravenous or orally administered sildenafil with inhaled iloprost, PGI1, nitroglycerine, or milrinone and intravenous PGI1 may enhance iNO-induced pulmonary vasodilation; short-term effects of inhaled PGI2, milrinone, and nitroglycerin may be as effective as iNO at lowering PVRI with minimal systemic effects; in a placebo-controlled trial, intravenous sildenafil reduced PAP and shortened extubation and intensive care unit stay without adverse events in children after cardiac surgery, but intravenous sildenafil can cause systemic hypotension and reduce oxygenation; compared with iNO, intravascular sildenafil has a greater vasodilator response but increased intrapulmonary shunt in postoperative patients; longer pretreatment courses around surgery have shown advantages, including that a randomized study of sildenafil therapy for 1 week before and after surgery favored pretreatment, and longer pretreatment decreased mPAP, time on cardiopulmonary bypass, and duration of intensive care unit and hospital days.

### Cardiovascular effects of sildenafil during exercise in men with known or probable coronary artery disease: a randomized crossover trial [^112q5kX7]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

The relationship between sildenafil citrate use and reported adverse cardiovascular events in men with coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the cardiovascular effects of sildenafil during exercise in men with CAD.

Design, Setting, and Subjects

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial conducted March to October 2000 at a US ambulatory-care referral center among 105 men with a mean (SD) age of 66 (9) years who had erectile dysfunction and known or highly suspected CAD.

Interventions

All patients underwent 2 symptom-limited supine bicycle echocardiograms separated by an interval of 1 to 3 days after receiving a single dose of sildenafil (50 or 100 mg) or placebo 1 hour before each exercise test.

Main Outcome Measures

Hemodynamic effects of sildenafil during exercise (onset, extent, and severity of ischemia) assessed by exercise echocardiography.

Results

Mean (SD) resting ejection fraction was 56% (7%) (range, 39%-68%). After sildenafil use, resting systolic blood pressure was reduced from 135 (19) mm Hg to 128 (17) mm Hg, for a mean change of -7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI] -9 to -4 mm Hg; P < .001). After placebo use, the mean (SD) change was from 135 (20) mm Hg to 133 (19) mm Hg, a difference of -2 mm Hg (95% CI, -6 to 0.3 mm Hg; P = 0.08). The difference between mean change after sildenafil and placebo use was 4.3 (95% CI, 0.9–7.7; P = 0.01). Resting heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and wall motion score index (a measure of the extent and severity of wall motion abnormalities) did not change significantly in either group. Exercise capacity was similar with sildenafil use (mean [SD], 4.5 [1.0] metabolic equivalents) and placebo use (mean [SD], 4.6 [1.0] metabolic equivalents; mean difference, 0.07; 95% CI, -.06 to 0.19; P = 0.29). Exercise blood pressure and heart rate increments were similar. Dyspnea or angina developed in 69 patients who took sildenafil and 70 patients who took placebo (P = 0.89); exercise electrocardiography was positive in 12 patients (11%) who took sildenafil and 17 patients (16%) who took placebo (P = 0.09). Exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities developed in similar numbers of patients after sildenafil and placebo use (84 and 86 patients, respectively; P = 0.53). Wall motion score index at peak exercise was similar after sildenafil and placebo use (mean [SD], 1.4 [0.4] vs 1.4 [0.4]; mean difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03; P = 0.40).

Conclusion

In men with stable CAD, sildenafil had no effect on symptoms, exercise duration, or presence or extent of exercise-induced ischemia, as assessed by exercise echocardiography.

### An unusual adverse effect of sildenafil citrate: acute myocardial infarction in a nitrate-free patient [^113XPG9v]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Myocardial infarction (MI) associated with sildenafil citrate is seen rarely in patients without any history of coronary artery disease. We report a nitrate-free patient with a history of cardiovascular risk factors who developed acute MI after taking sildenafil. A 44-year-old man diagnosed with acute anterior ST segment elevation MI 120 min after self-administration of 150 mg sildenafil was admitted before attempting any sexual intercourse. The coronary angiography revealed 99% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and a bare-metal stent was implanted. He was discharged after 5 days without any complication. Sildenafil may cause coronary steal or may lead to vasodilation causing hypotension in patient with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, especially in patients on nitrate therapy. Our patient was nitrate free, with normal blood pressure values. Emotional stimulation associated with anticipated sexual activity may have been a triggering factor for vulnerable coronary plaque rupture.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

"See FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information)"

17.1 Nitrates

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of tadalafil tablets with regular and/or intermittent use of organic nitrates. Patients should be counseled that concomitant use of tadalafil tablets with nitrates could cause blood pressure to suddenly drop to an unsafe level, resulting in dizziness, syncope, or even heart attack or stroke.

Physicians should discuss with patients the appropriate action in the event that they experience anginal chest pain requiring nitroglycerin following intake of tadalafil tablets. In such a patient, who has taken tadalafil tablets, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary for a life-threatening situation, at least 48 hours should have elapsed after the last dose of tadalafil tablets before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should still only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring. Therefore, patients who experience anginal chest pain after taking tadalafil tablets should seek immediate medical attention [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

17.2 Guanylate Cyclase (GC) Stimulators

Physicians should discuss with patients the contraindication of tadalafil tablets with any use of a GC stimulator, such as riociguat, for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patients should be counseled that the concomitant use of tadalafil tablets with GC stimulators may cause blood pressure to drop to an unsafe level.

17.3 Cardiovascular Considerations

Physicians should consider the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Physicians should advise patients who experience symptoms upon initiation of sexual activity to refrain from further sexual activity and seek immediate medical attention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

17.4 Concomitant Use with Drugs Which Lower Blood Pressure

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for tadalafil tablets to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Acute myocardial infarction after sildenafil citrate ingestion [^116EtQyd]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of acute myocardial infarction (MI) associated with the use of oral sildenafil in a nitrate-free patient.

Case Summary

A 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with acute left-sided chest pain, nausea, and vomiting that started approximately 30 minutes after taking sildenafil 100 mg before a sexual contact. The patient was diagnosed with an acute anterior MI, and therapy with aspirin, metoprolol, and unfractionated heparin was initiated. Early coronary reperfusion treatment with primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed after initial evaluation. Balloon angioplasty followed by coronary stenting was performed successfully in the 80%-occluded left anterior descending artery. The patient was discharged one week after the coronary intervention without complication.

Discussion

Sildenafil-associated MI is rarely seen in patients without documented coronary artery disease. By inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5, sildenafil can cause an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels, which mediates the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum. Although sildenafil can cause a major decline in systemic arterial pressure in the existence of organic nitrates, physicians should be aware of its adverse cardiovascular effects even in nitrate-free patients. The Naranjo probability scale indicates that sildenafil was the possible cause of the MI.

Conclusions

Sildenafil may rarely be associated with MI in patients with no known cardiac history. Physicians should be aware of this rare and serious adverse reaction to sildenafil and counsel patients not to take sildenafil before undergoing a complete physical evaluation and further testing if warranted.

### Role of the cardiologist: clinical aspects of managing erectile dysfunction [^11324uLT]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is often a marker for serious underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cardiologists are increasingly involved in the care of men with ED. It is important to ask specifically about ED when evaluating men with CVD, since they may be embarrassed to volunteer this information. During the clinical workup, it is also important to check for contributing factors to ED such as diabetes, depression, stress, alcohol abuse, and cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be advised that many treatment options are available for ED, including the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. The PDE5 inhibitors are safe and effective in most patients with CVD, including those taking multiple antihypertensive drugs. Furthermore, they have no deleterious effect on exercise capacity, heart rate, or extent of exercise-induced ischemia. In the future, the PDE5 inhibitors may have a role in reducing pulmonary hypertension in persons with primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or congestive heart failure. The one major precaution for men taking PDE5 inhibitors is to avoid concomitant administration of therapeutic and recreational nitrate preparations. Patients with chest pain suggestive of a heart attack need to inform emergency room (ER) personnel if they are taking a PDE5 inhibitor. Similarly, before giving nitrates, ER personnel need to ask patients if they have used PDE5 inhibitors. Nitrates should not be given for at least 24 h after a patient uses sildenafil or vardenafil and at least 48 h after a patient uses tadalafil.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate IV (also known as Viagra):
- **Cardiovascular events**: use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia, resting hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, HF, unstable angina, or LV outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.
- **Exacerbation of hypotension**: use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe LV outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.
- **Hearing loss**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.
- **Increased serum sildenafil levels**: use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- **Priapism**: use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities, such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.
- **Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

### Vericiguat in combination with short-acting nitroglycerin in patients with chronic coronary syndromes: the randomized, phase Ib, VENICE study [^111zbsLn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Additive hemodynamic effects resulting in hypotension have been demonstrated with concurrent administration of riociguat (another sGC stimulator) with nitrates or NO donors, as well as with PDE5 or nonspecific PDE inhibitors, and, thus, their combined use is contraindicated. It is not currently known why the combination of vericiguat with short‐acting nitrates does not result in similar hypotensive effects to those observed with riociguat. Use of both short‐acting and long‐acting nitrates in combination with PDE5 inhibitors, α‐adrenergic blockers, and calcium channel blockers should be avoided due to drug–drug interactions.

Concentrations of vericiguat in plasma increased with up‐titration of the dose. Overall, the pharmacokinetics of vericiguat in this patient population were in line with prior knowledge for vericiguat, based on findings from phase IIb studies.

The present study suggests that vericiguat in combination with nitroglycerin may exert therapeutic effects without clinically relevant changes in BP and HR in patients with CCSs, and these data supported the use of short‐acting nitrates in the VICTORIA study. With regard to the effects of the combination in a broader, more severely ill population, the phase III VICTORIA study included patients up to 6 months post discharge and spanned a range of worsening HF to allow a more representative HF patient population to be analyzed. Short‐acting nitrates, such as sublingual nitroglycerin spray, were permitted as concomitant medications for symptom relief in VICTORIA.

The limitations of this study primarily relate to the small size of the study population. There were 31 patients who completed the study, with slight imbalances in some baseline characteristics noted between the groups. Both interpatient and intrapatient variability may have contributed to the overall differences. Although this study was small, the statistical design and analysis methods were optimized to address the hypothesis and the specific study population. To minimize bias, double‐blind follow‐up was performed, including assessment of TEAEs by the investigator under blinded conditions.

### General pharmacologic treatment of acute myocardial infarction [^112rzUMa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The general pharmacotherapeutic issues surrounding AMI are complex and expanding, especially with regard to treatment aimed at the [table: see text] culprit, coronary atherosclerotic thrombus. Basic, well-established therapy includes the routine administration of oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin, and at times morphine, with selected cases invoking caution with respect to these agents (e.g., nitroglycerin and the risk of hypotension in right ventricular infarction; contraindication to nitrolycerin in patients on sildenafil). Cardioprotective agents, especially beta-adrenergic antagonists, should be considered early in light of their demonstrated benefit; others, such as ACE inhibitors, need not be administered in the ED. Heparin, both UFH and the newer LMWHs, have well-established roles in acute coronary syndromes. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are the most recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium; their role is evolving rapidly as research on this frontier continues. Table 2 reviews recommended dosing of selected agents in acute coronary syndromes.

### Erectile dysfunction and heart failure: the role of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors [^115H6Bfi]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

The PDE-5 inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of ED; however their role in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases has yet to be determined. It is important that clinicians understand that ED is very common in the HF population, and therefore physicians should ask their patients about ED. PDE-5 inhibitors are safe and effective therapy for ED in patients with mild to moderate HF and who are at low cardiac risk. PDE-5 inhibitors should be used with caution in cases of intermediate risk, and should be avoided in patients with high risk or are concurrently being treated with nitrates. Sildenafil is effective in improving the quality of life, exercise tolerance and hemodynamics of HF patients, especially patients with pulmonary hypertension. However whether the other PDE-5 inhibitors have this same benefit remains to be determined. Studies have shown that it is safe to treat HF patients with sildenafil in a chronic setting; however whether PDE-5 inhibitors decrease mortality or major adverse cardiac events has not been established. The exact mechanism by which PDE-5 inhibitors improve HF is unknown but may be related to improved endothelial function, reduced preload, reduced afterload or some direct effect on the diseased myocardium. Studies have shown that sildenafil is effective in treating pulmonary hypertension, but sildenafil's effect on mortality in these patients also is unknown. Each of the PDE-5 inhibitors may affect the hemodynamics of pulmonary hypertension in a different manner.

### Sex and the patient with cardiovascular risk factors: focus on sildenafil [^112BdmrJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in men with cardiovascular disease. The introduction of sildenafil citrate, the first oral agent for the treatment of this disorder, has increased awareness about the risks of sexual activity in cardiac patients and raised concerns about the safety of sildenafil in patients being treated for coronary disease. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Sildenafil acts along the same general pathway as nitric oxide donors to increase cGMP levels and enhance erections. Sildenafil is a modest vasodilator that causes small decreases in systemic arterial pressure and mild preload and afterload reductions. It does not cause major decreases in blood pressure when administered with one or more standard antihypertensive agents. Because PDE5 is also present in small amounts in the systemic vasculature, sildenafil can cause a synergistic and major decrease in pressure when combined with organic nitrates. Use of organic nitrates is the only contraindication to sildenafil use. Data on sildenafil in patients with recent (less than 6 months) myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, stroke, and recent life-threatening arrhythmias are not available, so the drug should be used with caution in patients with unstable cardiac conditions. Placebo-controlled and open-label phase 2/3 trials including men with ischemic heart disease did not show an increase in MI or serious cardiovascular events in patients treated with sildenafil versus placebo. None of the serious cardiovascular events reported in these trials were considered treatment related by the investigators. There is a small but finite increased risk of developing ischemia or infarction with sexual activity. Therefore, before prescribing sildenafil or any current or future treatment for ED to patients with known cardiac disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, physicians should discuss the potential cardiac risk of sexual activity and perform a complete medical assessment, including an exercise stress test if appropriate.

Nitric oxide donors

Several studies have looked at the effects of the organic nitrates glyceryl trinitrate and isosorbide dinitrate in women with pre-eclampsia. These have demonstrated a reduction in maternal blood pressure, uterine artery pulsatility index and resistance index, and umbilical artery resistance index with no evidence of adverse effects on fetal heart rate. The studies have been small, however, with only three randomised trials, which were powered to look at short-term haemodynamic changes rather than outcome.–Furthermore, organic nitrates are associated with tolerance, requiring nitrate-free periods. An alternative NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), does not produce tolerance, reduces platelet aggregation, and increases the antioxidant glutathione. A phase I study in women with early-onset pre-eclampsia (21–33 weeks of gestation, n = 10), in which eight of the fetuses were classified as growth restricted, found that GSNO significantly reduced maternal blood pressure and uterine artery resistance index without affecting fetal Doppler measurements. Furthermore, a recent dose ranging study found that GSNO could reduce small vessel tone, platelet activation, and proteinuria at doses that did not significantly reduce maternal mean arterial pressure. Larger studies are now needed to determine whether NO donors can produce clinically meaningful differences in outcome.

Sildenafil citrate

The phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil produces its vasodilatatory effects by preventing the breakdown of NO. Initial evidence to support its use as a therapy for poor placentation came from in vitro myography studies; myometrial vessels from women with pre-eclampsia exhibited significantly less relaxation than healthy controls, but relaxation increased after exposure to sildenafil citrate. These findings were replicated in myometrial vessels from pregnancies affected by FGR in the absence of pre-eclampsia. Unfortunately, results from a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in women diagnosed with early-onset pre-eclampsia (24–34 weeks of gestation, n = 35) were disappointing. Sildenafil was well tolerated, with no increase in maternal or fetal adverse events, but it did not increase the interval to delivery, possibly because the pathological process was too advanced. In addition, a dose escalation design meant over half of the women received only the lowest dose of 20 mg three times a day (TDS). No difference was found in the vascular reactivity of myometrial vessels from women receiving sildenafil compared with placebo, possibly because of the interval between the last dose and delivery.

How to treat nocturnal (supine) hypertension in PD?

For the treatment of nocturnal (supine) hypertension in PD, experts recommend the use of a stepwise approach. Non-pharmacological preventive and behavioral measures should be sought for, including avoidance of the supine position during daytime, patient education with regard to the timing of anti-hypotensive medication intake in case of OH [e.g. avoidance of any pressor agent intake after 4 p.m.], reducing fluid intake in the evening, eating a small meal before bedtime, and sleeping in a 10°–20° head-up tilted position, or steeper if tolerated. If the concomitant OH requires pharmacological treatment, short-acting pressor agents (e.g. midodrine, droxidopa) should be preferred over long-acting ones (e.g. fludrocortisone).

Small-sized studies reported on the efficacy of bedtime administration of transdermal nitroglycerin (0.1–0.2 mg/h), losartan (25–100 mg), eplerenone (50 mg), sildenafil (25 mg), nebivolol (5 mg) and clonidine (100–150 µg) in improving nocturnal hypertension in individuals with primary autonomic failure, including PD. A bedtime administration of short-acting antihypertensive agents (e.g. losartan 25–100 mg, nitroglycerine 0.1–0.2 mg/h transdermal patch overnight, carefully dosed on the individual hemodynamic profile at 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring) can be, therefore, considered in the opinion of the authors of the current manuscript in case of severe nocturnal hypertension, bearing in mind the risk of worsening OH.

Cardiovascular — ACS/STEMI prehospital nitroglycerin dosing and precautions: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (SL), can repeat q (quaque, every) 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past 48 hours; examples include sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan®) or treprostinil (Remodulin®) which is used for pulmonary hypertension. Care should always be taken when giving nitroglycerin when the patient's blood pressure is marginal. If used in this setting, the clinician should weigh the risk and benefit of nitrate administration over the administration of an opiate analgesic and be ready to respond to hypotension with fluid bolus or pressor. The location of the infarct does not preclude the use of nitrates, and right-sided leads are of no additional value if an inferior STEMI has been diagnosed; such findings do not preclude the use of nitroglycerin and clinicians should continually monitor hemodynamic status and be prepared to resuscitate if hypotension occurs.

Safety

PDE5 inhibitors are safe drugs, and the main contraindications for their use is the concomitant use of nitrates and use in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. Although several cardiovascular safety issues have been raised since their clinical introduction, the results of recent clinical trials and clinical pharmacologic surveillance data have demonstrated no increase in myocardial infarction rates in patients taking these agents compared with the expected rates in age-matched populations. Furthermore, the results of numerous studies have proven not only the cardiovascular safety of PDE5 inhibitors, but even possible cardiovascular benefits.

One important safety issue is the co-administration of PDE5 inhibitors with α-adrenoceptor blockers in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. All PDE5 inhibitors appear to have some interaction with α-adrenoceptor blockers with respect to lowering blood pressure, but co-administration rarely results in clinically significant orthostatic hypotension.

Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) alerted health providers about a possible association between the use of PDE5 inhibitors and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in response to a small number (> 50 cases) of postmarketing reports of vision loss in men taking PDE5 inhibitors. Based on currently available data, it is recommended that patients with a history of mono-ocular NAION be cautioned that the administration of PDE5 inhibitors may increase the risk of NAION in the fellow eye. Patients who have risk factors for the development of NAION should be referred to an ophthalmologist before being prescribed PDE5 inhibitors. Furthermore, any man taking a PDE5 inhibitor who develops visual problems should stop taking the PDE5 inhibitor and be seen by an ophthalmologist.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate PO (also known as Viagra):
- **Cardiovascular events**: use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia, resting hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, HF, unstable angina, or LV outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.
- **Hearing loss**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.
- **Hypotension**: use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe LV outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.
- **Increased serum sildenafil levels**: use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Reduce starting dose to 25 mg daily.
- **Increased serum sildenafil levels**: use caution in patients taking ritonavir. Maximum dose of 25 mg every 48 hours for erectile dysfunction.
- **Priapism**: use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities, such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.
- **Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

6.2 Post-marketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sildenafil (marketed for both PAH and erectile dysfunction). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cardiovascular Events

In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events, including myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. Most, but not all, of these patients had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after use concurrent with sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.
