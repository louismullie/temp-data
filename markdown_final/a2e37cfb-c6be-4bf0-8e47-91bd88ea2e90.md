## Question

Diagnosis of IGE-mediated food allergy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step process for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing pretest probability with a detailed allergy-focused history. Then, I should verify which initial diagnostic tests are appropriate and how to interpret them. Next, I will examine when and how to use advanced tests like component-resolved diagnostics and basophil activation. After that, I need to consider when to perform oral food challenges and how to conduct them safely. Finally, I will review post-test probability and likelihood ratios, management implications, special populations, and common pitfalls to avoid, making sure each assertion is backed by guidelines and high-quality evidence where possible.

> Let me first confirm the cornerstone of diagnosis: a careful, allergy-focused clinical history is mandatory before any testing, because symptoms, timing, reproducibility, and cofactors drive the pretest probability and test selection. I need to ensure I capture immediate-onset reactions within about 2 hours, multisystem involvement, and prior tolerance or anaphylaxis, while documenting age of onset, family history, and comorbid atopy, and I should remember that indiscriminate testing without suggestive history leads to overdiagnosis and unnecessary avoidance, so testing is reserved for cases with a credible index of suspicion [^113Rg3fd] [^117RSuwD] [^114RdDHc] [^112F2tg3].

> Wait, let me verify the next step before ordering tests. If the history is highly suggestive of IgE-mediated food allergy and there is clear temporal correlation with objective symptoms, I can proceed to targeted IgE sensitization testing, but if the history is atypical, vague, or absent, I should pause and consider non–IgE-mediated disorders, intolerances, or nonimmune reactions in the differential, rather than reflexively ordering food-specific IgE or panels, to avoid false positives and mislabeling [^1116PBg3] [^111ifpG5] [^114KvjuH].

> Next, I should review first-line diagnostic tests. Skin prick testing and serum-specific IgE are appropriate initial evaluations to document sensitization, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these tests show high sensitivity and only modest specificity, so a positive result indicates sensitization, not clinical allergy, and a negative test has strong negative predictive value but does not absolutely exclude allergy in the face of a compelling history, especially for non–IgE-mediated phenotypes. I need to check local availability and patient-specific contraindications when choosing between SPT and sIgE, and I should avoid intradermal food testing because of poor specificity and safety concerns [^115Z4Kfp] [^116feNaB] [^1163kpv9] [^1112qFuu] [^113r5N3r].

> I should double-check the role of population-specific 95% positive predictive value cutoffs for some foods. Using sIgE or SPT thresholds with 95% PPV can, in select allergens like peanut, egg, or milk, reduce the need for oral food challenges when combined with a convincing history, but wait, I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize — cutoffs are population-, method-, and age-dependent, so results between cutoffs land in a diagnostic gray zone and often still require a challenge, and importantly, higher sIgE or larger wheal size increases the likelihood of allergy but does not predict reaction severity or threshold [^115KSXvr] [^113TsSHw] [^111Fb3FU].

> Let me consider advanced diagnostics when first-line tests are inconclusive. Component-resolved diagnostics to molecules such as Ara h 2 for peanut, Cor a 14 for hazelnut, and Ana o 3 for cashew can improve specificity and help distinguish primary allergy from cross-reactivity, particularly in pollen-sensitized patients, but I should confirm availability and interpret results alongside history and extract-based testing. Similarly, the basophil activation test has high specificity for peanut and sesame and may obviate some challenges, yet it remains limited by access, standardization, and cost, so I should reserve it for selected cases where standard testing is equivocal [^111cRYYu] [^111en5JM] [^116ZBUtq].

> Hold on, I should verify when an oral food challenge is indicated. OFC remains the gold standard to confirm or exclude IgE-mediated food allergy when history and sensitization tests are discordant or insufficiently predictive, and I need to ensure challenges are performed by experienced clinicians with graded dosing, continuous monitoring, and access to resuscitation equipment. Open challenges are acceptable in most clinical settings, whereas DBPCFC is preferred for research or when observer bias is a concern, and after a negative challenge, patients should continue the food regularly to consolidate tolerance and be observed for rare delayed reactions [^1142PTsc] [^111dCghu] [^111cRYYu] [^116WgiHq] [^113jRsij].

> I will now examine how to integrate results using likelihood ratios and post-test probability. Let me think about this carefully — pretest probability from the history multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the test yields post-test probability, and because history carries substantial diagnostic weight, a strong clinical story can outweigh borderline test results, whereas in low-pretest settings even a moderately positive test may leave the patient below a clinically actionable threshold. I should confirm that I communicate these probabilistic concepts clearly to families to align expectations and decisions about challenges [^111Fb3FU] [^115KSXvr] [^114jzxa6].

> Next, I should review management once the diagnosis is established. Strict avoidance of confirmed triggers, individualized emergency action plans with epinephrine autoinjectors, dietitian support for nutrition and label literacy, and education on recognizing and treating reactions are foundational, and I need to ensure periodic reassessment because many children outgrow milk, egg, soy, and wheat allergies. For persistent or high-risk allergies like peanut, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish, I should discuss evolving options such as oral immunotherapy and, where appropriate, biologics like omalizumab, while emphasizing that severity is unpredictable and epinephrine remains first-line for anaphylaxis [^1155ArkF] [^115Kc63x] [^117TbZmG] [^114RdDHc] [^113cLgE7] [^112hiqrp].

> But wait, what if the patient is an infant or has atopic dermatitis? I should confirm that infants may react at lower sIgE or SPT thresholds and that high total IgE from eczema can yield false positives, so I must anchor testing to a compatible history and avoid broad panels. In suspected non–IgE-mediated disorders, I need to check for delayed symptoms and consider elimination diets or other non–IgE pathways rather than relying on IgE-based tests, and in high-risk siblings, I should use pretest probability and, if needed, component testing judiciously rather than screening indiscriminately [^116YGHv9] [^1112qFuu] [^116MPXot] [^114jzxa6].

> I should double-check common pitfalls to avoid. Testing foods that are already tolerated, ordering large indiscriminate panels, using unvalidated tests such as IgG or hair analysis, and assuming that higher sIgE predicts severity all lead to overdiagnosis and harm. I need to ensure I counsel families that positive tests without symptoms reflect sensitization, not necessarily clinical allergy, and that negative tests do not absolutely exclude allergy when the history is compelling, prompting careful follow-up or challenge as indicated [^114KvjuH] [^115Fd5pa] [^115DePQC] [^116MPXot] [^115KSXvr].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Start with a meticulous allergy-focused history to set pretest probability, proceed to targeted SPT and/or sIgE if suspicion is meaningful, escalate to component diagnostics or BAT when results are equivocal or cross-reactivity is suspected, and use supervised OFC to arbitrate uncertainty. Throughout, I should communicate probabilistic reasoning, avoid overtesting, and plan longitudinal reassessment to capture the natural history of tolerance acquisition, aligning with contemporary guidelines and evidence [^113Rg3fd] [^111dCghu] [^113Y9fsA].

Diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy relies on a **history-first approach** [^113Rg3fd] with targeted testing, because history alone establishes pretest probability and guides test selection [^1179ybNF]. Skin prick testing (SPT) and serum-specific IgE (sIgE) are first-line to confirm sensitization [^115Z4Kfp] [^116feNaB], but **positive results indicate sensitization, not clinical allergy** [^115DePQC]; results must match the clinical history [^114fnygq]. Oral food challenge (OFC) is the **gold standard** [^1142PTsc] for confirming or excluding allergy when history and tests are inconclusive [^1142PTsc]. Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) and the basophil activation test (BAT) improve specificity for select allergens (e.g. peanut, hazelnut, cashew) [^111en5JM] and may reduce unnecessary OFCs [^115rqxwJ]. Avoid indiscriminate testing [^115ZoUom] and unvalidated methods (e.g. IgG, hair analysis) [^115Fd5pa] to prevent overdiagnosis and unnecessary restrictions [^111uLWYB].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A detailed, allergy-focused history is the **essential first step** [^113Rg3fd], establishing pretest probability and guiding testing [^1179ybNF]. Key elements include:

- **Timing**: Immediate reactions within 2 hours of ingestion [^117RSuwD] [^116WgiHq].
- **Symptoms**: Urticaria, angioedema, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, anaphylaxis [^113cLgE7] [^111uLWYB].
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent reactions on repeated exposures [^113rVHF6].
- **Risk factors**: Personal/family atopy, asthma, eczema [^117RSuwD].
- **Dietary history**: Foods suspected, amounts, preparation, cofactors (exercise, alcohol, NSAIDs) [^113rVHF6].

Physical examination identifies **atopy** (eczema, asthma, allergic rhinitis) that increases the likelihood of IgE-mediated allergy [^117RSuwD].

---

## First-line diagnostic tests

SPT and sIgE are **first-line** to confirm sensitization [^115Z4Kfp] [^116feNaB]; positive results indicate sensitization, not clinical allergy [^115DePQC], and must be interpreted in clinical context [^114fnygq].

| **Attribute** | **Skin prick test (spt)** | **Serum-specific ige (sige)** |
|-|-|-|
| Method | In vivo; wheal ≥ 3 mm is positive [^115KSXvr] | In vitro; ≥ 0.35 kU/L is positive [^113TsSHw] |
| Sensitivity | High (> 85%) [^112bpAVE] | High (> 85%) [^112bpAVE] |
| Specificity | Moderate (40–80%) [^112bpAVE] | Moderate (40–80%) [^112bpAVE] |
| Limitations | False positives with high total IgE; not diagnostic alone [^115DePQC] | False positives; not diagnostic alone [^115DePQC] |

---

## Oral food challenge (OFC)

OFC is the **gold standard** [^111cRYYu] for confirming or excluding IgE-mediated food allergy when history and tests are inconclusive [^1142PTsc]. Types include open, single-blind, and double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPCFC, reference standard) [^111dCghu]. Indications include an **unclear diagnosis** despite sensitization tests, evaluation of tolerance acquisition, and determination of reaction thresholds [^116WgiHq]. OFCs should be performed by experienced clinicians with emergency protocols and resuscitation equipment [^116WgiHq].

---

## Advanced diagnostic tests

Advanced tests improve specificity and may reduce unnecessary OFCs [^113Y9fsA]:

- **Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD)**: sIgE to allergen components (e.g. Ara h 2, Cor a 14, Ana o 3) improves specificity for peanut, hazelnut, and cashew [^111en5JM] and helps distinguish primary from secondary sensitization [^116MPXot].
- **Basophil activation test (BAT)**: High specificity for peanut and sesame [^111en5JM]; useful when SPT/sIgE are inconclusive [^116ZBUtq].
- **Epitope-based assays**: Emerging tools with higher specificity and prognostic potential [^112JdYP6].

---

## Tests not recommended

Avoid **unvalidated tests** that lack evidence or may cause harm:

- **IgG/IgG4 testing**: Not recommended for food allergy diagnosis [^116p9cYD].
- **Hair analysis, cytotoxic testing, applied kinesiology**: Unproven and not recommended [^115Fd5pa].
- **Large panel testing**: Increases false positives and overdiagnosis [^114yssnx].

---

## Diagnostic algorithm

A practical, evidence-based algorithm: **history and exam** to establish pretest probability; if high, perform targeted SPT/sIgE [^116n7b8a]; if results are concordant with history, diagnose IgE-mediated allergy; if uncertain or discordant, proceed to OFC [^1142PTsc]; consider CRD/BAT for select allergens to improve specificity [^111en5JM].

---

## Special considerations

Infants and young children may have **lower SPT/sIgE thresholds** and different predictive values [^116MPXot]; results should be interpreted with age-specific norms [^116YGHv9]. High total IgE (e.g. eczema) increases false-positive rates; interpret results cautiously [^116YGHv9]. Geographic and ethnic differences in allergen exposure and genetic background influence test performance and thresholds [^115o1Svw].

---

## Follow-up and reassessment

Regular follow-up is essential because **many children outgrow food allergies** [^111cRYYu]; periodic reassessment with repeat testing and OFCs enables safe reintroduction and expands the diet [^111cRYYu].

---

Diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy requires a **history-first approach** with targeted SPT/sIgE, and OFC as the gold standard when needed [^113Rg3fd]. CRD and BAT improve specificity for select allergens, while unvalidated tests should be avoided [^111en5JM] [^115Fd5pa].

### Novel biomarkers and diagnostic tools in food allergy [^113J56Mw]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

The double-blind placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC) has been the "gold standard" for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy for the past 50years. Despite tremendous strides in our understanding of basic mechanisms and clinical features of food allergy, we remain dependent on refinements of old technologies, i.e., skin tests and serum IgE measurements, to complement clinical history in making an accurate diagnosis of food allergies. However, recent technical advances in two effector cell assays, i.e., the basophil and mast cell activation tests, may soon bring these diagnostic biomarkers to the clinic. In addition, new advances in antibody assays, T-cell assays, transcriptomics, and metabolomics in conjunction with machine learning and artificial intelligence may soon enable us to diagnose food allergy and accurately monitor immunotherapeutic outcomes without the need for an oral food challenge.

### Road map for the clinical application of the basophil activation test in food allergy [^116ZBUtq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy based solely on the clinical history and the documentation of specific IgE to whole allergen extract or single allergens is often ambiguous, requiring oral food challenges (OFCs), with the attendant risk and inconvenience to the patient, to confirm the diagnosis of food allergy. This is a considerable proportion of patients assessed in allergy clinics. The basophil activation test (BAT) has emerged as having superior specificity and comparable sensitivity to diagnose food allergy, when compared with skin prick test and specific IgE. BAT, therefore, may reduce the number of OFC required for accurate diagnosis, particularly positive OFC. BAT can also be used to monitor resolution of food allergy and the clinical response to immunomodulatory treatments. Given the practicalities involved in the performance of BAT, we propose that it can be applied for selected cases where the history, skin prick test and/or specific IgE are not definitive for the diagnosis of food allergy. In the cases that the BAT is positive, food allergy is sufficiently confirmed without OFC; in the cases that BAT is negative or the patient has non-responder basophils, OFC may still be indicated. However, broad clinical application of BAT demands further standardization of the laboratory procedure and of the flow cytometry data analyses, as well as clinical validation of BAT as a diagnostic test for multiple target allergens and confirmation of its feasibility and cost-effectiveness in multiple settings.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^1113Zh75]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the burden of disease and the consequences of a diagnosis of peanut allergy, it is important that peanut allergy be accurately diagnosed so that an appropriate treatment plan can be developed. However, a test that indicates there is peanut sensitization present (eg, a "positive" test) is not always associated with clinical reactivity. This practice parameter addresses the diagnosis of IgE-mediated peanut allergy, both in children and adults, as pertaining to 3 fundamental questions, and based on the systematic reviews and meta-analyses, makes recommendations for the clinician who is evaluating a patient for peanut allergy. These questions relate to when diagnostic tests should be completed, which diagnostic tests to utilize, and the utility (or lack thereof) of diagnostic testing to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanut.

### Diagnosis and management of food allergy [^113R8ZNv]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is an immune-mediated disease and must be differentiated from other adverse effects related to food that are non-immune mediated. Symptoms of immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated allergy can range from mild to severe, and life-threatening anaphylaxis may occur. Current recommended strategies for diagnosis include the use of skin prick tests, allergen-specific serum IgE, and/or oral food challenges. Management entails allergen avoidance and appropriate treatment of allergic reactions should accidental ingestions occur. Treatment approaches under investigation include immunotherapy as well as biologics and novel vaccines. Attention has also recently focused on implementing strategies for prevention of food allergy.

### Peanut allergy diagnosis: a 2020 practice parameter update, systematic review, and GRADE analysis [^115uAhJb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Peanut allergy diagnosis — 2020 practice parameter update highlights that immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated peanut allergy has an estimated prevalence of between 0.2% and 4.5%, with U.S. prevalence appearing to have tripled in a recent 10-year period while the United Kingdom has plateaued; peanut allergy carries substantial economic and psychologic burden, is often severe and usually lifelong, and is a leading cause of food-related anaphylaxis. The parameter emphasizes that a test indicating peanut sensitization (eg, a "positive" test) is not always associated with clinical reactivity, and it makes recommendations — based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses — for clinicians evaluating children and adults, focusing on when diagnostic tests should be completed, which diagnostic tests to utilize, and the utility (or lack thereof) of diagnostic testing to predict the severity of a future allergic reaction to peanut.

Current testing guidelines for IgE-mediated food allergy

Determining the need for allergy testing and identifying the most accurate testing methods are critical in making relevant diagnoses, as well as limiting overtesting and overdiagnosis. Guidelines in the USA and Europe recommend specific IgE tests in patients with relevant medical history focusing on foods suspected of causing allergic reactions. Specific IgE test results alone are not considered diagnostic of IgE-mediated food allergy (ie, they indicate sensitisation and must be considered with clinical history). If clinical history and IgE tests are not highly predictive, an oral food challenge (OFC) is recommended. Characteristics of recommended food-specific IgE tests and OFCs are detailed in table 1.

### Diagnostic accuracy, risk assessment, and cost-effectiveness of component-resolved diagnostics for food allergy: a systematic review [^1179JeJP]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The high prevalence of food allergy is now an emerging global public health concern. 1 Estimates of the prevalence of food allergy vary, but overall lifetime prevalence has been estimated to be between 4% and 7% for children and between 3% and 6% for adults in economically developed countries. 2, 3 The quality of life of patients with food allergy is often severely affected, resulting in considerable morbidity and healthcare utilization, including risk of accidental exposure leading to life‐threatening anaphylactic reactions. 4

An accurate diagnosis of food allergy is essential to provide appropriate, potentially life‐saving advice on how to prevent and manage allergic reactions and prevent unnecessary dietary restrictions. 1, 4 The diagnosis of food allergy is dependent on a thorough clinical history as well as an objective marker of allergic sensitization and, in some cases, oral food challenge tests. 5 Current first‐line tests to assess allergen sensitization are skin prick tests (SPT) and/or immunoassays of serum food‐specific IgE (sIgE) levels. However, these approaches have a high rate of false‐positive results and are poor predictors of the severity of allergic reactions. 4 Thus, diagnostic confirmation with (ideally) a double‐blinded placebo‐controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is often required. 5 While DBPCFCs are considered the gold standard diagnostic tests, they are costly, technically challenging, time‐consuming, labor‐intensive, and are associated with important safety risks, as they can trigger anaphylactic reactions. 4

Given the limitations of conventional methods for diagnosing food allergy, new molecular‐based diagnostic techniques — collectively referred to as component‐resolved diagnostics (CRD) — have emerged as promising diagnostic tools. 6 While current approaches evaluate patients' reactivity to whole food extracts, CRD involves detecting sIgE levels to individual allergenic molecules or the epitopes of those allergens. 7 This approach may enhance determination of specific food allergy phenotypes, assist in the development of patient‐tailored risk profiles for specific food allergens, and improve detection of possible cases of cross‐reactivity between different allergenic molecules. 8

Over the last decade, researchers have compared CRD to conventional diagnostic approaches for food allergy. 9 Through this work, the major allergen components in different food allergies have been identified. However, the diagnostic accuracy of identified components varies across studies, and thus, the diagnostic value and clinical utility of CRD remains unclear. 9, 10 CRD approaches are also expensive, which raises questions about their cost‐effectiveness. 11

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^112bpAVE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Food allergy diagnostic testing — percutaneous skin tests (prick/puncture tests) and serum specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) — are described as highly sensitive (generally > 85%) but only modestly specific (approximately 40% to 80%), with utility best when suspicion is high; sensitivity of a positive test result is generally more than 0.7 and in most studies exceeds 0.85, whereas specificity is lower, generally in the range of 0.4 to 0.8; these characteristics mean a negative test result has high utility to rule out IgE-mediated reactions, panels of food allergy tests should not be performed without consideration of the history, and they generally should not be used for indiscriminate screening; the serum assay for specific IgE may be less sensitive than skin prick tests, although in many cases the sensitivity is similar.

### Advances in diagnosing peanut allergy [^116zS9bw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Peanut allergy is often severe, potentially fatal, usually persistent, and appears to have increased in prevalence. An accurate diagnosis is essential because there is a significant burden on quality of life. The tools available for diagnosis include the medical history, skin prick test (SPT), determination of serum peanut-specific IgE antibodies (PN-IgE), and medically supervised oral food challenges. Numerous studies, almost exclusively in children, have correlated clinical outcomes against SPTs and PN-IgE with informative results. The diagnostic utility of SPT and PN-IgE is maximized by considering the degree of positive result and consideration of the medical history (a priori estimation of risk). Emerging tests that evaluate IgE binding to specific proteins in peanut (component testing) add important additional diagnostic information in specific settings. Studies are increasingly focused on how the results of tests considered in combination (or performed serially) may increase diagnostic accuracy. Here, we review the utility of currently available tests and provide suggestions on how to best use them to accurately predict peanut allergy. Still, the physician-supervised oral food challenge remains the most definitive test available.

### Diagnosis of food allergy [^113hvNm9]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of food allergies has been on the increase over the last 2 decades. Diagnosing food allergies can be complicated, as there are multiple types that have distinct clinical and immunologic features. Food allergies are broadly classified into immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated, non-IgE-mediated, or mixed food allergic reactions. This review focuses on the clinical manifestations of the different categories of food allergies and the different tests available to guide the clinician toward an accurate diagnosis.

How should I approach evaluation in a sibling of a recently diagnosed patient with peanut allergy?

A 2-year-old boy presents with no history of allergic reaction but with an older sibling recently diagnosed with peanut allergy. Should testing be offered? Pretest probability for a sibling of a peanut-allergic patient to have peanut allergy was determined to be 5% on the basis of available data. If a test is ordered, Ara h2 would provide the highest specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 5.5 and 0.17, respectively. Based on pretest probability, pretest odds and likelihood ratio, post-test probability was between 0.8% and 25% (figure 1). This range indicates that the patient has a low likelihood of peanut allergy, which can be confirmed through an OFC.

Figure 1
Fagan nomograms incorporate multiple parameters to visualise the probability of an IgE-mediated food allergy. IgE, immunoglobulin E; LR, likelihood ratio; Neg, negative; Pos, positive; Prob, probability.

Improved practitioner education on identifying patients in need of testing for IgE-mediated food allergy, determining the correct tests to perform and knowing how to interpret testing results can improve patient safety and reduce the burden of overtesting.

Clinical bottom line

Testing for IgE-mediated food allergy should only be performed in patients with a medical history demonstrating possible allergic reaction.
Antigen-specific tests, such as SPT and sIgE tests, can establish the probability.
OFC is the gold standard for confirming diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy.

### Food allergy: a practice parameter update-2014 [^117RSuwD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

IgE-mediated food allergy diagnosis — Summary Statement 22: The clinician should obtain a detailed medical history and physical examination to aid in the diagnosis of food allergy. [Strength of recommendation: Strong; B Evidence] Because IgE-mediated food allergy most often presents with immediate symptoms (within 2 hours) after ingestion of the culprit food, certain historical features such as immediate onset of oropharyngeal symptoms or skin abnormalities after ingestion are informative, and a history consistent with anaphylaxis or immediate multisystem symptoms after food ingestion is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of IgE-mediated disease. The physical examination alone cannot be considered diagnostic of food allergy, and evidence of atopy, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis, might indicate an increased risk of IgE-mediated food allergy.

### Making the most of in Vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^113TsSHw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

In Vitro Tests for IgE-Mediated Food Allergy

Specific IgE to allergen extracts

Specific IgE (sIgE) testing has been used to diagnose FA for many years. Automated systems permit the use of enzymatic immunoassays for a large number of samples in a standardized way; however, levels determined with different methodology may not be comparable. IgE is quantified using kilounits per liter (kU/L) based on the World Health Organization Reference Standard with 1 unit equaling 2.42 ng of IgE.

Using the cutoff of 0.35 kU/L, sIgE testing has high sensitivity but poor specificity to diagnose FA. For example, in the case of peanut allergy (PA), sIgE to peanut has a sensitivity of 75% to 100% and a specificity of 17% to 63%. Adopting 95% positive predictive value (PPV) cutoffs, the specificity of IgE testing increases. Following on with the example of PA, the cutoff of 15 kU/L, showed a specificity of 96.8% and a sensitivity of only 28.4% in a UK study. This indicates that the 95% PPV cutoffs can be useful to confirm the diagnosis of FA, especially if there is a recent history of an immediate-type allergic reaction. On the contrary, the cutoff of 0.35 kU/L can be useful to exclude the diagnosis of FA as it has a high negative predictive value (NPV). Levels of sIgE between positive and negative cutoffs without a clear clinical history do not allow us to confirm or exclude the diagnosis, falling in the so-called immunological gray area. Positive and negative cutoffs can be helpful in guiding the clinical diagnosis of FA; however, they are not absolute and need to be interpreted in light of the clinical history, as patients can still be allergic or tolerant below and above 95% NPV and 95% PPV, respectively.PPV and NPV decision levels have been identified for sIgE to other foods (Table I).

Discussion

Health care professionals working in allergy centers or clinics and linked settings can use the steps we set out in this report to diagnose people suspected of food allergy. The pathway translates guidelines into practical steps and includes tips to help clinicians do the day-to-day work. If all centers used this approach, people across the world would have access to more harmonized and consistent diagnosis and follow-up care. We recognize that there are differences in access to tests and resources. However, specific IgE tests are easily accessible in most clinical laboratories and could be used and interpreted more consistently.

Researchers continue to work on gaps in existing knowledge, such as the following:

- The predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of the clinical history in different types of food allergies.
- The value of specific IgE to allergen peptides, mast cell activation test, IgG 4 /IgE ratios, and allergen/total IgE ratios.
- Which type of oral food challenge is most effective for each type of food allergy, including open versus double-blind tests.
- The interval between each dose in oral food challenges and whether this differs between foods or types of reactions.

Diagnosing food allergy is only the first part of the journey. It is essential that people diagnosed with food allergies receive support with long-term management. This includes an individualized management plan, emergency action plan, advice about avoiding or gradually reintroducing food triggers, referral to a dietician for support with nutrition, prescription of adrenaline self-administration devices, discussion of immunotherapy or other treatment options, psychosocial support, and information and support for family caregivers. Assessing the impact of food allergy on quality of life can be an important step in the diagnostic process, acknowledging the wider determinants of health. There are validated questionnaires available to help clinicians screen for the impact of food allergy on quality of life. This can also help identify patients who may benefit from counseling or other support. The physical consequences of food allergy can be acute and serious but may occur sporadically. However, the psychological impacts of food allergy are ongoing because people may be anxious about having a reaction. Therefore, once people receive a diagnosis it is essential to put support in place for the affected people and their caregivers.

Interpreting results of IgE-mediated food allergy diagnostics

Understanding and communicating differences between IgE-mediated food allergy and sensitisation to the food is crucial for accurate treatment, as 50–90% of declared allergies are not actual allergies. While studies have identified sIgE values with a PPV of 95% for an allergic reaction to use as cut-off decision points to reduce the need for OFCs for some antigens, cut-off decision points are derived from specific populations and need validation for each population, limiting clinical utility. Rather than using previously defined cut-off points, pretest probability based on a patient's history and likelihood ratio provided by diagnostic testing should be used together to develop a post-test probability. When using probabilities and likelihood ratios, clinical history is as informative as the specific confirmatory test results, because post-test probabilities account for clinical history as well as diagnostic outcomes. Medical history, SPTs and/or OFCs are still informative, as patients with high total sIgE levels that are also below a 95% PPV may still be at risk of allergic reactions. Additionally, associations between specific allergens, such as egg and peanut, have been identified that need confirmation via testing.

### Beyond skin testing: state of the art and new horizons in food allergy diagnostic testing [^111NH2vC]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Food allergy affects approximately 1% to 10.8% of the general population, and its prevalence seems to be increasing. An accurate diagnosis is particularly important because a misdiagnosis could lead to life-threatening reactions or to unnecessary restrictive diets. However, allergy tests currently used in clinical practice have limited accuracy, and an oral food challenge, considered as the gold standard, is often required to confirm or exclude a food allergy. This article reviews several promising novel approaches for the diagnosis of food allergy, such as new molecular diagnostic technologies and functional assays, along with their potential clinical applications.

After a negative challenge result, the patient should be advised to avoid the food for the rest of the day in case a rare, delayed reaction occurs. The patient/family should be advised to watch for signs of reactivity as the food is reintroduced into the diet in the days and weeks after the challenge and told to contact the clinic if there are delayed reactions or any reactivity.

After a positive challenge result, where the patient reacted to the food, the duration of observation depends on clinical judgment. Patients are often observed for 2 to 4 hours after symptoms end. Timing of observation after an anaphylactic reaction should follow usual local recommendations for anaphylaxis.

All patients should have an emergency treatment plan and medications available when they are discharged after a positive or inconclusive oral food challenge.

There is scope to standardize how the outcomes of diagnostic testing are reported to support using real-life data for ongoing research. For example, the Food Allergy Severity Score can be used when reporting the result of food challenges.

Step 4: Diagnosis

Who

Clinicians need to combine the results of the clinical history, tests for sensitization, and oral food challenges, when used, to form a diagnosis. This is usually done in a specialist allergy center or clinic.

How

Clinicians should contemplate differential diagnoses when considering a diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy (Table VI). When patients are diagnosed with food allergy, in most cases they should be advised about avoiding the food, carrying adrenaline (epinephrine), interpreting precautionary allergen labeling, and managing worry or anxiety. They should work with their clinician to develop an emergency treatment plan in the event of an accidental exposure or reaction. In some individual cases with mild reactions to high doses, ingesting products with precautionary allergen labels, small amounts of the allergenic food, or, for milk or egg allergy, even baked forms, may be introduced into the diet.

Table VI
Examples of differential diagnosis of food reactions and non–IgE-mediated food allergies

If patients are not diagnosed with food allergy, they should be advised to consume the food regularly (Table VII). A number of studies suggest that despite this type of advice, up to a third of patients do not introduce the food allergen at home, possibly as a result of food aversion and/or fear of reactions.

Importance of medical history

Guidelines agree that obtaining a medical history is the most important step in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy. Medical history will determine the pretest probability that the patient has an IgE-mediated reaction and will help ascertain whether testing is warranted by asking about symptoms, food of concern and other factors that may be involved, including exercise or medications. Physical examination can identify possible comorbidities (eg, atopic dermatitis) that would make IgE-mediated allergy more likely. Patients who have a history consistent with IgE-mediated food allergy are typically assessed further by skin prick test (SPT), measurement of serum antigen-specific IgE (sIgE) levels or both.

Conversely, patients with a history that is not suggestive of IgE-mediated food allergy should not undergo further testing, as these tests do not screen for intolerances or other immune reactions to foods. Unless history is suggestive, caution is necessary when testing food triggers that are not common allergens, as 95% of all reactions are caused by eight allergens, including soy, wheat, milk and egg (prevalent in younger children and often outgrown), as well as peanut, tree nuts, fish and crustacean shellfish (not commonly outgrown).

### Bringing the next generation of food allergy diagnostics into the clinic [^111QiRpd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Food allergy diagnosis has a massive impact on the lives of patients and their families. Despite recent developments with specific IgE to component allergens, a significant proportion of patients assessed for possible food allergy require oral food challenge to ensure an accurate diagnosis. More precise diagnostic methods are required to reduce the need for oral food challenges. Bead-based epitope assays and cellular tests, such as basophil activation and mast cell tests are the most novel and promising tests on the horizon. There is a pathway to pursue to enable their incorporation in clinical practice, including standardization, technical validation, clinical validation, external validation, overcoming practical and logistical issues, and regulatory approval. Valuable clinical application of these tests goes beyond diagnosis and includes risk assessment to identify allergic patients who are most sensitive and at risk for severe allergic reactions, and to define prognosis and assess clinical response to immunomodulatory treatments.

### Mast cell activation test in the diagnosis of allergic disease and anaphylaxis [^115aHwig]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

IgE-mediated food allergy is an increasing public health issue with a prevalence of 6% in children and up to 2% in adults. It is the most common cause of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening and rapidly progressing systemic allergic reaction that can lead to death caused by airway obstruction or cardiovascular collapse. The adverse effect of food allergy on the quality of life of children and their families is greater than that caused by diabetes and other chronic illnesses.

The gold standard test for diagnosis of food allergy is a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), in which increasing doses of food (or placebo) are administered under medical supervision. Open and unblinded oral food challenges are often performed as an alternative. However, oral food challenges are time-consuming, costly, and not without risk because of the potential for anaphylaxis or even death. In practice, IgE-mediated food allergy is usually diagnosed by using a surrogate marker, detection of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) to the implicated food (referred to as sensitization) either in serum or through skin prick tests (SPTs). However, sensitization frequently fails to correlate with clinical reactivity: a positive allergy test result (either SPTs or IgE measurement to the whole allergen extract) is not diagnostic in isolation. A false-positive rate of greater 50% has been reported in population-based studies, and consequently, overdiagnosis of food allergy is common. This results in unnecessary dietary exclusions, social restrictions, and anxiety, which can further impair nutrition and quality of life.

To date, attempts to develop more accurate tests to diagnose food allergy have focused on 2 strategies: component-resolved diagnosticsand the basophil activation test (BAT). Component-resolved diagnostics use purified native or recombinant allergens to detect sIgE to individual allergenic molecules rather than whole allergen extracts. Superior diagnostic accuracy has been demonstrated for peanut allergy, but data are limited and equivocal for other allergens.

In the BAT basophils from patients are incubated with allergen ex vivo, and surface expression of activation markers is measured by using flow cytometry. The BAT can improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with peanut allergybut is technically challenging and limited to a few specialist centers and lacks the accuracy and reproducibility of a food challenge. It has not been validated for other food allergens and needs to be evaluated further in terms of feasibility and cost-effectiveness outside specialist units.

### Food allergy [^1119hUKZ]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Food allergy encompasses a range of disorders that result from adverse immune responses to dietary antigens. This group of conditions includes acute, potentially fatal reactions, and a host of chronic diseases that mainly affect the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Tools for diagnosis and management have not changed much in the past two decades, and include the clinical history, physical examination, tests for specific IgE antibody to suspected foods, elimination diets, oral food challenges, and provision of medications such as epinephrine for emergency treatment. However, much research in the past few years has enhanced our understanding of the clinical, epidemiological, and immunological aspects of these disorders. In this review I will discuss these advances and incorporate them into an improved diagnostic and management scheme. Additionally, emergent diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies are reviewed.

Tests that are not recommended

As summarised in box 1, additional testing technologies are available; however, these are not widely recommended, as they lack specific allergen information, present unnecessary risks or require additional research for clinical use. Furthermore, large panel screens are not recommended, as they increase risk of false-positive results, unnecessary food restrictions and additional follow-up testing. Component-resolved diagnostic testing for the Ara h2 component is recommended for peanut allergy; however, US guidelines do not recommend component testing for other foods, and European guidelines only recommend component testing in addition to SPT or sIgE results if additional information is needed.

### Investigating the accuracy, risk impact, and cost-effectiveness of component-resolved diagnostic test for food allergy: a systematic review protocol [^113XUfXZ]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Food allergy — particularly immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy — is now a global public health problem. It results in considerable morbidity, healthcare utilisation, and impairment in quality of life. – Food allergy reactions range in severity from relatively mild features to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Estimates of the prevalence of food allergy vary, but overall lifetime prevalence has been estimated as affecting up to 7% of children and 6% of adults.

Careful avoidance of offending foods is the mainstay preventive strategy for food allergy. Accurate diagnosis is essential in order to provide appropriate, potentially life-saving advice on how to prevent and manage reactions. This will also help to prevent unwarranted dietary restrictions. The diagnosis of food allergy is typically based on a combination of clinical history and an objective marker of allergic sensitisation, namely, skin prick tests (SPT) and/or immunoassays of serum-specific IgE levels. While these approaches have reasonable sensitivity, they have sub-optimal specificity and are in general poorly predictive of the severity of reactions. Further diagnostic confirmation with a double-blinded placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) — the gold standard diagnostic test — is therefore often required. DBPCFC is however costly, technically challenging, time-consuming, labour-intensive, and associated with important safety risks as the procedure can trigger anaphylaxis. Nevertheless, although risky, DBPCFCs offer a reliable diagnosis, which in turn increases patients' quality of life.

### Making the most of in Vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^111oyqoQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In vitro allergy tests are useful in diagnosing IgE-mediated FA and support the decision of whether an OFC is necessary to reach an accurate diagnosis. Validated cutoffs are reliable when applied to a similar patient population to the one where they were developed. Patient-specific factors can modulate the probability of clinical allergy of a given sIgE result. IgE to allergen components can provide more precise information about IgE specificity. The BAT assesses the function of IgE in its ability to mediate allergen-induced effector cell activation. Further research is needed to improve our understanding about how the information of various tests can be combined for optimal diagnostic accuracy to reduce the need to perform OFCs to a minimum.

### Novel diagnostics in food allergy [^1169pBaR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is increasing in prevalence, posing significant challenges for individuals and their families and adversely affecting their quality of life. Misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary dietary and social limitations and increased food allergy risk, whereas failure to diagnose may result in life-threatening anaphylaxis. Therefore, a precise diagnosis is of the utmost importance; however, barriers exist at every stage of the diagnostic process. Diagnosis of food allergy relies on clinical history, IgE sensitization tests, and oral food challenge. Component testing and identification of optimal cutoffs have improved diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, many patients still require an oral food challenge, and better tests are needed to reduce this need. Novel ways of detecting biomarkers, such as the basophil activation test and peptide-specific IgE level, are transitioning into clinical practice. Future approaches may include the use of alternative biologic samples, novel laboratory technologies, and analytic tools (including artificial intelligence) to integrate test results and clinical information. Conscientious use of existing tests, access to tests with superior diagnostic accuracy, and combination of tests, can lead to improved precision of diagnosis of food allergy and timely introduction of tolerated foods into the diet. This review summarizes recent advances in novel approaches to food allergy diagnosis that can enhance clinical decision making both now and in the future.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^113r5N3r]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Food-specific IgE allergy evaluation — For IgE antibody–associated food allergies, percutaneous skin tests (prick/puncture) and serum assays are highly sensitive (generally > 85%) but only modestly specific (approximately 40% to 80%); they are well suited when suspicion is high, are not effective for indiscriminate screening, and therefore generally should not be used for that purpose. Intracutaneous (intradermal) skin tests for foods are potentially dangerous, are overly sensitive, increase the chance of a false-positive test result, and are not recommended. Based on studies in infants and children, increasingly higher concentrations of food specific IgE antibodies correlate with an increasing risk for a clinical reaction. A trial elimination diet may be helpful to determine if a disorder with frequent or chronic symptoms is responsive to dietary manipulation, and graded oral food challenge is a useful means to diagnose an adverse reaction to food. Additional diagnostic tests under investigation include atopy patch tests (APTs) and tests for IgE binding to specific epitopes, and rational selection and interpretation of tests require consideration of epidemiology and immunopathophysiology, estimation of prior probability, and understanding of test utility and limitations.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in food allergy [^113Y9fsA]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, the clinical history is key for an accurate diagnosis of food allergy. Allergy tests can support the diagnosis of food allergy and reduce the number of OFCs. SPT and sIgE have high sensitivity and CRD and BAT have high specificity. Combining tests can improve the accuracy of food allergy diagnosis, namely by using them in a sequential way, with CRD and BAT after detection of allergen-specific IgE with SPT or sIgE. In the cases of equivocal outcomes after combining tests or when not all of the tests are available, one needs to be prepared to conduct OFCs to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of food allergy.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^114fnygq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People suspected of food allergy require accurate diagnosis to help manage their condition and get appropriate care. Recent guidelines summarize the latest evidence about diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy, but they do not describe how to address practical issues when testing. There is a need to translate guideline recommendations into a practical common pathway that all centers dealing with food allergy can use.

Objective

The Global Network of Centres of Excellence for Anaphylaxis & Food Allergy-ANAcare developed a pathway to help clinicians apply the latest diagnostic guidelines and overcome implementation challenges.

Methods

The pathway is based on reviewing guidelines, research and clinical feedback, plus consensus of experts from 13 countries.

Results

We describe practical tips that clinicians can use when taking a detailed clinical history and testing people with suspected IgE-mediated food allergy. Tests for IgE sensitization such as skin prick tests and specific IgE are readily available and inexpensive. However, they only demonstrate sensitization, not clinical allergic disease, so they need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical history. A controlled oral food challenge may also be needed to identify which foods the person is experiencing reactions to and what quantity can be tolerated.

Conclusions

Correct diagnosis is essential to support individualized management. Allergy centers around the world can use our practical tips to help avoid under- and overdiagnosis.

### Systematic review and meta-analyses on the accuracy of diagnostic tests for IgE-mediated food allergy [^111en5JM]. Allergy (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is updating the Guidelines on Food Allergy Diagnosis. We aimed to undertake a systematic review of the literature with meta-analyses to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests for IgE-mediated food allergy. We searched three databases (Cochrane CENTRAL (Trials), MEDLINE (OVID) and Embase (OVID)) for diagnostic test accuracy studies published between 1 October 2012 and 30 June 2021 according to a previously published protocol (CRD42021259186). We independently screened abstracts, extracted data from full texts and assessed risk of bias with QUADRAS 2 tool in duplicate. Meta-analyses were undertaken for food-test combinations for which three or more studies were available. A total of 149 studies comprising 24,489 patients met the inclusion criteria and they were generally heterogeneous. 60.4% of studies were in children ≤ 12years of age, 54.3% were undertaken in Europe, ≥ 95% were conducted in a specialized paediatric or allergy clinical setting and all included oral food challenge in at least a percentage of enrolled patients, in 21.5% double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. Skin prick test (SPT) with fresh cow's milk and raw egg had high sensitivity (90% and 94%) for milk and cooked egg allergies. Specific IgE (sIgE) to individual components had high specificity: Ara h 2-sIgE had 92%, Cor a 14-sIgE 95%, Ana o 3-sIgE 94%, casein-sIgE 93%, ovomucoid-sIgE 92/91% for the diagnosis of peanut, hazelnut, cashew, cow's milk and raw/cooked egg allergies, respectively. The basophil activation test (BAT) was highly specific for the diagnosis of peanut (90%) and sesame (93%) allergies. In conclusion, SPT and specific IgE to extracts had high sensitivity whereas specific IgE to components and BAT had high specificity to support the diagnosis of individual food allergies.

Confirmatory testing with the OFC

If patient history is discordant with either the SPT or sIgE result, an OFC can confirm or definitively rule out allergy. During this procedure, patients are given escalating doses — or a single dose if risk is considered low — of the food in question and monitored for reactions under the direct supervision of an HCP. Although OFC is considered the gold standard for confirming an IgE-mediated food allergy, it is not mandatory if the patient has an unequivocal and convincing medical history of clinical reactivity and positive SPT or sIgE tests for a known allergen. If no symptoms are present during an OFC, after ensuring an age-appropriate portion of the allergenic food has been eaten, then IgE-mediated food allergy can be ruled out for that allergen. The allergen needs to be eaten frequently to ensure tolerance and confidence that it may be eaten in an unsupervised setting. If unequivocal, immediate-onset symptoms develop, then a food allergy diagnosis can be confirmed and the food should be avoided. As food allergies may be outgrown, an OFC may be performed regularly to evaluate development of oral tolerance.

### IgE-mediated food allergy [^113cLgE7]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Food allergies are defined as adverse immune responses to food proteins that result in typical clinical symptoms involving the dermatologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and/or neurologic systems. IgE-mediated food-allergic disease differs from non-IgE-mediated disease because the pathophysiology results from activation of the immune system, causing a T helper 2 response which results in IgE binding to F c ε receptors on effector cells like mast cells and basophils. The activation of these cells causes release of histamine and other preformed mediators, and rapid symptom onset, in contrast with non-IgE-mediated food allergy which is more delayed in onset. The diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy requires a history of classic clinical symptoms and evidence of food-specific IgE by either skin-prick or serum-specific IgE testing. Symptoms of IgE-mediated food allergies range from mild to severe. The severity of symptoms is not predicted by the level of specific IgE or skin test wheal size, but the likelihood of symptom onset is directly related. Diagnosis is excluded when a patient can ingest the suspected food without clinical symptoms and may require an in-office oral food challenge if testing for food-specific IgE by serum or skin testing is negative or low. Anaphylaxis is the most severe form of the clinical manifestation of IgE-mediated food allergy, and injectable epinephrine is the first-line treatment. Management of food allergies requires strict avoidance measures, counseling of the family about constant vigilance, and prompt treatment of allergic reactions with emergency medications. Guidelines have changed recently to include early introduction of peanuts at 4–6 months of life. Early introduction is recommended to prevent the development of peanut allergy. Future treatments for IgE-mediated food allergy evaluated in clinical trials include epicutaneous, sublingual, and oral immunotherapy.

### The diagnosis of food allergy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11623ew9]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated the accuracy of tests used to diagnose food allergy.

Methods

Skin prick tests (SPT), specific-IgE (sIgE), component-resolved diagnosis and the atopy patch test (APT) were compared with the reference standard of double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge. Seven databases were searched and international experts were contacted. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and used QUADAS-2 to assess risk of bias. Where possible, meta-analysis was undertaken.

Results

Twenty-four (2831 participants) studies were included. For cows' milk allergy, the pooled sensitivities were 53% (95% CI 33–72), 88% (95% CI 76–94), and 87% (95% CI 75–94), and specificities were 88% (95% CI 76–95), 68% (95% CI 56–77), and 48% (95% CI 36–59) for APT, SPT, and sIgE, respectively. For egg, pooled sensitivities were 92% (95% CI 80–97) and 93% (95% CI 82–98), and specificities were 58% (95% CI 49–67) and 49% (40–58%) for skin prick tests and specific-IgE. For wheat, pooled sensitivities were 73% (95% CI 56–85) and 83% (95% CI 69–92), and specificities were 73% (95% CI 48–89) and 43% (95% CI 20–69%) for SPT and sIgE. For soy, pooled sensitivities were 55% (95% CI 33–75) and 83% (95% CI 64–93), and specificities were 68% (95% CI 52–80) and 38% (95% CI 24–54) for SPT and sIgE. For peanut, pooled sensitivities were 95% (95% CI 88–98) and 96% (95% CI 92–98), and specificities were 61% (95% CI 47–74), and 59% (95% CI 45–72) for SPT and sIgE.

Conclusions

The evidence base is limited and weak and is therefore difficult to interpret. Overall, SPT and sIgE appear sensitive although not specific for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy.

### EAACI guidelines on the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^111cRYYu]. Allergy (2023). Medium credibility.

This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guideline provides recommendations for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Food allergy diagnosis starts with an allergy-focused clinical history followed by tests to determine IgE sensitization, such as serum allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) and skin prick test (SPT), and the basophil activation test (BAT), if available. Evidence for IgE sensitization should be sought for any suspected foods. The diagnosis of allergy to some foods, such as peanut and cashew nut, is well supported by SPT and serum sIgE, whereas there are less data and the performance of these tests is poorer for other foods, such as wheat and soya. The measurement of sIgE to allergen components such as Ara h 2 from peanut, Cor a 14 from hazelnut and Ana o 3 from cashew can be useful to further support the diagnosis, especially in pollen-sensitized individuals. BAT to peanut and sesame can be used additionally. The reference standard for food allergy diagnosis is the oral food challenge (OFC). OFC should be performed in equivocal cases. For practical reasons, open challenges are suitable in most cases. Reassessment of food allergic children with allergy tests and/or OFCs periodically over time will enable reintroduction of food into the diet in the case of spontaneous acquisition of oral tolerance.

### Pathogenesis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^112hiqrp]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Food allergy is a prevalent disease for which there is no current treatment beyond careful food avoidance. Accidental exposure to foods causes reactions in allergic individuals that can range in severity from mild skin reactions to severe and life-threatening anaphylaxis, and there are no validated tools to predict severity of reactions. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of food allergy is needed to develop prevention and treatment strategies for food allergy. In the last few years, there have been significant developments in the field of food allergy that have led to new ideas about food allergy prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This review will discuss these recent advances in the food allergy field as well as identify gaps in our knowledge about the immune mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to foods.

### Advances in IgE testing for diagnosis of allergic disease [^113dLZvh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery in 1967, IgE antibody detection in skin and blood has identified a state of allergic sensitization and served as a necessary but not sufficient risk factor that requires objective symptoms to make the definitive diagnosis of human allergic disease. More recently, quantitative IgE antibody levels in serum against allergenic extracts, molecules, and epitopes have pushed its application into more accurately identifying the specificity of the allergic response for targeting immunotherapy, predicting allergic symptom severity after allergen exposure, and attempting to distinguish tolerance from food allergy. This review examines new in vivo and in vitro developments in the design, performance, interference, and application of the methods used to identify allergic sensitization. The increasing accepted applications of molecular allergen and allergen epitope-based IgE antibody measurements, especially as applied to food allergy diagnosis and management, are highlighted as state-of-the-art advances. Despite these major advances in allergic sensitization documentation, their ultimate value requires integration by the clinician with the patient's history and pretest probability of disease.

### Making the most of in Vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^115o1Svw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Various in vitro tests assess different aspects of the underlying immune mechanism of IgE-mediated food allergy. Some can be used for diagnostic purposes; specific IgE to allergen extracts is widely available; specific IgE to allergen components is used in most specialist centers, and the basophil activation test is becoming increasingly used clinically. IgE to allergen peptides, T-cell assays, allergen-specific/total IgE ratios, and allergen-specific IgG4/IgE ratios are currently reserved for research. Different factors can modulate the likelihood of IgE-mediated food allergy of a given allergy test result, namely, the patients' age, ethnicity, previous allergic reaction to the identified food, concomitant atopic conditions, and geographical location, and need to be taken into account when interpreting the allergy test results in the clinic. The importance of the specific food, the clinical resources available, and patient preferences are additional aspects that need to be considered when deciding whether an oral food challenge is required to reach an accurate diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy.

Methods

In 2024–25, The Global Network of Centres of Excellence for Anaphylaxis & Food Allergy — ANAcare used a consensus approach to develop this guideline-based pathway with novel advice. We set up a working group with representatives from 8 industrialized countries. The working group reviewed guidelines, systematic reviews, and other published evidence. The group used personal communication, surveys, and input at conferences and meetings to gather feedback about good practice, gaps in knowledge, and challenges implementing guidelines. Allergy specialists and centers in 13 countries contributed.

The working group compiled the knowledge into a draft diagnostic pathway and incorporated feedback about the draft from allergy specialists, dieticians, immunologists, researchers, psychologists, primary care teams, and representatives from ANAcare and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology guidelines groups. We met to review the updated pathway and achieved consensus through discussion. There was consensus across contributors (> 90% agreement with each point), so there was no need for a further Delphi process or formal voting.

Key messages

- Correct diagnosis is essential to support individualized management for people suspected of food allergy. Allergy centers use different approaches, which may lead to inconsistent outcomes.
- The pathway described in this report helps centers overcome practical obstacles when testing.
- Clinicians should take a detailed clinical and dietary history, followed by tests to demonstrate IgE sensitization and oral food challenges if needed to identify trigger foods.

Box 2
Tests that are unvalidated or not yet recommended

Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy vary considerably between the tests and for different allergens. Access to tests differs by geographic location. Practical points to consider when deciding which tests could be useful include:

- All tests can be positive after someone has tolerated a food. Therefore, it is important not to test foods that the patient tolerates and routinely eats.
- In vivo skin prick test (SPT) and in vitro allergen-specific IgE in serum for food allergens should be the first tests used to assess IgE sensitization.
- SPTs are cheap and easy to perform. The cost of commercial extracts can limit their use in some regions. For some foods, SPTs with fresh, dried, or frozen food are more sensitive and specific than using commercial extracts, although this varies.
- Tests measuring specific IgE to individual allergens and components/proteins (component-resolved diagnostics [CRD]) can help to differentiate between primary and secondary food allergy but are not available in all allergy centers. Measurement of specific IgE to allergen components, such as Ara h 2 from peanut, Cor a 14 from hazelnut, and Ana o 3 from cashew, may help support a diagnosis, especially in pollen-sensitized people.
- Basophil activation tests can assess allergic responses and may be useful for peanut and sesame, but they are not available in all allergy centers and are more costly than CRD. Therefore, basophil activation tests should be reserved for special cases where SPT, allergen-specific IgE, and CRD are not sufficient.

In general, the likelihood of food allergy increases the larger the size of the SPT wheal and the higher the level of allergen-specific IgE (Fig 4). Negative results usually have a high specificity and high negative predictive value. However, no test is absolute. All results need to be considered in the context of the clinical history.

Fig 4
Likelihood of clinical food allergy based on combination of level of clinical history and test results.

Positive predictive cutoff values have been proposed for some allergens, but they are influenced by factors including geographic differences in prevalence, the population, and the test methods and extracts used. In infants, symptoms of IgE-mediated food allergy may be associated with lower levels of SPT reactivity compared to older children.

Step 3: Oral food challenge

### Optimizing the diagnosis of food allergy [^111YGfpw]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Accurately diagnosing a patient with a possible food allergy is important to avoid unnecessary dietary restrictions and prevent life-threatening reactions. Routine testing modalities have limited accuracy, and an oral food challenge is often required to make a definitive diagnosis. Given that they are labor intensive and risk inducing an allergic reaction, several alternative diagnostic modalities have been investigated. Testing for IgE antibodies to particular protein components in foods has shown promise to improve diagnostics and has entered clinical practice. Additional modalities show potential, including epitope binding, T-cell studies, and basophil activation.

Introduction

Adverse food reactions can be broadly classified into immune-mediated and non-immune-mediated reactions, with classical food allergy being immune mediated. Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy is an immune response occurring on exposure to a food protein. Symptoms can include urticaria, angioedema, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, acute rhinoconjunctivitis, wheezing, coughing, stridor, hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. Although prevalence data are generally complicated by self-reporting (which tends towards over-reporting), prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in children aged < 5 years is estimated to be ≤ 10% in Western countries. Over the past decade, most countries have reported increases in prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy, with no Western countries reporting a decrease.

Currently, the widely accepted process of diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy consists of an accurate and thorough history supported by confirmatory testing. These confirmatory tests can have poor specificity, present an increased risk of severe allergic reactions and can be time-intensive and resource-intensive procedures. Newer methods may be more accurate, but they also carry downsides, such as decreased sensitivity. Additionally, biomarkers that predict diagnosis, identify allergen thresholds, monitor disease severity/resolution and more accurately inform treatment decisions are lacking.

For healthcare providers (HCPs) to use tests appropriately and provide informed clinical guidance, increased awareness is needed around which patient to test for IgE-mediated food allergy, along with an understanding of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value of these tests. Overuse of IgE-mediated food allergy testing likely produces overdiagnosis, leading to unnecessary dietary restriction and psychosocial and economic burden. Here, we summarise approaches to diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, appropriate result interpretation and overtesting risks.

### How to interpret skin prick tests and serum-specific IgE in children and young people with food allergy [^113zEVZv]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is common, it can lead to significant morbidity andnegatively impacts on quality of life; therefore, it is vitally important we get the diagnosis right. However, making the diagnosis can be complex. Clinical history is the most important diagnostic tool and subsequent investigation may help confirm the diagnosis. The investigations available to most paediatric departments are skin prick testing and specific IgE so we will focus on these. Within this article we explore the evidence related to targeted testing and how to interpret these within the clinical context.

### Diagnosing and managing common food allergies: a systematic review [^113g2Tro]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

There is heightened interest in food allergies but no clear consensus exists regarding the prevalence or most effective diagnostic and management approaches to food allergies.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the available evidence on the prevalence, diagnosis, management, and prevention of food allergies.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Searches were limited to English-language articles indexed between January 1988 and September 2009.

Study Selection

Diagnostic tests were included if they had a prospective, defined study population, used food challenge as a criterion standard, and reported sufficient data to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for management and prevention outcomes were also used. For foods where anaphylaxis is common, cohort studies with a sample size of more than 100 participants were included.

Data Extraction

Two investigators independently reviewed all titles and abstracts to identify potentially relevant articles and resolved discrepancies by repeated review and discussion. Quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, the quality of diagnostic studies using the QUADAS criteria most relevant to food allergy, and the quality of RCTs using the Jadad criteria.

Data Synthesis

A total of 12,378 citations were identified and 72 citations were included. Food allergy affects more than 1% to 2% but less than 10% of the population. It is unclear if the prevalence of food allergies is increasing. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves comparing skin prick tests (area under the curve [AUC], 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81–0.93) and serum food-specific IgE (AUC, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.91) to food challenge showed no statistical superiority for either test. Elimination diets are the mainstay of therapy but have been rarely studied. Immunotherapy is promising but data are insufficient to recommend use. In high-risk infants, hydrolyzed formulas may prevent cow's milk allergy but standardized definitions of high risk and hydrolyzed formula do not exist.

Conclusion

The evidence for the prevalence and management of food allergy is greatly limited by a lack of uniformity for criteria for making a diagnosis.

### Unproven diagnostic tests for food allergy [^115Fd5pa]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The gold standard for diagnosis of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy remains the oral food challenge, with serum IgE testing and skin prick testing serving as acceptable alternatives. However, the increase in prevalence of food allergy (both physician diagnosed and patient suspected) has led patients to pursue a variety of other alternative diagnostic procedures for suspected food allergy, which are reviewed in this article. These procedures (IgG testing, electrodermal testing, cytotoxic testing, provocation/neutralization, and applied kinesiology) have largely been unproven and may lead to unnecessary elimination diets.

### Diagnosis of food allergy [^111ifpG5]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Food allergy diagnosis remains challenging. Most standard methods are unable to differentiate sensitization from clinical allergy. Recognizing food allergy is of utmost importance to prevent life-threatening reactions. On the other hand, faulty interpretation of tests leads to overdiagnosis and unnecessary food avoidances. Highly predictive models have been established for major food allergens based on skin prick testing and food-specific immunoglobulin E but are lacking for most other foods. Although many newer diagnostic techniques are improving the accuracy of food allergy diagnostics, an oral food challenge remains the only definitive method of confirming a food allergy.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^114yssnx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Why

If the clinical and dietary history suggests a potential food allergy, the next step is to test for IgE sensitization to the foods. The most common food allergy triggers in industrialized countries are cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish (crustaceans, mollusks), and sesame. Testing is meant to confirm the clinical history rather than being diagnostic alone.

Panel testing (testing a large variety of allergens) should be avoided to prevent overdiagnosis, especially in patients with eczema, who often have high levels of total IgE. Only foods suspected of causing allergic reactions, chosen on the basis of clinical and dietary history, should be tested to determine sensitization. There is no need to test for food-specific IgE antibodies if the food is tolerated or if the food is not part of the family's regular diet. This helps prevent unnecessary testing and reduces the risk of false-positive results. High total and specific IgE levels in individuals with eczema may also lead to overdiagnosis.

A positive test result only means that there is sensitization. The test results must always be linked to the patient's symptoms. An oral food challenge may be performed to determine clinical reactivity if the medical history is unclear.

Who

Sensitization testing usually takes place in a hospital allergy center or an allergy clinic with sufficient experience in food allergy. In some areas, general practitioners are trained to perform first-line tests.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^117WcVkS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

This report is an important step toward addressing these challenges. It is novel in that it combines disparate recommendations from recent guidelines into a common practical pathway that can be used by all centers dealing with food allergy. We showcase how to apply guidelines in practice and provide tips to cope with challenges.

We provide practical steps for health care professionals working with people suspected of food allergy. Our target audience is professionals working in allergy centers, as well as in other hospital roles and in primary care. Not every clinic or setting will be able to undertake all the steps mentioned. We hope that describing a clear pathway concordant with recent guidelines will encourage referrals to other centers where necessary and develop more local capacity and capability over time. Different geographic regions can use this pathway to implement guidelines more consistently and harmonize how diagnostic tests are performed. This may also support more comparable data from different centers to enhance research.

In recent years, other biomarkers have been investigated for FA diagnosis, to monitor food‐allergic status over timeand help guide the need for OFC, or to support predict natural evolution and prognosis. Potential biomarkers may involve genetic and epigenetic factors, comprising their interaction with environmental risk factors linked to FA. Multi‐omics approaches may support the investigation of pathologic mechanisms in FA, potentially leading to insights for novel diagnostic biomarkers.

Furthermore, in the last decades, there is more and more attention to the risk of food allergy overdiagnosis. Reflection on recent advances in the use of diagnostic testing, as well as the application of diagnostic labels, provides an important perspective to understand how far the specialty of allergy and immunology has come in improving the lives of patients and families.

### Varying approaches to management of IgE-mediated food allergy in children around the World [^111tBmt1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is a chronic disease that affects individuals of all ages and is a significant public health problem globally. This narrative overview examines clinical management strategies for IgE-mediated food allergy in children around the world to understand variations in practice. Information was drawn from clinical practice guidelines, recent research, the websites of professional and governmental bodies with expertise in food allergy, and clinical experts from a broad cross-section of geographical regions. The structure and delivery of clinical services, allergen avoidance and food labeling, and resources to support the management of allergic reactions in the community are discussed in detail. The adoption of emerging food immunotherapies is also explored. Wide variations in clinical management of food allergy were apparent across the different countries. Common themes were continuing issues with access to specialist care and recognition of the need to balance risk reduction with dietary and social restrictions to avoid unnecessary detrimental impacts on the quality of life of food allergy sufferers. Findings highlight the need for standardized presentation of practice and priorities, and may assist clinicians and researchers when engaging with government and funding agencies to address gaps.

### Diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy: how to apply the latest guidelines in clinical practice [^116WgiHq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Why

A food allergy will be suspected if a person has an immediate objective allergic reaction after consuming a specific food (usually within 2 hours) and tests suggest IgE sensitization to that food. An oral food challenge may be needed if the connection between a specific food and an allergic reaction is less obvious or if the diagnosis is uncertain. Examples include reactions after complex meals or composite foods, delayed reactions, reactions after ingesting a food previously tolerated, or when cofactors are present such as infections, exercise, and drugs. Even with an anaphylactic reaction, a challenge under controlled conditions may be preferred to ensure a correct diagnosis and a safe diet/treatment if there is doubt about the eliciting food allergen. Challenges may also be performed to test how much of the allergen the person can ingest before experiencing a reaction or whether a person has outgrown the allergy. For example, a patient with a milk allergy and signs of declining IgE/SPT may need to undergo a challenge to determine whether he or she has become tolerant to cow's milk or to baked or heated forms of milk.

Who

In most cases, oral food challenges should be done by health care professionals with experience performing the challenges, interpreting the results, and managing allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Most challenges should be done in a setting with access to intensive care equipment. A risk assessment should be carried out about where and how the challenge should be performed.

Oral food challenges are not available in all allergy centers. Where there is a low risk of reaction or a very low risk of serious reaction, sometimes families may perform oral food challenges at home after discussion with their clinician. We do not recommend that this be done routinely because it is difficult to predict the severity of reactions, and home-based challenges are associated with overdiagnosis. Any positive challenge performed at home should be followed by a clinic-based challenge.

Key Messages

- Food anaphylaxis may be pathophysiologically different than anaphylaxis caused by nonfood triggers.
- Currently, there are no robust, clinically useful predictors of severity in food allergy.

### How to diagnose IgE-mediated food allergy [^113JVWdV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy is an immune response, typically to a food protein. Accurate diagnosis reduces unnecessary dietary restrictions and economic and psychological burden on patients and caregivers but relies on a rigorous clinical history, specific IgE diagnostic tests and, where needed, oral food challenge. Increased awareness is needed around which patients to test for IgE-mediated food allergy, as well as terms commonly associated with IgE-mediated food allergy testing, in order to optimise patient diagnosis and management. Herein, we describe approaches to diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy, appropriate interpretation of results and risks of overtesting.

### Investigating the accuracy, risk impact, and cost-effectiveness of component-resolved diagnostic test for food allergy: a systematic review protocol [^116WwwSM]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The limitations of conventional methods for diagnosing food allergy have stimulated promising developments in molecular-based diagnostic techniques, collectively referred to as component-resolved diagnosis (CRD). Molecular diagnosis of food allergy involves examining the specific proteins in foods, primarily at the molecular level. In this case, rather than providing a summary of all the allergen proteins in a particular food (e.g. peanuts), molecular-based methods quantify the individual proteins within a food that may be responsible for allergic reactions. In CRD, specific IgE responses are evaluated against individual allergenic molecules or the epitopes of those allergens. Therefore, CRD techniques have the potential to enhance the specificity and sensitivity of serum-specific IgE responses to foods. They may also: facilitate our ability to determine specific food allergy phenotypes; help improve compilation of a patient-tailored risk profile to specific food allergens, given that IgE antibodies to food molecules vary from patient to patient and also geographically; and boost the ability to distinguish between primary and secondary sensitisers. Importantly, in CRD approaches, diagnosis can be undertaken either in single test formats or in a microarray by simultaneously evaluating a range of allergens.

There is now a substantial body of evidence on using CRD to diagnose food allergy, which needs to be synthesised in order to generate robust estimates of diagnostic accuracy and assess cost-effectiveness in comparison with conventional approaches. Furthermore, a synthesis of the underlying evidence will help to inform deliberations on whether and how CRD should be deployed for (i) diagnosing food allergy, and (ii) assessing patient risk through the prediction of food allergy severity (i.e. the likelihood of life-threatening anaphylaxis as opposed to relatively mild features) across differing healthcare service contexts.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in food allergy [^116okvzV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of food allergy can have a major impact on the lives of patients and families, imposing dietary restrictions and limitations on social activities. On the other hand, misdiagnosis can place the patient at risk of a potentially severe allergic reaction. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of food allergy is of utmost importance. The diagnosis of food allergy is often established by the combination of the clinical history and allergen-specific IgE; however, without a clear history of an allergic reaction, the interpretation of IgE sensitization tests can be difficult. There are also rare cases of clinical food allergy in the absence of IgE sensitization. For that reason, testing for suspected food allergy ideally requires access to oral food challenges (OFCs), which are currently the gold standard tests to diagnose food allergy. As OFCs are time consuming and involve the risk of acute allergic reactions of unpredictable severity, the question remains: how can we improve the accuracy of diagnosis before referring the patient for an OFC? Herein, we review the predictive value of different tests used to support the diagnosis of food allergy, discuss implications for therapy and prognosis, and propose a diagnostic approach to be applied in clinical practice.

### EAACI guidelines on the management of IgE-mediated food allergy [^1155ArkF]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

This European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) guideline provides recommendations for the management of IgE-mediated food allergy and was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Following the confirmation of IgE-mediated food allergy diagnosis, allergen avoidance and dietary advice (with support of a specialised dietitian, if possible) together with the provision of a written treatment plan, education on the recognition of allergic symptoms and prescription of medication including adrenaline using an auto-injector are essential. Patients with significant anxiety and requirement for coping strategies may benefit from support from a clinical psychologist. As immunomodulatory interventions, omalizumab is suggested for treatment of IgE-mediated food allergy in children from the age of 1 and adults; and oral allergen-specific immunotherapy is recommended for children and adolescents with peanut allergy and suggested for milk and egg allergies (generally after 4years of age for milk and egg). Sublingual and epicutaneous immunotherapy are suggested for peanut allergy but are not yet available at the point of care. Future research into disease modifying treatments for IgE-mediated food allergy are highly needed, with standardised and patient-focused protocols and outcomes.

Food allergies involve an abnormal immune-mediated response to food, often a protein. They can be IgE mediated, non–IgE mediated, or mixed type (Fig 1). In this report, we focus on IgE-mediated food allergies, hereafter termed food allergies.

Fig 1
Typology of IgE-mediated, non–IgE-mediated, and mixed-type food allergies.

Food allergy is a major health issue that affects the nutrition, quality of life, and social activities of individuals, their families, and wider communities. Symptoms can affect any organ system. They vary in their severity, from mild skin symptoms to serious systemic reactions. Symptoms can be upsetting, painful, and even life-threatening.

Food allergies are distinct from other reactions to food that may be based on intolerance and/or that have autoimmune features, such as celiac disease. It is essential to provide prompt and accurate diagnosis for people suspected of food allergy so they can get individualized support about nutrition, foods to avoid, and treatment strategies.

Recent international reviews and guidelines summarize up-to-date evidence about the most effective ways to diagnose and manage food allergies. However, guidelines alone are not sufficient because first, most guidelines focus only on certain elements of the diagnostic process; second, recent guidelines give slightly different recommendations, which may be confusing when trying to apply them in practice; and third, guidelines do not describe how to address practical issues and obstacles when performing diagnostic tests and food challenges.

In order to help patients, guidelines need to be put into practice. The recommendations need to be consistent and interpreted in the same way across settings and regions. Currently, diagnostic guidelines are not being well implemented. There are large variations in the diagnostic approaches used in clinical practice as well as differences in funding, staffing, and processes around the world. There are also significant regional differences in access to allergy specialists, the use of diagnostic tests, and the ability to perform oral food challenges.

sIgE tests

sIgE tests detect circulating IgE antibodies to suspected allergens, but the predictive value of sIgE levels varies across patient populations and may be associated with a patient's age, ethnicity, geographical location and concomitant allergic diseases (such as atopic dermatitis). False-positive results can occur with sIgE tests because of a high degree of non-specific binding in the test or high total IgE levels in some patients. Also, sIgE results from different laboratories are not directly comparable, as slightly different forms of antigens may be used and produce variable outcomes.

### Improving diagnostic accuracy in food allergy [^1116PBg3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of food allergy can have a major impact on the lives of patients and their families, imposing dietary restrictions and often limitations on social and family activities. On the other hand, misdiagnosis can place the patient at risk of a potentially severe allergic reaction. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of food allergy is of utmost importance. The clinical history is key for an accurate diagnosis, and in cases with a clear history of typical IgE-mediated symptoms after the ingestion of a specific food, the diagnosis can be relatively straightforward. However, diagnosis is much more challenging in the absence of a clear history of an allergic reaction or of uneventful consumption of an age appropriate amount of the allergenic food.

The diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy requires evidence of IgE sensitization by skin prick test (SPT) or serum IgE. IgE sensitization is more common than clinical food allergy and there are also rare cases of clinical food allergy in the absence of IgE sensitization. The diagnosis is often established by the combination of the history and allergen-specific IgE; however, without a clear history of an allergic reaction, the interpretation of IgE sensitization tests can be difficult. For that reason, testing for suspected food allergy ideally requires access to an oral food challenge (OFC), which is currently the gold standard test to diagnose food allergy.

2 SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS

FA may result in a large spectrum of clinical manifestations, which may present as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological signs and symptoms, in an isolated or concomitant manner with the same or different timing. Reactions may range from mild local to fatal or near‐fatal anaphylaxis. In this century, significant efforts have gone into to attempting to establish a standard definition for reaction severity, with a recently developed scoring system currently undergoing validation. A thorough clinical history and evaluation remain fundamental for an accurate diagnosis. These serve as the basis for the interpretation of IgE sensitization observed through in vivo (e.g. skin prick tests) and/or in vitro tests (sIgE), which remain critical for investigating potential triggers. In recent years, a significant overdiagnosis of milk allergy in young children has been estimated in some countries. A recent Delphi consensushas highlighted the importance of reproducibility and specificity for diagnosing milk allergy in children with acute or delayed symptoms temporally related to milk protein ingestion. Consensus was reached that milk allergy diagnosis does not need to be considered for stool changes, aversive feeding or occasional spots of blood in stool, if there is no temporal relationship with milk protein ingestion.

Oral food challenge (OFC) represents the gold standard for diagnosis. While it is safe, it comes with significant barriers, including patient and physician fear of severe reactions, as well as important logistic considerations. There is thus an unmet need for novel diagnostic techniques to inform the diagnosis and management of FA and potentially eventually serve as reliable and safe diagnostic alternatives to OFCs.

Component‐resolved diagnosis (CRD) is a diagnostic technique measuring sIgE against specific food allergenic molecules, which has greatly evolved in the last decades. Singleplex or multiplex formats are available on the market, with the spectrum of the available allergenic molecules rapidly rising. Recently, a peanut bead‐based epitope assay has been developed, and it demonstrated an overall accuracy superior to other diagnostic tests.

The potential of basophil activation testand mastocyte activation testhas been recently consolidated with, overall, a good diagnostic performance when compared with OFCs. However, additional robust data including cost‐effectiveness analyses and consensus on international standards are still required before these are ready for clinical use.

### Diagnostic testing in the evaluation of food allergy [^115W9pHo]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food-related symptoms are frequent in childhood, and pediatricians are often requested to initiate a food allergy diagnostic workup. A careful history is the cornerstone for assessing whether tests are needed and which diagnostic procedures are most appropriate. Skin prick tests should be performed only according to standard procedures by a skilled health professional. Determining serum IgE levels (in vitro tests) are available for a wide range of foods. Of utmost importance is the need to correlate test results to the clinical picture. When a conclusion cannot be reached, oral food challenges should be performed for a definite diagnosis.

Oral food challenges (OFCs) for IgE-mediated food allergy — recommendations and formats — are tests the clinician should consider to aid in diagnosis [Strong; A Evidence]; challenge types include open (unmasked), single-blind with or without placebo, and double-blind, placebo-controlled challenges, with the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) as the gold standard that is labor- and time-intensive; for diagnosis, graded dosing during OFCs is recommended because it minimizes the risk of a severe allergic reaction and identifies the lowest provoking dose, and interpretation can be affected by patient or observer bias.

Skin Prick Test and IgE to Allergen Extracts

Skin prick testing and specific IgE (sIgE) levels are diagnostic modalities used to detect the presence of sIgE antibodies to the food source. Positive results have traditionally been considered an SPT wheal diameter of ≥ 3 mm greater than the negative control or an sIgE ≥ 0.35 kU/L. However, a positive result alone indicates sensitization and does not equate to food allergy. Using the 3 mm and 0.35 cutoffs, SPT and sIgE have high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV), but low specificity and positive predictive value (PPV), and thus may lead to overdiagnosis. Studies have demonstrated that a larger SPT wheal size and/or higher sIgE correlates with increased likelihood of clinical allergy. Hence, specificity can be increased by using available 95% PPVs (Table I), but then sensitivity is reduced.

Table I
Diagnostic cutoffs for specific IgE and skin prick testing with 95% positive predictive

Although these cutoffs can be very useful in diagnosing food allergy, they have many limitations. These tests alone are by no means definitive, and it is not uncommon for patients to tolerate a food even with markedly elevated SPT and sIgE results. It is also important to consider that diagnostic cutoff values have varied widely in different studies, presumably due to differences in the patient populations and disease prevalence.SPT and sIgE thresholds may be dependent on age, but there is limited information in children < 2 years. It is also important to note that the level of positivity does not predict reaction threshold or severity. Finally, many individuals have intermediate range results that fall between the NPV and PPV value where a definitive diagnosis is difficult and an OFC is often needed.

### Will oral food challenges still Be part of allergy care in 10 years' time? [^115rqxwJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge is the reference standard procedure for food allergy diagnosis. Open challenges have been adopted as the practical equivalent in clinical settings. Clinical services seeing patients with suspected food allergy should be able to offer OFCs in a feasible and timely fashion. As diagnostic tests improve, they can be used to predict clinical reactivity and reduce the need for OFCs (especially reactive OFCs) and increase the accuracy and response to demand, reduce anxiety, and improve the experience of patients and their families. In clinical practice, one may be able to avoid OFCs in patients by confirming food allergy through combining the clinical history with allergy test results or using high PPV test results (eg, specific IgE to components, BAT) when using appropriate cutoffs for the local population. However, any tests need to be interpreted considering the clinical context of individual patients.

In answer to the question of whether OFC will still be part of allergy care in 10 years' time: yes, given their clinical value, we are likely to still be doing OFCs in 10 years. However, our aim should be to reduce the need for diagnostic OFC markedly by developing more robust and accurate tests that do not carry the risk associated with anaphylaxis. The same goal should exist for using OFCs to monitor the response to immunomodulatory treatments. However, substantial further OFC data (with an array of OFC designs) will likely be needed over the next decade to characterize aspects of reaction phenotypes and dose distributions better for two purposes: to provide insights into the characteristics of food allergic reactions by allergen and provide large controlled datasets through which novel allergy tests can be validated. As these data emerge and the use of these new tests for disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction become more robust, the requirement for clinical OFCs for diagnostic purposes should be drastically reduced with OFCs remaining available for selected purposes.

### Food allergy: immune mechanisms, diagnosis and immunotherapy [^114B2ZG3]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

Food allergy is a pathological, potentially deadly, immune reaction triggered by normally innocuous food protein antigens. The prevalence of food allergies is rising and the standard of care is not optimal, consisting of food-allergen avoidance and treatment of allergen-induced systemic reactions with adrenaline. Thus, accurate diagnosis, prevention and treatment are pressing needs, research into which has been catalysed by technological advances that are enabling a mechanistic understanding of food allergy at the cellular and molecular levels. We discuss the diagnosis and treatment of IgE-mediated food allergy in the context of the immune mechanisms associated with healthy tolerance to common foods, the inflammatory response underlying most food allergies, and immunotherapy-induced desensitization. We highlight promising research advances, therapeutic innovations and the challenges that remain.

### Making the most of in Vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^114SzqP7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Various in vitro assays reflect different aspects of the immunologic mechanisms of IgE-mediated FA. For instance, the amount of circulating allergen-specific IgE antibodies can be determined using immunoenzymatic assays, and basophil activation and T-cell proliferation in response to allergen can be assessed using flow cytometry (Figure 1). Some of these in vitro assays can be used to diagnose FA and/or defer or obviate the need for an oral food challenge (OFC). An OFC is the most accurate test to diagnose FA but requires expensive resources, highly trained personnel, and carries the risk of causing an acute allergic reaction. Therefore, in clinical practice, the diagnosis of FA is based on a combination of the clinical history and the results of allergy tests when possible. The clinical history, including the allergic reaction(s) to the culprit food and the dietary history, is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of FA; it guides the selection of allergens to be tested and the interpretation of allergy test results. In this review, we discuss the main in vitro tests for FA and how to make the most of these tests to decide whether an OFC is required to reach an accurate diagnosis of FA.

### An algorithm for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergy in study participants who do not undergo food challenge [^116mYxWT]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Food allergy diagnosis in clinical studies can be challenging. Oral food challenges (OFC) are time-consuming, carry some risk and may, therefore, not be acceptable to all study participants.

Objective

To design and evaluate an algorithm for detecting IgE-mediated food allergy in clinical study participants who do not undergo OFC.

Methods

An algorithm for trial participants in the Barrier Enhancement for Eczema Prevention (BEEP) study who were unwilling or unable to attend OFC was developed. BEEP is a pragmatic, multi-centre, randomized-controlled trial of daily emollient for the first year of life for primary prevention of eczema and food allergy in high-risk infants (ISRCTN21528841). We built on the European iFAAM consensus guidance to develop a novel food allergy diagnosis algorithm using available information on previous allergenic food ingestion, food reaction(s) and sensitization status. This was implemented by a panel of food allergy experts blind to treatment allocation and OFC outcome. We then evaluated the algorithm's performance in both BEEP and Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) study participants who did undergo OFC.

Results

In 31/69 (45%) BEEP and 44/55 (80%) EAT study control group participants who had an OFC the panel felt confident enough to categorize children as "probable food allergy" or "probable no food allergy". Algorithm-derived panel decisions showed high sensitivity 94% (95%CI 68, 100) BEEP; 90% (95%CI 72, 97) EAT and moderate specificity 67% (95%CI 39, 87) BEEP; 67% (95%CI 39, 87) EAT. Sensitivity and specificity were similar when all BEEP and EAT participants with OFC outcome were included.

Conclusion

We describe a new algorithm with high sensitivity for IgE-mediated food allergy in clinical study participants who do not undergo OFC.

Clinical Relevance

This may be a useful tool for excluding food allergy in future clinical studies where OFC is not conducted.

### Epitope-based IgE assays and their role in providing diagnosis and prognosis of food allergy [^112JdYP6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

With advances in molecular and computational science, epitope-specific IgE antibody profiling has been developed and recently brought into clinical practice. Epitope-based testing detects IgE antibodies that directly bind to antigenic sites of an allergen, providing increased resolution specificity and fewer false-positive results for diagnosing food allergy. Epitope-binding profiles may also serve as prognostic markers of food allergy and help predict quantities of allergen that would provoke a reaction (ie, eliciting dose, possible severity of a reaction after allergen ingestion, and outcomes of treatment options such as oral immunotherapy [OIT]). Future studies are under way to discover additional applications of epitope-specific antibodies for multiple food allergens.
