## Question

What to do if patient has low hemoglobin but high mcv

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when a patient has low hemoglobin with high MCV, i.e., macrocytic anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true anemia and true macrocytosis. Then, I should verify the reticulocyte response to distinguish increased destruction from decreased production. Next, I will consider the major etiologic categories of macrocytic anemia and the first-line laboratory evaluation. After that, I should review special populations and medication causes. Finally, I will outline management principles, transfusion thresholds, and when to escalate to bone marrow evaluation, ensuring I double-check areas where MCV-guided classification can mislead us.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and avoid premature closure. Low hemoglobin should be compared with age- and sex-specific norms, and high MCV should be verified against the lab's reference range, keeping in mind that automated counters can artifactually elevate MCV with reticulocytosis or cold agglutinins, so I need to check a reticulocyte count and a peripheral smear to confirm true macrocytosis before proceeding [^111etdk1].

> Next, I should review the reticulocyte count to separate hemolysis or blood loss from marrow failure. An elevated reticulocyte count suggests a compensatory marrow response to hemolysis or ongoing blood loss, whereas a low or inappropriately normal reticulocyte count points to impaired production, which in macrocytosis often reflects megaloblastic processes, drugs, or myelodysplasia. I should double-check the absolute reticulocyte count and, if needed, calculate a reticulocyte production index to refine this distinction [^111Y5frp] [^111F3gdk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with MCV-based rules. I initially thought macrocytosis essentially excludes iron deficiency, but wait, let me verify that assumption because it is dangerously oversimplified. A large primary care cohort showed that MCV-guided classification frequently misclassifies etiologies, and macrocytosis does not reliably exclude iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease, so I should not anchor on MCV alone and must obtain iron studies regardless of MCV when anemia is present [^112FPnFF].

> I will now examine the major etiologic buckets for macrocytic anemia. The most common are megaloblastic processes due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, medication-induced macrocytosis such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or hydroxyurea, liver disease and alcohol, hypothyroidism, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Less common causes include congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and copper deficiency, so I need to tailor testing to the clinical context and medication history [^111etdk1] [^111F3gdk].

> Let me first confirm the initial laboratory workup. I should order vitamin B12 and folate levels, a comprehensive metabolic panel including liver enzymes and bilirubin, TSH, and iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation to evaluate for coexisting iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease. If hemolysis is suspected from the reticulocyte count, I should add LDH, haptoglobin, and indirect bilirubin, and I should review a peripheral smear for macro-ovalocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, or dysplasia, which can pivot the diagnosis toward megaloblastic anemia or MDS respectively [^117Fk92E] [^111Y5frp] [^111F3gdk].

> But wait, what if the patient is on cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy. I need to check for drug-induced macrocytosis, particularly with PARP inhibitors, methotrexate, azathioprine, or hydroxyurea, and remember that PARP inhibitor–related anemia is macrocytic and not due to B12 deficiency, which changes management to drug modification, transfusion, and growth factor support rather than B12 replacement [^116iZ1vG].

> Next, I should review special populations. In older adults, macrocytosis increases the likelihood of myelodysplasia, so I should maintain a lower threshold for bone marrow evaluation if cytopenias are unexplained or persistent. In children, macrocytosis is less common and should prompt evaluation for B12/folate deficiency, hypothyroidism, liver disease, or bone marrow disorders. In pregnancy, physiologic hemodilution can mask macrocytosis, so I should confirm true macrocytosis and prioritize B12/folate assessment given teratogenic risks of untreated deficiency [^117Fk92E] [^113rxHok] [^117Vr9jF].

> I need to ensure I do not miss combined etiologies. Coexisting iron deficiency can blunt macrocytosis and yield a normocytic picture, so a normal MCV does not exclude B12/folate deficiency when iron deficiency is present. Conversely, macrocytosis does not exclude iron deficiency, so I should interpret iron studies in the context of CRP and the clinical picture to avoid misclassification [^112FPnFF] [^116Ln8KB].

> Now, I will outline management principles. For confirmed B12 deficiency, I should initiate parenteral B12 replacement and investigate the cause, especially pernicious anemia or malabsorption. For folate deficiency, oral folate is appropriate while addressing the underlying cause. For drug-induced macrocytosis, I should modify the offending agent when feasible and provide supportive care. For suspected MDS, I should refer to hematology for bone marrow evaluation and cytogenetics. Throughout, I should treat any coexisting iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease to optimize erythropoiesis [^117Fk92E] [^116iZ1vG] [^112LM63t].

> I should double-check transfusion thresholds. In stable, hospitalized adults, a restrictive strategy using 7 g/dL is supported, with 7.5–8 g/dL reasonable in cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, or cardiovascular disease, and decisions should integrate symptoms, comorbidities, and the rate of hemoglobin decline. In MDS or aplastic anemia, many guidelines endorse 70–80 g/L thresholds in stable patients, with individualization for symptoms and comorbidities, so I must avoid reflexive transfusion above these ranges in the absence of compelling indications [^111TuXVE] [^117QbNoA] [^111zj53d].

> Let me reconsider when to escalate to bone marrow evaluation. Indications include unexplained macrocytic anemia with cytopenias, persistent macrocytosis without a reversible cause, dysplasia on smear, or suspicion of MDS or aplastic anemia. Noninvasive models can sometimes estimate MDS probability, but they do not replace marrow examination when the pretest probability is high or when results will change management [^112LM63t] [^114uyxr6].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and monitoring. After initiating B12 or folate therapy, I expect a reticulocyte rise within 3–5 days and hemoglobin recovery over 4–8 weeks. After iron therapy, I should recheck hemoglobin in about 4 weeks and continue for roughly 3 months after normalization to replete stores. If anemia fails to respond as expected, I need to reassess adherence, absorption, ongoing blood loss, alternative diagnoses, or combined deficiencies and adjust the plan accordingly [^117Fk92E] [^116DCPpr].

Low hemoglobin with high MCV indicates **macrocytic anemia**, most often due to **B12/folate deficiency**, **alcohol**, **medications** (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, hydroxyurea), or **myelodysplastic syndrome**. Confirm with **reticulocyte count**, **B12/folate**, **TSH**, **LFTs**, and a **peripheral smear**; if unexplained or persistent, pursue bone marrow evaluation. Treat the cause: B12/folate replacement, stop offending drugs, or refer to hematology for MDS. Transfuse only if symptomatic or Hb < 7–8 g/dL, and monitor response to therapy.

---

## Differential diagnosis

Macrocytic anemia has a **broad differential**; categorize as megaloblastic or non-megaloblastic:

| **Category** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|
| Megaloblastic (DNA synthesis defects) | - Vitamin B12 deficiency <br/> - Folate deficiency <br/> - Medications (methotrexate, azathioprine, hydroxyurea, zidovudine) |
| Non-megaloblastic | - Alcohol use disorder <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) <br/> - Reticulocytosis (hemolysis, bleeding) <br/> - Congenital disorders (e.g. Diamond-Blackfan) |

---

## Initial evaluation

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm anemia and macrocytosis**: Repeat CBC to exclude lab error; verify age/sex-specific anemia thresholds.
- **Reticulocyte count**: Elevated suggests hemolysis or blood loss; low/normal suggests impaired production.
- **Peripheral smear**: Look for macro-ovalocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, dysplasia, blasts.
- **Vitamin B12 and folate**: Core tests for megaloblastic anemia.
- **TSH**: Evaluate for hypothyroidism.
- **Liver function tests**: Assess for liver disease.
- **Medication review**: Identify cytotoxic or antimetabolite exposure.

---

## Further diagnostic steps

If initial tests are inconclusive, **additional evaluation** includes:

- **Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy**: Indicated for unexplained macrocytosis, cytopenias, dysplasia, or suspicion of MDS.
- **Hemolysis labs**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, direct antiglobulin test if hemolysis is suspected.
- **Genetic testing**: Consider for suspected congenital macrocytic anemia.

---

## Management strategies

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Intramuscular B12 (e.g. 1000 mcg daily for 1 week, then weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly).
- **Folate deficiency**: Oral folate 1–5 mg daily.
- **Medication-induced macrocytosis**: Stop or adjust the offending drug when feasible.
- **Alcohol-related anemia**: Abstinence and nutritional support.
- **Myelodysplastic syndrome**: Hematology referral; consider supportive care, hypomethylating agents, or transplant.
- **Transfusion**: Use restrictive thresholds (generally Hb 7–8 g/dL) unless symptomatic or high-risk.

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the **cause and response**. Untreated B12/folate deficiency can cause irreversible neuropathy and hematologic failure. MDS carries variable risks of progression and complications. Macrocytosis itself is a marker of disease severity in some cancers and is associated with higher mortality in CKD.

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Track **hemoglobin recovery** and **reticulocyte response** to therapy; reassess for relapse or progression. In MDS, monitor for transformation and complications. Educate patients on adherence, diet, and alcohol cessation.

---

Low hemoglobin with high MCV signals macrocytic anemia; **confirm with repeat CBC and reticulocyte count**, then target testing to B12/folate, TSH, LFTs, and smear. Treat the underlying cause and transfuse only when indicated, with close follow-up to ensure response and detect complications.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^112FPnFF]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^111ULGRj]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Not so benign haematology: anaemia of the elderly [^117KoYiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

Screening

As outlined above, patients with IBD have a high risk of anemia, and if present, anemia is a main factor contributing to morbidity. It is therefore important that every patient with IBD is screened for anemia. The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) recommend a laboratory screening using complete blood count (CBC), serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) for every patient with IBD in their 2015 guidelines. Screenings should be repeated every 6–12 months for patients in remission or with mild disease and at least every 3 months for patients with active disease in the outpatient setting. Vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be tested at least once a year if a patient has risk factors (e.g. extensive small bowel disease or resection, ileoanal pouch) or if macrocytosis is present. Figure 1 in section 'Summary' visualizes the recommended screening algorithm.

### Iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^117Vr9jF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anemia is defined as a low red blood cell count, a low hematocrit, or a low hemoglobin concentration. In pregnancy, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11.0 g/dL in the first trimester and less than 10.5 or 11.0 g/dL in the second or third trimester (depending on the guideline used) is considered anemia. Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy. Maternal anemia is associated with adverse fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes, but causality is not established. Maternal anemia increases the likelihood of transfusion at delivery. Besides hemodilution, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends screening for anemia with a complete blood count in the first trimester and again at 24 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation. Mild anemia, with a hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL or higher and a mildly low or normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is likely iron deficiency anemia. A trial of oral iron can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Mild anemia with a very low MCV, macrocytic anemia, moderate anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL) or severe anemia (hemoglobin 4.0–6.9 g/dL) requires further investigation. Once a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed, first-line treatment is oral iron. New evidence suggests that intermittent dosing is as effective as daily or twice-daily dosing with fewer side effects. For patients with iron deficiency anemia who cannot tolerate, cannot absorb, or do not respond to oral iron, intravenous iron is preferred. With contemporary formulations, allergic reactions are rare.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### PARP inhibitors in the management of ovarian cancer: ASCO guideline [^116iZ1vG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

PARP inhibitors — anemia management notes that anemia is macrocytic with mean corpuscular volumes that can reach > 105 (units) and "is not a vitamin B12–dependent pernicious anemia functionally". Interventions include "drug hold, dose reduction, transfusion, and consideration of growth factor support", with the latter "recommended to follow existing ASCO guidelines". Because "drug holding without associated other change will result in recurrence of the anemia upon reinstitution of the agent", "dose modification with or without transfusion to acutely ameliorate effects of anemia is recommended".

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111V71Fg]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little information in literature to guide the approach to CKD patients who show laboratory evidence of iron deficiency. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of GI blood loss due to variety of causes in this patient population, deciding on a subsequent management plan, including endoscopy, depends on the clinical presentation. This supports the recommendation that CKD patients who present with anaemia and iron deficiency should undergo careful clinical assessment prior to the initiation of anaemia therapy.

Reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis can manifest as low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), but given the relatively long lifespan of circulating erythrocyte, this test will not reflect the existing availability of iron at the time of testing. Testing the reticulocytes for their Hb content (CHr or Ret-He) may allow more accurate estimation of iron availability, because reticulocytes are present in the circulation for 4–5 days, so give a discrete population to study. Reduced red cell Hb can be reflective of reduced haem availability or globin. Therefore, the red cell analyte values (%HRC, CHr, Ret-He) may be affected by the presence of haemoglobinopathies.

Who to investigate

The investigation of IDA potentially involves a considerable workload with a relatively low yield, and so there is a strong case for targeting valuable investigational resources. Cancer is by far the most serious pathology underlying IDA, but even following previous guidelines advising investigation of males and postmenopausal women, cancer is only found in 8%–10% of cases — and the majority of investigations reveal no other significant abnormalities either.

It is also important to bear in mind that premenopausal women do on occasion develop cancer in the GI tract, and that cancer is not the only GI pathology underlying IDA. There is therefore sometimes justification for investigating younger women — particularly if the IDA is severe or recurrent, and disproportionate to perceived menstrual losses (see the Special situations section).

There is now evidence that individuals with IDA can be stratified for the risk of underlying GI cancer based on a set of simple and objective clinical variables — specifically age, sex, MCV and Hb concentration. The IDIOM Apphas been developed to provide a swift estimate of GI cancer risk in IDA, which may help inform the patient discussion as to the potential benefit of investigation. Further refinement of the risk stratification process with the incorporation of additional clinical variables may allow the identification of sizeable subgroups who can safely avoid invasive procedures altogether.

### Consensus statement for the perinatal management of patients with α thalassemia major [^117Pkryh]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Prenatal screening

- Couples who are at risk for offspring affected with ATM (those in which both parents are carriers for a 2-gene deletion in cis) should be counseled regarding the risks for this condition and the availability of prenatal screening to determine carrier status. Universal screening, including hemoglobin and red cell indices (mean corpuscular volume) in the preconception or early prenatal period is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Women who are at risk of being carriers for ATM can be identified by a low mean corpuscular volume (< 70 fL) on routine complete blood count analysis. Importantly, because red cell indices may fail to identify all carriers, molecular based screening should be pursued in high-risk populations to definitively identify α thalassemia carrier status. Notably, hemoglobin electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography tests are unable to identify α thalassemia carriers: although prospective parents should be offered these tests to rule out β thalassemia deletions, they should also be tested for α thalassemia mutations using molecular genetic testing.
- If both parents are carriers of ATM, they should be thoroughly counseled about the implications of this diagnosis. This counseling should include the etiology, clinical manifestations, prognosis, and the full range of long-term outcomes, depending on the expected severity of disease based on number of genes affected. Collaborative education (including consultation with pediatric hematologist who is familiar with the management of patients with thalassemia) may be valuable for these families for reproductive planning. Prospective parents should be informed of the option of preimplantation genetic testing for monogenetic conditions of embryos to prevent a pregnancy with ATM. Recognition of the limitations of preimplantation genetic testingand need for confirmatory prenatal diagnostic testingshould be discussed. Patients who are already pregnant should be offered early prenatal diagnosis (via chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) to allow for informed decision making about the pregnancy.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113hZ1ny]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anemia synopsis — Even mild preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization defines anemia as a hemoglobin concentration < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women. Up to 64% of surgical patients have anemia, more than half of which is moderate to severe. Iron deficiency is responsible in 40% to 50% of cases, and ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation < 20%, and/or microcytic hypochromic red cells (mean corpuscular volume < 80 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration < 27 g/dL) are indicative of iron deficiency. Most anemias are correctable within 2 to 4 weeks, and anemia management programs decrease the rate of transfusions, complications, and mortality.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Pretreatment high MCV as adverse prognostic marker in nonanemic patients with head and neck cancer [^116bYed9]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) has been shown in to be a reliable prognostic marker in other cancers; however, no evidence exists on its use in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study aimed to investigate the association between MCV, hemoglobin, platelet count and albumin concentration, and survival in stage III/IVA-B HNSCC treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

In this multicenter retrospective study, we analyzed MCV, platelet count, hemoglobin concentration, and albumin concentration in peripheral blood samples from 260 patients with HNSCC undergoing organ preservation treatment with curative intent at the time of diagnosis. We then analyzed survival outcomes after accounting for confounders using multivariate analysis.

Results

After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with low hemoglobin had a 3.3-fold higher risk of death (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.26–4.81) than those with normal hemoglobin. Patients with an elevated MCV had a 1.54-fold higher risk of death (95% CI: 1.06–2.24), independent of site, stage, and human papillomavirus status. Interestingly, the effect of MCV on overall and progression-free survival was limited to those with a normal pretreatment hemoglobin. We identified no associations between pretreatment platelet count or albumin concentration and survival.

Conclusion

These findings suggest that pretreatment anemia and macrocytosis are independent predictors of lower overall and progression-free survival in HNSCC patients undergoing organ preservation treatment.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^114FcXEi]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### High mean corpuscular volume predicts poor outcome for patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma [^111ViocN]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our finding that MCV, but not RDW or Hb, is a prognostic factor independent of other (hematologic) parameters for patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction accords well with the data published by Yoon et al.underscoring the prognostic potential of a number of possible hematologic prognostic markers.

Although we could show that MCV is an independent prognostic factor in AEG, this study had certain limitations. Besides its retrospective nature, the long observation period must be addressed. During this period, both the surgical techniques and the regimens of neoadjuvant treatment undergo significant changes. Those two points cannot be disregarded, although the surgical approach and neoadjuvant therapy were factors that did not show any significant correlation in our study.

Based on our findings, clinicians might well focus on identifying patients at high risk for early recurrence and diminished survival after surgery. The possible consequences of preoperatively elevated MCV might be that patients receive neoadjuvant treatment despite their low clinical staging and must followed up in shorter intervals after surgery or receive adjuvant chemotherapy even though they show no lymph node involvement in their pathologic staging.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms for the development of macrocytosis and therefore the background for the prognostic role of MCV are not fully understood to date. Thus, further studies investigating preoperative vitamin B12 and folate status are needed to clarify the prognostic role of MCV for patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^112jDw99]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — preoperative interventions include that preoperative identification of high-risk patients should be performed, and all available preoperative and perioperative measures of blood conservation should be undertaken in this group as they account for the majority of blood products transfused (Class I, Level A). Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits. In patients undergoing cardiac operations, it is reasonable to implement standardized transfusion protocols in order to reduce transfusion burden. In patients who have (i) preoperative anemia, (ii) refuse blood transfusion, (iii) or are deemed high-risk for postoperative anemia, it is reasonable to administer preoperative erythropoietin-stimulating agents and iron supplementation several days before cardiac operations to increase red cell mass. Minimization of phlebotomy by reduced volume and frequency of blood sampling is a reasonable means of blood conservation. Preoperative treatment of asymptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia with transfusion is of uncertain benefit (Class III: No Benefit, Level B-NR).

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

Hemoglobinopathies — a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant to assess not only their risk of anemia but also to allow assessment for risk of a hemoglobinopathy, and ideally, this testing also should be offered to women before pregnancy. A hemoglobin electrophoresis should be performed in addition to a complete blood count if there is suspicion of hemoglobinopathy based on ethnicity (African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, or West Indian descent). If red blood cell indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^115kG2fk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency in pregnancy remains underdiagnosed despite professional society recommendations for first-trimester complete blood count (CBC) screening. To determine the effectiveness of the CBC hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) to identify iron deficiency in pregnancy, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 20,550 pregnancies from 2009 to 2022 at the University of California, San Francisco, obstetrics clinics. A total of 16,547 (80.5%) pregnant individuals had first-trimester screening CBC; 345 (2.1%) had a coincident ferritin test. Hemoglobin level less than 11 g/dL and MCV level less than 80 fL each had sensitivity of only 30% (95% CI, 20–41%) to detect first-trimester iron deficiency (ferritin level less than 30), corresponding to a negative likelihood ratio of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.77–1.05) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73–0.99), respectively. More than 50% of the 1,749 women with documented iron deficiency anytime during pregnancy were neither anemic nor microcytic at the time of diagnosis.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^111ecQpE]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

Table 5. Extended — hematologic parameters with prognostic or diagnostic value: In Ph+ pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), low-risk on d1 defined by peripheral blood WBC < 100 000 and bone marrow blast < 5% was associated with significantly better event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), with EFS: 55% low risk, 18% high risk; OS: 79% low risk, 27% high risk. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), hemoglobin (Hgb) thresholds are prognostic, as Hgb > 10 g/dL is associated with better OS in Int-1 and Int-2 MDS, and in MDS, significantly different survival and evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was associated with Hgb < 10 g, platelet count (Plt) < 100 000, and absolute neutrophil count < 0.8. Baseline thrombocytopenia < 100 000 was associated with 39% transfusion independence versus 73% without thrombocytopenia, and the odds ratio for decreased cytogenetic response with, versus without, thrombocytopenia was 4.78. For differentiating aplastic anemia (AA) from hypoplastic MDS in adults, peripheral blood Plt, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocyte count, and percentage of lymphocytes are significantly different, and red cell distribution width (RDW) values differ with mean RDW, 16.8% severe AA; 17.4% nonsevere AA; versus 20.4% MDS.

### Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean platelet volume (MPV) as early diagnostic markers for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and anemia: a systematic review of clinical evidence and mechanisms [^1119ZPHc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In resource-limited settings, timely and affordable diagnostics can significantly impact maternal health outcomes. Among the most accessible are MPV and MCV — readily accessible within standard CBC parameters.

Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) and Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) are fundamental hematological parameters routinely measured in complete blood count (CBC) tests. While traditionally utilized for assessing anemia and thrombocytopenia, recent studies have highlighted their potential as early diagnostic markers for pregnancy-related complications.

During normal pregnancy, significant physiological adaptations occur in the maternal hematological system. Plasma volume increases by 40–50%, while red blood cell mass rises by 20–30%, leading to physiological anemia of pregnancy. Concurrently, platelet production accelerates, with MPV values typically increasing across trimesters. These changes reflect the body's response to meet fetal demands and prepare for delivery-associated blood loss.

In Yemen and neighboring low-resource regions, the combined burden of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and iron-deficiency anemia affects over 30% of pregnant women, contributing to maternal morbidity and neonatal complications. Recent Ministry of Health data (2023) report a 12% prevalence of preeclampsia, 9% for GDM, and 22% for anemia among antenatal clinic attendees in Lahej and Aden governorates. These high rates underscore the urgent need for affordable and early diagnostic tools in maternal care.

Pathological alterations in these parameters may signal developing complications:
Preeclampsia: Elevated MPV (> 10.2 fL) reflects increased platelet activation and consumption, a hallmark of endothelial dysfunction. Studies demonstrate 78% sensitivity for predicting preeclampsia when MPV exceeds this threshold.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM): MPV > 9.8 fL correlates with insulin resistance (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.8–3.0), suggesting subclinical inflammation.
Iron-Deficiency Anemia: MCV < 80 fL shows 85% specificity for iron deficiency, the most common anemia etiology in pregnancy.

### Biology of anemia, differential diagnosis, and treatment options in human immunodeficiency virus infection [^1151tzEi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common hematologic manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The causes of HIV-related anemia are multifactorial and include direct and indirect effects of HIV infection. HIV-related anemia generally is due to reduced red blood cell (RBC) production, secondary to a variety of causes, but it may also involve nutritional deficiencies, increased RBC destruction, or a combination of these problems. Evaluation of hemoglobin level, reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and mean corpuscular volume value and review of the peripheral blood smear are necessary for diagnosis. Treatment of HIV-related anemia should address the correctable underlying causes of this disorder, such as modifications of offending medications, nutritional deficiencies, and parvovirus infection. Patients with HIV infection have a blunted erythropoietin response to anemia. Therapeutic modalities for anemia that is not amenable to correction include blood transfusion and recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa).

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^117XwWin]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease — research recommendations identify unanswered questions to inform future studies. The guideline notes that in cohort studies moderate anemia is associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and asks whether anemia is a true risk factor or a marker. It highlights uncertainty about optimal Hb targets for ESA therapy, querying the risk–benefit ratio of low Hb targets < 10.0 g/dl (< 100 g/l) or high targets of 11.5–13.0 g/dl (115–130 g/l) compared with conventional targets of 10.0–11.5 g/dl (100–115 g/l). It asks whether the objective of therapy should be improvement in clinical outcomes provided Hb concentration is within 10.0–13.0 g/dl (100–130 g/l), explores ESA responsiveness versus dose and clinical outcomes, examines intravenous vs subcutaneous administration and biosimilar comparability, and requests data on appropriate, weight-based dosing for younger pediatric patients, especially those under the age of two years.

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^112rkjre]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia with and without comorbidities.

Methods

Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were used in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia with no secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using the mean values.

Results

The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while 26 to 31.5 pg can distinguish iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

Conclusions

Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^117NHQFZ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 × 10¹²/l or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^1176yBmc]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^111TuXVE]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guideline — adult good practice and recommendations: For hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which the transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remark: in accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most of the trials for subgroups of patients, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. For hospitalized adult patients, the panel suggests a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL in those with hematologic and oncologic disorders (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Good practice considerations state clinicians should consider not only the hemoglobin concentration but also symptoms, signs, other laboratory data, patients' values and preferences, and the overall clinical context, and that clinicians should consider alternatives to transfusion, including medical treatment of anemia and blood conservation strategies; the guideline also notes this practice guideline will not apply to all individual RBC transfusion decisions.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^112Gr85t]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative management — risk assessment for anemia in cardiac surgery states: Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits (Class IIa, Level B-R). Anemia burden is substantial, with the prevalence of anemia in the 30% to 40% range and severe anemia by World Health Organization classification of hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in the 8% to 10% range. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia in the cardiac surgical population, occurring in up to 50% of anemic patients; iron‑deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, whereas normocytic or macrocytic anemia stem from a variety of causes. Routine iron studies are of importance in the determination of the type of anemia present and should be done routinely in the careful preoperative assessment of patients so that treatment can be instituted if warranted, and differentiation must be made between anemias caused by iron deficiency as opposed to other causes of anemia.

Hereditary hemochromatosis phlebotomy regimen — initial depletion and maintenance guidance are as follows: One phlebotomy (removal of 500 mL blood) is performed "weekly or biweekly", and each unit removed contains "approximately 200–250 mg iron". Monitoring includes checking serum ferritin "after every 10–12 phlebotomies (approximately 3 months)" early in treatment, with excess iron mobilization indicated when ferritin "drops to between 50 and 100 μg/L". As the "target range of 50–100 μg/L" is approached, testing may be increased; frequent phlebotomy is stopped when ferritin "reaches 50–100 μg/L", and then continued to keep ferritin "between 50 and 100 μg/L". Safety measures include allowing hematocrit/hemoglobin to fall by "no more than 20% of prior level". Treatment burden can be substantial in heavily iron-loaded patients — those with total body iron stores " > 30 g" may require "up to 2–3 years" of therapy — and maintenance needs vary, with some patients requiring phlebotomy "monthly", while others may need "only 1–2 units of blood removed per year".

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^112BCHrC]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Impact on clinical practice

On the basis of the above fact, we reiterate the prognostic importance of confirming the diagnosis of true ET in any patient with a reported diagnosis of 'ET'. In this regard, one must carefully examine the complete blood count (anemia or leukocytosis suggest early/prefibrotic MF), peripheral blood smear (increased red cell distribution width, decreased mean corpuscular volume that is not associated with iron deficiency, or leukoerythroblastosis suggests early/prefibrotic MF), serum lactate dehydrogenase (increased levels are more consistent with early/prefibrotic MF) and JAK2 V617F allele burden (diagnosis of ET must be questioned in the presence of > 25% allele burden).

In terms of management, caution is required in the use of aspirin in early/prefibrotic MF because of the increased baseline risk of bleeding. In general, we recommend avoidance of prophylactic aspirin therapy in early/prefibrotic MF, especially in the presence of a bleeding history. This is different from our treatment approach in WHO-defined ET, in which we recommend universal use of aspirin therapy in the absence of clear contraindications, such as clinically relevant acquired von Willebrand syndrome. On the other hand, the indications to use cytoreductive therapy remain similar to those of ET, but might require deeper cytoreduction in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

Down syndrome — macrocytosis and interpretation of mean corpuscular volume notes that children have a similar risk for iron-deficiency anemia as the typical population but it may be missed because of macrocytosis; iron insufficiency may precede anemia and have longer term neurologic effects; macrocytosis, which increases mean corpuscular volume, is present in up to one-third of patients, therefore a low mean corpuscular volume is not a useful screen for iron deficiency/insufficiency, lead toxicity, or thalassemia.

Preprocedure preparation blood management protocols — Multimodal protocols or algorithms may be employed as strategies to reduce the usage of blood products, although no single algorithm or protocol can be recommended at this time. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy may be safely used to reduce transfusion administration, with determination of whether hemoglobin concentrations between 6 and 10g/dl justify or require red blood cell transfusion based on bleeding, volume status, signs of organ ischemia, and cardiopulmonary reserve; red blood cells should be administered unit‑by‑unit, when possible, with interval reevaluation. A protocol for avoidance of transfusion may be used for patients in whom transfusion is refused or not possible, and transfusion of red blood cells is rarely necessary when the hemoglobin concentration is more than 10g/dl.

Patient Blood Management is the timely application of evidence-based medical and surgical concepts designed to maintain hemoglobin concentration, optimize hemostasis, and minimize blood loss to improve patient outcomes. Conceptually similar to a "bundle" strategy, it is designed to improve clinical care using comprehensive evidence-based treatment strategies to manage patients with potential or ongoing critical bleeding, bleeding diathesis, critical anemia, and/ or a coagulopathy. Patient Blood Management includes multimodal strategies to screen, diagnose and properly treat anemia, coagulopathies and minimize bleeding, using goal-directed therapy and leverages a patient's physiologic ability to adapt to anemia while definitive treatment is undertaken. Allogeneic blood component transfusion is one traditional therapeutic modality out of many for managing blood loss and anemia and, while it may be the best choice in certain situations, other effective and more appropriate options are available and should be used in conjunction or alone. Therefore, comprehensive Patient Blood Management is the new standard of care to prevent and manage anemia and optimize hemostasis and has been recommended by the World Health Organization, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the European Society of Anaesthesiology and the Australian National Blood Authority. While there is a plethora of expert consensus and good practice guidelines published for blood component transfusion from multiple professional organizations and societies, there remains a need for more comprehensive and broader standards of patient medical management to proactively reduce the risk of exposure to allogeneic transfusions. In 2010, the Society for Advancement of Blood Management published the first comprehensive standards to address the administrative and clinical components of an effective, patient-centered Patient Blood Management program. Recognizing the need to reduce inappropriate transfusions, some professional organizations have placed their emphasis on transfusion guidelines. In contrast, the focus of the Society for Advancement of Blood Management Standard is on the centrality of the patient and the full spectrum of therapeutic strategies needed to improve clinical outcomes in patients at risk for blood loss or anemia, thereby reducing avoidable transfusions as well. The Standards are meant not to replace, but to complement transfusion guidelines by more completely addressing the need for a multi-modal clinical approach with the goal to improve patient outcomes. Compared to adult programs, Pediatric Patient Blood Management programs are currently not commonly accepted as standard of care for pediatric patients. This is partly due to the fact that, until recently, there was a paucity of robust evidence-based literature and expert consensus guidelines on pediatric PBM. Managing pediatric bleeding and blood product transfusion presents a unique set of challenges. The main goal of transfusion is to correct or avoid imminent inadequate oxygen carrying capacity caused by inadequate red blood cell mass. Determining when, what, and how much to transfuse can be difficult. Neonates, infants, children, and adolescents each have specific considerations based on age, weight, physiology, and pharmacology. In this edition of Pediatric Anaesthesia we provide, in abbreviated format, the 4th edition of the Administrative and Clinical Standards for Patient Blood Management; Pediatric Version, first published in 2010 with the addition of a new Pediatric section in 2016. These Standards provide guidance for implementing a comprehensive Pediatric Patient Blood Management program at both pediatric and adult medical institutions. While every hospital may not be equipped to have a dedicated Pediatric Patient Blood Management program, this document highlights important universal clinical strategies that can be implemented to optimize pediatric bleeding management and minimize allogeneic blood product exposure through the use of multi-modal therapeutic strategies that have their central emphasis on the patient rather than the transfusion. Important strategies include: treatment of preoperative anemia, standardized transfusion algorithms, the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds, goal-directed therapy based on point of care and viscoelastic testing, antifibrinolytics, and avoidance of hemodilution and hypothermia as supported by evidence.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^114AKt1p]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### Outcomes using lower vs higher hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion [^117QbNoA]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is a lower vs higher hemoglobin threshold best for minimizing both red blood cell use and adverse clinical outcomes when used to trigger red blood cell transfusions in anemic patients in critical care and acute care settings?

Bottom Line

Compared with higher hemoglobin thresholds, a hemoglobin threshold of 7 or 8 g/dL is associated with fewer red blood cell units transfused without adverse associations with mortality, cardiac morbidity, functional recovery, or length of hospital stay.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^114Wx4vx]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^116Dgo4n]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathy and thalassemia screening — pregnancy care includes that a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant; if indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed, and it should also be performed when ethnicity raises suspicion, ideally before pregnancy, with repeat testing not necessary if prior results are available. Determination of mean corpuscular volume is recommended to assess risk of α-thalassemia or β-thalassemia; patients with a low mean corpuscular volume (less than 80 fL) may have one of the thalassemia traits and should have hemoglobin electrophoresis, and measurement of serum ferritin levels is recommended. β-thalassemia is associated with elevated hemoglobin F and elevated hemoglobin A2 levels (more than 3.5%). Neither hemoglobin electrophoresis nor solubility testing can identify α-thalassemia trait; if the mean corpuscular volume is below normal, iron deficiency is excluded, and electrophoresis is not consistent with β-thalassemia trait, then DNA-based testing should be used to detect α-globin gene deletions characteristic of α-thalassemia. Solubility tests are inadequate for screening and fail to identify several important traits, and if both partners are identified as carriers of a gene for abnormal hemoglobins, genetic counseling is recommended.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^116DbepM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Children from baffin island have a disproportionate burden of tuberculosis in Canada: data from the children's hospital of Eastern Ontario (1998–2008) [^11383jgF]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

A standard medical record abstraction form was developed for data collection. The information collected included demographic data, clinical manifestations at presentation, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination history, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, results of diagnostic investigations, hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values, complications, and surgical interventions. The form was developed after a review of the clinical manifestations, complications, diagnosis and management of TB. Following this review, lists were created for all qualitative variables, including symptoms, physical findings, CXR findings, specimens sent for microbiology, acute and chronic complications, and surgical interventions.

BCG vaccination status can be assessed on history, physical examination (presence/absence of a BCG scar), or by review of immunization records. Among those children considered recipients, we recorded the criteria used from most to least reliable (i.e. 1) availability of records, 2) presence of a scar, or 3) verbal history). If a family denied BCG vaccination on history and neither of the other 2 criteria were fulfilled, the child was classified as a non-recipient. All others were classified as having unknown BCG status. Hemoglobin and MCV values were compared to age-specific normal ranges provided by the CHEO hematology laboratory, and were classified as normal, high or low. Patients with low hemoglobin and a normal MCV were classified as having normocytic anemia, while those with low hemoglobin and a low MCV were classified as having microcytic anemia. Mention of an HIV work-up, or at least consideration of co-infection, was present in many charts in the absence of further information or testing results. Testing is done at the ORPHL, and results are forwarded to the CHEO virology laboratory. Records at the CHEO virology laboratory were reviewed for all patients included in the study, to verify if testing was done and the results of testing.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115c7PCF]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the patient is persistently anemic despite iron supplementation?

If the mean corpuscular volume is low, consider workup for underlying thalassemia trait or iron deficiency with the latter being common in the setting of heavy menses. Iron replacement is not always straightforward; using oral replacement every other day may be equally effective as daily administration. Resorting to IV iron may be important especially if oral replacement does not correct iron status and/or there are signs of a chronic inflammatory disease. If the mean corpuscular volume is high, bone marrow failure must be considered. There could also be pernicious anemia secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency or an autoimmune hemolytic anemia, such as Evans syndrome. Another possibility is microangiopathic anemia with thrombocytopenia, whether in the form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic uremic syndrome. In these cases, there would likely be increased reticulocytosis. While individually each of these conditions is rare, having one of many rare conditions would not be as surprising.

If heavy menstrual bleeding persists, a progesterone-based approach is superior to an estrogen-based approach in women with ITP as the former raises the platelet count. While estrogen-based therapies are more commonly used in general practice for heavy menstrual bleeding, they might worsen ITP. In contrast, progestational agents have previously been tried as treatment in ITP with good effect. Progesterone may be administered orally at a dose of 5–10 mg daily or medroxyprogresterone acetate (Depo-Provera) can be given intramuscularly once every 3 months but the latter may result in intermittent vaginal bleeding.

### High mean corpuscular volume predicts poor outcome for patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma [^1128TDrG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

In our prospective database containing 544 patients with resectable esophageal cancer, 314 patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction had data on preoperative hematologic parameters and were eligible for further investigation. Their mean age at time of surgery was 63.8 years (range, 30.7–89.5 years). The study included 255 male patients (81.2%). Of the 157 patients (50%) who underwent neoadjuvant treatment, 95 received regimen A, 51 received regimen B, and 11 received regimen C. The majority of the patients (n = 132, 43%) had clinical stage 3 disease. Of the patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment, 13 (8.3%) showed a complete response (CR).

The clinicopathologic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median of preoperative MCV was 91.2 fl (range, 63.5–108.2 fl). When the patients were stratified into quintiles for preoperative MCV levels, 64 patients were categorized as very low (range, 63.5–84.1 fl) and medium (range, 89.3–92.8 fl), and 62 patients were classified as low (range, 84.1–89.3 fl), high (range, 92.8–97.8 fl), and very high (range, 97.8–108 fl).

### Prognosis of myelodysplasic patients: non-parametric multiple regression analysis of populations stratified by mean corpuscular volume and marrow myeloblast number [^115FASjG]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic (MDS) patients at diagnosis (n = 162) were analysed by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). The two intermediate groups were not significantly different. The IPSS was of limited value in predicting survival of MDS patients after preliminary separation into subgroups with < 5%, or ≥ 5%, myeloblasts. Cox's proportional hazards analysis of these subgroups enabled discrimination of highly significant prognostic groups. In both subgroups, longer survival was associated with macrocytosis. Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and marrow myeloblast number were used to define four groups with prognostic significance similar to the IPSS. A low-risk group was described by macrocytosis associated with < 5% myeloblasts and high risk was related to blast counts ≥ 5% and MCV < 100 fl. Further analysis defined factors identifying very high-risk patients and those with benign disease, together with many intermediate survival patterns. Results were consistent in two time-separated patient groups.

### Management of sickle cell disease: summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^111whY3h]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

Objective

To support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

Evidence Review

Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

Findings

Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.

### Is bone marrow examination always necessary to establish the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes? A proposed non-invasive diagnostic model [^114uyxr6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2018). Low credibility.

A non-invasive myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) diagnostic model would allow for care while avoiding invasive bone marrow examinations (BME). BME-established MDS patients were compared to non-MDS (BME-excluded) patients. Variables (gender, age, hemoglobin (Hb), mean red blood cell corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet (PLT), and white blood cell (WBC)) were combined with multivariate logistic regression; a probability score (Y) was calculated. MDS (n = 48) and non-MDS (n = 63) patients were used to establish the model. The ROC was drawn, giving an AUC of 0.748 (95% CI: 0.656–0.84). Two cutoff values were used for Y. Y ≥ 0.633: high likelihood (positive predictive value (PPV) = 85%); Y ≤ 0.288: low likelihood (negative predictive value (NPV) = 81%) of MDS. The first group is defined as probable MDS (pMDS); the second, probably not MDS (pnMDS). The model was validated with 40 additional patients (20 with and 20 without MDS). Using clinical and lab data, we could diagnose or exclude MDS in about half of the patients, avoiding BME. Future work will use larger cohorts of patients to improve and further validate the model.

Table 3 indicates that the median diastolic blood pressure and urea levels were significantly higher in the conservative treatment group compared with the RRT group. The chi square test also revealed that more RRT patients tested positive for protein in urine than the conservative treatment group (93.1% vs. 92.0%, p < 0.001). However, the conservative treatment group compared to the RRT group tested positive for blood in urine (56.4% vs. 50.0%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in SBP, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, MCV, MCH, sodium, potassium, triglycerides, LDL-c, HDL-c, VLDL-c, cholesterol, creatinine levels and eGFR between the two groups.

### Mean corpuscular volume and mortality in patients with CKD [^113WL5Sj]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mean corpuscular volume is the measure of the average size of the circulatory erythrocyte, and it is principally used as an index for the differential diagnosis of anemia. Recently, mean corpuscular volume has been associated with mortality in many clinical settings. However, the association of mean corpuscular volume with mortality in patients with CKD has not been fully addressed.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of 1439 patients with stages 3–5 CKD and baseline mean corpuscular volume values from 2004 to 2012 in a medical center. The study cohort was divided into the high-mean corpuscular volume group and the low-mean corpuscular volume group by the median value (90.8 fl) of mean corpuscular volume. The baseline patient information included demographic data, laboratory parameters, medications, and comorbid conditions. The independent association of mean corpuscular volume with mortality was examined using multivariate Cox regression analysis.

Results

Of the 1439 participants, 234 patients (16.2%) died during a median follow-up of 1.9 years (interquartile range, 1.1–3.8 years). The crude overall mortality rate was significantly higher in the high-mean corpuscular volume group (high-mean corpuscular volume group, 22.7%; low-mean corpuscular volume group, 9.7%; P < 0.001). In the fully adjusted models, the high-mean corpuscular volume group was associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.62 to 2.96; P < 0.001), cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio, 3.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.80 to 7.06; P < 0.001), and infection-related mortality (hazard ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.41 to 3.49; P = 0.001) compared with the low-mean corpuscular volume group.

Conclusions

In patients with stages 3–5 CKD, mean corpuscular volume was associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, and infection-associated mortality, independent of other factors. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms warrant additional investigation.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^113rxHok]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing mortality in restrictive and liberal haemoglobin thresholds for red cell transfusion: an overview of systematic reviews [^117ADo9P]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This overview of reviews evaluating the effect on mortality of restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies identified 19 systematic reviews and 33 meta-analyses that used data from 53 RCTs. Of the 33 meta-analyses, one was graded as high quality, 15 were moderate, and 17 were low. The 16 meta-analyses of mortality graded as high to moderate quality demonstrate no difference in mortality between these two transfusion strategies.

Australian guidelines state that red cell transfusion should not be dictated solely by haemoglobin concentration; rather, the decision should also be based on a patient's clinical signs and symptoms, the availability of other therapies for the treatment of anaemia, and the presence of risk factors for haemorrhage. Similarly, the AABB Clinical Practice Guidelines highlight it is a good practice to individualise transfusion decisions taking into account the overall clinical context, haemoglobin decline, symptoms, volume status, patient preferences, and alternative therapies. Therefore, important questions for future research include examining whether haemoglobin concentration is a good indicator of tissue oxygen needs and looking at other physiological parameters to assess whether these would be more indicative of tissue oxygenation and perfusion.

Should future systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing transfusion thresholds be updated, we recommend they address the variations between studies in haemoglobin thresholds selected for transfusion, the gap in haemoglobin thresholds between restrictive and liberal groups both planned and actual, the different timing of randomisation, and the lack of comparable transfusion dosing regimens.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^117St36s]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^115ypWsB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

I. Critically ill patients

Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia, starting at a threshold of no greater than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l).
Once insulin therapy has been started, a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10.0 mmol/l) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients.
Intravenous insulin infusions are the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glycemic control in critically ill patients.
Validated insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, and with low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, are recommended.
With IV insulin therapy, frequent glucose monitoring is essential to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemia and to achieve optimal glucose control.

II. Noncritically ill patients

For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, the premeal BG target should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunction with random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), provided these targets can be safely achieved.
More stringent targets may be appropriate in stable patients with previous tight glycemic control.
Less stringent targets may be appropriate in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities.
Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin, with basal, nutritional, and correction components, is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control.
Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is discouraged.
Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents are not appropriate in most hospitalized patients who require therapy for hyperglycemia.
Clinical judgment and ongoing assessment of clinical status must be incorporated into day-to-day decisions regarding treatment of hyperglycemia.

III. Safety issues

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety concerns.
Education of hospital personnel is essential in engaging the support of those involved in the care of inpatients with hyperglycemia.
Caution is required in interpreting results of POC glucose meters in patients with anemia, polycythemia, hypoperfusion, or use of some medications.
Buy-in and financial support from hospital administration are required for promoting a rational systems approach to inpatient glycemic management.

IV. Cost

Appropriate inpatient management of hyperglycemia is cost-effective.

V. Discharge planning

Preparation for transition to the outpatient setting should begin at the time of hospital admission.
Discharge planning, patient education, and clear communication with outpatient providers are critical for ensuring a safe and successful transition to outpatient glycemic management.

VI. Needed research

A selected number of research questions and topics for guiding the management of inpatient hyperglycemia in various hospital settings are proposed.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^115ZwBpm]. KDIGO (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — red cell transfusion for acute stabilization is indicated in acute hemorrhage with thresholds including estimated blood loss > 30–40% of blood volume (1500–2000 ml) with symptoms of severe blood loss and estimated blood loss < 25–30% blood volume with no evidence of uncontrolled hemorrhage if hypovolemia recurs despite colloid/crystalloid resuscitation. In acute coronary syndrome, studies have reached differing conclusions and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and American College of Chest Physicians guidelines do not make any recommendations concerning transfusion; in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, 30-day adverse cardiovascular risk was higher with Hb below 11 g/dl (110 g/l) than with Hb ≥ 11 g/dl (≥ 110 g/l). In heart failure, limited data are available, correction of anemia is not an evidence-based therapy per cited guidelines, and general indications for red cell transfusion apply with careful attention to volume status.

### Interventions to prevent iatrogenic anemia: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review [^111nTXwD]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis

We converted the volume of blood loss to milliliters per patient per day when possible, and decline in hemoglobin to grams per liter per day. Measures reported for the entire length of stay were converted to daily values by dividing the total by the average length of stay, and group totals were converted to patient-level measures by dividing by the total by the number of patients in the group.

Effect size rating was determined a priori based on clinical significance as minimal, 0 to < 10%, moderate, 10 to 30%, and substantial, more than 30%, for all outcomes except the decline in hemoglobin. For the decline in hemoglobin, a relative effect greater than 20% was considered substantial. We synthesized evidence by intervention type and outcome. We rated the body of evidence as high, moderate, suggestive, or insufficient based on the number of studies, the study ratings, and the magnitude of the effect size (Additional file 3) and as described by Christenson et al. In brief, a high level of evidence requires three or more good quality studies with substantial effects; moderate evidence requires two good quality studies with substantial effects or at least three good quality studies with moderate effects; and suggestive evidence requires one good study with substantial effect, two good studies with moderate effects, or at least three fair studies with moderate effects. There must be at least moderate evidence to support the effectiveness of a laboratory practice. (Insufficient evidence does not rule out the potential value of the practice. Frequently, it indicates a need for additional evidence assessing the effect of the practice.) We also considered the consistency of the effect across studies in rating the strength of the evidence.

Meta-analytic estimates were calculated for outcomes for which we had evidence from at least three independent studies with the same type of intervention and outcome. We used the methods of Hedges and Vevea. Fixed effects modeling was used if the studies were homogeneous and random effects modeling if they were heterogeneous, based on the I 2 test for heterogeneity.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^114jZJTV]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^116S1vvd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia in chronic kidney disease hemoglobin target — measuring performance: In general, a Hb target range suggests that ESA dose adjustment decisions are made by comparing the patient's achieved Hb with the selected Hb target, and the result of a single sampling in a single patient cannot be expected to lie within a narrow Hb target range (eg, Hb of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL) or to equal a discrete point Hb target (eg, Hb of either 11.0, 11.5, or 12.0 g/dL). However, mean or median Hb levels of a group of patients or mean Hb levels of a single patient repeated over time would be expected to lie within a Hb target range or to approximate a discrete Hb target, and measures of clinical performance, to be clinically useful, must account for a high degree of within-patient and between-patient variability.

### Red blood cell indices and development of hospital-acquired anemia during acute myocardial infarction [^114wp8DX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired anemia (HAA) is common, often develops in the absence of bleeding, and is associated with poor outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is unknown whether red cell distribution width (RDW) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which are routinely available markers of iron deficiency, are associated with development of HAA during AMI. We studied 15,133 patients with AMI without anemia at admission. HAA was defined by nadir hemoglobin levels below age-, gender-, and race-specific thresholds and moderate-severe HAA was defined as nadir hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/dl. We examined the association between low MCV (< 80 fL) and/or increased RDW (> 15%) on patients' initial complete blood cell count and moderate-severe HAA using multivariable modified Poisson regression. Moderate-severe HAA was more common in patients with high RDW and low MCV (45.5%), high RDW and MCV ≥ 80 fL (33.0%), and normal RDW and low MCV (28.0%) than in those with normal RDW and MCV (18.3%, p < 0.001). Compared to patients with normal RDW and MCV, those with increased RDW and low MCV (relative risk 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 1.87), increased RDW and MCV ≥ 80 fL (relative risk 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.42), or normal RDW and low MCV (relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.65) were independently more likely to develop moderate-severe HAA. In conclusion, increased RDW and low MCV were independent predictors of moderate-severe HAA.

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) — Meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused and the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood for major cardiac, orthopedic, thoracic, or liver surgery (Category A1‑B evidence). Additional meta-analyses of RCTs indicate that ANH combined with intraoperative red blood cell recovery compared with intraoperative red blood cell recovery alone is effective in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused (Category A1‑B evidence) and is equivocal regarding the number of patients transfused with allogeneic blood (Category A1‑E evidence). Consider ANH to reduce allogeneic blood transfusion in patients at high risk for excessive bleeding (e.g., major cardiac, orthopedic, thoracic, or liver surgery), if possible, noting that ANH may not be possible due to pre‑existing patient factors such as small blood volume, low hemoglobin, or presence of ischemic disease.

Table 2
95% range for haematocrit during pregnancy (taken from Bain, 2015)

Dehydration should be avoided in all patients during labour and the third stage of labour should be actively managed. Thromboembolic deterrent (TED) stockings are advisable during labour and if immobile during the postpartum period. LMWH and aspirin should be stopped prior to elective caesarean section or once spontaneous labour has begun, as per local guidelines.

Low molecular weight heparin should be restarted at the earliest opportunity post‐partum provided there is no significant bleeding. The dose of LMWH should be once daily and should be continued for 6 weeks post‐partum. Aspirin should be continued throughout the post‐partum period. Breastfeeding is safe with both aspirin and LMWH, and permissible with interferon. The Hct should be monitored in the post‐partum period and maintained at less than 0.45. Attention should be paid to the platelet count, as a rebound thrombocytosis may develop, necessitating the introduction of cytoreductive therapy.

There is no evidence regarding the management of PV during fertility treatment. Ovarian hyperstimulation is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and therefore cytoreductive therapy (with interferon) and thromboprophylaxis with LMWH should be considered.

Recommendations: pregnancy management

There should be close collaborative management between obstetrician and haematologist to formulate an individualised plan for the pregnancy, delivery and postpartum period based on the previous history of thrombosis, haemorrhage and previous pregnancies. (GRADE 1C)
Avoid cytoreductive therapy (such as hydroxycarbamide and anagrelide) for a minimum of 3 months in male and female patients prior to planned conception and in the first trimester. Commence interferon if cytoreduction is required. (GRADE 1C)
Maintain Hct within the normal range for gestation. (Grade 1C)
Consider low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and/or interferon in addition to aspirin for high risk pregnancies (and for 6 weeks postpartum), based on individual patient discussion. (GRADE 1C)
Commence prophylactic dose LMWH for 6 weeks postpartum for standard risk pregnancies. (GRADE 1C)
Assess growth scans regularly and mean pulsatile index with uterine Doppler scans at 20 weeks. Consider escalation of treatment to include LMWH and interferon if scans are abnormal. (GRADE 1C)
The risk of continuing interferon whilst breastfeeding is permissible and should be individually considered. There are no contraindications to breastfeeding whilst taking aspirin and LMWH. (GRADE 1C)

Regarding therapeutic procedures for aplastic anemia, more specifically with respect to blood transfusion, BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider using a restrictive transfusion strategy (hemoglobin 70–80 g/L; 80 g/L for patients with CVD) in stable hospitalized patients. Consider adopting individual transfusion plans in outpatients depending on symptoms and comorbidities in line with the limited data in myelodysplastic syndrome.
