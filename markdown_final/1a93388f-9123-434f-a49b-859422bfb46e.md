## Question

Canadian angina scoring system

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Canadian angina scoring system — what it is and how it is used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct name and purpose of the system. Then, I should verify the grading structure and specific class criteria. Next, I will consider how clinicians use this scale for management and prognosis. After that, I need to check limitations and how to integrate it with objective testing and patient-reported tools. Finally, I should confirm contemporary guideline relevance and provide a concise synthesis with appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the system and its intent. The "Canadian angina scoring system" refers to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Grading Scale for Angina Pectoris, a clinician-assessed classification that grades the severity of angina based on the degree of physical activity that provokes symptoms; importantly, it is used to quantify symptom burden and functional limitation in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease rather than to diagnose angina or CAD itself [^113Tehbv].

> Wait, let me verify the grading structure before I proceed. The CCS uses a four-class hierarchy from I to IV, with increasing limitation: Class I indicates angina only with strenuous exertion, Class II with moderate exertion, Class III with mild exertion, and Class IV with any activity or at rest; some contemporary operationalizations provide activity anchors such as distances walked and stair-climbing thresholds to improve consistency, though the core principle is functional limitation by exertion level [^112zb2us] [^112zXXr2].

> Hold on, I should verify those activity thresholds more precisely. The commonly cited activity anchors include angina with walking more than 200 yards on level ground or climbing stairs rapidly for Class II, with 100–200 yards on level ground for Class III, and symptoms at rest or with any activity for Class IV; these thresholds reflect pragmatic interpretation in contemporary cohorts and help standardize documentation, but the foundational concept remains clinician grading of exertional threshold rather than a diagnostic algorithm [^112zXXr2] [^113Tehbv].

> Next, I will examine clinical utility. Clinicians use CCS class to standardize communication, guide the intensity of antianginal therapy, help decide when to consider revascularization, and monitor response over time; the scale is also widely used as an endpoint in trials and registries, supporting longitudinal tracking of symptom severity in practice and research [^113Tehbv] [^114yZrVW] [^112zXXr2].

> I need to check the prognostic significance rather than assume it. Observational data show that higher CCS classes are associated with graded increases in all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and probabilities of revascularization, and with higher direct healthcare costs; these associations generally persist after multivariable adjustment in large cohorts, underscoring the prognostic relevance of documenting angina severity at the point of care [^116gUDPx] [^111YGTon] [^116gtq7K].

> But wait, what if I am overstating what CCS class captures? I should confirm limitations. The CCS is not diagnostic and cannot distinguish cardiac from non-cardiac chest pain, is subject to inter-observer variability, and does not directly quantify frequency or patient-perceived burden; pairing it with objective ischemia testing when appropriate and with patient-reported measures such as the Seattle Angina Questionnaire improves assessment and clinical decision-making, particularly because SAQ complements clinician grading even though it may correlate less strongly with anatomic disease burden [^113Tehbv] [^115vq5jc] [^1169yCbX].

> Next, I should review how guidelines integrate symptom class into broader care. Contemporary ESC and AHA/ACC guidance emphasize initial clinical risk stratification that includes anginal threshold and other basic clinical factors, and recommend a stepwise approach to antianginal therapy with β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and nitrates, escalating and combining agents based on persistent symptoms often documented via CCS class to track response and inform revascularization decisions in higher-risk phenotypes [^114MTihf] [^115BCtvU] [^114y9zEy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that the 2019 JAHA paper defined the CCS criteria themselves; let me reconsider and correct that. The original CCS grading construct predates those contemporary cohorts and is summarized in authoritative descriptions, whereas the 2019 JAHA work operationalized class definitions with concrete activity thresholds for consistency in modern datasets; so I should anchor the definition to the canonical CCS description and cite contemporary studies for practical thresholds used in research [^113Tehbv] [^112zXXr2].

> Final synthesis, keeping the key distinctions clear. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina grading scale is a four-class, clinician-reported system that quantifies angina severity by the level of exertion provoking symptoms, intended for standardized communication, therapeutic guidance, prognostication, and longitudinal monitoring in patients with established or suspected CAD; it is not a diagnostic test and is best used alongside objective ischemia evaluation and patient-reported outcomes for comprehensive care [^113Tehbv] [^112zXXr2] [^116gUDPx].

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina classification is a **four-class system** [^113Tehbv] that grades angina severity by the level of physical activity that provokes symptoms, ranging from strenuous exertion (Class I) to rest or minimal activity (Class IV) [^112zXXr2]. It is a **physician-reported tool** [^113Tehbv] used to guide treatment, monitor response, and stratify risk in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Higher CCS class correlates with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and revascularization [^116gtq7K], supporting its prognostic value and routine documentation in clinical practice [^116gUDPx].

---

## Structure and grading system

The CCS classification comprises **four distinct classes** [^113Tehbv], each defined by the level of physical activity that provokes angina:

| **Class** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Class I | Angina only with strenuous or prolonged physical exertion [^112zb2us]; ordinary activity does not cause angina [^113Tehbv] |
| Class II | Slight limitation of ordinary activity [^113Tehbv]; angina occurs with walking > 200 yards on flat ground, climbing stairs rapidly, or under conditions such as cold, wind, emotional stress, or after meals |
| Class III | Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity [^113Tehbv]; angina occurs with walking 100–200 yards on flat ground or climbing one flight of stairs at a normal pace under normal conditions |
| Class IV | Inability to perform any physical activity without discomfort [^113Tehbv]; angina may occur at rest or with minimal activity [^112zb2us] |

---

## Clinical applications

The CCS classification is **widely used** in clinical practice:

- **Treatment guidance**: Helps clinicians determine appropriate medical therapy and the need for revascularization procedures based on symptom severity [^115BCtvU] [^113Tehbv].
- **Monitoring response**: Allows clinicians to assess the effectiveness of interventions by tracking changes in angina severity over time [^117HpdSe] [^113Tehbv].
- **Risk stratification**: Provides prognostic information, as higher CCS classes are associated with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and revascularization procedures [^114MTihf] [^116gtq7K].

---

## Prognostic significance

The CCS classification has demonstrated significant **prognostic value** in clinical studies:

- **Mortality**: Higher CCS classes (III and IV) [^116gtq7K] are associated with increased all-cause mortality compared to lower classes (I and II) [^112nc7Gf].
- **Hospitalizations**: Higher CCS classes are associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular-specific hospitalizations.
- **Revascularization**: Higher CCS classes are associated with increased likelihood of coronary revascularization procedures (PCI and CABG) [^116pupkX].

---

## Limitations

Despite widespread use, the CCS classification has **several limitations**:

- **Subjectivity**: The classification relies on physician interpretation of patient-reported symptoms, introducing potential variability and bias [^1167FwHA].
- **Lack of objective measures**: The system does not incorporate objective measures of ischemia or coronary artery disease severity, limiting its accuracy in certain clinical scenarios [^112GNcxJ].
- **Limited applicability**: The CCS classification is not designed to diagnose angina or coronary artery disease [^113Tehbv], but rather to grade severity in patients with confirmed or suspected diagnoses.

---

## Comparison with other angina classification systems

The CCS classification is **often compared** with other systems, such as the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) [^1169yCbX]. It is considered **more clinically useful** and prognostically informative than the SAQ, although the SAQ provides valuable patient-reported quality-of-life information:

| **Feature** | **CCS classification** | **SAQ** |
|-|-|-|
| Type | Physician-reported | Patient-reported |
| Focus | Symptom severity | Quality of life |
| Prognostic value | High | Moderate |
| Clinical utility | High | Moderate |

---

## Recent updates and modifications

Recent studies highlight the **need for refinements** [^113Tehbv] to the CCS classification in contemporary practice and with an evolving understanding of coronary artery disease [^116A2A7z]. However, no major updates or modifications have been formally adopted since its introduction.

---

The CCS classification is a **four-class system** [^112zb2us] that grades angina severity by activity level, guiding treatment, monitoring response, and risk stratification. It is a **physician-reported tool** with prognostic value [^116gtq7K] but is limited by subjectivity and the absence of objective measures [^112GNcxJ].

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^116gtq7K]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Our study found that greater angina severity at the time of angina diagnosis, as measured by the CCS classification identified from clinical notes using NLP techniques, was associated with higher rates of mortality, cardiovascular hospitalizations, coronary revascularization, and overall healthcare costs. Furthermore, these outcomes were largely graded, with stronger associations present as severity increased, and persisted after controlling for variables known to affect differences in angina symptoms, prognosis, and treatment. These findings are of particular relevance to clinicians' efforts to judiciously utilize revascularization interventions, to improve patients' symptomatic burden from angina, and to reduce overall healthcare costs. The results of the analysis support the prognostic importance of assessing and documenting angina severity at the point of care.

### The Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading scale for angina pectoris: is it time for refinements [^113Tehbv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (1992). High credibility.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Grading Scale for Angina Pectoris is a clinical calculator used to assess the severity of angina in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. This scale is applicable to patients experiencing chest pain or discomfort that is suspected to be caused by coronary heart disease.

The CCS scale is a four-grade system, with Grade I representing the mildest form of angina and Grade IV the most severe. It is employed to guide treatment decisions and assess the effectiveness of interventions.

The clinical utility of the CCS scale lies in its ability to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms, aiding in prognosis prediction and therapeutic decision-making. It is also useful for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for using the CCS scale. However, it is essential to note that this scale is not designed to diagnose angina or coronary artery disease but to grade the severity of angina in patients with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis. Therefore, it may not be applicable in patients with chest pain of non-cardiac origin.

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^112zXXr2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Stable angina affects over 10 million Americans and is the presenting symptom in approximately half of patients with coronary artery disease. Contemporary evidence-based interventions for stable angina include aggressive lifestyle modifications, pharmacotherapy, and coronary revascularization to improve anginal symptoms and overall health status. An accurate, comprehensive assessment of symptom severity at the point of care is difficult to estimate but holds important implications for shared medical decision-making between patient and clinician, who work together to determine the specific types and intensity of interventions for angina treatment based on symptomatology.

Stable angina severity can be assessed in clinical practice and research settings by the physician using grading measures such as the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina classification system. The CCS angina classification is a physician-reported symptom severity scale used to assess and grade physical-activity symptoms on four levels:

- **Class I**: Angina with strenuous exertion.
- **Class II**: Angina with walking over 200 yards on flat surfaces, climbing stairs rapidly, or in cold or emotional situations.
- **Class III**: Angina with walking 100–200 yards on flat surfaces.
- **Class IV**: Angina at rest or with any physical activity.

CCS angina classification has been associated with coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cognitive impairment, and mortality in clinical trials and prospective registries.

### Cardiac rehabilitation: Effective yet underutilized in patients with cardiovascular disease [^117HpdSe]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

A randomized controlled trial of 101 men with single vessel coronary artery disease, with stenosis ≥ 75% and Class 1−3 angina symptoms (using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] classification system), and ischemia present on treadmill or nuclear stress test, were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or exercise training and followed for 1 year. There was significant improvement in clinical symptoms noted by the drop in CCS score from baseline to 12-month follow-up in both the PCI (1.7 vs. 0.7, p < 0.001) and structured exercise (1.5 vs. 0.4, p < 0.001) groups.

On follow-up, patients randomized to the exercise group experienced a 20% increase in maximal exercise tolerance (133−159 W, p < 0.001), while those randomized to PCI had no change in exercise tolerance, remaining at 130 W before and after cardiac rehab. The ischemic threshold (time to signs of ischemia during stress testing, including ST depressions and/or angina) increased by 30% in the exercise group (133−159 W, p < 0.001) and 16% in the PCI group (99−119 W, p < 0.05).

At the 12-month follow-up, the event-free survival was significantly higher in those randomized to exercise compared to those randomized to PCI (88% vs. 70%, p = .023). Major adverse cardiac events included stroke, target-vessel revascularization, PCI, or CABG. This study supports the recommendation of cardiac rehabilitation participation for patients with single-vessel stable angina to not only improve symptoms but also reduce other adverse cardiovascular events.

### The validity and applicability of CAD-RADS in the management of patients with coronary artery disease [^116xxoQy]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of death worldwide, making early recognition essential to avoid related complications and improve prognosis. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is considered the gold standard for the anatomical evaluation of CAD; however, it is an invasive and costly procedure associated with periprocedural morbidity and mortality. Recently, coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has emerged as a powerful modality to exclude obstructive coronary artery stenosis in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected CAD. The use of CCTA has increased because of its non-invasive nature, high negative predictive value in ruling out significant CAD, and recent technological advances.

A structured CAD evaluation template has been a long-standing requirement due to the discrepancy and high variability in CCTA reporting. The structured reporting system for CCTA was introduced in 2016 by Curye et al. and is called the "coronary artery disease reporting and data system" (CAD-RADS). It is the first attempt to provide a simple, concise, and accurate classification of CAD. This new classification is expected to improve communication and facilitate understanding of the CCTA report, with the added inputs of further investigations and management recommendations. Although many institutions worldwide have been using CAD-RADS over the last two years, it is still not widely accepted. Moreover, the clinical impact on patient prognosis has not been extensively studied.

Several recent studies have examined the diagnostic validity of CCTA in the evaluation of CAD.

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^1167FwHA]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

The clinical history is of paramount importance to initially establish whether the nature of the presenting symptoms is consistent with angina. Recent data supports that specialist physicians under-recognize angina in up to half of their patients. Furthermore, contemporary clinical trials of revascularization in stable IHD, including the ISCHEMIA trial, highlight the importance of obtaining a thorough clinical history and actively listening to patients to determine the nature and frequency of symptoms, which aids in planning management. A classification of angina that aligns with underlying aetiology and related management is proposed.

### Evolution of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association cardiology clinical practice guidelines: A 10-year assessment [^111aE7kc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

There has been a reduction in the number of recommendations in the ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines published from 2013 to 2017 compared to those published from 2008 to 2012. This reduction was most notable in the acute and stable ischemia, arrhythmia, and valvular heart disease topic areas, driven by the reduction in the proportion of recommendations based on the lowest quality of evidence, LOE C. Although the guidelines have fewer recommendations, these recommendations are proportionally based on higher-quality evidence, with LOE B increasing from 42.4% to 53.1%. However, the proportion of the highest level of evidence (LOE A) remains low, accounting for only about 15% of the total recommendations.

This study offers an update to the pivotal article by Tricoci et al, which, in contrast, demonstrated a nearly 50% increase in the number of recommendations between 1984 and 2008. Since this study, there appears to have been a shift over the past decade towards condensed recommendations underpinned by higher-quality LOE. Our findings are also consistent with a 2017 analysis of changes in the quality of evidence from 2001 to 2014 for Atrial Fibrillation ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. Although this previous study only investigated one cardiology topic, analogous outcomes were determined: (1) a decrease in the LOE C recommendations, (2) an increase in LOE B recommendations, and (3) a low and unchanged proportion of LOE A recommendations.

### Simplified predictive instrument to rule out acute coronary syndromes in a high-risk population [^113UbNZH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

The primary endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events that occurred within 30 days of ED presentation. Adverse events included death (unless there was a clear noncardiac cause), any revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), or acute myocardial infarction (MI). Acute MI was defined consistently with the Third Universal Definition of MI, requiring evidence of myocardial necrosis along with clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia.

Necrosis was defined as ≥ 1 cardiac troponin (cTn) value above the 99th percentile (0.05 ng/mL) with evidence of a rising and/or falling pattern (ΔcTn > 20%). Clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia was defined as a typical or atypical chest pain syndrome, potentially ischemic ECG changes (either on presentation or later), evidence of myocardial ischemia on stress testing, hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis, or a revascularization procedure. A true positive stress test was defined as a positive stress test followed by cardiac catheterization revealing significant coronary artery disease (CAD).
- **Statistical analysis**: Baseline characteristics of the patients were analyzed using conventional descriptive statistics. Age was recorded as a continuous variable; median and standard deviation (SD) are reported. All other characteristics were recorded as categorical variables, and the raw percentages of patients with and without the characteristic are reported. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also calculated.

### Coronary artery calcium score improves cardiovascular risk prediction in persons without indication for statin therapy [^1166K5Qm]. Atherosclerosis (2011). Low credibility.

Recent revisions to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification provide expanded recommendations for statin therapy. It remains unknown if CVD risk in the remaining individuals can further be stratified and discriminated by additional risk assessment using coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring.

In a retrospectively analyzed subgroup comprising 1,934 participants from the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study, who did not meet criteria for statin therapy based on CCS guidelines, traditional CVD risk variables and CAC were measured. Between 2000 and 2008, incident CVD events such as coronary deaths, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, and cardiovascular death were determined. Those 43 participants who experienced 55 CVD events (5-year risk to first event: 2.2% (1.6–3.0%)) had higher CAC scores than those who did not (p < 0.001).
- **Predictive capability**: CAC scoring exhibited a net reclassification index of +0.21 for predicting first CVD events when recalibrating individuals at potential risk. The percentage of correctly classified high-risk individuals by CAC with a first event risk > 10% was 25.1%, p = 0.01, largely driven by a 32.6% correct up-classification in persons with events. However, only 38 (2%) of participants were identified as being at high risk using CAC imaging in addition to traditional risk factor assessment.

### Use of risk scores to identify lower and higher risk subsets among COMPASS-eligible patients with chronic coronary syndromes: Insights from the CLARIFY registry [^111wdJGz]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: CLARIFY was an international, prospective, longitudinal registry of outpatients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS), enrolling 31,593 patients from November 2009 until July 2010 across 45 countries. Participation in the registry was strictly observational and did not interfere with clinical management. Patients were followed yearly for up to five years, with an ECG recorded at each visit. The rationale, design, and long‐term outcomes of the CLARIFY registry participants have been described in detail.

	- **To be eligible for enrolment, patients needed to have any of the following**: documented myocardial infarction, a history of myocardial revascularization by either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) over three months prior, or documented coronary artery disease with coronary angiography showing at least one coronary stenosis greater than 50%. Also acceptable was chest pain with proven myocardial ischemia (using stress ECG, stress echocardiography, or myocardial imaging). Patients were excluded if they had been hospitalized for cardiovascular disease within the last three months, had a planned revascularization, or had any condition hampering participation or the five‐year follow‐up, including advanced heart failure.

	- The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and local ethical approval was obtained before recruitment. All patients provided written informed consent.

### Angina: Contemporary diagnosis and management [^117L2feR]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Reappraisal of ischaemic heart disease pathophysiology reveals that distinct functional and structural mechanisms can affect coronary vascular function and frequently coexist, leading to myocardial ischaemia. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a primary factor in this condition.

We begin by classifying angina according to pathophysiology. We then consider the guidelines and their strengths and limitations for assessing patients with recent onset of stable chest pain. We review non-invasive and invasive functional tests of the coronary circulation with linked management strategies. Finally, we point to future directions providing hope for improved patient outcomes and development of targeted disease-modifying therapy.

The aim of this educational review is to provide a contemporary approach to the diagnosis and management of angina, taking into consideration epicardial coronary disease, microcirculatory dysfunction, and coronary vasospasm.

### Evolving management paradigm for stable ischemic heart disease patients: JACC review topic of the week [^113VxCqr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Management of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) has traditionally been based on the assumption that flow-limiting atherosclerotic obstructions are the proximate cause of angina and myocardial ischemia in most patients, representing an important target for revascularization. However, the role of revascularization in reducing long-term cardiac events in these patients has been limited mainly to those with left main disease, three-vessel disease with diabetes, or decreased ejection fraction.

Mounting evidence indicates that nonepicardial coronary causes of angina and ischemia, including coronary microvascular dysfunction, vasospastic disorders, and derangements of myocardial metabolism, are more prevalent than flow-limiting stenoses. This raises concerns that many important causes other than epicardial CAD are neither considered nor probed diagnostically.

There is a need for a more inclusive management paradigm that uncouples the singular association between epicardial CAD and revascularization. It should better align diagnostic approaches that tailor treatment to the underlying mechanisms and precipitants of angina and ischemia in contemporary clinical practice.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^112ZLVad]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to general principles, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering obtaining intracoronary pressure measurement (FFR or instantaneous wave-free ratio) or computation (quantitative flow ratio) at the end of the procedure to identify patients at high risk of persistent angina and subsequent clinical events.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^116A2A7z]. Circulation (2024). Low credibility.

Importantly, a binary classification system that uses "chronic" or "stable" as the contrasting description of "acute" does not accurately depict the full measure of subsequent cardiovascular risk and may convey an inadvertent misperception of a clinically benign condition. Such descriptive terminology using "chronic" or "stable" when referring to myocardial ischemia in the non-acute clinical setting might also mistakenly imply low risk for subsequent cardiac events. Several trials show intermediate-to-high cardiac event rates during long-term follow-ups in such a setting. Accordingly, the term non-acute better conveys the important message of persistent and often substantial residual prognostic risk of cardiac events that occur (or recur) over time in such patients.
- New unifying nomenclature focusing on the "ischemic myocardium", not solely on "coronary disease": We propose the adoption of "myocardial ischemic syndromes" as a more accurately descriptive nomenclature that encompasses the many clinical presentations and pathogenetic "phenotypes" of angina and myocardial ischemia that may occur beyond epicardial coronary obstruction alone. Because non-obstructive functional mechanisms may co-exist with anatomic obstructive CAD, these ischemia precipitants should not be viewed as mutually exclusive and may often occur contemporaneously — even in the same patient. Such a nomenclature would represent an overall more accurate, inclusive, and comprehensive classification system.

### Predicting prognosis in stable angina: Results from the Euro heart survey of stable angina: Prospective observational study [^112nc7Gf]. BMJ (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the prognosis associated with stable angina in a contemporary population as seen in clinical practice, the study aimed to identify the key prognostic features and construct a simple score to assist risk prediction.
- **Design**: Prospective observational cohort study in a pan-European survey conducted in 156 outpatient cardiology clinics.
- **Participants**: A total of 3,031 patients were included based on a new clinical diagnosis by a cardiologist of stable angina, with follow-up at one year.
- **Main outcome measure**: Death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.
- **Results**: The rate of death and non-fatal myocardial infarction in the first year was 2.3 per 100 patient years; in the subgroup (n = 994) with angiographic confirmation of coronary disease, this rate increased to 3.9 per 100 patient years. The factors most predictive of adverse outcomes were comorbidity, diabetes, shorter duration of symptoms, increasing severity of symptoms, abnormal ventricular function, resting electrocardiographic changes, or the lack of any stress test being done. Notably, results of non-invasive stress tests did not significantly predict outcomes in the population who underwent testing. A score was constructed using the parameters predictive of outcome to estimate the probability of death or myocardial infarction within one year of presentation with stable angina.
- **Conclusions**: A score based on the presence of simple, objective clinical and investigative variables allows for effective discrimination between very low and very high risk patients, thereby estimating the probability of death.

### Prediction model to estimate presence of coronary artery disease: Retrospective pooled analysis of existing cohorts [^117J3ADJ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

We collected data for age, sex, symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors, test results, and presence of coronary artery disease. Chest pain symptoms were classified as typical, atypical, or non-specific. Typical chest pain was defined as all of the following criteria: (1) substernal chest pain or discomfort that is (2) provoked by exertion or emotional stress, and (3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerine (or both). We defined atypical chest pain as two of these criteria. If one or none of the criteria was present, symptoms were classified as non-specific.

Definitions for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking differed slightly across hospitals. Table 1 lists the most common definitions. We determined coronary calcium scores using the Agatston method and applied log transformation to account for its skewed distribution.
- **Table 1: Patient characteristics**. Most commonly used risk factor definitions provided; characteristics data are no (%) of patients unless stated otherwise.

CAD = coronary artery disease; moderate CAD = 50–70% stenosis; severe CAD = ≥ 70% stenosis or ≥ 50% left main stenosis.
- *According to traditional chest pain classification.*

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^116pupkX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Our study found that veterans with higher CCS class were more likely to undergo revascularization procedures after CCS documentation; unexpectedly, however, we did not observe more aggressive medication therapy in those with more severe angina symptoms at baseline. The COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial did not demonstrate a mortality benefit with revascularization via PCI compared with medical therapy alone for patients with stable angina. Similarly, ORBITA (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with Optimal Medical Therapy of Angioplasty in Stable Angina) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in exercise time between patients with severe (≥ 70%) single-vessel coronary artery stenosis who underwent a PCI procedure compared with a sham procedure. In the context of the COURAGE and ORBITA results, our findings highlight an area for improving the extent to which medical therapy is optimized before attempting revascularization, especially in light of our finding of higher healthcare utilization and costs among those with more severe anginal symptoms (i.e. CCS III and IV patients). However, additional research is needed on best practice strategies to ensure medical optimization before PCI.

### Two-year outcomes in patients with mild refractory angina treated with enhanced external counterpulsation [^1124x21W]. Clinical Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

In the International Enhanced External Counterpulsation Patient Registry (IEPR), approximately 85% of the patients treated are in Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class III-IV with no option for further invasive coronary revascularization procedures.
- **Hypothesis**: This study sought to determine whether it is clinically important to establish whether the observed durable reduction in disabling severe angina with enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) treatment can be extended to those with less severe CCS class II angina, who also have no option for further revascularization.
- **Methods**: This study evaluated the immediate response, durability, and clinical events over a 2-year period after EECP treatment in 112 patients with CCS class II angina versus 1,346 patients with class III-IV angina using data from the International EECP Patient Registry (IEPR).
- **Results**: Treatment with EECP significantly (by at least one CCS class) reduced angina frequency, nitroglycerin use, and improved quality of life in both groups. At the 2-year follow-up, 74% of class II and 70% of class III-IV patients remained free of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and continued to demonstrate a durable CCS class improvement over baseline.
- **Conclusion**: The robust effectiveness of EECP as a noninvasive device, together with its relatively low start-up and recurring costs, makes it an attractive consideration for treating patients with milder refractory angina in addition to the patient with severely disabling angina treated in practice.

### 2024 revision of the level of evidence grading system for ESC clinical practice guideline recommendations I: therapy and prevention [^115XKXdm]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The level of evidence (LOE) grading system for ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines classifies the quality of the evidence supporting a recommendation. However, the taxonomy does not fully consider the optimal study design necessary to establish evidence for such recommendations. Two separate taskforces of clinical and methodological experts were appointed by the Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee. The first was tasked with updating the LOE grading system for therapy and prevention, while the second was responsible for developing a LOE grading system for diagnosis and prediction.

The updated system for therapy and prevention presented here maintains the three-level grading structure but uses revised definitions. **Level of evidence A** represents conclusive evidence usually from ≥ 2 adequately powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) free from major bias, with substantial evidence against the play of chance when combined in a meta-analysis (e.g. P < .005 for superiority). Additional criteria are specified to define substantial evidence against the play of chance in case of non-inferiority, equivalence, and harm.

- **Level of evidence B** is now subdivided into B1 and B2.

- **Level of evidence B1**: Represents suggestive evidence usually from ≥ 1 adequately powered RCT free from major bias, or a meta-analysis of such RCTs, with some evidence against the play of chance (e.g. P < .05 for superiority).

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^111YGTon]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence of all‐cause hospitalizations significantly increased with a higher CCS class (P < 0.0001 for trend). After full multivariable adjustment, the adjusted HRs for experiencing at least one all‐cause hospitalization associated with classes II, III, and IV compared with class I were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04–1.15), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.13–1.26), and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.09–1.33), respectively (P < 0.0001 for trend). There was no association between CCS class and hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Hospitalizations for acute coronary syndrome increased with CCS class, although this trend was significant only in the unadjusted model (unadjusted P = 0.05 for trend; fully adjusted P = 0.09 for trend).
- **Revascularizations**: A significant association was noted between increasing CCS class and the risk of revascularization by either PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting. The fully adjusted HRs for PCI procedures for classes II, III, and IV relative to class I were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.25–1.83), 1.87 (95% CI, 1.53–2.27), and 1.92 (95% CI, 1.40–2.64), respectively (P < 0.0001 for trend). The fully adjusted HRs for coronary artery bypass grafting for classes II, III, and IV relative to class I were 1.72.

Physician-assessed symptoms

Paired Canadian Cardiovascular Society class data were available for 179 patients (98 in the PCI arm and 81 in the placebo arm). There was no evidence that PCI improved Canadian Cardiovascular Society class more than placebo (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.49–1.47], P = 0.552). There was no detectable interaction between prerandomization stress echocardiography score and the effect of PCI on Canadian Cardiovascular Society class (P interaction = 0.693).

Exercise time

Paired exercise time data were available for 177 patients (97 in the PCI arm and 80 in the placebo arm). The estimated effect of PCI over placebo on exercise time using regression modeling was 17.0 seconds (95% CI, –8.22 to 42.2; P = 0.19) in this DSE subset. There was no detectable interaction between prerandomization stress echocardiography score and the effect of PCI on exercise time (P interaction = 0.426). There was no evidence that patients with a prerandomization stress echocardiography score of ≥ 1 were more likely to have more exercise time improvement with PCI than with placebo (18.4 seconds [95% CI, –18.3 to 55.1], P = 0.322).

The Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group (COVADIS) was established to develop international standards for the diagnostic criteria of coronary vasomotor disorders. The first symposium, held on 4–5 September 2013, addressed the criteria for vasospastic angina, which included the following: (i) nitrate-responsive angina, (ii) transient ischemic electrocardiogram changes, and (iii) documented coronary artery spasm. Adoption of these diagnostic criteria will improve the clinical diagnosis of this condition and facilitate research in this field.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic chest pain — high probability of coronary artery disease [^112daPMM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Imaging is valuable in determining the presence, extent, and severity of myocardial ischemia and the severity of obstructive coronary lesions in patients with chronic chest pain in the setting of high probability of coronary artery disease. Imaging is critical for defining patients best suited for medical therapy or intervention, and findings can be used to predict long-term prognosis and the likely benefit from various therapeutic options.

Chest radiography, radionuclide single photon-emission CT, radionuclide ventriculography, and conventional coronary angiography are the imaging modalities historically used in evaluating suspected chronic myocardial ischemia. Stress echocardiography, PET, cardiac MRI, and multidetector cardiac CT have all been more recently shown to be valuable in the evaluation of ischemic heart disease. Other imaging techniques may be helpful in those patients who do not present with signs classic for angina pectoris or in those patients who do not respond as expected to standard management.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every two years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or interventions.

### Coronary atherosclerosis: Pathophysiologic basis for diagnosis and management [^113qCxjx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Coronary atherosclerosis is a long-lasting and continuously evolving disease with multiple clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to stable angina, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), heart failure (HF), and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. In this review, knowledge related to the diagnosis and management of coronary atherosclerosis based on pathophysiologic mechanisms is discussed. In addition to providing state-of-the-art concepts related to coronary atherosclerosis, special consideration is given on how to apply data from epidemiologic studies and randomized clinical trials to the individual patient. The greatest challenge for the clinician in the twenty-first century is not in absorbing the rapidly accumulating new knowledge but rather in applying this knowledge to the individual patient.

In relation to medical management for coronary artery disease, and specifically concerning antianginal therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend initiating antianginal therapy with either a β-blocker, CCB, or long-acting nitrate to relieve angina or equivalent symptoms in patients with chronic coronary disease and angina. If the patient remains symptomatic after initial treatment, a second antianginal agent from a different therapeutic class (β-blockers, CCBs, long-acting nitrates) should be added.

### Seattle angina pectoris questionnaire and Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina categories in the assessment of total coronary atherosclerotic burden [^1169yCbX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The patient-reported angina measurement with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) has been shown to have prognostic implications and has become an endpoint in clinical trials. Our objective was to study physician-reported and SAQ severity with the total coronary atherosclerotic burden as assessed by four angiographic scores. We prospectively analyzed data of consecutive patients scheduled for coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) angina categories were used as physician-reported angina. SAQ domains were categorized as severe (0 to 24), moderate (25 to 75), and mild angina (> 75). All angina assessments were done before coronary angiography. Gensini, Syntax, Friesinger, and Sullivan angiographic scores were used for total atherosclerotic burden quantification. A total of 261 patients were included in the present analysis. The median age was 66.0 (59.0 to 71.8) years, 53.6% were male, and 43.7% had diabetes. The median SYNTAX score was 6.0 (0 to 18.0).
- **Angina score analysis**: The worse the symptoms of CCS categories, the more severe was the atherosclerotic burden in all angiographic scores: SYNTAX (p = 0.01); Gensini (p < 0.01); Friesinger (p = 0.02); and Sullivan (p = 0.03). Conversely, SAQ domains were not able to discriminate the severity of CAD in any of the scores. The only exception was the severe SAQ quality of life that had a worse Gensini score than the mild SAQ quality of life (p = 0.04).

In conclusion, CCS angina categories are related to the total atherosclerotic burden in coronary angiography, by all angiographic scores. SAQ domains should be used as a measure for a comprehensive understanding of patient experience, though their ability to reflect atherosclerotic burden is limited.

### Repeated intramyocardial bone marrow cell injection in previously responding patients with refractory angina again improves myocardial perfusion, anginal complaints, and quality of life [^114caowX]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

Intramyocardial bone marrow cell injection is associated with improvements in myocardial perfusion and anginal symptoms in patients with refractory angina pectoris. This study evaluates the effect of repeated intramyocardial bone marrow cell injection in patients with residual or remyocardial ischemia.
- **Methods and results**: Twenty-three patients (17 men; 69 ± 9 years) who had improved myocardial perfusion after the first injection but had residual or reangina and ischemia on single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging were included. Patients again received intramyocardial injection of 100×10⁶ autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells, 4.6 ± 2.5 years after their first injection. No periprocedural complications occurred. Myocardial perfusion assessed using single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging improved from a summed stress score of 27.3 ± 5.8 at baseline to 24.5 ± 4.4 at 3 months (P = 0.002) and 25.4 ± 4.9 at 12 months of follow-up (P = 0.002). Perfusion improvement after 3 months was comparable with the effect of the first injection (P = 0.379). Anginal complaints improved ≤ 12 months after cell injection in Canadian Cardiovascular Society score (mean change at 3, 6, and 12 months: 0.6 ± 0.9%, 0.5 ± 0.9%, and 0.6 ± 0.9%, respectively; Pslope = 0.007, first versus repeated; P = 0.188) and in quality of life score as measured by Seattle Angina Questionnaire (mean change at 3, 6, and 12 months: 7 ± 14%, 8 ± 14%, and 7 ± 15%, respectively; Pslope = 0.020, first versus repeated; P = 0.126).

### Definition, classification, and pathophysiology of acute coronary ischemic syndromes [^113dfFuX]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is now used to describe a spectrum of clinical presentations that share an underlying pathophysiology, replacing the previous nomenclature of ischemic chest pain. Accurate diagnosis and proper management of patients with these entities require the emergency medicine physician to consider the entire spectrum of ACS, with emphasis placed on early diagnosis and rapid treatment. Each of these syndromes has its own prognosis, pathophysiology, and specific management strategy.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^114Tgohw]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Since the 1960s, cardiologists have adopted several binary classification systems for acute myocardial infarction (MI) that facilitated improved patient management. Conversely, for chronic stable manifestations of myocardial ischemia, various classifications have emerged over time, often with conflicting terminology, such as "stable coronary artery disease" (CAD), "stable ischemic heart disease", and "chronic coronary syndromes" (CCS). While the 2019 European guidelines introduced CCS to impart symmetry with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS), the 2023 American guidelines endorsed the alternative term "chronic coronary disease".

An unintended consequence of these competing classifications is the perpetuation of the restrictive terms "coronary" and "disease", often connoting only a singular obstructive CAD mechanism. It is now crucial to advance a more broadly inclusive terminology for both obstructive and non-obstructive causes of angina and myocardial ischemia that fosters conceptual clarity and unifies asynchronous nomenclatures across guidelines. We, therefore, propose a new binary classification of "acute myocardial ischemic syndromes" and "non-acute myocardial ischemic syndromes", which comprises both obstructive epicardial and non-obstructive pathogenetic mechanisms, including microvascular dysfunction, vasospastic disorders, and non-coronary causes. We retain accepted categories of ACS, ST-segment elevation MI, and non-ST-segment elevation MI as critical subsets for which revascularization is of proven clinical benefit, as well as new terms like ischemia and MI with.

### Stable coronary syndromes: pathophysiology, diagnostic advances and therapeutic need [^115enjut]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnostic management of patients with angina pectoris typically centers on the detection of obstructive epicardial CAD, which aligns with evidence-based treatment options that include medical therapy and myocardial revascularization. This clinical paradigm fails to account for the considerable proportion (approximately one-third) of patients with angina in whom obstructive CAD is excluded. This common scenario presents a diagnostic conundrum whereby angina occurs but there is no obstructive CAD (ischemia and no obstructive coronary artery disease-INOCA).

We review new insights into the pathophysiology of angina whereby myocardial ischemia results from a deficient supply of oxygenated blood to the myocardium, due to various combinations of focal or diffuse epicardial disease (macrovascular), microvascular dysfunction, or both. Macrovascular disease may be due to the presence of obstructive CAD secondary to atherosclerosis, or may be dynamic due to a functional disorder (e.g. coronary artery spasm, myocardial bridging). The pathophysiology of coronary microvascular disease may involve anatomical abnormalities resulting in increased coronary resistance or functional abnormalities resulting in abnormal vasomotor tone.

We consider novel clinical diagnostic techniques enabling new insights into the causes of angina and appraise the need for improved therapeutic options for patients with INOCA. We conclude that the taxonomy of stable CAD could improve to better reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiology of the coronary circulation. We propose the term 'stable coronary syndromes'.

### Limitations of chest pain categorization models to predict coronary artery disease [^112GNcxJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate how chest pain categorization, currently used to assess the pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD), predicts the actual presence of CAD in a population of patients with stable symptoms. We studied 475 consecutive patients enrolled in the Evaluation of Integrated Cardiac Imaging for the Detection and Characterization of Ischemic Heart Disease study based on possible symptoms of CAD. Chest pain or discomfort was categorized as typical angina, atypical angina, or nonanginal according to the guidelines. Exertional dyspnea and fatigue suspected to be angina equivalents were classified as atypical angina. Patients with a probability of CAD of 90%, based on age, gender, and symptoms, were excluded.

The end points of this substudy were significant CAD (defined by invasive coronary angiography as > 50% reduction in lumen diameter in the left main stem, > 70% stenosis in a major coronary vessel, or 30% to 70% stenosis with fractional flow reserve ≤ 0.8), inducible myocardial ischemia at noninvasive stress imaging, and their association. Patients' symptoms had limited ability to predict the presence of significant CAD, with the global chi-square being 5.0. The inclusion of age increased the global chi-square to 18.7, and gender increased it further to 51.1. Using inducible myocardial ischemia or the association of CAD with inducible ischemia as endpoints, the ability to predict these endpoints was again better for patient demographics than for patient symptoms. Thus, the ability of models based on symptoms, age, and gender to predict the presence of significant CAD was limited.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^114YEkeT]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

As our understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (MI) has matured and evolved over decades, so too has our nomenclature for classifying these conditions. There has been a remarkable partnership of joint collaboration across major international cardiovascular societies in the classification of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including both diagnosis and treatment, which has been well-received by clinicians and has favorably impacted patient management over the past 20 years. Yet, the ACS nomenclature neglects many important non-obstructive coronary causes of both myocardial ischemia and MI.

Moreover, among patients with chronic stable manifestations of myocardial ischemia, various classifications have emerged over time but often with conflicting terminology and implications — e.g. "stable coronary artery disease" (CAD), "stable ischemic heart disease" (SIHD), "chronic coronary syndromes" (CCS), and, most recently, "chronic coronary disease" (CCD). This lack of unanimity in accurately clarifying the many chronic manifestations of angina pectoris and myocardial ischemia has resulted in competing classification systems and dyssynchronous nomenclatures across clinical practice guidelines and among various professional societies, most notably those endorsed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). While the 2019 European guidelines introduced CCS to provide symmetry with ACS, the movement towards standardization continues.

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^116gUDPx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In this retrospective cohort analysis of veterans with stable angina, documented CCS classification in the electronic health record identified by NLP was positively associated with all‐cause mortality and healthcare utilization for cardiovascular causes. Compared with CCS class I, those with CCS class III or IV angina symptom severity near the time of angina diagnosis experienced a 33% to 48% higher all‐cause mortality rate over a median 3‐year follow‐up. All‐cause mortality rates were similar among those presenting with class I and II symptoms. A graded association was also noted in which CCS class was associated with a progressively higher risk of undergoing coronary revascularization (i.e. PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting procedures). CCS classes III and IV were also significantly associated with more incurred direct healthcare costs. To our knowledge, the analysis represents the first large, electronic health record–based cohort study reporting CCS classification and its association with all‐cause mortality in newly diagnosed stable angina patients. These results support the prognostic importance of assessing and documenting angina severity at the point of care.

### Predictors of long-term clinical endpoints in patients with refractory angina [^11135oec]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The identification of patients with refractory angina is challenging. The European Society of Cardiology Joint Study Group on the Treatment of Refractory Angina requires three months of angina not controlled by medical or interventional therapy where ischemia has been documented as the cause of symptoms. Studies of these patients have largely been based on catheterization lab series where documentation of medical therapy and continued symptoms has been lacking.

In our study, the percentage of patients undergoing catheterization who fulfilled our selection criteria was only 2.5%, lower than many previous series (6 to 15%). This reflects our selection process and inclusivity of all patients undergoing catheterization, including those with non‐cardiac conditions and those not related to coronary disease. This is similar to other series from the DDCD. Notably, 38% of patients did not have significant coronary artery disease and 49% of the remaining patients were excluded because they did not have sufficient angina.

Our study is strengthened by the number of patients selected, inclusion of all patients undergoing catheterization in a comprehensive database, and specific phenotyping of angina class and clinical risk factors and outcomes. Enrollment in clinical trials likely more rigorously selects for patients on optimal medical therapy with stable symptoms, as does referral to a clinic specializing in the treatment of this condition. The concordance of our findings with these analyses validates our patient selection strategy and the outcomes described.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^116kdCgY]. Circulation (2024). Low credibility.

The term "ischemic syndrome" better characterizes and captures the many pathogenetic causes of angina and ischemia more inclusively and accurately than the narrower terms "coronary" and "disease". We certainly recognize that coronary obstruction or epicardial coronary stenosis remains an important mechanistic cause of ACS and accounts also for many clinical presentations of CCS or CCD. However, the very term "coronary" fails to encompass the many non-coronary processes that may also cause myocardial ischemia, such as microvascular dysfunction, extramural microcirculatory compression, microvascular embolization and rarefaction, and myocardial bridges. An unforeseen consequence of disproportionately focusing on epicardial coronary obstruction is that other pathogenetically important causes of angina and ischemia too often fail to be considered.

A purely anatomical diagnostic approach using invasive coronary angiography or coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) may likewise fail to diagnose microvascular and/or vasospastic angina as treatable causes of angina. In such cases, many patients in whom no obstructive coronary lesions are identified may be falsely reassured that ischemia is not present. Often, these patients are discharged from cardiology settings, leading to a search for a myriad of potential (and costly) non-cardiac causes rather than pursuing a more diligent evaluation of non-coronary causes of angina and ischemia.

### International standardization of diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina [^115Khnin]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

The Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina, commonly referred to as the COVADIS criteria, serves as a clinical tool for diagnosing vasospastic angina. This condition is typified by coronary artery spasms that lead to transient myocardial ischemia and presents diagnostic challenges due to its variability and the necessity for provocative testing.

The COVADIS criteria integrate three primary components: nitrate-responsive angina, transient ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and evidence of coronary artery spasm.
- **Nitrate-responsive angina**: This is characterized by rest angina, particularly occurring between night and early morning, marked diurnal variations in exercise tolerance with reduced tolerance in the morning, the capability of hyperventilation to precipitate an episode, and suppression of episodes by calcium channel blockers but not beta-blockers.
- **Transient ischemic ECG changes**: These changes are identified by ST-segment elevation or depression of at least 0.1 mV or the emergence of new negative U waves.
- **Evidence of coronary artery spasm**: This is determined by transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion, with angina and ischemic ECG changes occurring either spontaneously or in response to a provocative stimulus such as acetylcholine, ergot, or hyperventilation.

The diagnostic criteria are considered met if there is clear evidence of nitrate-responsive angina and transient ischemic ECG changes, along with coronary artery spasm.

### Chronic remote ischemic conditioning treatment in patients with chronic stable angina (EARLY-MYO-CSA): A randomized, controlled proof-of-concept trial [^114yZrVW]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The assessment of angina pectoris was conducted using the CCS classification, SAQ score, and 6-MWT by investigators who were blinded to the randomization and participants' clinical information. The CCS classification assessed the severity of angina pectoris based on a combination of the physician's assessment and patient's self-reported symptoms. The SAQ is a 19-item questionnaire measuring five domains related to angina pectoris: angina frequency, angina stability, physical limitation, treatment satisfaction, and disease perception. Each domain has a score from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating an improvement in angina pectoris. Further details on the CCS classification and SAQ are available in Additional file 3. The 6-MWT was conducted as follows: after resting for 5–10 minutes, the patient walked back and forth in a 30-meter straight corridor for 6 minutes. The assessor encouraged the patient to walk as fast as possible, following directly behind, and recorded the maximal distance covered by the patient in 6 minutes or less if the patient stopped earlier.

Safety of CRIC treatment was evaluated by assessing major adverse cardiovascular events and local adverse reactions in the limbs. Major adverse cardiovascular events included all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke following randomization. Detailed definitions of these events are provided in our previous studies. Local limb adverse reactions reported by participants or investigators included skin ecchymosis, limb pain, and limb weakness.

### Simplified predictive instrument to rule out acute coronary syndromes in a high-risk population [^115KNMQX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic performance**: Table 2 describes the performance of our expanded classification strategy and the modified ADAPT rule for predicting 30-day events in our cohort. Of the 47 patients who developed a cardiovascular event, 46 (sensitivity 98%, 95% CI 89% to 100%) were correctly identified as high risk based on our classification scheme. Further, the classification scheme identified 53 patients as low risk, of whom 52 did not have an adverse cardiac event within 30 days (NPV 98%, 95% CI 90% to 100%). The specificity was poor, with 132 (72%) of the 184 patients without an event being labeled as high risk.

The modified ADAPT rule correctly identified all 47 patients who developed ACS as high risk (sensitivity 100%) but identified only 18 patients as low risk, of whom none had an event (NPV 100%). As with the expanded classification strategy, the specificity for ADAPT was poor, with 166 (90%) of 184 event-free patients being labeled as high risk. Our classification strategy concurred on 15 of the 18 patients ADAPT identified as low risk. We identified an additional 38 patients as being low risk, of whom 1 patient experienced a revascularization procedure within 30 days of hospital admission.

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^1115a6A5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: Characteristics of the study population were calculated according to initial CCS classification ("baseline"). Trends in baseline characteristics across CCS classification were determined by modeling the characteristic of interest as the outcome variable and CCS classification as an ordinal predictor. Appropriate regression models (i.e. linear, logistic) were selected based on the type of variable (i.e. continuous, binary) with dummy indicators created for categorical characteristics.

	- We calculated incidence rates for each outcome as the number of events divided by the total person-years at risk. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality, hospitalizations, and revascularization procedures associated with CCS classification, with the lowest class (CCS class I) serving as the reference group. Potential violations of the proportional hazards assumption were tested by modeling the interaction between each model covariate and the log of follow-up time. No violations were present.

	- To compare healthcare costs at 1-year follow-up between groups, adjusted incremental costs were calculated using multivariate-adjusted generalized linear models with a log-link function and a γ distribution with cost as the outcome variable and CCS class as an ordinal predictor. Finally, we compared baseline characteristics between veterans with and without CCS class measurements as identified using the NLP tool. Analyses were performed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute) and STATA v12.0 (StataCorp).

### Stable coronary syndromes: Pathophysiology, diagnostic advances and therapeutic need [^1112Qbba]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical conundrum of angina is classically thought to be due to flow-limiting coronary artery disease (CAD), which results in a supply-demand mismatch in myocardial perfusion. Anatomical thresholds for CAD severity can vary. A widely used cut-off for obstructive CAD is a stenosis of 70% in a main coronary artery (> 2.5 mm) in one angiographic projection, or 50% in two projections, and 50% of the left main coronary artery. The management of patients with angina appropriately centers on the detection of obstructive epicardial CAD, which may be challenging to diagnose objectively — for example, mild tandem lesions in series may cause flow-limiting disease. Systemic problems, including anemia and aortic stenosis, also influence the propensity for angina and should be considered.

In patients with obstructive epicardial CAD, the treatment involves optimal medical therapy and consideration of myocardial revascularization with either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, this paradigm fails to account for one-third or more of patients with angina in whom obstructive CAD is excluded. A US registry of 398,978 patients referred for coronary angiography demonstrated that 39.2% of patients had no evidence of epicardial CAD. Also, angina may persist following PCI and CABG. The reasons for 'negative' coronary angiography are multifactorial. However, a growing body of evidence supports the use of coronary function tests, especially since a disorder of coronary artery function may be the unifying diagnosis in a patient with symptoms not explained by obstructive CAD.

### International observational analysis of evolution and outcomes of chronic stable angina: The multinational CLARIFY study [^114JmeiU]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Although angina is common in patients with stable coronary artery disease, limited data are available on its prevalence, natural evolution, and outcomes in the era of effective cardiovascular drugs and widespread use of coronary revascularization.
- **Methods**: Using data from 32,691 patients with stable coronary artery disease from the prospective observational CLARIFY registry (Prospective Observational Longitudinal Registry of Patients with Stable Coronary Artery Disease), anginal status was mapped each year in patients without new coronary revascularization or new myocardial infarction. The use of medical interventions in the year preceding angina resolution was explored. The effect of 1-year changes in angina status on 5-year outcomes was analyzed using multivariable analysis.
- **Results**: Among 7,212 (22.1%) patients who reported angina at baseline, angina disappeared (without coronary revascularization) in 39.6% at 1 year, with further annual decreases. In patients without angina at baseline, 2.0% to 4.8% developed angina each year. During the 5-year follow-up, angina was controlled in 7,773 patients, in whom resolution of angina was obtained with increased use of antianginal treatment in 11.1%, with coronary revascularization in 4.5%, and without any changes in medication or revascularization in 84.4%. Compared to patients without angina at baseline and 1 year, persistence of angina and occurrence of angina at 1 year with conservative management were each independently associated with higher rates of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction.

### Angina severity, mortality, and healthcare utilization among veterans with stable angina [^117Ho19E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, several studies have shown mixed results regarding the association between angina severity and clinical outcomes, but these studies have generally been limited to hospitalized patients undergoing revascularization. Clinical and survey data from ACQUIP (Veterans Affairs Medical Center Ambulatory Care Quality Improvement Project) demonstrated that greater angina severity scores, as measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), were associated with all‐cause mortality and increased admission rates for acute coronary syndrome. Conversely, a post hoc analysis from the BARI 2D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) registry found similar rates of all‐cause death and myocardial infarction among patients with CCS classes III and IV compared with those with CCS classes I and II.

Nonetheless, in light of the lack of consensus regarding the most appropriate method for assessing and documenting anginal symptoms at the point of care (i.e. physician assessment with the CCS or patient‐reported using the SAQ), objective evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g. inducible ischemia using exercise treadmill testing with stress echocardiography), as opposed to angina symptoms alone, is a stronger marker of adverse cardiovascular risk. Although our study did not investigate CCS classification with objective evidence of myocardial ischemia on noninvasive testing, our findings justify the utility of CCS classification and documentation in routine practice. The relative merits, utility, and value of provider‐documented symptom severity…

### Refractory angina: Mechanisms and stratified treatment in obstructive and non-obstructive chronic myocardial ischaemic syndromes [^115YvHM1]. European Heart Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of refractory angina has conventionally been limited to patients with angina and ischaemia secondary to obstructive atherosclerotic epicardial coronary disease, who experience persistent symptoms despite optimal pharmacological and revascularization therapies. It is now well-established that angina may also be caused by ischaemia resulting from coronary microcirculatory disorders, coronary vasospasm, and bridging in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary disease or after "successful" revascularization. This increasingly prevalent and symptomatic group of patients, with both angina and demonstrable ischaemia, has been excluded from the conventional definition of refractory angina.

In patients with obstructive epicardial coronary disease, disturbed microcirculatory and vasomotor function, among other ischaemic mechanisms, may account for continuing symptoms despite revascularization. Under-recognition of these mechanisms results in inadequate treatment and symptom persistence. In this review, a redefinition of refractory angina is proposed to include the full spectrum of patients experiencing persistent angina despite maximal guideline-directed medical and revascularization therapies. Systematic approaches for comprehensive investigation are suggested to identify underlying mechanisms of ischaemia and stratify treatments accordingly. The complex needs of patients with refractory angina are likely best addressed by an inter-disciplinary Angina Heart Team with the aim of improving patient symptoms, quality of life, and clinical outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

The 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease recommends obtaining risk stratification in patients with chronic coronary disease by incorporating all available information. This includes noninvasive and/or invasive cardiovascular diagnostic testing results, or using validated risk scores. The goal is to classify patients as having a low (3%) yearly risk for cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

### 2024 revision of the level of evidence grading system for ESC clinical practice guideline recommendations II: diagnostic tests and prediction models [^113FPJXa]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

The level of evidence (LOE) grading system for European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) classifies the quality of the evidence supporting a recommendation. However, the taxonomy does not fully consider the optimal study design necessary to establish evidence for different types of recommendations in ESC guidelines. Therefore, two separate task forces of clinical and methodological experts were appointed by the CPG Committee, with the first tasked with updating the LOE grading system for therapy and prevention and the second responsible for developing a LOE grading system for diagnosis and prediction.

This report from the second of these task forces develops a new system for diagnostic tests and prediction models which maintains the three-level grading structure to classify the quality of the evidence but introduces new definitions specific for diagnosis and prediction.
- **Diagnostic tests**: LOE A represents conclusive evidence of adequate diagnostic ability from at least two high-quality studies. Level of evidence B represents suggestive evidence from one high-quality or at least two moderate-quality studies. Level of evidence C represents preliminary evidence not classified as A or B, including evidence from less than two moderate-quality studies or from expert consensus.
- **Prediction models**: LOE A represents conclusive evidence of adequate predictive ability from at least one high-quality derivation and two or more external validation studies of at least moderate quality. Level of evidence B represents suggestive evidence in one high-quality validation or derivation study.

### British Cardiac Society working group on the definition of myocardial infarction [^114G57C4]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The British Cardiac Society commissioned this report to address inconsistencies in terminology for acute coronary syndromes and variations in the threshold for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI), depending on the assay performed, precision, and sensitivity. Several publications have highlighted potential issues with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) consensus document published in 2000. A revision process has been initiated under the guidance of the ESC, the ACC, and the American Heart Association (AHA), aiming to inform the next revision of the ESC/ACC/AHA guidelines for diagnosing MI.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^116ydira]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for vasospastic angina, specifically concerning coronary provocative testing, the 2024 ESC guidelines recommend obtaining invasive coronary functional testing. This is to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of underlying atherosclerotic disease in patients with suspected vasospastic angina. It is particularly important for those experiencing repetitive episodes of rest angina associated with ST-segment changes that resolve with nitrates and/or calcium antagonists.

### Myocardial ischemic syndromes: A new nomenclature to harmonize evolving international clinical practice guidelines [^114vqbLM]. Circulation (2024).

Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) has been widely regarded as the prevalent pathogenetic mechanism across the clinical spectrum of angina pectoris, transient myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction (MI) in the majority of patients. However, a growing body of scientific evidence highlights that distinct alternative pathogenetic mechanisms are at play. These can act either in isolation, such as in the absence of flow-limiting CAD, or in combination with epicardial CAD, which may or may not be flow-limiting. It is now increasingly clear that there are many important non-obstructive causes that are not comprehensively captured in the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus chronic coronary syndrome/disease (CCS/CCD) nomenclatures. The terms "coronary" or "disease" are equally applicable to both acute and non-acute clinical presentations.

Since obstructive CAD does not inevitably lead to symptomatic ischemia, and conversely, both myocardial ischemia and MI can occur without obstructive CAD, a practical and accurate nomenclature should fully reflect the totality of potential obstructive and non-obstructive causes of ischemia occurring in both acute and non-acute clinical settings.

It holds true for MI as well. Notably, in the Fourth Universal Definition of MI (UDMI-4), the diagnosis of MI is based on functional rather than anatomical criteria, such as troponin rise and fall. A sizeable percentage of patients with type 2 MI develop MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). Thus, existing nomenclatures do not fully reflect the totality and distribution of all myocardial infarctions.

For all these reasons, we believe…

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^114y9zEy]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for coronary artery disease, particularly in risk assessment, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend performing invasive coronary angiography. This procedure should be complemented by invasive coronary pressure measurements (FFR/instantaneous wave-free ratio) when appropriate. These steps are intended to refine risk stratification and improve symptoms and cardiovascular outcomes through revascularization in patients at high risk of adverse events regardless of symptoms.

Assessment of risk stratification strategies

Thresholds for risk stratification strategies

Table 2 shows the number and proportion of people identified as having a high risk of cardiovascular disease for each risk stratification strategy. Compared with strategy A, strategy B stratified 20,241 (149.8%) more women aged ≤ 53 years and 9,832 (150.2%) more men aged ≤ 47 years as having a high risk of cardiovascular disease; for all other ages the strategies were the same. For strategy B, individuals with a predicted risk ≥ 90th centile had higher values for systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and body mass index, and were more likely to be smokers than those with a predicted risk < 90th centile.
- **Age and sex specific cut-off values**: These values are used for stratifying individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The table lists the numbers of individuals identified as high risk in different strategies, with risk estimations by version 2 of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK2).
