## Question

FABER exam

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the FABER exam, including its definition, technique, interpretation, diagnostic accuracy across conditions, reliability, limitations, and how to integrate it into practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acronym and basic mechanics. Then, I should verify the standard technique and stabilization. Next, I will interpret pain localization and what it implies. After that, I need to review diagnostic accuracy for hip intra-articular pathology, FAI syndrome, sacroiliac joint pain, and greater trochanteric pain syndrome. I should then examine reliability and guideline positions. Finally, I will consider limitations, differential diagnosis, and practical integration with other tests and imaging, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the acronym and core concept. FABER stands for Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation, and the test is also called Patrick's test; it is a passive movement of the hip into flexion, abduction, and external rotation, typically with the foot placed on the contralateral knee to form a figure-four, while the examiner stabilizes the pelvis and applies a gentle downward force on the knee to load the joint and surrounding structures [^1156wkVD] [^113i9MrE].

> Wait, let me verify the standard technique so I don't miss a key step. The patient lies supine, the tested hip is flexed, abducted, and externally rotated so the lateral calf rests on the contralateral thigh, the examiner stabilizes the contralateral ASIS to limit pelvic motion, and then applies a posteriorly directed force through the knee to tension the hip and sacroiliac region; pain localization and range asymmetry are the primary clinical observations, and some authors emphasize measuring the distance from the lateral knee to the table to quantify side-to-side differences in ROM [^1156wkVD] [^113i9MrE] [^1112QSnD].

> I will now examine interpretation by pain location, because this drives differential diagnosis. Anterior groin pain during FABER suggests intra-articular hip pathology such as labral tears, chondral injury, or femoroacetabular impingement, whereas posterior buttock pain near the ipsilateral sacroiliac joint suggests SI joint–mediated pain; importantly, FABER can stress both the hip joint and the SI joint, so concordant pain reproduction with the patient's typical complaint strengthens the inference, but I should confirm that anterior pain is not simply referred from the SI region before concluding hip pathology [^113i9MrE] [^1156wkVD] [^111oRuJ7].

> Next, I should review diagnostic accuracy for intra-articular hip pathology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — FABER shows high sensitivity but low specificity for intra-articular hip pain, meaning a positive test supports the possibility of intra-articular disease but cannot confirm it, whereas a negative FABER makes intra-articular pathology less likely; in a cohort using diagnostic injection as reference, sensitivity was 0.82 with specificity 0.25, and in arthroscopy-correlated series, sensitivity around 0.88 has been reported, reinforcing its value as a screening rather than a confirmatory test [^113i9MrE] [^1116mF1G].

> I need to check how FABER performs in suspected femoroacetabular impingement syndrome. Systematic reviews and contemporary guidelines indicate that FABER, like FADIR, has high sensitivity but low specificity for FAIS; thus, a negative FABER helps rule out FAIS, whereas a positive FABER is not diagnostic by itself and should be integrated with history, ROM, and imaging when appropriate; combining multiple impingement tests and ROM measures modestly improves diagnostic accuracy, but no single clinical test reliably rules in cam or pincer morphology [^11128WZP] [^117Ccoqz] [^1156TcW5] [^1112QSnD] [^111xAnGt].

> Let me consider sacroiliac joint pain, where FABER is often used as part of a provocation cluster. FABER can be among the more sensitive SI provocation maneuvers, with reported sensitivity around 91% in some cohorts, but specificity is limited and diagnosis should rely on a constellation of tests rather than any single maneuver; in patients with low back pain, a positive Patrick-FABER sign has been associated with MRI-confirmed sacroiliitis and spondyloarthritis, though again, this supports screening rather than standalone diagnosis [^114QKUEr] [^115CBGw9].

> I should confirm FABER's role in greater trochanteric pain syndrome. FABER frequently reproduces lateral hip pain in GTPS and, when combined with point tenderness over the greater trochanter and other tests such as resisted external derotation or single-leg stance, improves diagnostic accuracy; however, MRI studies show gluteal tendon pathology is common even in asymptomatic individuals, so FABER positivity must be interpreted in clinical context and not overattributed to tendinopathy alone [^116xceRo] [^113Wj3BB] [^116CBQeA].

> Next, I should review reliability so I don't overstate consistency. Inter-rater reliability for FABER is generally moderate to substantial, with kappa values around 0.63 in mixed hip pathology cohorts and greater than 0.6 in FAI-focused studies, supporting its routine clinical use when standardized technique and criteria are applied; intra-rater reliability for ROM measurement during FABER is excellent in hip OA work, which supports using FABER to track side-to-side ROM differences over time [^115wP4fM] [^116kp7Gd] [^1163EgiE].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline positions to ensure alignment. Contemporary APTA guidance recommends using FABER and FADIR to help identify patients without FAIS when these tests are negative, and to classify nonarthritic hip joint pain when anterior groin or lateral hip pain is reproduced with FABER or FADIR alongside consistent imaging; VA/DoD low back pain guidance includes FABER among hip clearing tests in the spine evaluation, underscoring its role in differential diagnosis of low back and posterior hip pain [^117Ccoqz] [^11241nJH] [^117Hnggr].

> But wait, what about limitations and pitfalls. FABER lacks specificity and can be positive across multiple conditions, including intra-articular hip disease, SI joint pain, GTPS, and even asymptomatic individuals with cam morphology; thus, a positive FABER should prompt targeted questioning, additional provocative tests, and, when indicated, imaging rather than a definitive label; moreover, FABER distance interpretations require the unaffected hip to be free of cam or pincer morphology, which is often unknown without imaging, limiting the standalone utility of asymmetry thresholds [^1112QSnD] [^111xAnGt] [^116xceRo].

> I should double-check how to integrate FABER with other tests and imaging. In suspected intra-articular hip pain, FABER complements FADIR, scour, and ROM measures; in suspected SI pain, FABER should be combined with other provocation tests such as thigh thrust, distraction, compression, and Gaenslen to reach a cluster-based diagnosis; in suspected GTPS, FABER adds value alongside greater trochanter palpation, resisted external derotation, and single-leg stance; when FAIS is suspected, negative FABER and FADIR help rule out the syndrome, whereas positive tests should be corroborated with radiographs or MRI for cam/pincer morphology and labral or chondral disease [^117Ccoqz] [^114QKUEr] [^116xceRo] [^1112QSnD].

> Let me reconsider the practical takeaway so I don't overpromise. FABER is a simple, reproducible screen that helps localize pain to the hip joint versus the SI region and supports the differential for FAIS, SI pain, and GTPS; a negative FABER lowers the likelihood of intra-articular hip pathology or FAIS, whereas a positive FABER should be interpreted in the context of the full examination and, when appropriate, confirmed with imaging to guide management decisions [^113i9MrE] [^117Ccoqz] [^1112QSnD].

---

The FABER (Patrick's) test is a **simple, reliable** [^115wP4fM] maneuver that helps localize hip or sacroiliac pain and guide differential diagnosis [^1156wkVD]. It is performed with the patient supine, the tested hip flexed, abducted, and externally rotated into a figure-four position, and the examiner stabilizing the pelvis while gently pressing the knee downward. Pain in the **groin** suggests intra-articular hip pathology (e.g. labral tear, FAI) [^113i9MrE], whereas pain in the **buttock** near the PSIS indicates sacroiliac involvement [^1156wkVD]. Sensitivity and specificity vary by condition [^1112QSnD], so FABER is best used alongside other tests and imaging when needed [^117Ccoqz]. It is also useful for tracking treatment response and can be adapted for telemedicine [^1167JK9X].

---

## Clinical technique

- **Patient position**: Supine on the examination table.
- **Examiner action**: Flex, abduct, and externally rotate the tested hip, placing the foot on the contralateral knee to form a figure-four.
- **Stabilization**: The examiner stabilizes the pelvis by pressing the contralateral ASIS downward.
- **Application of force**: Gentle downward pressure is applied to the flexed knee to load the hip and SI joint [^1156wkVD].

---

## Interpretation of results

| **Pain location** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|
| Groin | Intra-articular hip pathology (e.g. labral tear, femoroacetabular impingement, osteoarthritis) [^113i9MrE] [^1116mF1G] |
| Buttock (near PSIS) | Sacroiliac joint dysfunction or pathology [^1156wkVD] [^115CBGw9] |
| Lateral hip | Greater trochanteric pain syndrome or abductor tendon pathology [^116xceRo] [^116CBQeA] |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy

Sensitivity and specificity vary by condition: for intra-articular hip pathology, sensitivity is **0.82** and specificity is **0.25** [^113i9MrE]; for sacroiliac joint dysfunction, sensitivity is **0.91** and specificity is **0.78** [^114QKUEr]; and for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, sensitivity is **0.81** and specificity is **0.82** [^116xceRo]. These metrics underscore the need to interpret FABER within the clinical context and alongside other tests [^1112QSnD].

---

## Clinical applications

- **Differential diagnosis**: Helps distinguish hip joint pathology from sacroiliac joint dysfunction and extra-articular hip pain syndromes [^1156wkVD] [^111oRuJ7].
- **Monitoring treatment response**: Useful for tracking changes in pain and function over time [^1163EgiE].
- **Telemedicine**: Can be adapted for remote assessment, enhancing accessibility [^1167JK9X].

---

## Limitations

- **Non-specificity**: Positive results can occur in multiple conditions, necessitating correlation with history and other tests [^1112QSnD].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, limited mobility, or concurrent lumbar pathology may affect test performance [^116qLXy2] [^111pwwxp].
- **Imaging correlation**: May require imaging (MRI, X-ray) for definitive diagnosis, especially in complex cases [^113fqFpm].

---

## Modifications and variations

The **FABER distance test** quantifies side-to-side differences in knee-to-table distance to assess ROM asymmetry and cam morphology [^114MxZ3K] [^1112QSnD]. The **telemedicine adaptation** guides patients to perform FABER remotely with self-palpation and symptom reporting [^1167JK9X].

---

The FABER test is a **quick, reproducible** clinical tool that localizes pain to the hip joint, sacroiliac joint, or lateral hip structures, supporting differential diagnosis and treatment monitoring. It should be interpreted in context and, when needed, complemented by additional tests or imaging [^117Ccoqz].

SIJ Provocative Tests

FABER Test (Patrick's Test)

When performing the FABER test (Figure 1), the patient lies supine on the examination table. The examiner brings the hip joint on the ipsilateral side of SIJ pain into the FABER position. The ipsilateral knee is flexed at 90° and the hip is externally rotated with the ipsilateral foot resting on the contralateral knee. Subsequently, the examiner presses the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) against the table and pushes the flexed knee down toward the table. The test is considered positive if the patient feels pain in the SIJ on the side where the knee was flexed. Although, some textbooks suggest the FABER test can also stress the contralateral SIJ. At this point, pain in the buttocks is suggestive of SIJ pain, whereas pain in the groin region could indicate hip pathology. When performed correctly, the FABER test can have one of the highest sensitivities of the five provocative maneuvers. This test is also useful in this current age of telemedicine as patients can perform their own FABER examination by sitting on a chair, and crossing the ankle of the affected side over the contralateral knee and pushing down on their ipsilateral knee while leaning back in their chair.

Figure 1
FABER Test (Patrick's Test) – With the patient in a supine position, the lower extremity ipsilateral to the patient's painful SIJ is correctly positioned by lying their lateral ankle on the contralateral anterior thigh. Then with the clinician standing on the side of the painful SIJ, one hand must stabilize the contralateral ASIS with firm pressure, while simultaneously applying a downward force through the ipsilateral flexed, externally rotated and abducted lower extremity, as depicted by the arrow.

Thigh Thrust Test (Posterior Shear Test)

When performing the Thigh Thrust Test (Figure 2), the patient lies in a supine position while the tested-side hip joint and knee are flexed to approximately 90° by the examiner. An anterior to posterior shear force is applied to the SIJ through the axis of the femur. Resulting pain at the ipsilateral SIJ indicates a positive test.

Figure 2
Thigh Thrust Test (Posterior Shear Test) – With the patient lying in a supine position the hip and knee ipsilateral to the painful SIJ are flexed, and the femur is positioned perpendicular to the table. A linear downward force through the femur towards the table is applied as depicted by the arrow.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^113i9MrE]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Hip flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test — nonarthritic hip joint pain evaluates impairment of body function, specifically pain in joints and mobility of a single joint, and is performed in supine with the hip passively externally rotated and abducted; a positive test is production or increase of anterior groin, posterior buttock, or lateral hip pain consistent with the presenting complaint. Provocation is recorded as nominal and range of motion is continuous, with degrees used for range of motion and none for provocation. Using pain relief with a diagnostic injection as the comparison, reported accuracy metrics were sensitivity 0.82 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.96), specificity 0.25 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.48), positive predictive value 0.46 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.65), and negative predictive value 0.64 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.91). Mitchell et al reported sensitivity of 88% compared to intraoperative findings but no correlation to a specific hip joint pathology. No studies were located reporting FABER range-of-motion measurement properties in nonarthritic hip joint pain; in knee osteoarthritis, range-of-motion reliability was ICC = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94).

### Chronic pelvic pain: ACOG practice bulletin, number 218 [^112Q91Vq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Neuromusculoskeletal examination — chronic pelvic pain: Pelvic floor muscle tenderness or a positive forced flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER) test correctly classified neuromusculoskeletal pain in 85% of patients in a small U.S. study, indicating potential benefit from physical therapy. The Carnett test is highlighted as the abdominal examination finding most associated with chronic pelvic pain; a positive result is defined by tenderness that worsens or does not improve during an abdominal wall muscle contraction, whereas a negative result indicates visceral pain that improves during the muscle contraction when the abdominal wall shields the viscera. A positive Carnett test result is independently associated with severity of chronic pelvic pain to a similar degree as pelvic floor muscle tenderness.

### Positive FABER distance test is associated with higher alpha angle in symptomatic patients [^114MxZ3K]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) distance test (FDT) for the diagnosis of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) as defined by alpha angle.

Methods

For this study, 603 patients with symptomatic, unilateral femoroacetabular impingement were included. Patients with symptoms of hip instability, bilateral symptoms, bilateral surgery, or bilateral alpha angles over 55 were excluded from the analysis. A positive FDT was defined as a difference of 4 cm or more between hips. A pathological cam was defined as an alpha angle of 78° or greater.

Results

The average age was 36.4 ± 12 years, with 344 males and 259 females. Faber distance of the injured hip was correlated with age at surgery (rho = 0.148; p < 0.001). Alpha angle on the injured hip was positively correlated with injured hip FABER distance (rho = 0.276; p < 0.001). The average alpha angle in patients with a positive FABER distance test was 74° (SD = 11°) compared to 68° (SD = 8°) in patients with a negative distance test (p = 0.001). The sensitivity of the FDT to diagnose pathological cam was 0.848 (0.79–0.89) with a negative predictive value of 86% (81–90%).

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that the FABER distance test is correlated with the alpha angle and is a good diagnostic exam for pathological cam-type FAI as defined by and alpha angle equal to or greater than 78°.

Clinical Relevance

FABER distance test is a simple test that can be used as a screening test to decide if FAI should be suspected and further testing is needed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam or pincer morphology in individuals with suspected FAI syndrome: a systematic review [^1112QSnD]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review examined the current literature on clinical tests for the detection of cam or pincer morphology in individuals suspected of having FAI syndrome. Eight out of 4091 studies were included, and these reported on 17 clinical tests and two test combinations. Because of the insufficient number of studies per test, a meta-analysis could not be performed. There are three main findings: (1) there is only low-quality evidence; (2) no single test effectively rules in a cam or mixed morphology; (3) the FADIR, FPAW and the maximal squat test showed the best sensitivities and should be combined to cautiously rule out a cam or mixed morphology, but the validity of this combination should be tested with a multivariable regression model.

Specificity could only be calculated for nine tests. Overall results showed low specificity for all tests, ranging from 0.11 to 0.56. This indicates that these clinical tests might not be appropriate to rule in a cam or pincer morphology. High sensitivity was found for some pain provocation tests (the FADIR, FPAW, maximal squat) and for the FABER distance test. The interpretation of the FABER distance test, however, is questionable because the positivity criterion is a loss of distance between the lateral aspect of the knee and the examination table compared with the unaffected side. This requires the unaffected hip to be free of a cam or pincer morphology, but this can only be determined with imaging studies. Hence, this test is not applicable in physiotherapy practice. The lowest values for sensitivity were from a study for which we only had an abstract. No test reached a sensitivity above 0.75 in that study. Detailed information on test execution and criteria for a positive test were unavailable, and therefore findings from that study should be interpreted with caution.

### Role of patrick-FABER test in detecting sacroiliitis and diagnosing spondyloarthritis in subjects with low back pain [^115CBGw9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of Patrick-FABER test in assessing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sacroiliitis and addressing the diagnosis of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in subjects with low back pain (LBP).

Methods

Subjects with LBP were consecutively enrolled. The assessors were blinded to patients' clinical, laboratory, or imaging data. All subjects underwent sacroiliac joint MRI to detect presence of sacroiliac oedema or structural changes.

Results

One hundred and ten subjects were included in the study [males (61.8%); median age of 45 (21–69) years; LBP duration of 78 (3–240) months]. Patrick-FABER test sign's sensitivity was 76.2% (95% CI: 60.5–87.9%), specificity was 66.2% (95% CI: 53.6–77.2%), positive predictive value (PPV) was 58.1% (95% CI: 44.1–71.3%) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 81.8% (95% CI: 69.1–90.9%) for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 70%. At the univariate and multivariate analysis, Patrick-FABER test sign was associated with inflammatory lesions of sacroiliitis at MRI and SpA diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed an association between smoking status (p = 0.01), sacroiliitis, and SpA diagnosis. The odds of having sacroiliitis was 2.7 higher in smokers (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1–7) as compared to non-smokers and 6.3 higher in those with a positive Patrick-FABER test sign (OR: 6.3; 95%CI: 2.5–15.6) as compared to those with a negative sign.

Conclusions

Our study shows that Patrick-FABER test positivity could represent a useful clinical test for addressing the use of sacroiliac joints MRI and SpA diagnosis in subjects with LBP. Further, smoking habit could represent an associate anamnestic element for addressing the use of sacroiliac MRI.

### Hip pain and movement dysfunction associated with nonarthritic hip joint pain: a revision [^116bQTiT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2023). High credibility.

Evidence synthesis — Based on the evidence, the ability to accurately diagnose those with FAIS using clinical examination testing is limited; none of these tests could adequately identify those with FAIS due to low specificity; a finding of no pain with FADIR and no restricted ROM with FABER compared with the unaffected side was recommended as the best best test to identify those without FAIS. There was evidence with 1 level II cohort study to support the ligamentum teres test to accurately identify those with and without a ligamentum teres tear, and another level II cohort study found that the abduction-hyperextension-external rotation, prone instability, and resisted straight-leg raise tests have high specificity but low sensitivity for hip instability; the benefits of performing these clinical tests are that those without FAIS may be identified when select tests are negative and that those with and without a ligamentum teres tear can be identified, whereas the harms include potential aggravation of a patient's symptoms.

Study flow diagram. FAI, femoroacetabular impingement.

Description of included studies

The characteristics of included studies are shown in the online supplementary table 1. The studies were performed in Canada, the USAand France. All studies were prospective. Seventeen clinical tests and two test combinations were reported. Three studies investigated the FABER test, but only one of these reported specificity. Two studies examined the FABER distance test(only one reported specificity). Two studies investigated the Stinchfield test(only one reported specificity). Two studies investigated the sensitivity of the posterior impingement test (PIT)(none reported specificity) and four studies investigated the FADIR test(only one reported specificity). For the remaining tests, there was only one study per test. In total, both sensitivity and specificity could be calculated for nine tests in five studies. For the other 10 clinical tests, only sensitivity could be calculated.

Studies provided data for 1666 hips. The prevalence of FAI morphology ranged from 10% to 64% (see table 1). Two studiesincluded only participants with confirmed FAI syndrome, while from another studywe extracted data from participants with confirmed FAI morphology and excluded asymptomatic participants so as to conform to our inclusion criteria.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^111oRuJ7]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Thigh Thrust Test

With the patient still supine and examiner standing on the patient's affected side, position the ipsilateral leg to 90-degree hip flexion and allow the knee to passively flex. The examiner places one hand on contralateral ASIS to stabilize the pelvis. The opposite hand is then placed on the anterior aspect of the passively flexed knee and vertical pressure is applied posteriorly through the patient's femur to create a shearing force at the affected SI joint. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

FABER Test

While the patient remains supine, position the affected leg to 90-degree hip and knee flexion. Abduct and externally rotation the ipsilateral leg at the hip joint and rest the lateral aspect of the patient's calf on the anterior aspect of the contralateral thigh, resembling a figure four. The examiner places one hand on the contralateral ASIS to stabilize the pelvis. The opposite hand applies a gentle posteriorly directed force on the anteromedial aspect of the affected side knee. This test is positive for SI joint pain when the patient describes posteriorly localized pain near the affected side SI joint and can fulfill the three or more requirement for provocation testing. However, if the pain is described anteriorly this may indicate hip pathology as the sole or an additional source of pain contributing to the patient's presentation. At this point, addition hip special testing (i.e. Scour Test, FADIR Test) can be performed.

Compression Test

If the examiner must continue provocative testing to adequately evaluate the SI joint, the patient is asked to lie on the unaffected side with the suspected SI joint facing upward and both hips and knees comfortable flexed. Examiner will stand posterior to the patient at the level of the pelvis. The examiner places one palm between the upward-facing ASIS and greater trochanter and uses the free hand to brace the contacted hand. With the examiner's elbows fully extended, vertical pressure is applied through the pelvis into the exam table. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

### Clinical hip tests and a functional squat test in patients with knee osteoarthritis: reliability, prevalence of positive test findings, and short-term response to hip mobilization [^112KBpEu]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

One group pretest-posttest exploratory design.

Objectives

Primary purposes of this study were to examine the short-term effect of hip mobilizations on pain and range of motion (ROM) measurements in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine the prevalence of painful hip and squat test findings in both patients with knee OA and asymptomatic subjects. The secondary purposes were to assess intrarater reliability and to determine whether fewer subjects experienced painful test findings following hip mobilization.

Background

Conservative intervention, including manual physical therapy applied to the lower extremity, has been shown to reduce impairments associated with knee OA.

Methods and Measures

One rater pair administered 4 clinical hip tests to 22 patients with knee OA (mean age, 61.2 years; SD, 6.1 years) and 17 subjects without lower extremity symptoms or known pathology (mean age, 64.0 years; SD, 7.9 years). Intrarater reliability was examined for each clinical test. Patients with knee OA and painful-hip and squat test findings received hip mobilizations. Pain and ROM responses for each test were dependent variables.

Results

Intraclass correlation coefficients for all tests were greater than 0.87. Composite and individual test pain scores and ROM scores improved significantly following hip mobilization. All clinical test findings were more frequent in the group with knee OA, except for those of the FABER test, and the number of subjects with painful test findings following hip mobilization was reduced for all tests except the hip flexion test.

Conclusions

Patients experienced increases in ROM, decreased pain, and fewer subjects had painful test findings immediately following a single session of hip mobilizations. Examination and intervention of the hip may be indicated in patients with knee OA.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^114QKUEr]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Criteria

Increasing the difficulty of diagnosis is the poor sensitivity with imaging. X-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance may offer some indication for abnormalities, but may not be specific alone. The joint is difficult to profile well on radiographic views, and therefore the radiographic findings of sacroiliitis are often equivocal. MRI is the most sensitive imaging technique to detect sacroiliitis. It is the only imaging modality that can reliably reveal bone marrow edema and inflammation around the sacroiliac joints and is comparable to low dose CT for demonstrating erosions and ankyloses.

Three hundred and seventy-eight patients were retrospectively identified who underwent definitive diagnostic injections with different sources of low back pain. The mean age and the number of patients reporting hip girdle pain, leg pain, and thigh pain were determined in each diagnostic group. This explored the relationship between predictors and the source of LBP. Age correlates with the source of low back pain, as disc disease is more likely in the younger population and older patients are likely to have diagnosis of sacroiliac or facetogenic pain. Interestingly, the absence of thigh pain in older patients increases the likelihood of sacroiliac joint dysfunction as a source of low back pain.

Physical Exam Findings

Telli et al looked at the validity and reliability of provocation tests in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction in 156 patients, investigating the distraction test, compression test, Gaenslen test, thigh thrust test, sacral thrust test, and Faber test. Diagnosis was made with three or more positive provocation tests, with the highest sensitivity being Faber (91.4%) and lowest probability was Gaenslen test.

Description of Provocation Maneuvers

Provocative Testing

The five following provocative tests have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity when used in combination. Three or more tests must be positive with at least one resulting from the Thigh Trust or Compression Test. This diagnostic threshold yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 76%. Testing sequence ought to be performed in a manner to minimize position changes for patient comfort and may include tests to diagnose comorbid hip pathology.

The Distraction Test

The patient lies supine with the examiner standing next to the patient at or just inferior to the level of the pelvis. Examiner will place each palm on the patient's ASIS while keeping elbows extended and apply an adequate posterolateral force directed at distracting the SI joints. The test is positive when the patient's pain is reproduced.

### Combining results from hip impingement and range of motion tests can increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with FAI syndrome [^1156TcW5]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of the present study was that the diagnostic accuracy for FAI syndrome can be improved when results from both hip impingement and range of motion tests are considered. The results show substantial agreement between two experienced raters for the AIMT, FADIR and FABER tests, moderate agreement for the DEXRIT and DIRIT, and poor agreement for the PRIMT. Moderate agreement was noted for all hip ROM tests, except the extension test, which showed poor agreement. The AIMT and FADIR test showed high sensitivity but low specificity in the diagnosis of FAI syndrome. The FABER test, DEXRIT and DIRIT showed moderate sensitivity and low to moderate specificity. Low sensitivity but high specificity was noted for ROM values rated as normal or decreased during internal rotation with a neutral hip position, external rotation with 90° of hip flexion, and abduction. Flexion and internal rotation with 90° of hip flexion exhibited moderate sensitivity and specificity.

The AIMT, FADIR, and FABER tests showed substantial agreement between two experienced raters. In line with these findings, Martin et al. reported substantial inter-rater agreement for the FABER test and moderate inter-rater agreement for the FADIR test. Ratzlaff et al. reported absolute agreement values for the AIMT, FADIR, and FABER that were comparable to our findings. However, no kappa values were reported in their study, and since absolute agreement values are limited due to the influence of chance and/or prevalent positive and negative outcomes, our results cannot easily be compared to their findings. Based on our results, which are supported by previous findings, the results from the AIMT, FADIR and FABER obtained from different raters may reliably be used in clinical practice as well as in research. The moderate agreement observed for the DEXRIT and DIRIT indicates that results obtained from different raters should be interpreted with caution. The PRIMT can be an inappropriate test for this patient group based on the poor inter-rater agreement observed.

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam or pincer morphology in individuals with suspected FAI syndrome: a systematic review [^1137ezSR]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methods

The review protocol was registered in the international Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews.

The Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews was used for the conduct of this study and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) checklist was used for reporting.

The search was conducted from inception to February 2019 in the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus (see online supplementary file 6 for the PubMed search strategy). Reference lists of included studies were checked for additional articles, and searches for papers cited in the included articles were performed using Google Scholar.

Selection criteria

Study design

Studies were included if: (1) they investigated the diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam, pincer or mixed morphology of the hip; (2) they included patients with symptoms such as groin, hip or buttock pain; (3) all patients underwent both an index test and a reference test that was able to identify cam or pincer morphology; and (4) the results allowed for the calculation of true or false positives and/or negatives. Studies including asymptomatic individuals and those classifying participants with labral tears only as true positives were excluded. No restrictions were set regarding the language of publication, study settings or the ages or previous surgical histories of included patients.

Index tests

Included studies had to describe a clinical test that was intended to identify cam, pincer or mixed morphology of the hip joint. All available clinical tests for FAI were accepted as index tests (ie, flexion-abduction-external rotation (FABER), flexion-adduction-internal rotation (FADIR), maximal squat test, and others).

Target condition

Patients had to show imaging findings of cam or pincer morphology, and could also exhibit labral or articular cartilage damage. Patients presenting with acetabular labral tears without any cam or pincer morphology were not classified as true positives.

Reference tests

MRA, MRI, CT and radiography were considered to be adequate reference tests. See online supplementary table 3S for a short description of the diagnostic accuracies of all reference tests used in the included studies and online supplementary table 4S for the reliability of plain radiography for measuring alpha angles.

Screening process

Titles and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers (RC and RH), and consensus was sought. The same procedure was applied for full texts of included references; in case of disagreement, a third reviewer decided.

### The interrater reliability of 4 clinical tests used to assess individuals with musculoskeletal hip pain [^115wP4fM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Descriptive and reliability study.

Objectives

To evaluate the interrater reliability of the FABER test, flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test, log roll test, and the palpation of the greater trochanter for tenderness.

Background

Clinical examination for individuals with musculoskeletal hip pain is believed to provide critical diagnostic information. However, there is very limited information in the literature on the reproducibility of examination techniques for the hip region.

Methods and Measures

Seventy subjects were evaluated prospectively by an orthopaedic surgeon and physical therapist. Subjects had a mean age of 42 years (range 18–76 years; SD 15.4) and included 32 (46%) females and 38 (54%) males. Subject diagnoses were as follows: degenerative joint disease (n = 27 [39% of subjects]), labral tear (n = 35 [50% of subjects]), femoroacetabular impingement (n = 48 [69% of subjects]), capsular laxity (n = 28 [40% of subjects]), trochanteric bursitis (n = 29 [41% of subjects]), iliopsoas tendonitis (n = 10 [14% of subjects]), and adductor strain (n = 2 [3% of subjects)]. Subjects could have more than 1 diagnosis. Kappa, prevalence indexes, bias indexes, and maximal attainable kappa were calculated.

Results

Kappa (kappa) coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were as follows: FABER test kappa was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.43–0.83); flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test kappa was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.29–0.87); log roll test kappa was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41–0.81); and greater trochanteric tenderness kappa was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.48–0.84). Bias indexes were low (0.06–0.08) for all 4 tests while prevalence indexes were low (0.03–0.37) for 3 of the 4 tests. The flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test had a high prevalence index (0.76), with a higher proportion of positive tests.

Conclusion

The kappa values for the FABER test, log roll test, and assessment of greater trochanteric tenderness were greater than 0.40 (fair level of agreement) at a 95% confidence level. The low reliability obtained for the flexion-internal rotation-adduction impingement test may be related to a prevalence concern.

### Hip MRI in flexion abduction external rotation for assessment of the ischiofemoral interval in patients with hip pain-a feasibility study [^113ft3GU]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischiofemoral impingement (IFI) is a cause of hip pain in young adults due to a mechanical conflict between the proximal femur and ischium, initially described between the lesser trochanter and ischial tuberosity. It is more common in women and is bilateral in one third of cases. Patients usually present with hip and buttock pain and a positive posterior impingement test (pain with combined extension-adduction-external rotation). In addition, a positive FABER test (pain with combined flexion-abduction-external rotation) also suggests IFI. These provocative tests lead to narrowing of the ischiofemoral interval and can provoke pain in the buttocks and groin. This is supposedly related to the abutment of the quadratus femoris muscle (QFM) and increased stress on the anterior chondro-labral junction by leverage of the femoral head and maltracking of the fovea capitis. Furthermore, many patients present with additional hip deformities such as femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) or developmental hip dysplasia and chondro-labral lesions making clinical diagnosis of IFI difficult.

The pathomechanics of IFI are poorly understood. Research into potential pathomechanisms have identified abductor insufficiency, increased femoral antetorsion, and valgus deformity as contributing factors. This has, in turn, led to the proposal of different treatment strategies.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fluid-sensitive sequences is vital in diagnosing IFI as it shows the narrowing of the ischiofemoral space (IFS) and QFM edema (QFME). However, current static MR imaging protocols do not directly visualize changes in the ischiofemoral interval. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an MRI protocol in which the hip is positioned in flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER) similar to the clinical test.

The aim of this study was to assess (1) the feasibility of performing FABER-MRI of the hip to visualize changes in the ischiofemoral interval, (2) changes in the ischiofemoral interval in normal and FABER positions depending on high/normal femoral torsion and/ or the presence of QFME, and (3) the relationship between the fovea capitis and the acetabular rim during FABER-MRI.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of pediatric hip pain [^114WxbQx]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Range of motion

Active movements. Hip flexion (most children can bring their knee to touch their chest; 120–135°), hip extension (30°), abduction (45–50°), adduction (20–30°).

Passive movements. Rotation measured with hip and knee flexed to 90°. Total internal and external rotation should equal 90°, internal rotation is greater with femoral anteversion and external rotation is greater with femoral retroversion. Femoral anteversion decreases with age (30° to 15°). If hip range of motion is normal in single planes, combined movement in the hip quadrant position (flexion, adduction, internal rotation) may reproduce pain, especially if there is intra-articular pathology as these movements decrease intracapsular volume.

Special tests

Thomas test for flexion contracture. Patient supine with level pelvis – place your hand under the patient's lumbar spine and flex one hip as far as possible. The patient's back should flatten and the extended leg should remain straight. A hip flexion contracture is present if the patient is unable to extend the leg straight without arching the spine. The degree of contracture is measured as the angle between the table and the leg at the point of greatest extension.

Trendelenburg Test. Positive when patient stands on one leg and the contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteals/hip abductor weakness.

Ober test for contraction of iliotibial band. Patient lying on their side with their affected leg uppermost. Abduct the leg and flex the knee to 90° while keeping the hip joint in neutral position and then bring the leg into slight hip extension and external rotation. On release of the leg the thigh should drop into an adducted position. The thigh will remain abducted in a positive test.

FABER or Patrick test. Patient lying supine and leg passively brought into Flexion, ABduction, External Rotation with foot resting on opposite knee. Press down gently but firmly on the flexed knee and the opposite anterior superior iliac crest. Pain may be felt in the groin with intraarticular hip pathology or SI joint region with SI pathology.

Flexibility

The hip should be moved thru active range of motion and then placed thru full passive range of motion. Muscles that span two joints are important for functional range of motion and should be tested independently (rectus femoris, biceps femoris).

### Doha agreement meeting on terminology and definitions in groin pain in athletes [^117S9LJZ]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Defined clinical entities for groin pain. Adductor-related groin pain: Adductor tenderness AND pain on resisted adduction testing. Iliopsoas-related groin pain: Iliopsoas tenderness+more likely if pain on resisted hip flexion AND/OR pain on hip flexor stretching. Inguinal-related groin pain: Pain in inguinal canal region AND tenderness of the inguinal canal. No palpable inguinal hernia is present. More likely if aggravated with abdominal resistance OR Valsalva/cough/sneeze. Pubic-related groin pain: Local tenderness of the pubic symphysis and the immediately adjacent bone. No particular resistance tests to test specifically for pubic-related groin pain.

There was agreement that pain from the hip joint should always be considered as a possible cause of groin pain.

History should focus on the onset, nature and location of the pain and mechanical symptoms such as catching, locking, clicking or giving way. It was acknowledged that hip-related groin pain can be hard to distinguish from other causes and that it may coexist with other types of groin pain. The group recommended that physical examination including a passive range of motion and hip special tests (Flexion-abduction-external rotation (FABER) and Flexion-adduction-internal rotation (FADIR) test) should be performed in all cases when athletes present with groin pain.

The expert group found it hard to recommend single discriminatory clinical tests to identify the hip as a cause of groin pain in athletes. Previous studies demonstrated that while hip surgeons often do perform certain special tests, there are a large number used in clinical practice. Most clinical tests for the hip joint have good sensitivity but poor specificity. This means that clinical tests can be useful in practice for excluding hip-related groin.

### Combining results from hip impingement and range of motion tests can increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with FAI syndrome [^116kp7Gd]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical examination is an important part in the diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome. However, knowledge on reliability and validity of clinical diagnostic tests is scarce. The aims were to evaluate the inter-rater agreement and diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests to detect patients with FAI syndrome.

Methods

Eighty-one patients (49% women) were recruited. Two experienced raters performed impingement and range of motion (ROM) tests. Three criteria had to be fulfilled for the diagnosis of FAI syndrome: (1) symptoms; (2) CAM and/or Pincer morphology; and (3) being responder to intra-articular block injection. For inter-rater agreement, the Cohen's kappa statistics were used (0.41–0.60 = moderate, 0.61–0.80 = substantial agreement). For diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated.

Results

Anterior impingement test (AIMT), FADIR test and FABER test showed kappa values above 0.6. All passive hip ROM, except extension, had kappa values above 0.4. AIMT and FADIR showed the highest sensitivity, i.e. 80%, with a specificity of 26% and 25%, respectively. Passive hip ROM in internal rotation with neutral hip position had a sensitivity of 29% and a specificity of 94%.

Conclusion

The AIMT, FADIR and FABER tests were reliable between two experienced raters, while results from different raters for hip ROM should be interpreted with caution. The AIMT and FADIR test can only be used to rule out patients with FAI syndrome, while evaluation of ROM in internal rotation with neutral position may be more suitable to rule in patients with FAI syndrome.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: a scoping review [^116CBQeA]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Peritrochanteric pathology

There are several pathologies that can affect the abductor muscle complex in the peritrochanteric space which can be broadly classified into (1) greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), (2) abductor tendon (gluteus medius/minimus) tears and (3) external snapping hip syndrome (ESHS).

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS)

GTPS is thought to be a degenerative condition affecting the abductor tendons and the bursae around them. GTPS has a female preponderance of 4:1 with the majority of the patients between the fourth and sixth decades of life. A varus femoral neck and females with increased gynoid adipose tissue are at a higher risk of developing GTPS. Spontaneous onset of lateral hip pain with point tenderness over the GT is suggestive of GTPS.

Clinical tests which help in the diagnosis of GTPS are inability to complete a single-leg stance for 30 s and inability to perform a resisted external derotation of the hip in the supine position with the hip flexed to 90° (Fig. 3) and in the prone position with hip extended. The resisted external derotation test is performed with the hip flexed to 90° and the hip being placed in full internal rotation and then the patient being asked to bring the leg to a neutral position against resistance. A positive test is indicated by pain or weakness. The sensitivity and specificity for single-leg stance was 100% and 97.3% and that for resisted external derotation of the hip in supine position was 88% and 97.3%, respectively, as correlated in the MRI study by Lequesne et al. This was also supported by the study by Ganderton et al. who reported that a positive hip flexion, abduction and external rotation (FABER) test, tenderness over GT, and a positive resisted hip abduction and external derotation test supported the diagnose of GTPS. Furthermore, a hip lag sign (Fig. 4), when correlated with an MRI, has been shown to be accurate in diagnosing hip abductor damage, with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 89%, 96%, 94% and 93%, respectively.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1116mF1G]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4.1.3 Labral tears

Two hip joint pathologies that mimic lumbosacral radiculopathy are labral tear and femoroacetabular impingement (see next section). Like AVN, these conditions are more common in younger adults.

The labrum of the hip joint is the fibrocartilaginous tissue that surrounds the acetabulum which plays a role in shock absorption, joint stability, and pressure distribution. Labral tears are associated with athletic activities and affect up to 55% of athletes who present with hip pain along with mechanical symptoms such as clicking, locking, and instability. Labral tears are more common in women, particularly between 15 and 41 years of age. Labral tears typically present with anterior groin pain, with nearly all patients who have arthroscopically diagnosed labral tears noting this symptom. However, pain attributable to labral tears can be felt in the lateral hip, or radiate to the buttocks or the knees, mimicking lumbosacral radiculopathy. Acetabular labral tears can be caused by trauma, joint hypermobility, age‐related degeneration, hip dysplasia such as shallow acetabulum and femoral/acetabular anteversion, and femoroacetabular impingement.

There are no specific physical exam maneuvers that distinguish an acetabular labral tear from other forms of intraarticular hip pathology such as osteoarthritis or AVN, but the Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation (the FABER test or maneuver) is commonly used to diagnose intraarticular hip pathology. The FABER test is positive when there is anterior hip/groin pain when the hip is placed in the Flexed, Abducted and Externally Rotated hip position. In one small case series, the sensitivity of the FABER test was 0.88 for intraarticular hip pathology identified on hip arthroscopy. Another labral test is the hip scour test; it has a sensitivity 0.62 and a specificity 0.75 for detecting hip intraarticular pathology. The scour test is positive if it elicits groin pain and is performed with the hip in flexion, while an axial loading force is applied as the hip moves into abduction with hip external rotation and then adduction with hip internal rotation. Because the scour test also loads the lumbosacral spine, it may elicit low back pain; therefore, it is important to note the location of the patient's pain when performing this test.

Accuracy

The test accuracy of each index test is presented using forest plots (figure 3). Sensitivity could be calculated for each of the index tests, and ranged from 0.11 (IR ROM and f90 IR, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.18) to 1.00 (IROP, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.00). The lowest sensitivity occurred in ROM tests, ranging from 0.11 to 0.22, and in PIT, ranging from 0.18 to 0.21.

Forest plots of included clinical tests (see online supplementary file 4 for true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives). Red point estimates and CIs in the forest plot indicate high risk of bias (at least one item at high risk of bias), orange indicates unclear risk of bias (at least one unclear risk of bias and no high risk of bias), green indicates all risk of bias items at low risk. add, adduction; AIT, anterior impingement test; C, compression; f90, flexion 90°; f120, flexion 120°; FABER, flexion-abduction-external rotation; FADIR, flexion-adduction-internal rotation; FLEX, flexion; FPAW, foot progression angle walking; IR, internal rotation; IROP, internal rotation over pressure; MRA, magnetic resonance arthrography; ROM, range of motion; RSLR, resisted straight leg raise.

Specificity could be calculated for nine tests in five studies. The FPAW had the highest specificity at 0.56 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.66). The FADIR had the lowest specificity at 0.11 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.20).

### Greater trochanteric pain syndrome: defining the clinical syndrome [^116xceRo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Effective treatment of hip pain improves population health and quality of life. Accurate differential diagnosis is fundamental to effective treatment. The diagnostic criteria for one common hip problem, greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) have not been well defined.

Purpose

To define the clinical presentation of GTPS.

Methods

Forty-one people with GTPS, 20 with hip osteoarthritis (OA), and 23 age-matched and sex-matched asymptomatic participants (ASC) were recruited. Inclusion and exclusion criteria ensured mutually exclusive groups.

Assessment

the Harris hip score (HHS), a battery of clinical tests, and single leg stance (SLS). Participants identified the site of reproduced pain.

Analysis

Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) informed recursive partitioning to develop two classification trees.

Results

Maximum walking distance and the ability to manipulate shoes and socks were the only HHS domains to differentiate GTPS from OA (ANOVA: p = 0.010 and < 0.001); OR (95% CI) of 3.47 (1.09 to 10.93) and 0.06 (0.00 to 0.26), respectively. The lateral hip pain (LHP) classification tree: (dichotomous LHP associated with a flexion abduction external rotation (FABER) test) had a mean (SE) sensitivity and specificity of 0.81 (0.019) and 0.82 (0.044), respectively. A non-specific hip pain classification tree had a mean (SE) sensitivity and specificity of 0.78 (0.058) and 0.28 (0.080).

Conclusions

Patients with LHP in the absence of difficulty with manipulating shoes and socks, together with pain on palpation of the greater trochanter and LHP with a FABER test are likely to have GTPS.

Hip impingement tests

The six impingement tests were performed according to the methods described by Martin et al. (Fig. 1 a–f). All tests were performed in a supine position. The patients were instructed to report any pain in the hip and/or groin area. The test results were categorized as either (1) negative (no pain) or (2) positive (the patient's typical hip and/or groin pain was reproduced).

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for cam or pincer morphology in individuals with suspected FAI syndrome: a systematic review [^111xAnGt]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

LRs could be calculated for nine tests. The LRs only allow for small changes from pretest to post-test probabilities. However, the combination of three negative test results in the FADIR, FPAW and maximal squat tests yielded an LR− of 0.15. Unexpected results were obtained for the Stinchfield and FABER tests, where the LR+ was below 1 and the LR− above 1. These two tests were investigated in the same study, with a prevalence of FAI morphology of 10%. All subjects were suspected to have intra-articular pathology, which might explain the high false positive rate.

A higher suspicion of cam and pincer morphology may result in a higher sensitivity of clinical tests, because evaluators might rate the test as positive in cases where the result is less clear; this would in turn decrease the number of false negatives. Three studiesincluded only patients with confirmed FAI deformities. In two studies, the raters were aware of this fact, while in one study the manuscript was unclear regarding the blinding status.

The reference test in most of the included studies was radiography, though one studyused three different imaging techniques (MRI, MRA, X-ray) and oneused MRI/MRA. Further, the included studies showed varying criteria for positivity of the reference test. They defined different alpha angle values for the diagnosis of cam morphology, as well as varying positivity criteria for pincer morphology, making them difficult to compare. Of the three tests proposed for our test combination, the maximal squat test was compared with MRI/MRA (head-neck offset < 9 mm or alpha angle > 55°), while the FPAW and the FADIR were compared with radiography (alpha angle > 60°).

It is known that cam or pincer morphology can lead to labral and cartilage damage. Both types of damage are considered to be risk factors for early degenerative processes and osteoarthritis of the hip joint, due to reduced hip joint motions, elevated contact pressures and shear stress caused by cam and pincer deformities. It is important to recognise that lesions of the labrum can occur as a consequence of impingement but are not present in all cases. Thus, studies including participants who have only labral lesions are not appropriate for assessing the accuracy of tests for cam or pincer morphology. There is an association between cam morphology and the development of osteoarthritis, whereas pincer morphology (in contrast to acetabular dysplasia) does not seem to be a risk factor for osteoarthritis.

### Adolescent elite skiers with and without cam morphology did change their hip joint range of motion with 2 years follow-up [^1144tJ31]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Hip ER, in the present study, was shown to be in line with earlier studies in athletes when compared at baseline, whilst the results from the follow-up are approximately 10° lower for both the cam and no-cam group. This may be due to an actual reduction in the hip joint ROM or muscular stiffness in the hip rotators, as a response to the alpine skiing.

The FABER test is commonly used as a diagnostic test in patients with hip and/or groin pain and is considered positive if the pain is reproduced and/or there is a decrease in ROM as compared with the non-affected leg. The most common method to measure hip ROM with the FABER test is with a stick between the lateral femoral condyle on the test side and the examination table. However, this method has not been able to distinguish between cam and no-cam morphology. In the present study, the hip ROM in FABER test was measured with a digital goniometer and the results were shown to conflict. The no-cam group had significantly lesser angle in the right hip from baseline to the follow-up, this was not shown for the cam group. In the left hip, none of the groups reached significant levels. Moreover, when comparing the groups from baseline to follow-up, there was no difference in either hip. Some previous studies, using this angle-measuring method, could not either report an association between hip ROM in the FABER test and participants with cam morphology. As the intra- and interobserver reliability was shown to be good to excellent in the present study, the likelihood of measurement errors due to the examiners is reduced. One may, therefore, speculate if the FABER test should be a predictor for hip ROM in patients with hip/groin pain, regardless of using the stick or the goniometer.

Clinical assessment

The clinical assessment of the hip included clinically relevant hip impingement tests, as described by Martin et al.: the Anterior Impingement Test (AIMT), Flexion/Adduction/Internal Rotation (FADIR) test, Flexion/Abduction/External Rotation (FABER) test, Dynamic External Rotatory Impingement Test (DEXRIT), Dynamic Internal Rotatory Impingement Test (DIRIT), Posterior Rim Impingement Test (PRIMT), and passive ROM (flexion, internal rotation with 90° of hip flexion, internal rotation with a neutral hip position, external rotation with 90° of hip flexion, abduction and extension). All participants were assessed by an orthopedic surgeon (IK). To evaluate the inter-rater agreement, the first 69 participants (hips, n = 138) recruited for the study were assessed by both an orthopedic surgeon (IK) and a physical therapist (AP) in a random order. The two raters examined each patient within 1 hour. Both raters had extensive clinical experience in the assessment and treatment of people with hip and groin pain, they examined the patients independently in separate rooms, and they were blinded to the results of the other rater. Prior to the data collection, the raters practiced administering the tests together on two occasions for calibration purposes, and the criteria for a negative/positive test result were agreed upon.

Structural hip instability — suspicion and ICF joint pain/stability impairment: This diagnosis can be suspected when anterior groin, lateral hip, or generalized hip joint pain is reported with pain reproduced by the FADIR test or the flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test, a positive hip apprehension sign, hip internal rotation greater than 30° when the hip is at 90° of flexion, and radiographic evidence of decreased femoral head coverage including lateral center edge of Wiberg less than 25° or anterior center-edge angle less than 20°.

### Hip MRI in flexion abduction external rotation for assessment of the ischiofemoral interval in patients with hip pain-a feasibility study [^1143ptCo]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the aforementioned studies, we aimed to adapt one of the two established clinical tests used for the diagnosis of IFI for MRI. The FABER test was chosen since the posterior impingement test would require prone patient positioning which would be time-consuming and difficult to standardize. However, it is important to note that this test is not specific for IFI and, like most clinical tests, has only moderate diagnostic efficacy. In the clinical setting, the FABER test is completed by applying progressive force to the knee to determine whether the test is positive or negative. FABER-MRI of the hip was feasible, and in our study, no patient requested termination of the examination. Interestingly, in the FABER position, the lesser trochanter moved more anteriorly and "out of plane" which prevented us from measuring the IFS. By contrast, we observed narrowing between the intertrochanteric ridge and the ischial tuberosity, especially at the proximal portion of the ridge, leading to an overall mean narrowing of 26 ± 7 mm (40 ± 8 mm vs 14 ± 9 mm) with FABER-MRI. In addition, we could identify a correlation between increasing femoral torsion and narrowing of the PID (r p = .41) and DID (r p = .38). Our results confirm the findings of a previous study using virtual, dynamic CT-based simulation of the FABER test using collision detection software. In that study, the intertrochanteric ridge and greater trochanter were identified as impingement location in 67% and 62%, respectively when simulating the FABER test in 40° of external hip rotation.

The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

Hip osteoarthritis — differential diagnosis and examination measures: The following differential diagnoses should be considered in an individual with signs or symptoms suggestive of hip OA: bursitis or tendinitis, chondral damage or loose bodies, femoral neck or pubic ramus stress fracture, labral tear, muscle strain, neoplasm, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, Paget's disease, piriformis syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, septic hip arthritis, and referred pain as a result of an L2-3 radiculopathy. The following physical examination measures may be helpful in the differential diagnostic process when differentiating hip pain from other sources of pain: the Scour test for labral tears, FABER (Patrick's) test for labral tears, Fitzgerald's test for labral tears, flexion-adduction internal rotation tests for labral tears, sacroiliac joint provocation tests for sacroiliac joint pain, and the femoral nerve stretch test for L2-3 radiculopathy. Clinicians should consider diagnostic classifications other than osteoarthritis of the hip when the patient's history, reported activity limitations, or impairments of body function and structure are not consistent with those presented in the diagnosis/classification section of this guideline, or, when the patient's symptoms are not diminishing with interventions aimed at normalization of the patient's impairments of body function.

Descriptions of included index tests

Fourteen of the analysed index tests were pain provocation tests: the maximal squat test, the FABER test, the log roll test, the resisted straight leg raise test (Stinchfield test), the FADIR test (anterior impingement test, flexion 90-adduction-internal rotation test (f90 add IR)), the PIT, the scour test, the internal rotation over pressure (IROP) test, the flexion plus IR pain test, the foot progression angle walking (FPAW) test, the IR pain test, the f120 add IR, the flexion 90-adduction-compression test (f90 add C)and the f120 add C. Five tests were range of motion (ROM) tests: two studies used the FABER distance testto compare the unaffected and affected hips in terms of loss of distance between the knee and examination table; there were also two passive hip ROM testsand two combinations of an ROM test plus a pain provocation test.

Quality assessment and GRADE

Judgements of risks of bias and concerns regarding applicability were made using the QUADAS-2 tool, as shown in figure 2. Four studies showed a high risk of bias or concerns regarding applicability in at least one domain. Only one studywas classified as having no risk of bias and no applicability concerns. In two studies, the investigators were informed before the testing that only participants with confirmed cam or pincer morphology were included. Ratings with GRADEpro demonstrated moderate-quality evidence for both the sensitivity and specificity of the FPAW testand the maximal squat test, as well as for the specificity of the FABER distance test. All other index tests showed low to very-low-quality evidence according to the GRADEpro rating. A short overview is presented in table 1; for the detailed grading of evidence see online supplementary file 5.

### Hip arthroscopy enables classification and treatment of precollapse subchondral insufficiency fracture of the femoral head associated intra-articular pathology [^116HxkVT]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

One patient was diagnosed as SIFFH at 12 months due to persistent pain after internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture and was excluded because of prior ipsilateral hip surgery. Nine patients met the inclusion criteria at minimum 12-month follow-up (median, 30.0 months, range 12–56).

Regarding other bony abnormalities associated with SIFFH, including FAI and BDDH, clinical inclusion criteria were groin pain for more than 3 months, restricted hip ROM (flexion < 105° and/or restricted internal rotation in flexion < 20°), positive flexion abduction external rotation test (FABER) and a positive anterior impingement test. The hip dial test was utilized to detect anterior capsular laxity. It is performed with the patient supine and the hip in neutral extension. The leg is internally rotated and then released to allow for relaxed external rotation. A positive test is defined as greater external rotation of the affected hip than that of the contralateral hip.

Radiographic evidence of a cam deformity (alpha angle > 55° or head–neck offset < 8 mm on at least one radiographic view or computed tomography CT or magnetic resonance imaging MRI), and/or pincer deformity, defined as lateral CE angle (LCEA) from well-centred AP pelvic radiograph > 25° plus crossover sign, coxa profunda, or posterior wall sign, and/or prominence of the ischial spine sign. Patients with LCEA ranging from 20° to 24° were diagnosed as BDDH. Physical examination was also performed to evaluate impingement and instability of the hip joint. Exclusion criteria included patients who had only non-surgical treatment, femoral head osteonecrosis or follow-up period less than 1 year.

### Hip arthroscopy and femoroacetabular impingement in the pediatric patient [^1161kkJV]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is widely understood to be an underlying etiology of injuries to the acetabular labrum and cartilage in the adult hip, although somewhat less attention has previously been spent on its incidence in the pediatric and adolescent populations. Initially recognized as a consequence of periacetabular osteotomies performed for developmental dysplasia of the hip, it can also be because of a number of other disorders or to a developmental process causing irregular bony growth. The adolescent presenting with FAI is athletic, particularly in endeavors placing excessive stress on the hip and surrounding soft tissues. The pain is characterized as sharp, localized around the anatomic femoral head location, and may be associated with catching or popping. Complete physical examination includes full range of motion testing, as a hallmark of FAI is restriction and pain with internal rotation. Special tests include the anterior impingement test, the FABER test, and the dial test. Imaging includes anteroposterior pelvic and cross-table lateral radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment in all patients is 6 weeks of conservative therapy. If patients see no improvement with conservative treatment, they may be candidates for hip arthroscopy. Arthroscopic treatment of FAI includes rim trimming for pincer lesions, osteoplasty for cam decompression and labral detachment, and repair or reconstruction for labral tears. Studies have shown improvements in the modified Harris Hip Score and the Hip Outcomes Score postoperatively. As FAI is diagnosed most frequently in athletes, and it is estimated that 30 to 45 million adolescents 6 and 18 years old are involved in sports, it is becoming imperative to identify factors that may predict its development, study treatments, and improve outcomes.

Materials and methods

Patients

Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved a single-center, retrospective observational study conducted at a primary referral center for joint preserving hip surgery in Austria. The study was performed with a written informed consent waiver. We included all patients with a clinical diagnosis of IFI who underwent CT-guided injection of local anesthetic into the IFS at our institution between June 2019 and April 2021. The overall study cohort was 13 hips (11 patients). Patient records were studied for subsequent surgeries.

Clinical diagnosis of IFI

Diagnosis of IFI was primarily based on the clinical presentation. This was a typical history of pain in conjunction with pain during clinical examination, and a positive FABER and/or posterior impingement test. The suspected clinical diagnosis of IFI was subsequently confirmed by IFI-typical morphology (narrowing of the IFS or QFM edema, Fig. 1A) and the absence of other causes of secondary IFI on diagnostic imaging such as tumors or tumor-like lesions.

### Successful diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction [^111pwwxp]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

When patients report posterior hip or low back pain below the level L5 or the beltline, various causes other than sacroiliitis should be considered, including seronegative spondyloarthropathies, posterior femoro-acetabular pathology, proximal hamstring tendinopathy, piriformis syndrome, stress fracture of the sacrum, and referred pain from lumbar spinal pathology including lumbosacral facet-mediated pain and proximal L5 radiculopathy. Although there are some overlapping characteristics amongst these other diagnoses, the following list helps to correlate various differentials with their particular findings.
Localization of pain to the spine or radiating pain into the lower extremities with a positive straight leg raise may suggest a spinal or spinal nerve pathology.
Concomitant anterior and posterior hip pain with a FABER test producing pain localizing in the groin area may point towards femoro-acetabular pathology.
Tenderness to palpation over the body of the piriformis muscle with a positive FADIR (Hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation) test may suggest piriformis syndrome.
Perineal pain worsened with palpation over the ischial spine may point toward a pudendal neuropathy.
Patients with reproducible pain along with the proximal hamstring muscle or tendon through various active, passive and resisted range of motion may have a hamstring strain, rupture, or tendinopathy.
Axial low back pain that is worse with lumbar extension and positive for lumbar facet loading may be indicative of lumbar facet arthropathy.
Pain localized over the inferior sacrum and coccygeal region may represent sacrocoxalgia or coccydynia.

Understanding the relationship between these various findings and correlated pathologies is crucial to identifying and appropriately addressing a patient's source of low back and posterior hip pain. It is not uncommon for SIJ pain to present concomitantly with some of these other underlying pathologies and having them in your differential will help formulate an appropriate treatment plan for the patient.

### Groin pain syndrome Italian consensus conference on terminology, clinical evaluation and imaging assessment in groin pain in athlete [^112NVYib]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Thus based on both on the literature reviewand on present expert opinion, the second document was approved concerning clinical examination. The clinical examinations approved and recommended during the consensus were categorised as follows:
First category: specific test for adductor muscles Palpation of the pubic insertion at common rectus abdominis/adductor longus aponeurosis. Isometric squeeze test with proximal resistance (at knee level). Isometric squeeze test with distal resistance (at ankles level). Isometric squeeze test with distal resistance and abducted legs. Isometric squeeze with flexed knee and proximal resistance. Isometric squeeze test performed separately with the two legs with the use of a dynamometer (I).

Notes: (I) Optional test, but strongly recommended, especially in case of unilateral pain.
Second category: specific test for abdominal muscles Palpation of the pubic insertion at common rectus abdominis/adductor longus Rectus abdominis eccentric test Sit-up pain test Obliquus abdominis eccentric test
Third category: specific test for the hip joint Hip joint intra and extra- rotation measurement Flexion Abduction External Rotation (FABER) test Flexion Adduction Internal Rotation (FADIR) test Dynamic internal rotatory impingement test (DIRIT) Dynamic external rotatory impingement test (DEXTRIT) Posterior rim impingement test Lateral rim impingement test
Fourth category: clinical evaluation of inguinal diseases

Palpation and clinical evaluation of the following anatomical structures:
Pubic tubercle
Pubic crest
Linea pectinea
Superior pubic ramus
Superficial inguinal ring
Inferior crus(inferolateral pillar or external pillar)
Superior crus (superomedial pillar or internal pillar)

It is important to note that the exact technical application of all proposed examination tests was also discussed, and during the discussion it has also emerged that the clinician, with respect to the investigated pathology, can also adopt other clinical tests at his/her own discretion.

Furthermore, as part of the second consensus document, the use of Copenhagen Hip And Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) patient-reported outcome measures in its validated Italian formhas been approved as a part of the medical history. The HAGOS questionnaire represents an important tool for the assessment of symptoms, activity limitations and participation-restrictions in physically active patients with GrPS. HAGOS is recommended as an important tool to assess the patient's quality of life in an objective manner.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of low back pain in children and adolescents [^117W2D5p]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

4. Special tests

Scoliosis test (Adams Forward Bend Test)

Patient standing and instructed to forward flex with the feet together and knees straight. The curve of structural scoliosis is more apparent when bending over and the examiner may observe an imbalanced rib cage, with one side being higher than the other.

Modified Schober's test for lumbosacral spine mobility

Patient standing and measurements made 10 cm above and 5 cm below the lumbosacral junction (dimples of Venus). Repeat measurement with patient in full forward flexion. In general, the measure should increase by at least 6 cm to 21 cm. An increase of less than 6 cm suggests decreased lumbar spinal mobility, which may be seen in spodyloarthropathies. (Figure 1)

Figure 1
Modified Schober's Test. Patient standing and measurements made 10 cm above and 5 cm below the lumbosacral junction (dimples of Venus, iliac crest line). Repeat measurement with patient in full forward flexion.

Straight leg raise

Patient supine and the examiner lifts the leg keeping the knee straight, while supporting the calcaneus. Normal range is 80 degrees. If the patient has tight hamstrings, they may localize pain to the hamstring area. If the patient has sciatic pain, the patient may experience pain extending down the back of the leg or in the back. Lowering the leg 15 degrees and dorsiflexing the foot to stretch the sciatic nerve should reproduce sciatic pain. If pain persists it is sciatica, if not it is likely tight hamstrings.

FABER or Patrick test

Patient lying supine and leg passively brought into Flexion, ABduction, External Rotation with foot resting on opposite knee. Press down gently but firmly on the flexed knee and the opposite anterior superior iliac crest. Pain may be felt in the groin with intraarticular hip pathology or SI joint region with SI pathology.

Trendelenburg Test

Positive when patient stands on one leg and the contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteals/hip abductor weakness. There are many conditions that may weaken the hip abductors including musculoskeletal and neurologic problems.

5. Flexibility

The back and hips should be moved through active and passive range of motion.

Hamstring flexibility is determined by measuring the popliteal angle. The hips and knees are flexed to 90 degrees and then the examiner extends the knee until there is firm resistance. An angle greater than 45 degrees or asymmetry is common with tight hamstrings and low back pain.

Results

Inter-rater agreement

The kappa values were greater than 0.6 for the AIMT, FADIR and FABER tests, greater than 0.4 for DEXRIT and DIRIT, and less than 0.4 for the PRIMT. The absolute agreement ranged between 80 and 83% (Table 2). For the passive hip ROM, the kappa values were greater than 0.4 for flexion, internal rotation with 90° of hip flexion, internal rotation with a neutral hip position, external rotation with 90° of hip flexion and abduction, and they were less than 0.4 for extension. The absolute agreement ranged from 78 to 91% (Table 2). Detailed inter-rater agreement data for the two raters are presented in the Appendix.

Table 2
Kappa values, 95% confidence intervals (CI 95%) and absolute agreement (%) for the hip impingement tests and the ROM tests (hips, n = 138)

Diagnostic accuracy

Of the 81 participants, 7 were excluded due to missing radiographs or missing Lauenstein projections, and 11 participants were excluded because they either declined the injection or failed to complete the VAS scoring after the injection. Thus, 63 participants [6 with bilateral symptoms and 57 with unilateral symptoms (hips n = 69)] were included in the analysis. The results for the criteria used as reference standards are described in Table 3. The PRIMT and passive extension data were excluded from the analysis of diagnostic accuracy due to poor inter-rater agreement.

### Demystifying the clinical diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome in women [^113Wj3BB]. Journal of Women's Health (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 10 clinical tests that can be used in the diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) in women, and to compare these clinical tests to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-eight participants with GTPS (49.5 ± 22.0 years) and 18 asymptomatic participants (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 52.5 ± 22.8 years) were included. A blinded physiotherapist performed 10 pain provocation tests potentially diagnostic for GTPS-palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted external derotation test, modified resisted external derotation test, standard and modified Ober's tests, Patrick's or FABER test, resisted hip abduction, single-leg stance test, and the resisted hip internal rotation test. A sample of 16 symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic women undertook a hip MRI scan. Gluteal tendons were evaluated and categorized as no pathology, mild tendinosis, moderate tendinosis/partial tear, or full-thickness tear.

Results

Clinical test analyses show high specificity, high positive predictive value, low to moderate sensitivity, and negative predictive value for most clinical tests. All symptomatic and 88% of asymptomatic participants had pathological gluteal tendon changes on MRI, from mild tendinosis to full-thickness tear.

Conclusions

The study found the Patrick's or FABER test, palpation of the greater trochanter, resisted hip abduction, and the resisted external derotation test to have the highest diagnostic test accuracy for GTPS. Tendon pathology on MRI is seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111fzxKn]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

GTPS can be difficult to distinguish from radiculopathies for several reasons. First, the distribution of pain may approximate L3, L4, or L5 radiculopathies due to the common complaint of pain radiating along the lateral thigh in a distal fashion. Second, patients with GTPS often have history and physical examination findings also found in radiculopathy, such as pain in the thigh (58%), pain below the knee (67%), and ipsilateral lower extremity weakness (62%). Finally, patients with radiculopathy are at an increased risk of GTPS due to biomechanical alterations, such as Trendelenberg gait, and patients with painful lower extremity conditions are at increased risk of lumbosacral radiculopathy due to imbalances in the spine. Biomechanical alterations associated with gluteus medius weakness can lead to GTPS, so clinicians should strongly consider the possibility that GTPS may occur concurrently with L5/S1 radiculopathy.

GTPS is characterized by pain at the lateral hip which may radiate down the lateral thigh, point tenderness at the greater trochanter (Figure 2) with palpation or lying on the affected side, pain with resisted hip abduction in side‐lying, and lateral hip pain at end‐range motion for hip Flexion, ABduction, and External Rotation (i.e. the FABER test, sometimes termed Patrick's test). Ober's test, in which patients lie in lateral decubitus with the affected side up while the examiner passively abducts and extends the hip, and lowers the leg slowly to its passive resting position, is frequently used in the evaluation of patients with suspected GTPS. However, studies cast doubt on the utility of Ober's test and the modified Ober's test for this diagnosis. Pain may also occur with activity, prolonged standing, and transitions from sitting to standing. The onset of pain may be insidious, secondary to biomechanical alterations such as Trendelenberg gait or post‐hip arthroplasty, or may be traumatic, such as after a fall.

### Hip MRI in flexion abduction external rotation for assessment of the ischiofemoral interval in patients with hip pain-a feasibility study [^116qLXy2]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, a PID of ≤ 7 mm in the FABER position predicted QFME with an accuracy similar to using ≤ 20 mm as threshold for the IFS. Thus, crush QFME could also result from impingement between the greater trochanter and/or the intertrochanteric ridge with the ischial tuberosity. This seems intuitive considering the fact that the footprint of the quadratus femoris muscle is located at the posteromedial aspect of the proximal femur at the intertrochanteric ridge.

Since the optimal surgical treatment of young patients with IFI is controversial and ranges from resection of the lesser trochanter to femoral derotation osteotomy, we believe that MRI visualization of the impingement location could be helpful for surgical decision making.

This study has limitations. First, we did not integrate the FABER-MRI into our institutional routine protocol. This was related to the fact that direct MR arthrography of the hip is routinely performed in our institution and there were concerns that intra-articular injection and subsequent FABER positioning may be too uncomfortable. However, we did not test this hypothesis nor did we implement the FABER position into a standard non-contrast MRI protocol of the hip. Since all study participants were able to complete the FABER-MRI examination it could be performed before the arthrography or be included into a non-contrast hip MRI examination in the future and thus be integrated more easily into clinical routine. Second, FABER-MRI was performed on a scanner with a 70-cm gantry. While image acquisition was feasible and tolerated throughout our study this may be more difficult when either using a scanner with a 60-cm gantry, or in a more obese population. Third, there were only 8 hips (7%) with QFME. Although this reflects the rarity of ischiofemoral impingement in the FAI population as a whole, these limitations do not allow us to draw conclusions about the actual clinical utility of FABER MRI. This emphasizes the need for future, prospective studies of patients undergoing subsequent surgery and appropriate follow-up to evaluate the added benefit of FABER-MRI in patients with suspected IFI. Fourth, unlike the clinical test in which progressive force is applied to the ipsilateral knee we decided to perform the MRI in a static FABER position. This position was considered easier to implement and to standardize than a dynamic motion protocol. However, dynamic assessment of hip motion using sequences with high temporal resolution would yield the potential advantage of a "real time" visualization of the impingement conflict at the maximum individual passive range of motion. In conclusion, FABER-MRI of the hip is feasible, allows assessment of changes in the ischiofemoral interval proximal to the lesser trochanter, and detects foveal excursion. It enables the detection of "intertrochanteric type" IFI and possibly hip instability. We feel FABER-MRI has great potential to improve our understanding and surgical decision-making in IFI.

### Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain: an update [^113vM5sE]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Tenderness to deep palpation of the suprapubic and sacroiliac area along the course of the long posterior sacroiliac and sacrotuberous ligaments, as well as a palpable step of the pubic symphysis joint, may be evident. Signs of local inflammation (erythema, oedema, warmth) may exist in a small percentage of the cases.

A wide variety of clinical examinations have been evaluated regarding their usefulness in the assessment and differential diagnosis of PPGP. Earlier studies were more focused on deep palpation and radiologic findings, while lately the weight of diagnosis has shifted toward the cumulative results of specific pain provocation tests. For the posterior elements of the pelvic girdle and the sacroiliac joints, the most reliable examinations are the posterior pelvic pain provocation test (P4/thigh thrust), the Patrick's FABER (flexion, abduction, external rotation at the hip), the active straight leg raise (ASLR), the long dorsal ligament and the Gaenslen tests. With regard to the pubic symphysis, the diagnosis is based mostly on deep palpation and the modified Trendelenburg test.

Because most of these tests have a proven high specificity but lower sensitivity, there appears to be a consensus for the combined use of all of these tests to minimise false-negative results. Leadbetter et al. described a scoring system to guide clinicians in screening the general pregnant patient population. In that system, they included five essential symptoms: pain of the pubic symphysis on walking, while standing on one leg, while climbing stairs, or while turning over in bed, as well as a history of damage to the pelvis or the lumbosacral area.

Laboratory blood tests are usually normal, with a nonspecific mild elevation of the acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) in a number of cases. However, for reasons related to differential diagnosis, most authors report acquiring a complete blood count, biochemistry and urine analysis.

### Radiofrequency ablation of the trochanteric branches of the femoral nerve for the treatment of greater trochanteric syndrome [^115f9aKY]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patient Selection

The subjects in this case series were eight consecutive patients who received RFA of the nervus femoralis to the trochanter at the University of Wisconsin Department of Anesthesiology. Patients were given a diagnosis of GTPS if their presenting complaint was consistent with lateral hip pain near the greater trochanter that increased with ambulation, prolonged standing, and other forms of exertion as well as other physical exam findings. Physical exam findings necessary to confirm GTPS were either the presence of a Trendelenburg gait in the absence of antalgic limp with high clinical suspicion or confirmatory testing via FABER test, resisted external derotation test, or tenderness to palpation of the greater trochanter with high clinical suspicion. All patients underwent a trial of conservative management, including pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and/or steroid injection. Prior to undergoing RFA, patients are generally required to first undergo two separate nerve blocks to confirm that the intended location for RFA will be effective in modulating pain. All patients presented in this report have not been previously reported in any other body of work.

Consent and Institutional Review Board Approval

This case series was deemed exempt by the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health Institutional Review Board, as this was a retrospective study with data collection from an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) without the need to contact patients. The Declaration of Helsinki was adhered to throughout the investigation.

### CT-guided infiltration of the ischiofemoral space in young patients with ischiofemoral impingement is an effective diagnostic tool [^113x9xbR]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischiofemoral impingement (IFI) is more common in women and often occurs bilaterally. The underlying abnormal narrowing of the space between the ischium and the posterior part of the proximal femur not only causes symptoms in older patients, but has also been identified as a cause of hip pain in young patients. Patients with IFI usually complain of pain in the hip and/or buttocks. The clinical diagnosis is based on the reproduction of the known pain during movement patterns that lead to a further narrowing of the already reduced ischiofemoral space (IFS). This includes long stride-walking, a combined flexion–abduction–external rotation movement (FABER test), or during combined extension–adduction–external rotation (posterior impingement test). However, pain during normal gait or at rest accompanied by a sensation of clicking or snapping may also occur. The etiology of IFI is multifactorial and implicates abnormal shape of the pelvis and ischium, femoral malalignment, as well as functional factors such as muscular dysbalance. Imaging diagnosis of IFI is based on static or dynamic visualization of the narrowing of the IFS in combination with a quadratus femoris muscle (QFM) edema on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fluid-sensitive sequences. Treatment strategies for IFI depend on the underlying etiology and on the patient's age. In young patients with femoral malalignment due to excessively high femoral torsion, femoral derotational osteotomies or resection of the lesser trochanter have been introduced for surgical treatment of IFI. However, in practice, it is often difficult to establish a clinical diagnosis of IFI.

Recently corticoid and local anesthetic injections into the IFS have been proposed as a diagnostic, or even therapeutic tool. To date, this is yet to be applied in young patients who are eligible for joint-preserving hip surgery. Thus the aim of this study was to describe our technique of diagnostic computed tomography (CT)-guided injection of the IFS. In addition, we report on the pain response, complications, and imaging findings in young IFI patients undergoing evaluation for surgical correction of IFI.

### Telemedicine in the era of COVID-19: the virtual orthopaedic examination [^1167JK9X]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2020). Medium credibility.

Hip

Many examination methods described above are applicable to the hip. The examination of the hip additionally includes the evaluation of the leg length, range of motion, and location of pain. For leg length, a virtual ruler can be used to make side-to-side comparisons of the measurements of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the floor. Patients can be asked to place a finger on the ASIS to assist with finding this landmark for measurement.

To measure hip flexion, the patient is asked to lie back with one side to the camera and to pull the knee to the chest. The measurements of internal and external rotation are obtained by having the patient sit in a chair facing the camera and rotating the hip with the knee bent at 90° (Fig. 2). External rotation can be assessed by asking the patient to initiate crossing the legs or placing them in a figure-of-4 position. Localization of pain and tenderness is assessed by asking the patient to point to this area and can include the C sign.

Fig. 2
External rotation of the hip can be measured by having the patient sit in a chair facing the camera and rotating the hip with the knee bent at 90°.

In atraumatic cases, flexion, adduction, and internal rotation (FADIR) and flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER) tests may be performed by demonstrating (or providing a visual example of) the test and having the patient mimic this motion, to help differentiate between hip and spine-related pain. Strength testing can be important to rule out spine-related symptoms and to identify muscle groups that can be targeted for rehabilitation. A straight-leg raise to test for hip strength and pain is performed. The evaluation of abduction strength in the side-lying position (gluteus medius, L5) can be assessed. Having the patient perform toe-walking can demonstrate strength in L5/S1 and having the patient perform heel-walking can demonstrate strength in L4. Hip extension strength (gluteals, L5/S1) can be assessed by having the patient arise from a chair without using the arms to assist (Fig. 3).

Hip extension strength can be assessed by having the patient sit back in a chair and arise without using the arms to assist.

### Is a positive femoroacetabular impingement test a common finding in healthy young adults? [^116GGBYS]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is an incompletely understood clinical concept that implies pathomechanical changes in the hip as a cause for hip-related pain in young adults. While a positive anterior impingement test is suggestive of FAI, its association with clinical and radiographic findings remain unconfirmed in healthy young adults.

Questions/Purposes

We determined the prevalence of a positive test in 1170 young adults and examined its possible associations with (1) self-reported hip discomfort for the past 3 months; (2) weekly physical exercise; (3) hip ROM; and (4) radiographic findings associated with femoroacetabular impingement.

Methods

We invited 2344 healthy 19-year-olds to a population-based hip study between 2008 and 2009; 1170 patients (50%) consented. The study included questionnaires on medical and functional status, a clinical hip examination including the impingement test and hip ROM, and two pelvic radiographs (AP and frog-leg views).

Results

Based on at least one affected hip, 35 of 480 (7.3%) men and 32 of 672 (4.8%) women had positive impingement tests. Eighteen of the 1170 patients were excluded owing to suboptimal or missing radiographs. Self-reported hip discomfort in the women and increased physical exercise in the men were strongly associated with the positive impingement tests. Decreased abduction and internal rotation in the men, decreased flexion in both genders, and radiographic cam type findings in the men also were associated with positive tests.

Conclusion

A positive test for anterior impingement is not uncommon in healthy young adults, especially in males. We believe it always should be performed along with pelvic radiographs in young, active patients presenting with hip pain.

### Endoscopic shelf acetabuloplasty can improve clinical outcomes and achieve return to sports-related activity in active patients with hip dysplasia [^115rN9Fn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

The medical records of 80 patients (86 hips) who underwent endoscopic shelf acetabuloplasty by a single surgeon (S.U) between 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Endoscopic shelf acetabuloplasty were indicated for symptomatic DDH (Fig. 1), defined as recalcitrant pain in hip and/or groin unresponsive to conservative treatment for a minimum of 3 months (e.g. NSAIDs, modification of painful sports and/or hip flexion-related activities, physical therapy), a lateral center edge (LCE) angle of Wiberg of less than 25° on pelvic anterior–posterior view (AP) and/or vertical–center–anterior (VCA) angle of less than 20° on false profile view (Fig. 2 a, b), positive provocative maneuvers (anterior impingement and/or FABER tests), and intra-articular pathology including acetabular labral tears as detected by a gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) arthrogram (Fig. 2 c). Contraindications for hip arthroscopy in DDH included osteoarthritis (Tönnis grade II and III), Legg Calve Perthes disease, and lateral migration of the femoral head. A total of 36 hips were excluded; 13 of these hips belonged to non-athletes. Patients with either ankle lateral ligament instability (n = 2), knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren and Lawrence classification osteoarthritis grade 3 and 4) (n = 2), history of a previous hip surgery (n = 8), lumbar spine disorder (n = 3), worker compensation (n = 3), history of motor vehicle accident (n = 3) or Welfare recipients (n = 2) were excluded. 12 non-athlete hips were excluded. Two patients (two hips) were lost to follow-up.

### Surgical outcome of pincer femoroacetabular impingement with and without labral ossification [^115YwQWE]. Arthroscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe the clinical findings associated with labral ossification (LO), report the outcomes of arthroscopic treatment, and compare this condition to a control group with femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).

Methods

A retrospective review of hip arthroscopy patients from 2004 to 2013 was performed to identify patients with a diagnosis of pincer FAI with LO and at least 2 years of follow-up. Diagnosis was made by plain radiograph, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or intraoperatively. The LO cohort was compared to a chronologically matched control group of FAI patients with pincer FAI but no LO. Patients were prospectively assessed with modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS) preoperatively and then postoperatively at 3, 12, 24, 60, and 120 months.

Results

The LO group included 56 hips in 52 patients whereas the control group included 56 hips in 56 patients. Mean follow-up was 36 months for the LO group and 38 for the control group (P = 0.28). Patients in the LO group were older than those in the control group, with a mean age of 45 versus 30 years (P < .0001), and had more women: 58% female versus 32% male (P < .0001). The LO group patients were more likely to have pain while sitting (65% v 18%) and restricted activities of daily living (40% v 11%) than the control group (P < .0001), and more likely to have pain during a flexion, abduction, external rotation (FABER) test (67% v 36%) (P = 0.002). Both groups experienced a similar magnitude of improvement in mHHS, but the LO group had a significantly lower preoperative mHHS (49 v 63, P < .001) and final postoperative mHHS (75 v 87, P < .0001) than the control group.

Conclusions

Patients with LO represent a unique subset of pincer FAI and are more likely to be older, female, and have more severe symptoms. Hip arthroscopy can be used to treat LO with excision of the ossified fragments or rim, with a reasonable expectation of improvement of symptoms.

### Hip joint torsional loading before and after cam femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^114nES9N]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

After the cam resection stage, internal rotation increased substantially only at the flexion 90° (increase, +6°; change, +32%; P = 0.001, d = 0.58) and FADIR positions (increase, +5°; change, +33%; P < .001, d = 0.51) compared with the intact stage (Figure 5). No other differences were noted between the capsulotomy and cam resection stages in external or internal rotation. Subsequent capsular repair provided marginal restraint in internal rotation but helped restore external rotations at the neutral 0°, flexion 30°, flexion 90°, and FABER positions toward, but never reaching, the values of the intact hip (Figure 5).

### Adolescent elite skiers with and without cam morphology did change their hip joint range of motion with 2 years follow-up [^117AULYD]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical examination

The clinical examinations were carried out at Åre Ski Academy, Östersund, Sweden, following a standardized protocol, according to Agnvall et al. both at baseline and at the follow-up. All clinical examinations were performed by two examiners (co-authors CA and ASA) in a specific order. Intra- and interobserver tests for all physical examination measurements have previously been reported to be good to excellent, ICC 0.77–0.78 and 0.83–0.94, respectively.

All participants were first examined in a standing position with both feet together and arms hanging by their sides. A non-invasive measurement of lumbar flexion and extension was performed with a modified Debrunner Kyphometer (Protek AG, Bern, Schweiz). Secondly, the participants were examined in the supine position. Hip flexion (Fig. 1), hip internal rotation (IR) in 90° hip- and kneeflexion (Fig. 2) and FABER (flexion, abduction, external rotation) test (Fig. 3) were measured using a Digital Goniometer (DG) (HALO medical devices, Australia) together with a Universal Goniometer (UG) with extended arms, 40 cm. If the angles between the two devices differed, the angle measured by the UG was used for the final analysis. Final examinations were in a sitting, neutral position measuring passive hip IR and external rotation (ER) (Fig. 4) using a DG together with a UG as described previously. All measurements were recorded in degrees (°). We refer to the original work for a full description of the technical aspects.

### Hip internal rotation is correlated to radiographic findings of cam femoroacetabular impingement in collegiate football players [^114zE3Hk]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to determine whether physical examinations (flexion-abduction-external rotation [FABER], impingement, range-of-motion profiles) could be used to detect the bony abnormalities of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) in an athletic population.

Methods

We performed a prospective study of 65 male collegiate football players. Both hips were evaluated by 2 orthopaedic surgeons for radiographic signs of FAI. The alpha angle and head-neck offset were measured on frog-leg lateral films. The center-edge angle, acetabular index, crossover sign, and alpha angle were measured on anteroposterior films. Measurements were averaged for both observers. Maximum hip range of motion in flexion (supine) and internal/external rotation (supine, sitting, and prone) was measured with a goniometer. Pain provoked by the impingement and FABER tests was also recorded. Examinations were completed at 2 of 4 stations (2 duplicates), each staffed by 2 clinicians (1 examined and 1 measured). The relation between each range-of-motion and radiographic measure was determined. Data from each station were assessed separately. Only those regressions significant (P < .05) for paired stations were considered clinically significant.

Results

The alpha angle and head-neck offset measured on the frog-leg lateral films were significantly correlated (all P < .01) to supine, sitting, and prone internal rotation for all stations. Correlation coefficients ranged from -0.59 to -0.35 for alpha angle and 0.42 to 0.57 for head-neck offset. Although 95% of the hips had at least 1 radiographic sign of FAI, pain was reported in only 8.5% and 2.3% during the impingement and FABER tests, respectively.

Conclusions

Internal rotation correlates to radiographic measures of cam FAI in this cohort of collegiate football players. Football players with diminished internal rotation in whom hip pain develops should be evaluated for underlying cam FAI abnormalities.

### Hip MRI in flexion abduction external rotation for assessment of the ischiofemoral interval in patients with hip pain-a feasibility study [^115CSXK7]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the feasibility of flexion-abduction-external rotation (FABER) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip to visualize changes in the ischiofemoral interval and ability to provoke foveal excursion over the acetabular rim.

Methods

IRB-approved retrospective single-center study. Patients underwent non-contrast 1.5-T hip MRI in the neutral and FABER position. Two readers measured the ischiofemoral interval at three levels: proximal/distal intertrochanteric distance and ischiofemoral space. Subgroup analysis was performed for hips with/without high femoral torsion, or quadratus femoris muscle edema (QFME), respectively. A receiver operating curve with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of QFME was calculated. The presence of foveal excursion in both positions was assessed.

Results

One hundred ten patients (121 hips, mean age 34 ± 11 years, 67 females) were evaluated. FABER-MRI led to narrowing (both p < .001) of the ischiofemoral interval which decreased more at the proximal (mean decrease by 26 ± 7 mm) than at the distal (6 ± 7 mm) intertrochanteric ridge. With high femoral torsion/ QFME, the ischiofemoral interval was significantly narrower at all three measurement locations compared to normal torsion/no QFME (p < .05). Accuracy for predicting QFME was high with an AUC of .89 (95% CI .82-.94) using a threshold of ≤ 7 mm for the proximal intertrochanteric distance. With FABER-MRI foveal excursion was more frequent in hips with QFME (63% vs 25%; p = .021).

Conclusion

Hip MRI in the FABER position is feasible, visualizes narrowing of the ischiofemoral interval, and can provoke foveal excursion.

Critical Relevance Statement

FABER MRI may be helpful in diagnosing ischiofemoral impingement and detecting concomitant hip instability by overcoming shortcomings of static MR protocols that do not allow visualization of dynamic changes in the ischiofemoral interval and thus may improve surgical decision making.

Key Points

- FABER MRI enables visualization of narrowing of the ischiofemoral interval proximal to the lesser trochanter.
- Proximal intertrochanteric distance of ≤ 7 mm accurately predicts quadratus femoris muscle edema.
- Foveal excursion was more frequent in hips with quadratus femoris muscle edema.

### Femoral anteversion change is associated with ischiofemoral impingement after total hip arthroplasty: a retrospective CT evaluation [^111Mpzpe]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient selection

This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee (Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich) and was conducted in accordance with national ethical guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its subsequent amendments.

Figure 1 illustrates the entire patient selection process. To identify patients for the present study, the hospital information system was queried to retrieve records of all patients who underwent THA between 2014 and 2021. Subsequently, only patients who received THA through an anterior approach were included, while patients who underwent THA due to secondary osteoarthritis (e.g. hip dysplasia), tumor, trauma, infection, or femoral head necrosis or had a history of THA revision were excluded from this study. Patients who had received pre-surgical pelvic radiographs and post-surgical CT examinations of the pelvis and knee region were selected from the local Picture Archiving and Communications System (Merlin, Phoenix PACS). A total of 261 patients were identified for further analysis based on these criteria. CT was performed for complications after THA, for postoperative assessment of positioning of THA components, or for other clinical indications. Out of this sample, patients with THA revision, as well as documented infection, aseptic loosening, periprosthetic fracture, cup overhang, or instability as a reason for groin pain, were excluded, leading to a sample size of 197 patients. Of these patients, 124 had preoperative CT images available to assess FA change. Moreover, a review of surgical and clinical reports as well as imaging data (magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound) of the final patient cohort was conducted, aiming to identify documented cases of IFI and GTPS. Clinical diagnoses were made exclusively by orthopedic surgeons at the local institution specializing in hip surgery. For IFI, the diagnosis was made based on the patients' history, symptoms, and specific clinical examination (long-stride walking test and/or IFI test). For GTPS, all clinical diagnoses were made by an orthopedic surgeon specialized on hip surgery. The diagnosis was based on the patient's symptoms (location of pain and/or tenderness, worsening of pain with unilateral weight-bearing activities, lying on the affected side) and clinical examination (hip abduction and external rotation test, FABER test, resisted external rotation test, or Trendelenburg test), in accordance with the 2022 ISHA Physical Therapy Agreement for the Evaluation and Management of GTPS. IFI and GTPS were considered confirmed only if a clinical or surgical report documented these conditions and the corresponding imaging showed signs corroborating the suspected clinical diagnosis. This was edema and/or fatty atrophy of the quadratus femoris muscle for IFI respectively abductor tendinopathy and/or trochanteric bursitis for GTPS in postoperative ultrasound or MR imaging studies. In addition, imaging studies of patients without symptomatic IFI or GTPS in this population were reviewed for radiologic signs of these diagnoses. For IFI, this was presence of fatty atrophy of the quadratus femoris muscle and measurement of the ischiofemoral space on the surgically treated side according to Torriani et al on postoperative CT images. The measured values were then compared to normative values for the ischiofemoral space established by Özdemir et al. For GTPS, available postoperative ultrasound and MRI examinations were reviewed for signs of trochanteric bursitis and abductor tendinopathy as described above.

Changes in Torque Resistance

During position control testing (ie, playback of the intact hip's path of motion to measure changes in torque restraint), both internal and external torsional resistance decreased for all testing positions after the capsulotomy stage, compared with the intact hip (P < .01, d > 0.8). However, after the cam resection stage, internal torsional resistance further decreased in only flexion 90° (decrease, –1.0 N·m; change, –45%; P < .001, d = 0.98) and FADIR (decrease, –1.3 N·m; change, –37%; P = 0.003, d = 1.0), compared with the capsulotomy stage (Figure 6). The cam deformity accounted for 21% in flexion 90° and 27% in FADIR relative to the torsional resistance of the intact hip. No differences were found in external torsional resistance after cam resections compared with the capsulotomy stage.

Testing Positions

The robot positioned each hip joint in 6 testing positions, which included 4 sagittal plane angles and 2 clinical impingement scenarios: (1) full extension, (2) neutral 0° (standing position), (3) flexion 30° (heel strike position), (4) flexion 90° (sitting position), (5) flexion-adduction and internal rotation (FADIR), and (6) flexion-abduction and external rotation (FABER). In each position, the robot performed applicable internal-external rotations of the intact hip, until a torque resistance of 5 N·m was measured in each rotational direction, for 2 cycles (Figure 3; see). A compressive load of 5 N was applied to keep the hip joint in contact throughout testing. As the primary focus was the capsular mechanics and passive range of motion, a relatively small load was preferred so as not to compromise the joint and tissues or risk any damage to them. For the FADIR and FABER positions, the robot first applied 5 N·m of adduction and abduction, respectively; flexion 90°; and then 5 N·m of internal and external rotational torque, respectively. Hips were rotated slowly at a fixed angular speed (internal-external rotation, 0.8 deg/s; abduction-adduction, 1.6 deg/s) for all tests to ensure that any rate dependence did not influence results. Each path of internal-external rotational motion was recorded and stored.

Log-roll test — description and reliability: This test is used to determine ligamentous laxity, with the patient supine and the hip and knee in 0° of extension; the hip is passively rotated internally and externally, and the examiner notes side-to-side differences. The test is positive for ligamentous laxity when the involved hip demonstrates greater external rotation range of motion than the uninvolved hip. The variable is nominal and units are none. In people seeking care for intra-articular, nonarthritic hip joint pain, intertester reliability showed 80% agreement with kappa 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.84), indicating substantial reliability.

### Low back pain in professional golfers: the role of associated hip and low back range-of-motion deficits [^111GjnTB]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain is fairly prevalent among golfers; however, its precise biomechanical mechanism is often debated.

Hypothesis

There is a positive correlation between decreased lead hip rotation and lumbar range of motion with a prior history of low back pain in professional golfers.

Study Design

A cross-sectional study.

Methods

Forty-two consecutive professional male golfers were categorized as group 1 (history of low back pain greater than 2 weeks affecting quality of play within past 1 year) and group 2 (no previous such history). All underwent measurements of hip and lumbar range of motion, FABERE's distance, and finger-to-floor distance. Differences in measurements were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results

33% of golfers had previously experienced low back pain. A statistically significant correlation (P < .05) was observed between a history of low back pain with decreased lead hip internal rotation, FABERE's distance, and lumbar extension. No statistically significant difference was noted in nonlead hip range of motion or finger-to-floor distance with history of low back pain.

Conclusions

Range-of-motion deficits in the lead hip rotation and lumbar spine extension correlated with a history of low back pain in golfers.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

As a consequence of the discovery of IgE and the development of methods to identify and quantify anti-allergen IgE levels, interest in recent years has centered around the utilization of in vivo and in vitro diagnostic procedures.7,9

Patients who react to a small quantity of antigen by skin testing can be classified as highly sensitive. Those who react only to large quantities of antigen can be classified as less sensitive. It would appear that there is at least a 50,000-fold range between the most and least sensitive individuals. On the other hand, certain patients who do not appear to have elevated quantities of specific anti-allergen IgE do have positive skin tests and have symptoms of allergic rhinitis. These patients are considerably less sensitive than patients with detectable levels of specific IgE antibody.10

The current standard method of immunotherapy dates back to the earliest studies by Noon. As adapted for ragweed pollen extract, therapy is begun with a low dose, which has been shown to be tolerated by both experience and skin testing.

The physician who undertakes immunotherapy should be concerned with the degree of sensitivity of the patient. This can be measured by skin test, leukocyte histamine release, or anti-allergen IgE levels. Strongly positive skin tests or high initial ragweed IgE and total IgE may be risk factors for systemic reactions. Less aggressive immunotherapy schedules may be indicated for such patients. Maintenance dose potency must be established by the physician's clinical observation and experience.10,17

Serial fivefold or tenfold dilutions of the extract are used to make more dilute extract concentrations. Other concentrations can be prepared by appropriate dilution. In brief, the allergist can prepare any dilution of extract that is considered appropriate for the patient.

4. Special tests

1) Patellar tilt test [patient supine and knee extended – apply downward pressure to the medial edge of the patella to assess lateral patellar restraints. Test is positive if the patellar tilt angle is more than 5 degrees.]

2) Medial and lateral patellar glide [push patella medially and laterally noting degree of movement relative to width of patella, > 75% translation is hypermobile]

3) Quadriceps setting/grind test, patellar inhibition [suprapatellar resistance while patient performs isometric quadriceps contraction with knee in full extension. Pain indicates a positive test.]

4) Patellar compression test [direct compression of the patella into the trochlea, pain indicative of articular cartilage degeneration or acute chondral injury]

5) Patellar apprehension test [apply lateral pressure to patella at 30° knee flexion, positive if patient feels instability or pain]

6) Lachman test [positive for anterior cruciate insufficiency if there is anterior translation of tibia on femur with knee in 30° flexion]

7) Posterior drawer test [positive for posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency if there is posterior translation of tibia on femur with knee in 90° flexion]

8) McMurray's test [positive for meniscal tear if palpable or audible click. Patient supine, flex hip to 90°, maximally flex knee followed by passive knee extension, first with external tibial rotation while applying a varus stress at the knee (lateral meniscus) and then with internal tibial rotation while applying a valgus stress (medial meniscus) at the knee]

9) Trendelenberg test [positive when patient stands on one leg and contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteal/hip abductor weakness]

5. Flexibility

The knee should be moved thru active range of flexion and extension and then placed thru full passive range of motion. Active range of knee motion includes flexion (135°), extension (0°), internal and external rotation (10°). Muscles that span two joints are important for functional range of motion and should be tested independently (hamstrings, rectus femoris, gracilis, tensor fascia lata and iliotibial band, and gastrocnemius muscles).

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^1173i3Zn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of the Test

The skin test should be read by a trained health professional 48 to 72 hours after administration of TUBERSOL. Skin test sensitivity is indicated by induration only; redness should not be measured.

Measure the diameter of induration transversely to the long axis of the forearm and record the measurement in millimeters (including 0 mm). (7) The tip of a ballpoint pen, gently pushed at a 45° angle toward the site of injection, will stop at the edge of induration.

Also record presence and size (if present) of necrosis and edema, although these are not used in the interpretation of the test.

Positive Reactions

Tuberculin reactivity may indicate latent infection, prior infection and/or disease with M. tuberculosis and does not necessarily indicate the presence of active tuberculous disease. Persons showing positive tuberculin reactions should be considered positive by current public health guidelines and referred for further medical evaluation. (7)(9) The repeated testing of uninfected persons does not sensitize them to TUBERSOL. (6)(7)(9)

The significance of induration measurements in diagnosing latent TB infection must be considered in terms of the patient's history and the risk of developing active TB disease as indicated in Table 1. (9)

A TST conversion is defined as an increase of ≥ 10 mm of induration within a 2-year period, regardless of age. (9)

The possibility should be considered that the skin test sensitivity may also be due to a previous contact with atypical mycobacteria or previous BCG vaccination. (7)(9)

Negative Reactions

An individual who does not show a positive reaction to 5 TU on the first test, but is suspected of being TB positive, may be retested with 5 TU. (See Booster Effect and Two-Step Testing .) Any individual who does not show a positive reaction to an initial injection of 5 TU, or a second test with 5 TU may be considered as tuberculin negative.

False Positive Reactions

False positive tuberculin reactions can occur in individuals who have been infected with other mycobacteria, including vaccination with BCG. (7) However, a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection and the use of preventive therapy should be considered for any BCG-vaccinated person who has a positive TST reaction, especially if the person has been, or is, at increased risk of acquiring TB infection. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE .) (13)(14)

### Does this patient have hip osteoarthritis? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^1144eJSj]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hip osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of pain and disability.

Objective

To identify the clinical findings that are most strongly associated with hip OA.

Data Sources

Systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception until November 2019.

Study Selection

Included studies (1) quantified the accuracy of clinical findings (history, physical examination, or simple tests) and (2) used plain radiographs as the reference standard for diagnosing hip OA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Studies were assigned levels of evidence using the Rational Clinical Examination scale and assessed for risk of bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Data were extracted using individual hips as the unit of analysis and only pooled when findings were reported in 3 or more studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs).

Results

Six studies were included, with data from 1110 patients and 1324 hips, of which 509 (38%) showed radiographic evidence of OA. Among patients presenting to primary care physicians with hip or groin pain, the affected hip showed radiographic evidence of OA in 34% of cases. A family history of OA, personal history of knee OA, or pain on climbing stairs or walking up slopes all had LRs of 2.1 (sensitivity range, 33%-68%; specificity range, 68%-84%; broadest LR range: 95% CI, 1.1–3.8). To identify patients most likely to have OA, the most useful findings were squat causing posterior pain (sensitivity, 24%; specificity, 96%; LR, 6.1 [95% CI, 1.3–29]), groin pain on passive abduction or adduction (sensitivity, 33%; specificity, 94%; LR, 5.7 [95% CI, 1.6–20]), abductor weakness (sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 90%; LR, 4.5 [95% CI, 2.4–8.4]), and decreased passive hip adduction (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 81%; LR, 4.2 [95% CI, 3.0–6.0]) or internal rotation (sensitivity, 66%; specificity, 79%; LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.7–6.0]) as measured by a goniometer or compared with the contralateral leg. The presence of normal passive hip adduction was most useful for suggesting the absence of OA (negative LR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11–0.54]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Simple tests of hip motion and observing for pain during that motion were helpful in distinguishing patients most likely to have OA on plain radiography from those who will not. A combination of findings efficiently detects those most likely to have severe hip OA.

### Is internal rotation measurement of the hip useful for ruling in cam or pincer morphology in asymptomatic males? A diagnostic accuracy study [^115qjSWV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Another limitation of our study is that the test cannot differentiate between restricted internal rotation caused by femoral retroversion (retrotorsion), acetabular retroversion, or cam morphology. Femoral retroversion may have a larger effect on internal rotation than cam morphology. Furthermore, the test might produce a false negative in patients with concomitant hip dysplasia and cam morphology, where large femoral antetorsion and insufficient femoral coverage allow for high internal rotation despite the cam morphology. In addition, cutoffs based on our data may overestimate the test performance, and the specificity and sensitivity might be lower in an independent sample. Finally, one limitation is that the chair is not commercially available, although it is easy to build (Appendix 1).

Discussion of Key Findings

We are unaware of other studies that evaluated the same standardized tool to measure internal hip rotation. Only a few studies have evaluated sensitivity and specificity for the measurement of internal rotation to detect cam morphologies. In a study with a cohort of 200 asymptomatic participants without prior hip surgery or childhood hip problems, the sensitivity to detect a cam morphology was 0.36 and the specificity was 0.83 for a cutoff of at most 20° internal rotation (cam morphology was defined as an alpha angle of more than 50.5°), for a positive likelihood ratio of only 2.10. Among 65 male American football players, in one subset (rater 1) the sensitivity to detect a cam morphology (alpha angle > 50°) was 0.88 and the specificity was 0.47, for a threshold of 41° internal rotation of the hip, and in a second subset (rater 2) sensitivity was 0.81 and specificity was 0.51, for a threshold of 38°. These values yielded negative likelihood ratios of 0.26 and 0.37, respectively, similar to those in our study.

### Is internal rotation measurement of the hip useful for ruling in cam or pincer morphology in asymptomatic males? A diagnostic accuracy study [^116ejf2C]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. Since only eight participants had a pincer morphology and eight had a combination of cam- and pincer-type morphologies, we could not draw strong conclusions about the detection of these morphologies. The proportion of patients who declined to undergo MRI might have introduced selection bias, thus limiting the generalizability of our results. However, when we compared participants to nonparticipants, we found no differences regarding age, height, weight, WOMAC, or self-reported health state (EuroQol). Since we only included men, it is unclear if our results apply to women. The ROM of internal hip rotation differs between females and males, so although our approach might still have diagnostic validity, the cutoffs may differ. Furthermore, the prevalence of pincer-type morphology might be different in females compared with males, although there is conflicting evidence whether females have a higher or a lower prevalence of pincer morphology. Because the prevalences of cam- and pincer-type morphologies increase with age, and because hip mobility decreases with age, the extrapolation of our results — which were generated in a group of 20-year-old men — to older people should be done only with caution. The same caution should be applied when using the test in other populations such as those with a higher proportion of obese persons or those who may have other reasons for having limited internal hip rotation. We included only asymptomatic individuals, and it is unclear whether the positive likelihood ratio would remain the same in symptomatic people. Symptomatic individuals may also have decreased internal hip rotation without femoroacetabular impingement. In a systematic review, we earlier identified only one study that evaluated flexion combined with internal rotation in symptomatic people. In another study, the authors found a low sensitivity of 0.22 for the detection of femoroacetabular impingement and pain, with a specificity of 0.91.

In patients with characteristic physical findings (patients with no definite LOM of the shoulder joint, negative in an ER test, but positive in an ABER test and O'Brien test) and with a clinical history of PS labral tear (patients with a history of pain occurring with the excessive ABER posture), clinicians need to have a suspicion of PS labral tear and to identify the PS labral tear by using MRI or arthrosonography.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Aplisol) [^113xXSfL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of Tuberculin Reaction

Readings of Mantoux reactions should be made by a trained health professional during the period from 48 to 72 hours after the injection. Induration only should be considered in interpreting the test. The diameter of induration should be measured transversely to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters. Erythema has no diagnostic value and should be disregarded. The presence and size of necrosis and edema if present should be recorded although not used in the interpretation of the test. In the absence of induration, an area of erythema greater than 10 mm in diameter may indicate the injection was made too deeply and retesting is indicated. Find the margins of the induration by drawing the index or middle finger lightly across the reaction. The tip of a ballpoint pen pushed at a 45° angle toward the site of injection will also stop at the edges of induration.

The diameter of induration should be measured (preferable with a caliper) transversely to the long axis of the forearm and recorded in millimeters.

Erythema has no diagnostic value and should be disregarded. The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative".

Reactions should be interpreted as follows (Please refer to most recent guidelines):

Based on current guidelines,3,7,14, 19interpretation of reactions is as follows:

Positive reactions:

Skin test conversions

For persons with negative skin test reactions who undergo repeat skin testing (e.g., health care workers), an increase in reaction size ≥ 10 mm within a period of 2 years should be considered a skin test conversion indicative of recent infection with M. tuberculosis .19
In some individuals who have been infected with nontuberculous mycobacteria or have undergone BCG vaccination, the skin test may show some degree of induration. For these individuals, a conversion to "positive" is defined as an increase in induration by 10 mm on subsequent tests.7

Healthcare facilities and other high-risk settings

For health care workers and employees in other high-risk settings with no other risk factors for TB, a cut-off of 15 mm of induration (rather than 10 mm) on the tuberculin skin test should be used to define a positive baseline test at the time of initial employment.
An increase of ≥ 10 mm in reaction size is generally accepted as a positive test result on subsequent testing unless the worker is a contact of a TB case or has HIV infection or is otherwise immunocompromised, in which case a result of ≥ 5 mm is considered positive.21
