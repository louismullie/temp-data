## Question

Diseases associated with microtones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diseases are associated with "microtones" — likely a misnomer for mitochondrial dysfunction — and to explain them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the terminology correction and justifying it. Then, I should organize the foundational genetics and inheritance. Next, I will classify pathogenic mechanisms, identify vulnerable organ systems, outline hallmark syndromes across the lifespan, synthesize epidemiology, connect mitochondrial dysfunction to common diseases, detail pathophysiology, and finally review diagnostic strategies and management including emerging therapies, ensuring I continuously self-verify and cite appropriately throughout.

> Wait, let me verify the initial premise: "microtones" does not map to any medical entity in the provided literature, and every relevant source concerns mitochondrial disease, so it is reasonable and necessary to self-correct the query to "mitochondrial diseases" before proceeding; I should state that explicitly to preserve transparency and then continue with a clinically structured synthesis grounded in the references.

> Let me first confirm the dual genetic control and inheritance patterns because these underpin everything else; mitochondria have their own 16.6 kb genome encoding 13 OXPHOS subunits, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs, while roughly 1,300 nuclear genes encode the remainder of the mitoproteome, so pathogenic variants can reside in mtDNA with maternal inheritance or in nDNA with Mendelian patterns, and disease expression is shaped by heteroplasmy, tissue-specific thresholds, and the mitochondrial bottleneck during oogenesis, which I should double-check as consistent with contemporary reviews before moving on [^114dUmjW] [^115CiQRB].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic taxonomy to avoid omissions; mitochondrial diseases can result from defects in OXPHOS complex subunits or assembly factors, disorders of mtDNA maintenance leading to depletion or multiple deletions, defects in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting tRNAs, ribosomal proteins, or translation factors, and abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics including fission, fusion, and quality control, with POLG, POLG2, TWNK, TK2, MFN2, OPA1, DRP1, and others frequently implicated, which aligns with high-level frameworks from disease primers and mtDNA maintenance reviews [^113kaYDV] [^115FVtdB] [^111aLXcL] [^1174aaDE].

> Let me consider which organs bear the brunt; tissues with the highest energy demands — brain, skeletal muscle (notably extraocular), heart, endocrine organs, retina, kidney, GI tract, and liver — are most vulnerable to bioenergetic failure and secondary mitochondrial derangements, so multisystem involvement is common and should shape clinical suspicion and surveillance strategies [^111B6xLt] [^113kaYDV].

> I should confirm the canonical clinical syndromes across the lifespan while acknowledging variability; in infants and children, Pearson syndrome, Alpers-Huttenlocher from POLG, and MELAS and MERRF from mtDNA tRNA variants are prototypic, whereas in adolescents and adults, single large-scale mtDNA deletions present as CPEO, Kearns-Sayre, or broader spectra, with MNGIE reflecting nuclear-encoded mtDNA maintenance defects and LHON exemplifying optic neuropathy due to mtDNA variants; I need to note that rigid syndromic labels can obscure the true continuum of phenotypes, so I will flag that explicitly [^1127TRz9] [^115e6ejb] [^115FVtdB] [^113unMAc].

> Next, I should review prevalence carefully; the minimum prevalence of mitochondrial disease is around 1 in 4,300 to 1 in 5,000, approximately 1 in 250 people carry a pathogenic mtDNA variant (often asymptomatic), adult mtDNA disease prevalence is near 10 per 100,000, and specific nuclear OXPHOS disorders in Europe are about 9 per 100,000, whereas some entities like multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome type 3 are extraordinarily rare — let me double-check these figures and cite the most robust sources [^113wEb8Z] [^11779R9M] [^115Dbm3Z] [^115zYs1v].

> But wait, what if the question extends beyond classic mitochondrial syndromes; I should explicitly link mitochondrial dysfunction to common diseases where evidence supports a mechanistic contribution — Alzheimer's disease via the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, Parkinson's disease through genes like PINK1 and DJ-1, subsets of ASD with shared organ system vulnerabilities, diabetes through insulin secretion/resistance interfaces, and a range of cardiomyopathies and conduction disorders — while acknowledging that causality varies by condition and study design [^115qPP9X] [^1156juBm] [^112PhoG9] [^114HZJ8N] [^114MtmPN].

> I will now examine the core pathophysiology; the final common pathway is ATP deficiency due to impaired OXPHOS, with secondary effects including increased ROS, disrupted calcium homeostasis, activation of apoptotic pathways, and disturbances in iron-sulfur cluster biology, which together explain vulnerability of high-demand tissues and the secondary cellular stress signatures often observed on biopsy or functional studies [^111B6xLt] [^114dUmjW] [^111xjcKY].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach systematically; clinical pattern recognition of multisystem disease prompts targeted labs such as serum/CSF lactate, neuroimaging looking for nonvascular stroke-like lesions, and in selected cases muscle biopsy to assess ragged-red or COX-deficient fibers and respiratory chain activities, while genetic testing has moved toward a genetics-first strategy where blood-based WGS resolves nearly 90% of cases, though I must not overstate this — wait, I should verify the exceptions: muscle-specific mtDNA mutations and large deletions may be missed in blood and require tissue-specific sampling and heteroplasmy quantification to avoid false negatives [^116H7YSY] [^114EWvKi] [^113NTe6D] [^112BP4CR].

> Let me think about management principles; there is no definitive cure for most patients, so care centers on surveillance for multisystem involvement, aggressive symptomatic management of seizures, diabetes, cardiac and endocrine complications, and provision of genetic counseling, with reproductive options including preimplantation testing and mitochondrial donation for women with mtDNA variants, and I should confirm that these recommendations align with contemporary consensus [^11413B13] [^113kaYDV] [^115CiQRB].

> Hold on, I should verify emerging therapeutics to avoid overpromising; approaches under investigation include nucleases and base editors for heteroplasmy shifting or direct correction, gene therapy vectors with tissue targeting, pharmacologic enhancers of mitochondrial biogenesis or redox buffering, and metabolic strategies such as ketogenic interventions that have shown in vitro selection for wild-type mtDNA — yet I need to emphasize that most remain preclinical or early clinical and require careful trial validation [^117CbQ6f] [^111hZe19] [^1128Kco2] [^11413B13].

> In summary — let me reconsider to ensure internal consistency — mitochondrial diseases comprise a genetically and clinically heterogeneous set of disorders driven by mtDNA and nDNA defects that converge on bioenergetic failure with multisystem manifestations; diagnosis increasingly relies on integrated genomics with tissue-aware heteroplasmy assessment, management is multidisciplinary and supportive with expanding reproductive options, and while targeted therapies are on the horizon, rigorous evidence for disease-modifying benefit remains limited at present, which I should clearly convey to set accurate expectations [^113kaYDV] [^11413B13].

Microtones are **not associated with any known diseases**. The term "microtones" refers to musical intervals smaller than a semitone and has no established medical relevance. If you meant "mitochondria", **mitochondrial diseases** [^113kaYDV] are genetic disorders affecting energy production and can involve multiple organ systems [^11413B13], including neurological, muscular, and endocrine manifestations [^117Knj8w] [^111B6xLt]. Please clarify your question if you intended a different term.

## Clarification of terminology

**Microtones** are musical intervals smaller than a semitone and have no established medical relevance, whereas **mitochondria** are cellular organelles responsible for energy production [^113kaYDV]; mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders that impair energy production [^1122Be9n] and affect multiple organ systems [^112tuuf6].

### Emerging therapies for mitochondrial disorders [^111B6xLt]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Mitochondria are complex intracellular organelles that play a central role in cell homeostasis. They are the principal source of intracellular energy, are intimately involved in both calcium and free radical metabolism, and they can trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis). Tissues and organs that critically depend on these functions bear the brunt of the pathology in human mitochondrial diseases, which often affect the nervous system, muscle, and endocrine organs. Most mitochondrial disorders are progressive and often result in disability and premature death. Therefore, although they are rare diseases, with a minimum reported prevalence of 1 in 4300, they have a substantial impact on families and healthcare services.

Most mitochondrial disorders are ultimately thought to arise through a bioenergetic defect linked to a deficiency of ATP synthesis. ATP synthesis is the final step of respiration, which is carried out by five oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes situated on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Each complex has multiple protein subunits encoded by two distinct genomes: nuclear chromosomal DNA (nDNA), and the 16.5 kb mitochondrial genome (mtDNA).

Pathogenic mtDNA mutations often cause a subset of classical mitochondrial clinical syndromes. However, an increased number of multisystem mitochondrial disorders are being described in the literature, many of which are yet to be fully characterized clinically and genetically. These include an emerging myriad of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in some of the ∼1500 nuclear genes.

### The genetics and pathology of mitochondrial disease [^113Xnirv]. The Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles present in all nucleated eukaryotic cells, responsible for producing cellular energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondrial function is under dual genetic control: the 16.6-kb mitochondrial genome, which contains only 37 genes, and the nuclear genome, which encodes the remaining approximately 1300 proteins of the mitoproteome. Mitochondrial dysfunction can arise from defects in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear mitochondrial genes. It can present in childhood or adulthood, showing vast clinical heterogeneity with symptoms affecting either a single organ or tissue, or involving multiple systems.

There is no cure for the majority of mitochondrial disease patients, making a genetic diagnosis crucial for genetic counseling and recurrence risk calculation. It also impacts the clinical management of affected patients. Next-generation sequencing strategies are proving pivotal in discovering new disease genes and diagnosing clinically affected patients; mutations in over 250 genes have now been associated with mitochondrial disease. The biochemical, histochemical, immunocytochemical, and neuropathological characterization of these patients has led to improved diagnostic testing strategies and the development of novel diagnostic techniques.

This review focuses on the genetic landscape associated with mitochondrial disease, before advancing into studies of associated mitochondrial pathology in two clinically relevant organs: skeletal muscle and brain.

### Prevalence of rare mitochondrial DNA mutations in mitochondrial disorders [^116oPbCs]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Since the first identification of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects responsible for human diseases in 1988, it has become increasingly clear that mutations in the mtDNA represent an important cause of neuromuscular disorders. Nevertheless, today, the prevalence of mtDNA disease is still difficult to assess for two main reasons. First, large series are extremely rare because of clinical heterogeneity and diagnosis complexity. Second, molecular screening is usually restricted to the detection of mtDNA deletions and a few common mutations without having accurate data on the prevalence of rare mutations.

Improvements in diagnostic methods led us to study a large cohort of patients from the French Mitochondrial Disease Network, including both children and adults suspected of manifesting a mitochondrial disorder. In our cohort, deletions and common mutations of mtDNA had already been excluded, and we performed a comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial genome to answer a number of key questions.

- **What is the prevalence of rare mtDNA mutations in mitochondrial disorders**: We aim to establish the frequency with which these uncommon mutations occur in the population.

- **What are the phenotypes associated with these mutations**: Identifying the physical and clinical presentations linked to these mutations helps in understanding their impact.

- **Is a comprehensive screening of mtDNA essential for optimal diagnostic approach**: This question addresses whether a thorough examination of the mitochondrial DNA is critical for accurately diagnosing mitochondrial disorders.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction can connect the diverse medical symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders [^112PhoG9]. Pediatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder. Over the past decade, evidence has emerged that some children with ASD suffer from undiagnosed comorbid medical conditions. One medical disorder consistently associated with ASD is mitochondrial dysfunction. Individuals with mitochondrial disorders, without concomitant ASD, manifest dysfunction in multiple high-energy organ systems, such as the central nervous, muscular, and gastrointestinal (GI) systems. Interestingly, these are the identical organ systems affected in a significant number of children with ASD. This finding increases the possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction may be one of the keys that explains the many diverse symptoms observed in some children with ASD.

This article reviews the importance of mitochondria in human health and disease, the evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in ASD, the potential role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the comorbid medical conditions associated with ASD, and how mitochondrial dysfunction can bridge the gap for understanding how these seemingly disparate medical conditions are related. We also review the limitations of this evidence and other possible explanations for these findings. This new understanding of ASD should provide researchers a pathway for understanding the etiopathogenesis of ASD and clinicians the potential to develop medical therapies.

### The neurodegenerative mitochondriopathies [^113tAKpq]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Mitochondria are physically or functionally altered in many neurodegenerative diseases. This is the case for very rare neurodegenerative disorders as well as extremely common age-related ones such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In some disorders, very specific patterns of altered mitochondrial function or systemic mitochondrial dysfunction are demonstrable. Some disorders arise from mitochondrial DNA mutation, some from nuclear gene mutation, and for some, the etiology is not definitively known. This review classifies neurodegenerative diseases using mitochondrial dysfunction as a unifying feature, and in doing so, defines a group of disorders called the neurodegenerative mitochondriopathies. It discusses what mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified in various neurodegenerative diseases, what is currently known about the mitochondria-neurodegeneration nexus, and speculates on the significance of mitochondrial function in some disorders not classically thought of as mitochondriopathies.

### A history of mitochondrial diseases [^1148EPQf]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

This article reviews the development of mitochondrial medicine from the premolecular era (1962–1988), when mitochondrial diseases were defined based on clinical examination, muscle biopsy, and biochemical criteria, through to the molecular era when the full complexity of these disorders became evident. In chronological order, the introduction of new pathogenic concepts is followed, which have shaped a rational genetic classification of these clinically heterogeneous disorders. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-related diseases can be divided into two main groups: those that impair mitochondrial protein synthesis in toto and those that affect specific respiratory chain proteins.

Mutations in nuclear DNA can affect components of respiratory chain complexes (direct hits) or assembly proteins (indirect hits). They can also impair mtDNA integrity (multiple mtDNA mutations), replication (mtDNA depletion), or mtDNA translation. Besides these disorders that directly affect the respiratory chain, defects in other mitochondrial functions may also affect oxidative phosphorylation, including problems in mitochondrial protein import, alterations of the inner mitochondrial membrane lipid composition, and defects in mitochondrial dynamics.

The enormous and still ongoing progress in our understanding of mitochondrial medicine was made possible by the intense collaboration of an international cadre of "mitochondriacs". Having published my first paper on a patient with mitochondrial myopathy 37 years ago (DiMauro et al, 1973), I feel qualified to write a history of the mitochondrial field.

### Prevalence of rare diseases: Bibliographic data [^115Dbm3Z]. Orphanet Report Series (2024). High credibility.

### Pathological mechanisms underlying single large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions [^113X5BRF]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Single, large-scale deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial disease. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the genetic defect and molecular phenotype to improve understanding of pathogenic mechanisms associated with these deletions in skeletal muscle.

- **Methods**: We investigated 23 muscle biopsies taken from adult patients (6 males/17 females with a mean age of 43 years) with characterized single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in skeletal muscle biopsies was quantified by immunoreactivity levels for complex I and complex IV proteins. Single muscle fibers with varying degrees of deficiency were selected from 6 patient biopsies to determine mtDNA deletion level and copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: We defined three "classes" of single, large-scale deletion with distinct patterns of mitochondrial deficiency, determined by the size and location of the deletion. Single fiber analyses showed that fibers with greater respiratory chain deficiency harbored higher levels of mtDNA deletion with an increase in total mtDNA copy number. For the first time, we demonstrated that threshold levels for complex I and complex IV deficiency differ based on deletion class.

- **Interpretation**: Combining genetic and immunofluorescent assays, we conclude that thresholds for complex I and complex IV deficiency are modulated by the deletion of complex-specific protein-encoding genes. Furthermore, removal of mt-tRNA genes impacts specific pathways, highlighting the complexity of the pathological mechanisms involved in these deletions.

### Use of whole genome sequencing to determine genetic basis of suspected mitochondrial disorders: Cohort study [^114EWvKi]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

The participants in this study had standard of care NHS genetic testing before enrollment. The use of whole genome sequencing as a first genetic test for suspected mitochondrial disorders has not been directly explored. The only mitochondrial diseases that cannot be diagnosed by whole genome sequencing of DNA extracted from blood are extremely rare muscle-specific mtDNA mutations and large mtDNA deletions, which usually present a very specific clinical phenotype. Based on known epidemiology, these muscle-specific mtDNA mutations and deletions account for approximately 11.5% of patients with a genetically confirmed mitochondrial disorder. Therefore, mitochondrial disorders can be diagnosed by whole genome sequencing of DNA extracted from blood in nearly 90% of patients. Additionally, whole genome sequencing can diagnose other monogenic disorders that have similar clinical features, implying a very high diagnostic yield.

In conducting this study, we have identified a cohort of patients with suspected mitochondrial disease in whom the likely diagnosis is contained within the whole genome sequencing data but cannot be distinguished from background sequence variation. This will form a useful resource for the discovery of future mitochondrial disease genes that are not in the coding space and thus are not detectable by whole exome sequencing. Large scale mtDNA rearrangements are not reliably detected in DNA extracted from blood in adults, meaning that patients with suspected progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Ke

### Presentation and diagnostic evaluation of mitochondrial disease [^116H7YSY]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial disease (MD) occurs when alteration of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex function, caused by genetic mutation, produces a detectable disease state. These mutations may be found in either the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes and may only be present in a subset of cells or body tissues. Thus, the phenotype of MD is extremely variable, and the definitive diagnosis of MD is complex.

This article provides a brief description of a strategy used in the diagnosis of MD by integrating data from clinical, imaging, pathologic, molecular, and enzymatic assessments. Additional information on characteristic findings seen in classic MD syndromes is also provided.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction and neuromuscular disease [^113wadW2]. Muscle & Nerve (2001). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders with widely varying clinical features, due to defects in mitochondrial function. Involvement of both muscle and nerve is common in mitochondrial disease. In some cases, this involvement is subclinical or a minor part of a multisystem disorder, but myopathy and neuropathy are a major, often presenting, feature of a number of mitochondrial syndromes. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in a number of classic neuromuscular diseases. This article reviews the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neuromuscular disease and discusses a rational approach to diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with a neuromuscular syndrome due to mitochondrial disease.

### Endocrine dysfunction in primary mitochondrial diseases [^116HvYr4]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial disease mechanisms can include a variety of disorders.

- **Disorders of OXPHOS complex subunits and assembly factors**: Disorders of OXPHOS complexes and their assembly refer to a group of mitochondrial diseases characterized by defects in the four respiratory chain complexes (Complexes I-IV) and the ATP synthase (Complex V). These disorders can result from pathogenic variants in the 13 mtDNA genes encoding OXPHOS subunits or in more than a hundred nuclear genes encoding subunits or assembly factors of the OXPHOS complexes.

- **Disorders of mitochondrial DNA maintenance**: Disorders of mtDNA maintenance refer to a group of nuclear gene–related primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) characterized by defects in the replication, repair, or maintenance of mtDNA. These disorders can result in the progressive depletion of mtDNA or in the accumulation of mtDNA point variants or large-scale deletions. Responsible genes include POLG and POLG2, which encode the catalytic and accessory subunits of polymerase gamma, the only DNA polymerase that can replicate the mtDNA. TWNK encodes the Twinkle helicase-primase needed to unwind mtDNA prior to replication. Defects in the mitochondrial nucleoside salvage apparatus may also impair mtDNA replication due to a lack of building blocks for mtDNA synthesis.

### Clinical and molecular spectrum of thymidine kinase 2-related mtDNA maintenance defect [^1161VAR3]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial DNA maintenance (mtDNA) defects have a wide range of causes, each with a set of phenotypes that overlap with many other neurological or muscular diseases. Clinicians face the challenge of narrowing down a long list of differential diagnoses when encountering non-specific neuromuscular symptoms. Biallelic pathogenic variants in the thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) gene cause a myopathic form of mitochondrial DNA maintenance defect. Since the first description in 2001, there have been 71 patients reported with 42 unique pathogenic variants. Here, we are reporting 11 new cases with 5 novel pathogenic variants. We describe and analyze a total of 82 cases with 47 unique TK2 pathogenic variants in an effort to formulate a comprehensive molecular and clinical spectrum of TK2-related mtDNA maintenance disorders.

### The genetics and pathology of mitochondrial disease [^114dUmjW]. The Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles present in all nucleated eukaryotic cells and are responsible for numerous cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis, iron-sulphur cluster biogenesis, apoptosis, and the production of cellular energy (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). With bacterial origins, a historical symbiotic relationship evolved during which mitochondria became normal constituents of eukaryotic cells. Their ancestry remains apparent from their own multicopy genetic material [mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)], with copy number varying greatly between individuals and across different tissues from the same individual. The 16.6-kb circular mtDNA molecule encodes 13 subunits of the OXPHOS components, 22 mitochondrial tRNAs, and two subunits of the mitoribosomes. Additionally, the mitoproteome requires a further ∼1300 nuclear-encoded proteins for producing, assembling, or supporting the five multimeric OXPHOS complexes (I–V) and ancillary mitochondrial processes. It stands to reason that mitochondrial dysfunction can result from either mtDNA or nuclear gene defects, and can occur as a primary, congenital condition or a secondary, age-associated effect attributable to somatic mutation.

The umbrella term 'mitochondrial disease' refers to a clinically heterogeneous group of primary mitochondrial disorders in which the tissues and organs that are most often affected are those with the highest energy demands. Clinical symptoms can arise in childhood or later in life and can affect one organ in isolation or be multisystemic.

### Endocrine dysfunction in primary mitochondrial diseases [^117Knj8w]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

- **Essential points**: Primary mitochondrial disorders are genetic disorders that can arise from diverse patho-mechanisms, including disrupted oxidative phosphorylation, defects of mitochondrial DNA maintenance, protein synthesis, membrane lipids, protein quality control, organelle dynamics, and antioxidant defense. Mitochondria house steroidogenesis and provide the energy to drive intracellular production and extracellular secretion of all hormones. Diabetes mellitus is the most frequent endocrine manifestation of mitochondrial disease, but growth hormone deficiency, adrenal insufficiency, hypogonadism, and parathyroid dysfunction also occur. Endocrine dysfunction may be the primary presentation of mitochondrial disease before neurological features arise but more commonly occurs in the context of complex multisystem disease. A high index of clinical suspicion of an underlying mitochondrial disorder is needed in a patient presenting with multisystemic disease and endocrine abnormalities.

Mitochondrial diseases are a diverse group of disorders that arise from dysfunction in the mitochondria, the energy-producing powerhouses within our cells. Mitochondria are present in all cells except mature erythrocytes, and they provide a multitude of functions. The result of mitochondrial dysfunction is a widely heterogeneous set of disorders, meaning virtually any organ in the body can be affected, leading to a complex clinical, biochemical, and genetic picture. The understanding of primary mitochondrial disease has been greatly improved by next-generation sequencing, with more than 400 genes identified to date.

### Impaired mitochondrial function and insulin resistance of skeletal muscle in mitochondrial diabetes [^114HZJ8N]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Impaired muscular mitochondrial function is related to common insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Mitochondrial diseases frequently lead to diabetes, which is mostly attributed to defective β-cell mitochondria and secretion.

- **Research design and methods**: We assessed muscular mitochondrial function and lipid deposition in liver (hepatocellular lipids [HCLs]) and muscle (intramyocellular lipids [IMCLs]) using ³¹P/¹H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose production (EGP) were evaluated using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps combined with isotopic tracer dilution in one female patient suffering from MELAS (myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) syndrome and in six control subjects.

- **Results**: The MELAS patient showed impaired insulin sensitivity (4.3 vs. 8.6 ± 0.5 mg · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹) and suppression of EGP (69 vs. 94 ± 1%), and her baseline and insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis were reduced (7.3 and 8.9 vs. 10.6 ± 1.0 and 12.8 ± 1.3 μmol · l⁻¹ · min⁻¹) compared with those of the control subjects. HCLs and IMCLs were comparable between the MELAS patient and control subjects.

- **Conclusions**: Impairment of muscle mitochondrial fitness promotes insulin resistance and could thereby contribute to the development of diabetes in some patients with the MELAS syndrome.

### Mtdna-maintenance defects: Syndromes and genes [^114zeWhZ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

A large group of mitochondrial disorders, ranging from early-onset pediatric encephalopathic syndromes to late-onset myopathy with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEOs), are inherited as Mendelian disorders characterized by disturbed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance. These errors of nuclear-mitochondrial intergenomic signaling may lead to mtDNA depletion, accumulation of mtDNA multiple deletions, or both, in critical tissues. The genes involved encode proteins belonging to at least three pathways: mtDNA replication and maintenance, nucleotide supply and balance, and mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. In most cases, allelic mutations in these genes may lead to profoundly different phenotypes associated with either mtDNA depletion or multiple deletions.

### Mitochondrial diseases in adults [^112tuuf6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial medicine is a field that has expanded exponentially over the last 30 years. Although individually rare, mitochondrial diseases collectively represent one of the most frequent genetic disorders in adults. The complexity of their genotype-phenotype correlation relates to penetrance, clinical expressivity, natural history, and diagnostic algorithms. This complexity derives from dual genetic determination — there are about 1,500 genes encoding mitochondrial proteins residing in the nuclear genome (nDNA), in addition to the 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), which require 22 specific tRNAs and 2 rRNAs. Therefore, beyond Mendelian genetics, we must consider how mtDNA is inherited, maintained, and expressed to fully comprehend the pathogenic mechanisms of these disorders.

The field has expanded beyond the initial focus on oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction. Now, the understanding of mitochondrial functions, which affect cellular homeostasis and drive processes of life and death, is impressively broader. Clinically, the focus has shifted from the neuromuscular field, where mitochondrial dysfunction initially targeted energy-dependent tissues like the brain and skeletal muscle. Today, nearly every subspecialty of medicine is involved. We summarize the key clinical features and pathogenic mechanisms of mitochondrial diseases in adults.

### The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis [^115qPP9X]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023).

To promote new thinking about the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examine the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Pathologically, AD is characterized by progressive neuronal loss and biochemical abnormalities, including mitochondrial dysfunction. Conventional thinking has dictated that AD is driven by amyloid beta pathology, as per the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis; however, the underlying mechanism of how amyloid beta leads to cognitive decline remains unclear. A model correctly identifying the pathogenesis of AD is critical for the development of effective therapeutics.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is closely linked to the core pathological feature of AD: neuronal dysfunction. Targeting mitochondria and associated proteins may hold promise for new strategies in the development of disease-modifying therapies. According to the Mitochondrial Cascade Hypothesis, mitochondrial dysfunction drives the pathogenesis of AD. Baseline mitochondrial function and mitochondrial change rates influence the progression of cognitive decline.

- **Key highlights**:
	- The Amyloid Cascade Model does not readily account for various parameters associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
	- A unified model that correctly identifies the pathogenesis of AD is greatly needed to inform the development of successful therapeutics.
	- Mitochondria play a key and central role in maintaining optimal neuronal and synaptic function, the core pathological feature of AD.
	- Mitochondrial dysfunction may be the primary cause of AD and is a promising target for new therapeutic strategies.

### Mitochondrial disease in adults: Recent advances and future promise [^11413B13]. The Lancet Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are among the most common inherited neurometabolic disorders, and significant progress has been made in our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions in the past five years. The development of national mitochondrial disease cohorts and international collaborations has expanded our knowledge of the spectrum of clinical phenotypes and the natural history of mitochondrial diseases. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have transformed the diagnostic algorithm for mitochondrial diseases by increasingly adopting a genetics-first approach, with more than 350 disease-causing genes identified at the time of writing.

The management strategy for mitochondrial disease focuses on surveillance for multisystem involvement and effective symptomatic treatment. However, new endeavors are underway to discover better treatments, including drug repurposing, the use of novel small molecules, and gene therapies. Additionally, developments in reproductive technology offer women the opportunity to prevent the transmission of DNA-related mitochondrial disease to their children.

### Mitochondrial disease: Genetics and management [^1122Be9n]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial disease is a collective term that encompasses a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of diseases due to defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It is one of the most common groups of genetic diseases and can be caused by mutations in either mitochondrial DNA or nuclear genes that directly or indirectly interfere with mitochondrial respiratory chain function. At the time of writing, mitochondrial proteomics analysis reveals that in addition to the 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome, around 1500 proteins are linked to various mitochondrial functions, and so far, more than 200 genes have been implicated in the development of human disease.

A number of syndromes have been described in mitochondrial disease, but often, patients present with non-syndromic presentations, of which the nervous system is most commonly affected. In addition to the diagnostic challenges, clinicians also encounter difficulties in the management of mitochondrial disease due to the lack of effective disease-modifying therapy and, until recently, best practice guidelines on various complications associated with the disease.

In this review article, we discuss the genetics and epidemiology of mitochondrial disease, neurological presentations and their management, as well as genetic counseling and reproductive options for patients.

### Late-onset mitochondrial DNA depletion: DNA copy number, multiple deletions, and compensation [^115ifVCU]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Through a report of four late-onset cases with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, we address the specificity of the clinical entities associated with a very low residual amount of mtDNA. Three of the patients met the diagnostic criteria of Kearns Sayre syndrome, which has never been associated with mtDNA depletion. The fourth patient had an isolated skeletal myopathy. Deleted mtDNA molecules were found by long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) only in the Kearns Sayre syndromes, which strengthens the clinical differences between the two types of patients. All patients had extremely low residual amounts of mtDNA as shown by Southern blot analysis. Using an original method based on competitive PCR, we were able to measure the number of mtDNA copies per diploid genome. These results demonstrated the severity of the depletion in the patients by comparison not only to normal controls but also to patients with mtDNA disorders. Despite the severity of the depletion, in situ hybridization using two mtDNA transcripts revealed a normal steady-state level of transcription. Such compensation provides clues to the striking contrast between the severity of mtDNA depletion and the late onset and slowly progressive disease.

### Outcome measures for children with mitochondrial disease: Consensus recommendations for future studies from a Delphi-based international workshop [^112UBZFi]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are an important group of inherited disorders, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5000 live births. Although the term "mitochondrial diseases" is much broader in the strict sense, it is reserved here for disorders directly affecting the function of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Mitochondrial diseases can be caused by mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA.

Paediatric mitochondrial diseases mostly present with a multi-system phenotype mainly involving tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain, retina, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. For practical reasons, we divided the extremely complex and heterogeneous clinical presentations of individual mitochondrial disease into two phenotypes: mitochondrial encephalopathy, where the central nervous system has the most prominent signs and symptoms, and mitochondrial myopathy, in which the clinical disease expression is dominated by muscle involvement.

### Mtdna-maintenance defects: Syndromes and genes [^115FVtdB]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). High credibility.

A large group of mitochondrial disorders, ranging from early-onset pediatric encephalopathic syndromes to late-onset myopathy with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEOs), are inherited as Mendelian disorders characterized by disturbed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance. These errors of nuclear-mitochondrial intergenomic signaling may lead to mtDNA depletion, accumulation of mtDNA multiple deletions, or both, in critical tissues. The genes involved encode proteins belonging to at least three pathways: mtDNA replication and maintenance, nucleotide supply and balance, and mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. In most cases, allelic mutations in these genes may lead to profoundly different phenotypes associated with either mtDNA depletion or multiple deletions.

### Investigation of the mitochondrial genome in patients with atypical motor neuron disease [^1136g8wL]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The molecular etiology of many patients with motor neuron disease (MND) remains unknown. Recent evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly the discovery of histochemical abnormalities and pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, prompted us to further investigate the role of mtDNA abnormalities in a cohort of thirteen patients with atypical MND presentations by conducting whole mitochondrial genome sequencing. No pathogenic mutations were detected, suggesting that inherited mtDNA mutations are not a common cause of atypical MND presentations.

### Mitochondrial myopathies [^111hAYPN]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Our understanding of mitochondrial diseases, defined restrictively as defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is expanding rapidly. In this review, I will provide the latest information on disorders affecting predominantly or exclusively skeletal muscle.

- **Recent findings**: The most recently described mitochondrial myopathies are due to defects in nuclear DNA, including coenzyme Q10 deficiency and mutations in genes controlling mitochondrial DNA abundance and structure, such as POLG, TK2, and MPV17. Barth syndrome, an X-linked recessive mitochondrial myopathy/cardiopathy, is associated with a decreased amount and altered structure of cardiolipin, the main phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane. A secondary impairment of respiratory chain function is plausible. The role of mutations in protein-coding genes of mitochondrial DNA in causing isolated myopathies has been confirmed. Mutations in tRNA genes of mitochondrial DNA can also cause predominantly myopathic syndromes, and — contrary to conventional wisdom — these mutations can be homoplasmic.

- **Summary**: Defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain impair energy production and almost invariably involve skeletal muscle. This leads to exercise intolerance, cramps, myoglobinuria, or fixed weakness, which often affects extraocular muscles and results in droopy eyelids (ptosis) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia.

### Mitochondrial abnormalities in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy [^116PwJM9]. Human Molecular Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial abnormalities and oxidative stress-mediated neuronal toxicity have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and HD. Here we studied mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA. We found that the expression of mutant AR is associated with activation of the mitochondrial caspase pathway, decreased MtMP, elevated ROS levels, and increased cell death. These changes were mitigated with CsA and antioxidants. We also report consistent decreases in PGC-1β mRNA and in SOD2 mRNA and protein. Altered gene expression in a knock-in mouse model of SBMA was evident in pre-manifesting mice, suggesting that mitochondrial abnormalities and redox imbalance occur early in the disease mechanism. Interestingly, we found AR associated with the mitochondria in MN-1 and PC12 cells. Taken together, the evidence supports both indirect and direct effects of mutant AR on mitochondrial function in SBMA (Fig. 8).

- **Figure 8. Mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA**: Mitochondrial mass, number, and membrane potential are likely affected by mutant AR indirectly through ligand-dependent alterations in mitochondrial gene expression and directly through association of AR with mitochondria. The decrease in MtMP is blocked by CsA. Downstream from the mitochondrial dysfunction, mutant AR increases ROS levels, which can reversibly result in further deleterious effects on the mitochondrial membrane. The antioxidants CoQ10 and idebenone block the increase in ROS levels. Mitochondrial dysfunction increases caspase 9 activity, which in turn increases caspase 3 activity.

### Understanding the impact of mitochondrial defects in cardiovascular disease: a review [^114MtmPN]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2002). Low credibility.

Defects in mitochondrial structure and function have been found in association with cardiovascular diseases such as dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction defects and sudden death, ischemic and alcoholic cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis. A genetic basis has been established for some mitochondrial abnormalities, such as mitochondrial DNA changes leading to oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction and fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) defects resulting from specific nuclear mutations. Other abnormalities appear to be due to a more sporadic or environmental cardiotoxic insult or have not yet been characterized.

- **Methods**: This article reviews mitochondrial abnormalities in structure or function reported in cardiac diseases, highlighting information about their potential etiology, significance in cardiac pathogenesis, and diagnostic and therapeutic options available to the clinician. It also provides a brief background concerning mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetic pathways in cardiac growth, development, and aging.

- **Conclusions**: Although aberrations in the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria appear to be most often related to cardiac dysfunction, the primary defect(s) causing bioenergetic dysfunction may reside in a non-bioenergetic pathway, such as signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, or in overall mitochondrial biogenesis or degradation pathways.

### Mitochondrial DNA disorders: from pathogenic variants to preventing transmission [^11779R9M]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Pathogenic mtDNA variants are an important cause of disease. Since their first description in 1988, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of mtDNA variants in human disease. While several studies suggest that mtDNA variants are risk factors for a growing number of common diseases, this review focuses on those primarily caused by pathogenic mtDNA variants.

One of the great challenges of mtDNA disease is the varied clinical presentation in terms of age of onset, which ranges from the neonatal period to late adult life, and the combination of clinical features. Tissues and organs heavily dependent upon OXPHOS (e.g. skeletal and cardiac muscles and brain) are predominantly affected, but any tissue can be involved. Historically, patients were categorized into specific syndromes such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome or mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). However, most patients present with a spectrum of nonspecific features (e.g. fatigue, diabetes, or deafness) and mtDNA disease is suspected through clinical pattern recognition and family history of mtDNA maternal inheritance. Most patients have involvement of multiple organs, thus diagnosis and care by a multidisciplinary team are required.

This phenotypical variability has made prevalence very difficult to establish. Population studies looking at mtDNA pathogenic variants suggest a surprisingly high frequency (1 in 250 people in some studies) and that most carriers are asymptomatic. Studies on the prevalence of mtDNA diseases have shown that they affect about 10 adults per 100,000.

### Ketogenic treatment reduces deleted mitochondrial DNAs in cultured human cells [^1128Kco2]. Annals of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism has been associated with a wide range of human disorders. Large-scale partial deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause sporadic Kearns-Sayre syndrome, a fatal multisystem disorder in which the majority of mtDNAs in affected tissues have deletions (Δ-mtDNAs). Since most mtDNA-related diseases, including Kearns-Sayre syndrome, are recessive, only a few wild-type mtDNAs can compensate for the deleterious effects of many Δ-mtDNAs.

We have developed a pharmacological approach to reduce the proportion of Δ-mtDNAs in vitro by growing cells in a medium containing ketone bodies, replacing glucose as the carbon source. Cells containing 100% Δ-mtDNA died after five days of treatment, whereas those containing 100% wild-type mtDNA survived. In a cloned heteroplasmic cell line, the proportion of wild-type mtDNA increased from 13% initially to approximately 22% after five days in ketogenic medium, accompanied by a dramatic improvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis.

We also present evidence that treatment with ketone bodies caused "heteroplasmic shifting" not only among cells (i.e. intercellular selection) but also within cells (i.e. intracellular selection). The demonstration that ketone bodies can distinguish between normal and respiratorily compromised cells points to the potential use of a ketogenic diet to treat patients with heteroplasmic mtDNA disorders.

### Endocrine dysfunction in primary mitochondrial diseases [^111aLXcL]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial protein synthesis disorders can broadly be categorized into two main groups: (i) mtDNA-related disorders and (ii) nuclear DNA-related disorders. The first group includes disorders involving mitochondrial tRNAs, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF). It also includes disorders associated with single large-scale mtDNA deletions (SLSMDs), such as Pearson marrow pancreas and Kearns-Sayre syndromes and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO).

The second group includes defects in genes encoding tRNA modification factors, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (enzymes that attach specific amino acids to cognate tRNAs to allow protein synthesis), mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and factors required for initiation, elongation, and termination of mitochondrial translation. Impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis leads to a deficiency of essential components of the OXPHOS system, with consequent effects on cellular energy production.

- **Clinical presentation**: SLSMD disorders, including Pearson and Kearns-Sayre syndromes, can exhibit extreme variability, both in terms of the affected tissues or organs and the severity of symptoms. This variability is partly due to the heteroplasmy phenomenon, where cells can have a mixture of normal and mutated mtDNA. The degree of heteroplasmy, or the proportion of mutant mtDNA within a cell, can greatly influence the severity of symptoms.

### Prevalence of rare mitochondrial DNA mutations in mitochondrial disorders [^115h66iG]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

In OXPHOS disorders, identification of causative mutation(s) is critical to confirm the diagnosis and propose accurate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. However, molecular analysis is problematic due to the large genetic heterogeneity of mtDNA-related disorders. Primary mtDNA defects include large rearrangements and point mutations.

In clinical practice, most suspected patients do not have their entire mitochondrial genome sequenced but are usually tested only for deletions and a small number of common mutations. Several groups have reported that testing for common mtDNA defects in adults with suspected mitochondrial disease can have quite a high diagnostic yield, ranging from 10% to 40% of patients tested. Testing for common mtDNA mutations has a much lower diagnostic yield in children, ranging from 2–4% to 25%. Recently, looking for 10 mtDNA point mutations in 3,168 neonatal cord blood samples revealed that at least 1 in 200 healthy humans harbors a pathogenic mtDNA mutation, although at low mutant heteroplasmy. However, at the time of writing, the rate of rare mutations is totally unknown. To answer this question, we analyzed the whole mitochondrial genome of 743 patients suspected of manifesting a mitochondrial disease after excluding deletions and the most common mutations.

A total of 55 patients (7.4%) harbored pathogenic mutations responsible for an onset disorder before adulthood in 67% of cases and before 1 year of age in 24% of cases. Previous studies have suggested that 50% or more of all patients have adult onset.

### Mitochondrial cardiomyopathies: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1114Xn9D]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Mitochondrial cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by dysfunction of mitochondrial energy production due to genetic mutations affecting mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. These conditions can include a wide range of cardiac manifestations and are frequently associated with other multisystemic symptoms, including skeletal myopathy, neurological deficits, and metabolic disturbances. Advances in genetic testing have improved diagnostic accuracy; however, early identification remains challenging due to the variable clinical presentation and clinical overlap with other cardiomyopathies.

Therapeutic strategies are still evolving, with management focusing on symptom control and mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options for mitochondrial cardiomyopathies, highlighting the ongoing need for research into effective therapies and improved patient outcomes.

### Clinical, biochemical, molecular, and histological features of 65 Portuguese patients with mitochondrial disorders [^114u9fsh]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial disorders exhibit remarkable genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical, histological, biochemical, and genetic features of 65 patients with molecular diagnoses of mitochondrial disorders. The most common genetic diagnosis was a single large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion, found in 41.5% of patients. The most frequent clinical phenotype was chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), occurring in 41.5% of all patients, mainly in those with mtDNA deletions. Histological signs of mitochondrial dysfunction were observed in 73.8% of patients, and respiratory chain enzyme assay (RCEA) abnormalities were found in 51.9%.

This study confirms the high relative frequency of single large-scale deletions among mitochondrial disorders and their particular association with CPEO. Muscle histology is particularly useful in older patients and those with mtDNA deletions, whereas RCEA might be more helpful in young children or individuals with mtDNA depletion.

### The contribution of mitochondria to common disorders [^111WtV9n]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial dysfunction secondary to mitochondrial and nuclear DNA mutations has been associated with energy deficiency in multiple organ systems and a variety of severe, often fatal, clinical syndromes. Although the production of energy is indeed the primary function of mitochondria, attention has also been directed toward their role in producing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the subsequent widespread deleterious effects of these intermediates. The generation of toxic reactive intermediates has been implicated in a number of relatively common disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Understanding the role mitochondrial dysfunction plays in the pathogenesis of common disorders has provided unique insights into a number of diseases and offers hope for potential new therapies.

### Endocrine dysfunction in primary mitochondrial diseases [^1174aaDE]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Disorders of mitochondrial dynamics involve abnormalities in the processes of mitochondrial fission, fusion, and motility. These dynamic processes are essential for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial network within cells.

- **Mitochondrial fission**: Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) is a protein involved in mitochondrial fission, the process of dividing mitochondria into smaller units. Excessive fission or impaired fusion can lead to fragmented mitochondria. Mutations or dysregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, such as DRP1 and the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), can result in the accumulation of elongated or interconnected mitochondria.

- **Mitochondrial fusion**: This process involves the fusion of the mitochondrial membranes, allowing mitochondria to merge and share contents. Examples of fusion dysfunction occur in deficiencies of MFN1/2 (Mitofusin 1 and 2), proteins that mediate the fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and deficiencies of OPA1 (Optic Atrophy 1), a protein required for inner mitochondrial membrane fusion. Pathogenic variants in MFN2 or OPA1 can lead to fragmented mitochondria and impaired fusion, affecting mitochondrial function and distribution.

- **Mitochondrial motility**: Mitochondrial motility requires intact microtubules to move along, and functioning motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, to facilitate this process. Impaired mitochondrial transport along microtubules can lead to uneven distribution and dysfunction. In addition, deficiencies in proteins responsible for anchoring mitochondria in specific cellular locations can further disrupt cellular function.

### Probing striated muscle mitochondrial phenotype in neuromuscular disorders [^116595Z2]. Pediatric Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Multisystemic disorders with predominantly neurologic manifestations often present with mitochondrial abnormalities in striated muscle biopsies. Decreased respiratory complex activities and abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and DNA constitute the spectrum of mitochondrial changes used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in patients with neuromuscular disorders. This study assessed mitochondrial defects present in a cohort of 154 young patients to determine diagnostic efficiency and probe the relationship of mitochondrial to clinical phenotype.

Striated muscle biopsies were analyzed for mitochondrial structure and number, levels of enzyme activities of complex I-V and citrate synthase, mitochondrial DNA and specific mitochondrial DNA deletions, and the presence of 15 pathogenic mitochondrial DNA point mutations. Reduced complex I, III, IV, and V activities were the most ubiquitous finding, with complex III most commonly affected. Mitochondrial structural defects (39%) included changes in mitochondria sizes/shapes and number and aberrant cristae formation. Mitochondrial DNA deletions were evident in 15 patients, three displayed mitochondrial DNA depletion, and only two harbored pathogenic point mutations.

Reductions in specific enzyme activities may be the most sensitive diagnostic indicator, whereas defects in ultrastructure and mitochondrial DNA integrity were frequently accompanied by the full spectrum of mitochondrial abnormalities. Some phenotypes displayed specific mitochondrial abnormalities; however, most clinical phenotypes displayed little specificity with respect to mitochondrial defects.

### Mitochondrial DNA deletions in muscle satellite cells: Implications for therapies [^112L7yZo]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial myopathies are an important group of muscle conditions caused by defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Patients often present with muscle weakness, although fatigue and exercise intolerance are frequently problems. In some patients, the predominantly proximal myopathy is accompanied by severe involvement of the extraocular muscles leading to chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), while in others it is part of a multi-system disorder. The myopathic symptoms are progressive and disabling in many patients, and unfortunately, there is little in the way of specific treatment.

Primary mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are a common cause of mitochondrial myopathy and may be either point mutations or single, large-scale mtDNA deletions. MtDNA is present in tissues in multiple copies, and the mtDNA mutations causing mitochondrial myopathies are frequently heteroplasmic, with a mixture of mutated and wild-type forms. The vast majority of mtDNA mutations are functionally recessive, and a biochemical deficit is only observed when there are high levels of mutated mtDNA and low levels of wild-type mtDNA. Heteroplasmic mtDNA defects classically give rise to the mosaic pattern of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) normal, intermediate, and deficient muscle fibres.

### Molecular basis of diseases induced by the mitochondrial DNA mutation m.9032T > C [^115F7yKH]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). Low credibility.

Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) provides eukaryotic cells with the energy-rich ATP molecule. During this process, electrons from carbohydrates and fatty acids are transferred to oxygen, resulting in a proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane used by ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP with inorganic phosphate. Mutations compromising this activity result in devastating neuromuscular diseases. Many of these mutations are located in the mitochondrial genome, where the genes for 13 OXPHOS proteins, as well as a number of transfer and ribosomal RNAs required for their synthesis inside the mitochondrion, reside.

With recent advancements in high-resolution protein structures and detailed descriptions of their energy-transducing mechanisms, predictions about the potential consequences of specific gene mutations on mitochondrial function have become possible. However, only a limited number of amino acid residues in OXPHOS proteins are known to have critical functions, and these are generally not targeted by mutations found in patients' mitochondrial DNA. Moreover, these mutations typically affect only a fraction of the numerous copies of the mitochondrial genome (heteroplasmy). The existence of multiple sources of genetic heterogeneity in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA between individuals further complicates the evaluation of their functional consequences and pathogenicity. Lastly, there are still no reliable methods for the genetic transformation of human mitochondria.

### Strategies for treating mitochondrial disorders: an update [^111hZe19]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from primary dysfunction of the respiratory chain due to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA mutations. The wide heterogeneity of biochemical dysfunctions and pathogenic mechanisms typical of this group of diseases has hindered therapy trials; therefore, available treatment options remain limited. Therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing mitochondrial functions by enhancing biogenesis and electron transport chain function, improving the removal of reactive oxygen species and noxious metabolites, modulating aberrant calcium homeostasis, and repopulating mitochondrial DNA could potentially restore the respiratory chain dysfunction. The challenge that lies ahead is the translation of some promising laboratory results into safe and effective therapies for patients. In this review, we briefly update and discuss the most feasible therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial diseases.

### Recent advances in understanding the molecular genetic basis of mitochondrial disease [^113NTe6D]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Low credibility.

WES is currently more widely used than WGS, but we expect this to change in the near future. There have been calls for a first-line WGS-based approach in mitochondrial disease. We agree that trio WGS should form a central role in the diagnostic process, but most cases will likely require some degree of functional validation (Figure 2). When a known pathogenic variant explaining the clinical phenotype has not been identified by WES/WGS, skin and skeletal muscle biopsies can be crucial. Their use has enabled the identification of many novel genetic associations where functional assessment was essential for affirming pathogenicity. It is in this niche where skeletal muscle biopsy continues to prove invaluable in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.

- **Variants in mtDNA**: In the case of mtDNA variants, it is helpful to assess the mutation load if the variant is not homoplasmic. However, it is important to do so in an appropriate tissue since mutation load can differ between tissues. For novel mtDNA variants of unknown significance, the "gold standard" approach for verifying pathogenicity is to demonstrate an observable correlation between higher mutant loads and severity of biochemical phenotype. This is typically done, for novel mt-tRNA gene variants, by assessing heteroplasmy in individual COX-positive and COX-deficient fibers to demonstrate a functional threshold.

- **Variants in nuclear DNA**:
	- **Novel variants in a known disease gene**: The functional workup varies on a case-by-case basis.

### Abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^112ov4PV]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the earliest and most prominent features in vulnerable neurons in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Recent studies suggest that mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles characterized by a delicate balance of fission and fusion, a concept that has revolutionized our basic understanding of the regulation of mitochondrial structure and function, which has far-reaching significance in studies of health and disease. Tremendous progress has been made in studying changes in mitochondrial dynamics in AD brain models and the potential underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the recent work demonstrating abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and distribution in AD models and discusses how these abnormalities may contribute to various aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of AD.

### Disease progression in patients with single, large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions [^1127TRz9]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial genetic defects are an important cause of neurological disease and result from mutations of either the nuclear or mitochondrial genome. The ability to understand and predict the progression of mitochondrial disease is of great clinical importance, providing patients with guidance about their risk of developing symptoms and enabling clinicians to provide optimal patient care. However, at the time of writing, the fundamental understanding of the factors governing mitochondrial disease progression is limited, and studies often present contradictory findings. We, therefore, chose to concentrate on one of the most common mitochondrial diseases: patients with single, large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions.

Characterization of the phenotypic presentation of single, large-scale mitochondrial DNA disease is traditionally divided into three main presentations: Kearns-Sayre syndrome, a multi-system childhood or teenage-onset syndrome; chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), a milder presentation primarily involving weakness of the extraocular muscles with ptosis, but often associated with more widespread muscular weakness; and Pearson Syndrome, an often fatal infantile-onset syndrome characterized by sideroblastic anemia and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, which may develop into Kearns-Sayre syndrome in those who survive infancy. However, as many studies attempting to clarify phenotypic presentation have noted, these divisions are somewhat imprecise and misrepresent the true spectrum of single mitochondrial DNA deletion-related disease.

### Mitochondrial DNA maintenance defects: potential therapeutic strategies [^117Eswbt]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication depends on the mitochondrial import of hundreds of nuclear-encoded proteins that control mitochondrial genome maintenance and integrity. Defects in these processes result in an expanding group of disorders called mtDNA maintenance defects, characterized by mtDNA depletion and/or multiple mtDNA deletions with variable phenotypic manifestations. As is the case for mitochondrial disorders in general, treatment options for mtDNA maintenance defects are limited.

Recently, with the development of model organisms, improved understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders, and a better knowledge of their natural history, there has been an increase in the number of preclinical studies as well as existing and planned clinical trials. In this review, we discuss recent preclinical studies and future clinical trials concerning potential therapeutic options for the different mtDNA maintenance defects.

### Mitochondrial disorders of DNA polymerase γ dysfunction: From anatomic to molecular pathology diagnosis [^115e6ejb]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Primary mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most common causes of inherited disorders predominantly involving the neuromuscular system. Advances in the molecular study of mitochondrial DNA have changed our vision and approach to primary mitochondrial disorders. Many of these disorders are caused by mutations in nuclear genes and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Among the autosomal inherited mitochondrial disorders, those related to DNA polymerase γ dysfunction are the most common and the best studied. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and being familiar with recent advances in laboratory diagnosis of this group of mitochondrial disorders are essential for pathologists. This knowledge helps in interpreting abnormal histopathology and laboratory results and in suggesting further studies for a definitive diagnosis.

- **Objectives**: To help pathologists better understand the common clinical syndromes originating from mutations in DNA polymerase γ and its associated proteins. This includes using a stepwise approach of clinical, laboratory, and pathologic diagnosis of these syndromes.

- **Data sources**: A review of pertinent published literature and relevant internet databases.

- **Conclusions**: Mitochondrial disorders are now better recognized with the development of molecular tests for clinical diagnosis. A cooperative effort among primary physicians, diagnostic pathologists, geneticists, and molecular biologists with expertise in mitochondrial disorders is required to reach a definitive diagnosis.

### Mitochondria as a therapeutic target for common pathologies [^111xjcKY]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2018). Low credibility.

Although the development of mitochondrial therapies has largely focused on diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, it has been found that mitochondrial dysfunction also contributes to the pathology of many common disorders, including neurodegeneration, metabolic disease, heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and protozoal infections. Mitochondria therefore represent an important drug target for these highly prevalent diseases. Several strategies aimed at therapeutically restoring mitochondrial function are emerging, and a small number of agents have entered clinical trials. This review discusses the opportunities and challenges faced for the further development of mitochondrial pharmacology for common pathologies.

### Late-onset mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and the role of serial imaging [^113unMAc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Mitochondria are essential for human metabolic function. Over 350 genetic mutations are associated with mitochondrial diseases, which are inherited in a matrilineal fashion. In mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), defective mitochondrial function and resultant impaired cellular energy production compromise vascular perfusion in affected tissues. Early diagnostic criteria suggested the diagnosis should be considered in those under 40; however, a broader range of phenotypes is now recognized, including those that present for the first time later in life. The primary presenting feature in MELAS is a stroke-like episode, invariably resulting in patients undergoing neuroradiological imaging. We present a case of a woman with a first presentation of a stroke-like episode and seizures in her 40s, who was eventually diagnosed with MELAS. We detail her clinical presentation, treatment, and diagnosis, emphasizing the role of serial imaging in her diagnosis.

### Mitochondrial disease: Genetics and management [^113UY4gf]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Over recent years, there have been important advances in mitochondrial disease, particularly in terms of diagnosis and reproductive options available. The role of the clinician remains crucial since a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt recognition of complications remain essential to make an earlier diagnosis and instigate better management. Currently, the management of mitochondrial disease is largely supportive; however, with the improved understanding of disease mechanisms, ongoing treatment trials and the discovery of new therapeutic agents should give hope for patients with mitochondrial disease.

### Mitochondrial DNA disorders: From pathogenic variants to preventing transmission [^115CiQRB]. Human Molecular Genetics (2021). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders are recognized as one of the most common causes of inherited metabolic disorders. The mitochondrial genome occurs in multiple copies, resulting in both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic pathogenic mtDNA variants. A biochemical defect arises when the pathogenic variant level reaches a threshold, which differs between variants. Moreover, variants can segregate, clonally expand, or be lost from cellular populations, resulting in a dynamic and tissue-specific mosaic pattern of oxidative deficiency.

MtDNA is maternally inherited, but transmission patterns of heteroplasmic pathogenic variants are complex. During oogenesis, a mitochondrial bottleneck results in offspring with widely differing variant levels compared to their mother, while highly deleterious variants, such as deletions, are not transmitted. Complemented by a complex interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, these peculiar genetics produce marked phenotypic variation, posing challenges to the diagnosis and clinical management of patients.

Novel therapeutic compounds and several genetic therapies are currently under investigation, but proven disease-modifying therapies remain elusive. Women who carry pathogenic mtDNA variants require bespoke genetic counselling to determine their reproductive options. Recent advances during in vitro fertilization techniques have greatly improved reproductive choices, but they are not without challenges. Since the first pathogenic mtDNA variants were identified over 30 years ago, there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of these diseases.

### Use of whole-genome sequencing for mitochondrial disease diagnosis [^113wEb8Z]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases (MDs) are the most common group of inherited metabolic disorders, and novel therapies are now beginning to emerge. However, targeted treatments and reproductive options rely on a precise molecular diagnosis. The limited genotypic-phenotypic correlation of MDs makes molecular confirmation challenging, and many patients remain undiagnosed despite extensive investigation over long periods of time. MDs are unique because they can be caused by variants in either the mitochondrial or nuclear genome and can affect both children and adults.

Although minimum prevalence studies have estimated that 1 in 4,300 live births develop MD, community-based prevalence studies demonstrate that at least 1 in 250 people carry a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant that puts them at risk of developing an MD. This highlights that a large percentage of at-risk individuals carrying disease-causing variants are undiagnosed or remain asymptomatic. The clinical severity of affected patients ranges from mild, oligosymptomatic disease to severe, fatal illness. Presenting features in adults emerge at variable ages at onset, commonly including muscle weakness, fatigue, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, hearing loss, diabetes, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, and visual loss. Standard diagnostic criteria are based on available clinical data and include results of invasive procedures, such as muscle biopsy, but a precise diagnosis requires genetic testing.

Single, large-scale deletions of mitochondrial DNA are an important cause of mitochondrial disease, with a broad phenotypic spectrum.

### Mitochondrial genetics and disease [^116CVoGb]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial disease resulting in reduced bioenergetic output can be due to mutations in either nuclear DNA-encoded or mitochondrial DNA-encoded gene products. We summarize some of the underlying principles of mitochondrial genetics that impact the diagnosis and pathogenesis of mitochondrial disorders. In addition, we present a brief overview of a new frontier in the field, namely, mitochondrial "dynamics", which controls organellar fusion, fission, trafficking, and positioning, and exerts mitochondrial "quality control" by maintaining organellar integrity and viability. Analysis of mutations in gene products associated with this latter area has opened up new vistas in the study of disorders associated with compromised energy production.

### Mitochondrial diseases [^113kaYDV]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). High credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation, caused by mutations in genes in the nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that encode structural mitochondrial proteins or proteins involved in mitochondrial function. These diseases represent the most common group of inherited metabolic disorders and are among the most common forms of inherited neurological disorders.

One challenge of mitochondrial diseases is the marked clinical variation seen in patients, which can delay diagnosis. However, advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have substantially improved diagnosis, particularly in children. Establishing a genetic diagnosis allows patients with mitochondrial diseases to have reproductive options, but this is more challenging for women with pathogenic mtDNA mutations that are strictly maternally inherited. Recent advances during in vitro fertilization techniques, including mitochondrial donation, will offer better reproductive choices for these women in the future.

The treatment of patients with mitochondrial diseases remains a challenge, but guidelines are available to manage the complications of the disease. Moreover, an increasing number of therapeutic options are being considered, and with the development of large cohorts of patients and biomarkers, several clinical trials are in progress.

### Simultaneous detection and quantification of mitochondrial DNA deletion(s), depletion, and over-replication in patients with mitochondrial disease [^112BP4CR]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2005). Low credibility.

Heterogeneous clinical expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disorders depends on both qualitative and quantitative changes in mtDNA. We developed a sensitive and effective method that simultaneously detects mtDNA deletion(s) and quantifies total mtDNA content. The percentage of deletions and mtDNA content of 19 patients with single or multiple deletions were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR) using TaqMan probes specific for mtDNA (tRNA leu(UUR), ND4, ATPase8, and D-loop regions) and nuclear DNA (AIB1, beta-2-microglobulin, and beta-actin). The proportion of deletion mutants determined by real-time qPCR was consistent with that determined by Southern analysis.

Most patients with mtDNA deletions also demonstrated compensatory mtDNA over-replication. Multiple mtDNA deletions that were not detectable by Southern analysis due to the low percentage of each deletion molecule were readily detected and quantified by real-time qPCR. Furthermore, 12 patients with clinical features and abnormal biochemical/histopathological results consistent with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders without identified mtDNA mutations had either substantially depleted or significantly over-replicated mtDNA content, supporting the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease.

Our results demonstrate that both qualitative and quantitative analyses are important in the molecular diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases. The presence of deletion(s) and mtDNA depletion or compensatory over-replication can be determined simultaneously by real-time qPCR.

### Origins of tissue and cell-type specificity in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) disease [^117CbQ6f]. Human Molecular Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

A major long-standing challenge facing clinicians and patients is the lack of specific and targeted treatment for mtDNA disease. While some mutation-specific drugs have been approved for therapeutic use, such as idebenone, a short-chain benzoquinone effective in the treatment of LHON, many mtDNA diseases are treated symptomatically, with relatively few options available to target the underlying causes of the disease.

- **Targeted therapeutics and future directions**: One potential therapeutic approach of particular interest in heteroplasmic mtDNA disease is targeted gene therapy to shift cellular heteroplasmy towards wild type (WT). At the time of writing, the two most promising methods for modulating heteroplasmy are the induction of double-stranded breaks in mutant mtDNAs using mutation-specific nucleases, which result in subsequent degradation and depletion of mutant genomes, and targeted DNA base editors that directly revert the mutant base to WT. When combined with tissue-specific delivery, for example via adenoviral vectors, these technologies represent a promising prospect for future treatment of mtDNA disease, with base editors potentially able to correct both heteroplasmic and homoplasmic mutations.

The discovery of mitochondrially-targetable DNA base editors is of particular note. This new technology not only offers potential therapeutic benefits through the correction of pathogenic heteroplasmies, but also enables the introduction of specific point mutations into the mtDNA genome. This promises to revolutionize research in the field, as bespoke in vivo and in vitro heteroplasmies may now be generated.

### Mitochondrial cytopathies [^116tkzXc]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial cytopathies represent a heterogeneous group of multisystem disorders which preferentially affect the muscle and nervous systems. They are caused either by mutations in the maternally inherited mitochondrial genome or by nuclear DNA mutations. Approximately 200 different disease-causing mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are known today, and due to increased knowledge about nuclear genetics in recent years, more nuclear mutations are being described.

Owing to the non-uniform distribution of mitochondria in tissues and the co-existence of mutated and wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy) in these organelles, these disorders may present with a wide variety of symptoms, even if the same mutation is involved. Diagnostic investigations should include the measurement of serum and CSF lactate, neuroradiological tests, and a muscle biopsy to show the characteristic ragged-red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase-deficient cells, and also to provide material for genetic analysis. At the time of writing, the treatment of these diseases remains supportive and should focus on typical complications such as cardiac dysrhythmia and endocrinopathy.

### Mtdna-maintenance defects: Syndromes and genes [^1126pBNT]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

In addition to sporadic or maternally inherited disorders due to mutations of the mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial diseases can also be transmitted as Mendelian traits. Here, we shall focus on those Mendelian disorders that alter the stability and the integrity of mtDNA. In 1989, Zeviani and colleagues described an Italian family with adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy characterized by chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Maternal inheritance was excluded because the male patients also transmitted the disease to their offspring. Since then, many additional autosomal dominant CPEO families have been described.

A second group of syndromes, characterized by infantile myopathy or hepatopathy, was then associated with depletion of mitochondrial DNA in affected tissues. Multiple deletions and depletion of mitochondrial DNA were also found in skeletal muscle in a complex, multisystem syndrome, combining muscle, brain, and gastrointestinal symptoms (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy or MNGIE). Finally, mutations in the gene encoding the DNA polymerase gamma (POLG), the master enzyme of mitochondrial DNA replication, were found in severe, early-onset neurologic disorders, namely Alpers-Huttenlocher hepatopathic poliodystrophy, sensory-ataxia neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia, and spinocerebellar ataxia-epilepsy syndrome.

Over the last decade, an increasing number of genes have been identified in association with mtDNA.

### Research priorities for mitochondrial disorders: Current landscape and patient and professional views [^111vxAC4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The inherent processes that expedite or delay progression in mitochondrial disease are predominantly cryptic. For example, it was suggested that the combination of muscle mtDNA heteroplasmy level, mtDNA deletion size, and the location of the mtDNA deletion within the mitochondrial genome predicted disease progression in adult patients with single, large-scale mtDNA deletions (SLSMDs), but the same effects were not observed in a pediatric cohort with SLSMDs. There remains a large unmet need for natural history studies that also collect biomarker data.

The biomarker question was seen to be essential to the delivery of high-quality clinical trials and the development of therapy. It is possible that answering this question will also address Priority 4. A number of putative biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified, including FGF21 and GDF15, but none of these is sufficiently specific and sensitive for all mitochondrial diseases. For mitochondrial disorders caused by mtDNA mutations, mtDNA heteroplasmy can, in some cases, be a clinically useful biomarker for assessment of disease and prognostication. However, no equivalent biomarker has been identified for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disease.

- **Sentence case**: A number of questions focused on specific impacts and symptoms.

This topic was polarizing, with some rating it as most important and others as not being specific to mitochondrial disorders. Psychological support may include assisting families, as many early-onset mitochondrial disorders are associated with multisystem morbidity and significantly reduced life expectancy.

### Mitochondrial disorders: Clinical presentation and diagnostic dilemmas [^1162Wy8h]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2003). Low credibility.

The number of genes known to be involved in mitochondrial energy production and the elucidation of the function of their individual transcripts is still increasing. Although it is impossible at this stage to predict the total number of human genes necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and maintenance, it will most probably exceed the number found in budding yeast, which is about 800. Without a doubt, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg regarding the clinical spectrum of mitochondrial disorders. Recent findings, such as mutations in structural complex II genes in certain tumors, emphasize the need to think beyond the classical clinical presentation. We propose considering a mitochondrial disorder in every chronic, intermittent, or progressive disorder with single-system or multisystem involvement, even if lactic acid levels are normal. This raises dilemmas, such as whether we should "scrape the barrel" in every patient. The characterization of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA mutations in patients with enzymatically established mitochondrial defects has taught us that several clinical and diagnostic assumptions must be altered or even eliminated. The most challenging future task will be developing new diagnostic criteria covering the expanding clinical spectrum of mitochondrial disorders.

### Endocrine dysfunction in primary mitochondrial diseases [^111imNLA]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) comprise monogenic disorders involving two genomes: the nuclear genome and the small circular mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA) located within the mitochondria. The mitochondrial genome is unique as it is exclusively maternally inherited. The mtDNA exists as a circular DNA molecule encoding 13 OXPHOS proteins, along with 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, essential for the intramitochondrial synthesis of these 13 proteins.

The genetics of mtDNA disease are complicated by the concepts of homoplasmy and heteroplasmy. Cells contain a high copy number of mtDNA (up to hundreds or thousands of copies depending on the cell type); they may be homoplasmic, where 100% of mtDNA copies are of the same genotype, or heteroplasmic, where mutant and wild-type mtDNA coexist. This results in different proportions of mtDNA mutations within a person's cells, leading to intragenerational and intergenerational variability.

The severity of mtDNA-related PMD is influenced by a concept known as the threshold effect. Cells require a minimum threshold of mutated mtDNA to manifest clinically. If the mutated mtDNA levels exceed this threshold, cellular function is compromised, leading to disease symptoms. Interestingly, the specific threshold level required to cause symptoms varies depending on the pathogenic mtDNA variant and the affected tissue or organ. This may result in the potential co-existence of severely affected and completely unaffected organs.

### Clinical features and treatment of stroke-like episodes in mitochondrial disease: a cohort-based study [^112Rywne]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are inherited neurometabolic diseases that affect mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. They are caused by mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA), and the prevalence is estimated to be between 1:4000 and 1:5000. The considerable variability of clinical symptoms associated with mitochondrial disease remains a major diagnostic challenge for clinicians.

Stroke-like episodes (SLEs) were first described in mitochondrial syndromes such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), most commonly associated with the m.3243A > G variant in mtDNA. Although the m.3243A > G variant is the most common cause of SLEs, other pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants and nuclear gene mutations are also recognized in association with SLEs. The clinical features of SLE typically include headache, nausea or vomiting, encephalopathy, seizures, visual disturbances, language or other cognitive impairments, and sensory-motor symptoms. The onset is typically subacute or acute, and the stroke-like lesions observed with brain imaging evolve over time. The distribution of the lesions is inconsistent with a vascular territory, and they are commonly located in posterior brain regions. SLEs were long thought to be associated only with mitochondrial disease at younger ages (< 40 years), but late-onset presentations are increasingly recognized.

The outcome of SLE varies among patients. The neurological symptoms and lesions can spontaneously reverse, but especially patients with mitochondr

### Mitochondria in the aetiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease [^1156juBm]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Several biochemical abnormalities have been described in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), including oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The identification of specific gene mutations that cause PD has reinforced the relevance of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in both the familial and sporadic forms of the disease. The proteins associated with familial PD — PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), DJ-1, alpha-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, and possibly parkin — are either mitochondrial proteins or are associated with mitochondria, interfacing with pathways of oxidative stress and free radical damage. Insights into the aetiology and pathogenesis of PD provide hope that drugs, or cocktails of drugs, might intervene in the pathogenesis and slow the progression of the disease, deriving from the study of converging rather than diverging pathways leading to cell dysfunction and death.
