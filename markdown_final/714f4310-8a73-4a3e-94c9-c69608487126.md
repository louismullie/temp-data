## Question

Recent round of azithromycin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the safety, efficacy, and stewardship considerations for a recent azithromycin course. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and indication for azithromycin. Then, I should verify the dosing regimen and pharmacokinetics. Next, I will review common and serious adverse effects, including QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity, C. difficile, and hypersensitivity. After that, I need to check drug–drug interactions and special populations. I will then examine antimicrobial resistance implications and stewardship. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit assessment and provide practical monitoring and follow-up recommendations, ensuring each assertion is supported by appropriate sources throughout [^notfound].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication, because azithromycin's risk–benefit profile varies substantially by use-case, and I should not jump to conclusions without anchoring to the indication and patient factors. Azithromycin is commonly used for community-acquired pneumonia, COPD exacerbation prevention, certain sexually transmitted infections, and as part of mass drug administration strategies in children; it is also used in HIV-related opportunistic infections and occasionally in asthma for immunomodulation, so I need to ensure the indication is appropriate and guideline-concordant before proceeding [^1117B96f] [^115rzPgH] [^111eV3po] [^113ytXac] [^115b4hA2].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing regimen and pharmacokinetics, because tissue persistence and accumulation can shape both efficacy and toxicity. Standard adult dosing for many infections is 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily on days 2–5, with IV-to-PO step-down regimens used in hospitalized CAP; azithromycin has a long tissue half-life and achieves steady-state slowly without a loading dose, which explains prolonged effects and the need to consider cumulative exposure when assessing risk, particularly for QT effects and microbiome disruption [^112VpUxg] [^116fqCW8].

> I will now examine common adverse effects, and I should double-check the frequencies from trials versus labels to avoid over- or underestimating. Gastrointestinal effects predominate: diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting are the most frequent, typically mild to moderate and reversible on discontinuation; injection-site reactions occur with IV use, and transient laboratory abnormalities such as transaminase elevations can occur, which supports routine clinical vigilance rather than alarm in otherwise low-risk patients [^116zuDaq] [^1123U76m] [^1166qLwf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cardiac safety; I need to check QT prolongation risk carefully because it is dose- and context-dependent and can be clinically significant. Azithromycin can prolong the QTc in a dose-dependent fashion, with spontaneous reports of torsades de pointes; risk is amplified by congenital long QT, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, heart failure, and coadministration with other QT-prolonging drugs; elderly patients are more susceptible, and guidelines recommend ECG screening in selected scenarios such as persistent asthma before chronic macrolide therapy, so I should confirm concomitant QT-prolonging agents and electrolyte status before concluding risk is acceptable [^111uf4R7] [^112QY3aL] [^116hsDLc] [^11586Xmw].

> Next, I should review hepatotoxicity, and I need to ensure I do not miss early warning signs. Serious hepatic injury, including cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure, has been reported, some fatal; therefore, I should advise immediate discontinuation if symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, or right upper quadrant pain occur, and consider baseline and symptom-triggered liver tests in patients with hepatic risk factors or prolonged therapy [^111uf4R7] [^112tow3S] [^11586Xmw].

> I will now examine Clostridioides difficile risk, and I should confirm that even short courses can precipitate CDI. Azithromycin, like other antibiotics, increases the risk of CDI, so new-onset diarrhea during or shortly after therapy warrants evaluation and empiric management per local protocols, with heightened suspicion in older adults or those with recent antibiotic exposure [^11586Xmw] [^111uf4R7] [^116zuDaq].

> But wait, what if the patient develops a rash or mucosal involvement; I need to check for serious hypersensitivity and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Azithromycin has been associated with anaphylaxis, angioedema, AGEP, SJS, and TEN, and DRESS has been reported; importantly, due to the long tissue half-life, allergic symptoms may recur after initial symptomatic treatment, so prolonged observation may be necessary if severe reactions occur [^111uf4R7] [^112tow3S] [^11586Xmw].

> Let me consider special populations, and I should confirm age-specific risks. In neonates, azithromycin has been linked to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, so caregivers should be counseled to seek care for persistent vomiting or feeding intolerance; in older adults, susceptibility to QT effects and hearing impairment may be higher, warranting conservative use and monitoring; in pregnancy, most data do not show a major teratogenic signal, though some observational studies suggest a small increase in spontaneous miscarriage, so risk–benefit discussions and indication-specific guidance are essential [^111uf4R7] [^115GPKyt] [^113DqwXh] [^114Rni7N].

> I need to check drug–drug interactions next, and I should verify both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic contributors to harm. Azithromycin has fewer CYP3A interactions than clarithromycin or erythromycin, but it still prolongs the QT interval and should be used cautiously with other QT-prolonging agents such as certain antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antimalarials, and ondansetron; in HIV care, it is often preferred over clarithromycin when macrolide therapy is needed due to fewer interactions, but coadministration with bedaquiline or other QT-prolonging TB drugs requires ECG monitoring and electrolyte correction [^115ghHcz] [^111kinfK] [^113aC9JH] [^111NpBux].

> Hold on, I should verify antimicrobial resistance implications because even a single course can have ecological effects. Azithromycin use contributes to macrolide resistance in common respiratory pathogens and can perturb the gut microbiome; mass drug administration programs have documented increases in macrolide resistance in pneumococcus and E. coli, and individual-level studies show that carriage of macrolide resistance genes can modulate clinical outcomes, with the mef(A) gene linked to loss of benefit or even harm in some pediatric post-discharge contexts, underscoring the need to reserve azithromycin for clear indications and to minimize unnecessary exposure [^111eV3po] [^113i3MJ9] [^114wuzLe] [^112iYdEE].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit assessment, and I should ensure the indication truly warrants macrolide therapy. For guideline-supported uses such as CAP, COPD exacerbation prevention in frequent exacerbators, or certain STIs, the benefits can outweigh risks when patients are appropriately selected, dosed, and monitored; conversely, for empiric therapy without a compatible bacterial syndrome, or in settings with high macrolide resistance and low expected efficacy, the harms — including CDI, QT effects, hepatotoxicity, and resistance selection — may predominate, arguing against use [^1117B96f] [^115rzPgH] [^114J71hk] [^115dx9AK].

> Next, I should review practical monitoring and follow-up, and I need to ensure recommendations are proportionate to risk. For most short courses in low-risk patients, counseling on GI effects and when to seek care is sufficient; for patients with cardiac risk factors, the elderly, or those on interacting drugs, I should check baseline and follow-up ECGs and electrolytes, and avoid coadministration of multiple QT-prolonging agents; if symptoms of hepatitis, severe diarrhea, or hypersensitivity occur, prompt evaluation and drug cessation are indicated, with consideration of alternative therapy guided by culture data and local resistance patterns [^116hsDLc] [^111uf4R7] [^111NpBux].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that the recent azithromycin course was justified by a compatible indication, that dosing was appropriate, and that the patient received targeted counseling on red flags such as persistent diarrhea, jaundice, palpitations, or syncope; given azithromycin's long tissue half-life and potential for delayed adverse effects, a short period of heightened vigilance after therapy is reasonable, and future antibiotic use should be guided by stewardship principles to mitigate resistance and adverse event risks [^112VpUxg] [^111uf4R7] [^115dx9AK].

A recent round of azithromycin is most often used for **respiratory tract infections** (community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of COPD) [^1117B96f] and for **sexually transmitted infections** (chlamydia and gonorrhea) [^notfound]. It is also used for **MAC prophylaxis in HIV** [^notfound] and for **mass drug administration** to reduce child mortality in high-burden settings [^111eV3po]. Common adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea [^1123U76m]; serious risks include QT prolongation [^111uf4R7], hepatotoxicity [^112tow3S], and C. difficile infection [^11586Xmw]. Azithromycin should be used only for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infections to limit resistance [^114J71hk] [^115dx9AK].

---

## Recent clinical applications

### Respiratory tract infections

- **Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)**: Azithromycin is recommended for CAP, particularly for atypical pathogens, and is often combined with a beta-lactam in hospitalized patients [^1117B96f] [^114MDfbt].

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABRS)**: Azithromycin is an alternative therapy for ABRS, especially in penicillin-allergic patients [^notfound].

- **Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Azithromycin reduces exacerbation frequency in patients with frequent exacerbations, though long-term use is limited by resistance and QT prolongation risks [^115rzPgH].

---

### Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)

Azithromycin remains a **first-line agent** for chlamydia, typically as a 1 g single dose, and is used in combination regimens for gonorrhea, often with ceftriaxone [^notfound].

---

### HIV-related infections

For patients with advanced HIV, azithromycin is used for **Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis and treatment** [^113ytXac].

---

### Mass drug administration (MDA)

Recent trials have evaluated azithromycin MDA to reduce **child mortality** in high-burden settings, with variable results and concerns about resistance [^111eV3po].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

### Common adverse effects

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common [^116zuDaq].

- **Injection site reactions**: Local pain and inflammation are frequent with IV administration [^116zuDaq].

---

### Serious adverse effects

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: Azithromycin can prolong the QT interval, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions or those taking other QT-prolonging drugs [^111uf4R7] [^112QY3aL].

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Rare cases of hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported [^112tow3S].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Azithromycin use is associated with increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea [^11586Xmw].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported [^114ZT8mk].

---

## Resistance concerns

Azithromycin use contributes to **antimicrobial resistance**, particularly among Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pathogens. MDA programs have raised concerns about increased macrolide resistance in target populations [^111eV3po] [^113i3MJ9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Respiratory infections**: Azithromycin is recommended for CAP and ABRS, but local resistance patterns should guide use [^1117B96f] [^116EmD3D].

- **STIs**: Azithromycin remains first-line for chlamydia and part of combination therapy for gonorrhea [^notfound].

- **HIV-related infections**: Azithromycin is recommended for MAC prophylaxis and treatment in HIV patients [^notfound].

- **General use**: Azithromycin should be used only for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infections to minimize resistance [^114J71hk] [^115dx9AK].

---

## Recent clinical studies and trials

Recent studies have evaluated azithromycin for **COPD exacerbations**, showing reduced exacerbation frequency but with resistance and QT risks [^115rzPgH]. Trials of azithromycin MDA to reduce child mortality report variable outcomes and resistance concerns [^111eV3po]. Research on azithromycin's immunomodulatory effects in asthma and other inflammatory conditions is ongoing [^115b4hA2] [^113aAqR1].

---

Azithromycin remains a key antibiotic for respiratory infections, STIs, and HIV-related infections, with recent use expanding to MDA and immunomodulatory roles. Its safety profile is generally favorable, but clinicians must balance benefits with risks of QT prolongation, hepatotoxicity, and resistance.

### Azithromycin mass drug administration: balancing survival benefits and risks in children [^111eV3po]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Childhood mortality remains a major public health challenge in low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, despite major advances in universal sanitation and immunisations. Mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, has shown promise in reducing under-5 mortality in high-risk regions, although its mechanism of protection remains largely unknown. In this Personal View, we analyse current evidence, potential effect of MDA on antimicrobial resistance, and relevant ethical principles, and propose priorities for future public health interventions. Our review of key randomised controlled trials revealed highly variable outcomes of azithromycin MDA differing by participants' age, geographical location, comorbidities, coinfections, and concurrent therapies. Intermittent use of azithromycin has been linked to rising macrolide resistance in several pathogens, spillover effects in untreated populations, and ecological disruptions. Ethical concerns, including informed consent and allocation of limited resources, require careful consideration. We propose a multifaceted approach including investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure, vaccination programmes, and robust antimicrobial resistance surveillance. Policy makers and global health stakeholders must prioritise context-specific, evidence-based strategies that strengthen local capacity, improve community engagement, and implement robust monitoring systems to ensure that the potential benefits of MDA are sustained and do not imperil public health.

1.4 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Macrolide selection — clarithromycin versus azithromycin: There are insufficient data to recommend the use of clarithromycin over azithromycin. Some experts use clarithromycin as the preferred first agent, reserving azithromycin for patients with substantial intolerance to clarithromycin or when drug interactions with clarithromycin are a concern (strong, low).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115rzPgH]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotics — In older studies prophylactic, continuous use of antibiotics had no effect on the frequency of exacerbations in COPD and a study of chemoprophylaxis undertaken in winter months over a period of 5 years concluded that there was no benefit, although later studies have shown that regular use of some antibiotics may reduce exacerbation rate. Azithromycin (250 mg/day or 500 mg three times per week) or erythromycin (250 mg two times per day) for one year in patients prone to exacerbations reduced the risk of exacerbations compared to usual care, but azithromycin use was associated with an increased incidence of bacterial resistance, prolongation of QTc interval, and impaired hearing tests. A post-hoc analysis suggests lesser benefit in active smokers, and there are no data showing the efficacy or safety of chronic azithromycin treatment to prevent COPD exacerbations beyond one-year of treatment.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of azithromycin monohydrate IV (also known as Zithromax, Zmax, Azitrocin):

- Angioedema, anaphylaxis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis: maintain a high level of suspicion, as azithromycin has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as azithromycin has been associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- Cardiovascular mortality: maintain a high level of suspicion, as azithromycin has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, regardless of pre-existing CVDs.
- Exacerbation of myasthenia gravis: use extreme caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.
- Hepatotoxicity: maintain a high level of suspicion, as azithromycin has been associated with an increased risk of liver dysfunction, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure.
- Torsades de pointes: use caution in patients with QT prolongation, bradyarrhythmias, uncompensated HF, history of torsades de pointes, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or taking QT-prolonging drugs or class IA or III antiarrhythmic agents.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In multiple-dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin, 9% of patients were at least 65 years of age (458/4,949) and 3% of patients (144/4,949) were at least 75 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

Azithromycin 600 mg tablets contain 2.1 mg of sodium per tablet.

Geriatric Patients with Opportunistic Infections, Including (MAC) Disease: Safety data are available for 30 patients (65 to 94 years old) treated with azithromycin at doses > 300 mg/day for a mean of 207 days. These patients were treated for a variety of opportunistic infections, including MAC. The adverse reaction was generally similar to that seen in younger patients, except for a higher incidence of adverse reactions relating to the gastrointestinal system and to reversible impairment of hearing [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^113i3MJ9]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of macrolides in patients with moderate to severe CAP, to provide coverage of atypical pathogens and for their immunomodulatory effects. However, at a population level, we found no evidence that empirical macrolide combination therapy provided any benefit over β-lactam monotherapy, and atypical pathogens were rarely identified. Furthermore, in subgroup analyses by severity we found no evidence of, or even trend toward, greater potential benefits in the more severe subgroups. Conversely, previous evidence has shown that macrolide use is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and a higher risk of adverse outcomes. For example, previous macrolide use has been associated with macrolide resistance among S pneumoniae within individuals and in population-based studies; in children, mass dose azithromycin administration was associated with resistance in S pneumoniae, S aureus, and Escherichia coli. Several large cohort studies reported that azithromycin and clarithromycin were associated with higher risk of adverse cardiovascular events, on which basis the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently published warnings on the use of azithromycin. A meta-analysis on 183 RCTs reported an increased rate of gastrointestinal adverse events with macrolide use. Macrolide use can also affect microbiome composition in healthy adults. Given the known risks associated with macrolides, routine empirical use of macrolides should be carefully balanced. Nevertheless, developing better diagnostic tools to accurately identify causative pathogens would be beneficial, allowing clinicians to target antibiotic therapy more effectively and also minimize unnecessary macrolide use.

### Costs, coverage, and acceptability of azithromycin mass administration to children 1–11 versus 1–59 months old to reduce mortality: a cluster-randomized trial in Niger [^111b98t3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

The per-dose cost of azithromycin MDA presented here may be high compared with expectations. A recent study in the same setting found a similar cost per dose delivered of ∼$2 for administering azithromycin MDA to children aged 1–59 months with existing CHWs, whereas an older 2016 study reported a cost per dose delivered ranging from $0.63 to $0.94 for treating children aged 1–59 months in Malawi. Mass drug administration is widely used in neglected tropical disease programs and has been associated with significant economies of scale. A systematic review found that MDA programs cost less than $0.50 per dose delivered in 2015 when treating 100,000 people or more, but more than $2.00 per dose delivered when treating fewer than 100,000 people, with unit costs decreasing as the number of implementation years increases. Given that these are initial treatment rounds on a small scale, our cost estimates for treating children aged 1–59 months are aligned with the systematic review. We anticipate that the cost per child treated will decrease when all communities within eligible CSI catchment areas are included in more rounds of distribution. Indeed, costs decreased between MDA 1 and 2 in this study. In addition, these analyses applied the 2021 currency exchange rate to facilitate comparison with our previous work. This rate is relatively favorable for CFA, raising the USD cost by ∼10% compared with 2024 exchange rates or the decade average. Finally, the costs presented in the systematic review were mostly from programs relying on volunteers, which decreases costs compared with the program implemented here that paid CHWs. Future work will explore the cost-effectiveness of these two approaches, which will be an important complement to these results because the 1- to 59-month approach is expected to notably increase the number of deaths averted.

Agents not recommended for initial ABRS — Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin and clarithromycin) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are not recommended for initial therapy of ABRS; the high prevalence of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in the US (> 30%) and resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole among S. pneumoniae (50%–75%) and Haemophilus influenzae (27%) preclude their initial empirical use even with reported penicillin allergy. Respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are no longer recommended as first-line treatment for uncomplicated ABRS due to FDA "black box" warnings of increased risks of serious adverse events including tendinitis, tendon rupture, aortic rupture, and peripheral neuropathy.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Community-Acquired Pneumonia

In a controlled trial of community-acquired pneumonia performed in the U.S., azithromycin (500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy) was compared to cefuroxime (2,250 mg/day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy), with or without erythromycin. For the 291 patients who were evaluable for clinical efficacy, the clinical outcome rates, i.e., cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 277 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

In a separate, uncontrolled clinical and microbiological trial performed in the U.S., 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia who received azithromycin in the same regimen were evaluable for clinical efficacy. The clinical outcome rates, i.e., cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) among the 84 patients seen at 10 to 14 days post-therapy were as follows:

Microbiological determinations in both trials were made at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, were reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was done on baseline and final visit specimens. The following combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates were obtained from the evaluable groups:

Special considerations during pregnancy — diagnosis and macrolide/quinolone use — the diagnosis of bacterial respiratory tract infections in pregnant women is the same as in those who are not pregnant, with appropriate shielding of the abdomen during radiographic procedures, and these infections should be managed as in non-pregnant women with certain exceptions. Among macrolides, clarithromycin is not recommended because of an increased risk of birth defects seen in some animal studies; azithromycin is recommended when a macrolide is indicated in pregnancy (BIII). When indicated, quinolones can be used in pregnancy for serious respiratory infections only when a safer alternative is not available (CIII).

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^111oDJPh]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Minimizing the risk for QT prolongation is important for patient safety, particularly since TdP can be fatal. Although there is general agreement on general discontinuation rules (e.g. QT interval, corrected for cardiac frequency, > 500 ms, and increases > 60 ms), the need for baseline QT assessment and timing for electrocardiographic re-assessment may vary depending on the drug, as well as underlying expected susceptibility. General warnings and monitoring guidance are reported in the European summary of product characteristics and US prescribing information, commenting on risk of cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, as well as on the QT prolongation and risk of TdP. However, ECG monitoring is not part of the current standard practice when HCQ is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatological or dermatological conditions, and there is currently insufficient evidence on which to base specific monitoring recommendations.

The "American College of Rheumatology White Paper on Antimalarial Cardiac Toxicity" provided practice considerations on obtaining a baseline ECG in patients with additional risk factors for QT prolongation and avoidance (or deprescribing) additional drugs with known QT-prolonging potential. In this regard, the interactive website crediblemeds.org (and relevant apps) provided updated lists of drugs categorized by their potential to cause QT prolongation and/or TdP (with links to US label and PubMed articles), and additional features such as a list of clinical risk factors associated with QT/TdP risk, also in terms of quality of the evidence (e.g. bradycardia is a strong risk factor for TdP, with high quality of the evidence). For HCQ, ECG monitoring could be considered after 3–4 days of therapy initiation in patients with different patient-, drug- and disease-related risk factors (Figure 1): frail patients with severe renal/liver impairment, cancer, cardiovascular comorbidities (including COVID-19), uncorrected hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia (e.g. due to diuretics or gastrointestinal diseases/malabsorption), and exposure to multiple drugs that can interact via pharmacokinetic (e.g. strong CYP and P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil, azithromycin) and/or pharmacodynamic (potent hERG blockers such as haloperidol) mechanisms. A synopsis of key drugs with QT-prolonging potential and TdP liability is provided in Table 3. Patients should be also educated and involved in shared decision-making about the potential for HCQ cardiac effects as well as the effect of other medications that prolong the QT interval.

5.1 Hypersensitivity

Serious allergic reactions, including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [see Contraindications (4.1)].

Fatalities have been reported. Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms, when symptomatic therapy was discontinued, the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure. These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment. The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half-life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present.

If an allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Physicians should be aware that the allergic symptoms may reappear after symptomatic therapy has been discontinued.

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Abnormal liver function, hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported, some of which have resulted in death. Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur.

5.3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS)

Following the use of azithromycin in neonates (treatment up to 42 days of life), IHPS has been reported. Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs.

5.4 QT Prolongation

Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval, imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes, have been seen with treatment with macrolides, including azithromycin. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin. Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation, which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at-risk groups including:

patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, a history of torsades de pointes, congenital long QT syndrome, bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure
patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval
patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents.

Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^114kdfou]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

Non-severe CAP inpatient treatment — Individuals with HIV who are being treated as inpatients should receive an intravenous (IV) beta-lactam plus a macrolide (AI) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI); monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting. In one study, beta-lactam monotherapy was not found to be non-inferior to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, and in the monotherapy arm patients with more severe CAP, as indicated by a PSI ≥ IV, or with atypical pathogens were less likely to reach clinical stability, with more 30-day readmissions among the patients on monotherapy. Given the heterogeneity and limitations of recent studies and scarce data in patients with HIV, the recommendation for patients with HIV who are hospitalized with non-severe CAP remains the same as in people without HIV: to administer either beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam, and preferred macrolides are azithromycin and clarithromycin.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia, in which 2 to 5 IV doses were given, the reported adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. The majority of patients in these trials had one or more co-morbid diseases and were receiving concomitant medications. Approximately 1.2% of the patients discontinued intravenous azithromycin therapy, and a total of 2.4% discontinued azithromycin therapy by either the intravenous or oral route because of clinical or laboratory side effects.

In clinical trials conducted in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease, in which 1 to 2 IV doses were given, 2% of women who received monotherapy with azithromycin and 4% who received azithromycin plus metronidazole discontinued therapy due to clinical side effects.

Clinical adverse reactions leading to discontinuations from these studies were gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), and rashes; laboratory side effects leading to discontinuation were increases in transaminase levels and/or alkaline phosphatase levels.

Overall, the most common adverse reactions associated with treatment in adult patients who received IV/Oral azithromycin in studies of community-acquired pneumonia were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea/loose stools (4.3%), nausea (3.9%), abdominal pain (2.7%), and vomiting (1.4%) being the most frequently reported. Approximately 12% of patients experienced a side effect related to the intravenous infusion; most common were pain at the injection site (6.5%) and local inflammation (3.1%).

5.3 Long‐Term Safety Considerations

The safety profile of long‐term azithromycin use presents several important considerations. Recent research has indicated that even short courses of macrolides can significantly affect both gut and airway microbiota. Encouragingly, in our study, only approximately 10% of children receiving azithromycin experienced mild gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly loose stools, similar to the GI symptoms observed in the placebo group. These effects were generally transient and manageable, with no instances of severe antibiotic‐associated colitis reported. In terms of other systemic effects, no cases of ototoxicity or cardiac complications were observed in the study. The absence of such complications may be attributed to the study protocol, which excluded children with pre‐existing sensorineural hearing issues and included thorough cardiac screening to reduce potential risks.

5.4 Clinical Implications

The results of this study suggest that winter‐long azithromycin prophylaxis should not be routinely implemented for all children with BPD. However, the significant reduction in emergency room visits and potential benefits seen in certain subgroups indicate that targeted use might be appropriate for specific patient populations.

The AMAZES trial demonstrated that the addition of azithromycin (500 mg three times weekly for 48 weeks) to standard treatment in adults with persistent uncontrolled asthma significantly reduced exacerbations and improved quality of life compared to placebo, with benefits observed in both eosinophilic and non‐eosinophilic asthma phenotypes. Wong et al. reviewed the immunomodulatory mechanisms of macrolides in asthma, highlighting their effects on neutrophilic inflammation, viral infections, and airway remodeling, while emphasizing the need for better phenotyping to identify which asthma patients are most likely to benefit from macrolide therapy and to balance potential benefits against concerns about antimicrobial resistance.

Several strategies could optimize this approach, including limiting prophylaxis to peak viral seasons rather than year‐round use, carefully selecting lower‐risk patients based on risk factors and previous exacerbation patterns, focusing on children with wheezing who have an increased risk for asthma in the future, and conducting regular monitoring for adverse effects and resistance development.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens (S. pneumoniae and S. aureus).

The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of azithromycin in plasma after dosing as per labeled recommendations in healthy young adults and asymptomatic HIV-positive adults (age 18 to 40 years old) are portrayed in the following chart:

With a regimen of 500 mg on Day 1 and 250 mg/day on Days 2 to 5, Cminand Cmaxremained essentially unchanged from Day 2 through Day 5 of therapy. However, without a loading dose, azithromycin Cminlevels required 5 to 7 days to reach steady state.

In asymptomatic HIV-positive adult subjects receiving 600 mg azithromycin tablets once daily for 22 days, steady state azithromycin serum levels were achieved by Day 15 of dosing.

The high values in adults for apparent steady-state volume of distribution (31.1 L/kg) and plasma clearance (630 mL/min) suggest that the prolonged half-life is due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues.

### Cost-effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to prevent maternal infection, sepsis, or death in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis of data from a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial [^112pGXEE]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Although the results of the A-PLUS trial and this cost-effectiveness analysis were promising, real-world implementation of intrapartum azithromycin requires several additional considerations. Azithromycin carries a risk of QT interval prolongation and fatal arrhythmias per US Federal Drug Administration data. Given this risk, the A-PLUS trial excluded women with arrhythmias or known cardiomyopathy. Recommendations for large-scale implementation of azithromycin should include clinical algorithms that limit its use among women at high risk of side-effects (eg, those with underlying cardiac disease including proarrhythmic conditions or known prolongation of the QT interval, or those taking concurrent medications that prolong the QT interval). The potential effect of recommending large-scale administration of antibiotic prophylaxis with intrapartum azithromycin on both maternal and neonatal AMR and the microbiome should be noted. There are few published data on long-term adverse outcomes and AMR following such administration. Following intrapartum azithromycin administration in The Gambia and Burkina Faso, Escherichia coli carriage in infants decreased but Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage and azithromycin resistance in both bacteria increased. The NICHD Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Research is evaluating AMR and the microbiome as a sub-study of the A-PLUS trial, with both maternal and neonatal surveillance conducted up to 12 months postpartum. The results of this study will be particularly important to understand unintended effects of the intervention and their implications for real-world programmes. Future cost-effectiveness analyses of intrapartum azithromycin should be expanded to include the economic effect of AMR and microbiome effects.

In conclusion, we found intrapartum azithromycin results in net savings of $0·33 per person giving birth in LMICs; this result translates to spending $0·91 to get back $1·24 per woman planning a vaginal birth. Although local conditions, such as the cost of azithromycin or the cost of a facility admission might differ, the intervention was cost saving or cost-effective in most countries analysed. This evidence supports global consideration of intrapartum azithromycin as an economically efficient preventive therapy to reduce infection, sepsis, or death among women planning a vaginal birth in LMICs. There is a crucial need for further studies to delineate the implications of large-scale implementation of azithromycin prophylaxis on AMR and clinical risks; the results of such studies should be incorporated into future cost-effectiveness analyses. Future trials should also consider the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to non-antibiotic interventions (eg, infection prevention and control, improving quality of intrapartum care, and health promotion strategies) aimed at reducing maternal sepsis.

### Effects of azithromycin in severe eosinophilic asthma with concomitant monoclonal antibody treatment [^116Cgem7]. Thorax (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our cohort of patients with severe asthma and residual exacerbations despite biologics, additional azithromycin treatment resulted in a significant reduction in both steroid and antibiotic-requiring events, as well as significant improvements in ACQ-5 but not lung function. These results are consistent with other studies of macrolides in less severe asthmaand suggest these findings can be generalised to include a biologic-treated severe asthma population.

Patients in our cohort who started azithromycin were older and had more exacerbations prior to biologics and did not show significant reduction in antibiotic-treated events following biologics unlike the rest of our severe asthma population. The demographic characteristics that differed most from the comparator cohort were daily sputum production (chronic bronchitis) and/or frequent purulent exacerbations, symptoms that are suggestive of persistent airways infection. We were interested in whether low baseline FeNO and/or positive sputum cultures were associated with a greater azithromycin effect, as FeNO has been shown to be inversely proportional to rates of Proteobacteria in the airway, including Haemophilus influenzae. There was a trend for a greater azithromycin effect in this group, but airway microbiology was not assessed systematically in our cohort, and we acknowledge that this may have compromised our ability to show an effect. Our audit has other important limitations, including being from a single centre, small sample size, non-randomised nature of azithromycin treatment and retrospective assessment of outcomes, limitations that are inherent to the study design. Larger randomised prospective trials incorporating more systematic assessment of both airway microbiology and type 2 biomarkers, preferably at baseline and at exacerbation, are needed to assess the response to azithromycin and associated factors in this population. Nonetheless, our findings provide a strong basis for these studies.

In summary, our findings suggest that azithromycin should be considered in patients with severe asthma treated with biologics with residual exacerbations and symptoms of chronic bronchitis and/or purulent exacerbations. Further research is required to confirm this and validate predictors of response to treatment.

### Impact of macrolide resistance on azithromycin for prevention of rehospitalization or death among children discharged from hospitals in Western Kenya [^11378pbC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

We saw no impact of azithromycin on linear growth overall, nor when stratifying by macrolide resistance genes in this study. Azithromycin has been demonstrated to offer growth-promoting benefits when targeted to children with diarrhea attributed to specific enteric bacteria, but similar findings have not been found in MDA trials. This antibiotic has shown efficacy in reducing the incidence of infectious diseases, which can indirectly support better growth and development in children. However, the potential use of this broad-spectrum antibiotic for multicausal and long-term processes like linear growth raises concerns about antibiotic resistance.

Our study is the first to systematically evaluate the potentially modifiable effect of macrolide resistance gene carriage on the efficacy of azithromycin for posthospital rehospitalization and mortality. If confirmed, this finding could explain sources of variability in treatment effects in empiric azithromycin trials targeting children at high risk of mortality. In the long term, identifying a biomarker predictive of treatment efficacy could result in fewer children being exposed to empiric azithromycin if a point-of-care diagnostic could be developed, such as rifampicin resistance detection in GeneXpert tests for tuberculosis. A limitation of our study is that although we identified certain macrolide resistance-conferring genes that altered the effect of azithromycin, the study was underpowered to detect variations in azithromycin's effect across subgroups.

Despite an overall reduction in child mortality, children recently discharged from hospital remain at an elevated risk of mortality and contribute to almost half of the total mortality rate in low- and middle-income countries. Azithromycin appeared to have a benefit in a subset of children identified by a specific macrolide resistance gene, a finding that needs to be confirmed in other populations.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1117B96f]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and adolescents with HIV — empiric regimens and dosing: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia, and the regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII); providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g. PCP, TB), which may alter empiric therapy. Empiric outpatient therapy includes a PO beta-lactam plus a PO macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AII), with preferred beta-lactams high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate; alternatives are cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII) or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. For hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI) is listed, with preferred beta-lactams ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; options for penicillin-allergic patients are levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AI) or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (AI). Alternative therapy options include a PO beta-lactam plus PO doxycycline (CIII), an IV beta-lactam plus doxycycline (CIII), and for penicillin-allergic patients with severe CAP, aztreonam IV plus levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (BIII).

Itraconazole and ketoconazole — when azole concentrations are increased by antibacterials (clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin) or protease inhibitors (PIs), clinicians are instructed to "Monitor for toxicities and monitor concentrations. Consider azithromycin instead of other macrolides. High doses of itraconazole are not recommended with PIs". For increased concomitant drug concentrations affecting antiretrovirals (ARVs) including etravirine, maraviroc, and PIs, the recommendation is "Caution advised. Monitor for toxicities. Decrease adult maraviroc dose to 150 mg twice daily". With statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin), guidance is "Do not coadminister with simvastatin or lovastatin. Avoid use of atorvastatin if possible. Alternative statins such as fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin are preferred; alternatively, discontinue statin during antifungal therapy". For antibacterials (clarithromycin, erythromycin), "Consider switching to azithromycin, which has less potential for drug interaction". For sedatives/hypnotics (alprazolam, diazepam, midazolam), "Coadministration of midazolam and alprazolam should be avoided. Coadministration of diazepam should be avoided, if possible". For the antimalarial quinidine, "Coadministration of quinidine should be avoided. QT prolongation may occur".

Cardiac Toxicity

Drug-induced QT prolongation is a recognized surrogate marker of cardiotoxicity, potentially leading to the so-called torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially life-threatening peculiar form of tachyarrhythmia, which may ultimately result in ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Drug-induced TdP is still a research and clinical priority, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Although it is currently believed that myocardial damage might represent a main driver of enhanced arrhythmic risk in COVID-19 patients, different proarrhythmic factors (including concomitant pharmacological treatments) may synergize with pre-existing arrhythmogenic substrates and high-grade systemic inflammatory state to reduce the repolarization reserve in the myocardium, with ultimate TdP onset. Different agents were used "off-label" to counteract virus invasion/replication; this was especially the case of (controversial) prophylactic use of HCQ in combination with azithromycin.

There are plenty of data on the pro-arrhythmic potential of HCQ, which is a well-known agent blocking the human ether-a-go-go–related gene (hERG) potassium channel, the most important and widely accepted mechanism of drug-induced QT prolongation. In the vast majority of cases, clinically significant QT prolongation was rarely observed during on-label uses of the drug, and in patients with documented risk factors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of pharmacovigilance studies using individual case safety reports from large databases found a considerable number (and increase) of cardiovascular events, including TdP and cardiomyopathy.

With regard to dermatological uses, a recent systematic review examined ten articles (389 patients with cicatricial alopecia; eight retrospective chart reviews) and found that only one patient with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities and exposed to diuretics developed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia 17 months after starting HCQ 400 mg daily. Notably, a recent retrospective chart review on 55 patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis found a prolonged QT interval only in 5.4% of patients (vs 12.1% in 116 controls), with a non-significant increase in mean QT length (+ 6 ms) in a sub-analysis of 22 patients. Another retrospective chart review of 131 patients with cicatricial alopecia who were prescribed HCQ in a specialty alopecia clinic found no significant QT prolongation during regular electrocardiograms (ECGs) despite 22% of patients being exposed to drugs with known TdP potential, especially antidepressants.

§ Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis (Type A) is limited to North America and susceptible to macrolides. F. tularensis subspecies holarctica (Type B) biovar I strains (in North America and Western Europe) and biovar japonica strains (primarily found in Japan) are also susceptible to macrolides. F. tularensis subspecies holarctica biovar II strains found in Eastern Europe and Asia are inherently resistant to macrolides. Thus, azithromycin can be used if PEP is indicated after natural occupational exposures in the United States (e.g. contact with an infected animal). In the wake of an intentional release, azithromycin can be used for PEP initially if needed. If additional information identifies a resistant strain, patients should be switched to another antimicrobial.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^1112xubX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES. Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with use of the drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine pamoate. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.

QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes (TdP)

Cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported during post-marketing use of hydroxyzine. The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation/TdP (pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use). Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, chlorpromazine), certain antidepressants (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine), certain antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin); and others (e.g., pentamidine, methadone, ondansetron, droperidol).

### Prevalence of the QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in hospitalized geriatric patients: findings of a single center cross-sectional study in Pakistan [^113cY5TV]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

There are not many studies that concentrate on figuring out how prevalent potential QT DDIs are in clinical settings. We found that 23.2% of the study population had potential QT DDIs. Among these, the most common drug interacting pair comprised of Metoclopramide - Ondansetron and Azithromycin - Metoclopramide. While research indicates that using the highest risk QTc lengthening medication concurrently with any other QTc prolonging medication must be circumvented due to the significant increase in the danger for fatal toxicities, such as the onset of TdP or other severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias of considerable severity. Apart from this, many previous studies considered only certain drug classes in their analysis, whereas, we used a broader strategy that took into account all medication classes that were prescribed to hospitalized geriatric patients. Our study found that diuretics, antimicrobials, antiemetics, proton pump inhibitors, and analgesics were the most commonly involved drug classes in QT prolongation. In our investigation, we found 228 cases of diuretics, indicating a significant prevalence. However, diuretics were commonly used by hospitalized patients, and our results align with the results of the earlier research done on older individuals. Among diuretics, furosemide was the most commonly used, constituting 20.5% of the prescriptions. The second most commonly prescribed group was antimicrobials, with 202 instances. Metoclopramide emerged as the most frequently used antiemetic, representing 13.7% of the prescriptions. Another study also reported a similar proportion where its use was documented in 11.1% of cases. The possible negative effects of QT-prolonging medications were disregarded, despite their widespread use.

### Impact of macrolide resistance on azithromycin for prevention of rehospitalization or death among children discharged from hospitals in Western Kenya [^114wuzLe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The Toto Bora trial tested whether a 5-day course of azithromycin reduced the risk of rehospitalization or death in the 6 months following hospitalization among Kenyan children and found no overall benefit. We hypothesized that macrolide resistance in gut microbes could modify azithromycin's effect.

Methods

From June 2016 to November 2019, Kenyan children aged 1–59 months were enrolled at hospital discharge and randomized to azithromycin or placebo. DNA from fecal samples and Escherichia coli isolates was analyzed for common macrolide resistance genes. Cox proportional hazards regression models, including interaction terms between randomization arm and individual macrolide resistance genes, were used to analyze time to rehospitalization or death, with Bonferroni correction applied to account for multiple comparisons.

Results

Among 1393 children tested, 94.7% had at least 1 macrolide resistance gene in their fecal DNA at hospital discharge, most commonly mph(A) (68.6% [955/1393]), followed by msr(D) (67.3% [937/1393]) and erm(B) (60.7% [846/1393]). Mef(A) (23.7% [330/1393]) was the only macrolide resistance gene that modified azithromycin's effect on rehospitalization or death (interaction P = .008). In children without the mef(A) gene, azithromycin reduced the hazard of rehospitalization or death by a third (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% confidence interval {CI},.45–.99]) whereas among children with the mef(A) gene, there was a higher risk in those randomized to azithromycin (HR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.21–6.09]). The effect size of azithromycin's impact on mortality and rehospitalization as separate outcomes in children with and without mef(A) were consistent but underpowered.

Conclusions

Macrolide resistance in the gut microbiome may influence the efficacy of azithromycin in children discharged from the hospital.

### Azithromycin prevents subglottic stenosis in mice [^113aAqR1]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Pediatric subglottic stenosis (SGS) is characterized by subglottic narrowing which occurs when pathological fibroblasts deposit extracellular matrix that reduces airway patency. Recent clinical observations have suggested that azithromycin may have favorable impacts on SGS reduction while treating airway infections; furthermore, our recent work in mice demonstrated that the airway microbiome influences SGS. In this work, we characterize the protective effect of azithromycin as an immunomodulatory and antibacterial therapeutic against subglottic stenosis.

Methods

Immunomodulatory and antifibrotic effects of azithromycin were assessed on TGF-β1-stimulated airway fibroblasts at 10μg/mL for 5days. Changes in gene expression were quantified by RT-qPCR and myofibroblast differentiation by α-SMA immunostaining. Murine airways were pretreated (2-weeks) with intranasal azithromycin before SGS injury by a twisted wire brush. Disease severity and immune response were characterized by histology and immunostaining for immune cells.

Results

In vitro, azithromycin treatment of TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblasts exhibited strong reductions in extracellular matrix (COL1A1, LOX) and myofibroblast-related gene expression (ACTA2). Notably, there was a significant reduction in pro-fibrotic expression, which was observed with 10μg/mL azithromycin. Immunostaining of fibroblasts for α-SMA revealed strong reductions in the number of positive-staining cells and the intensity of each positive cell. In vivo, azithromycin exhibited a significant decrease in lamina propria thickness indicative of reduced stenosis with associated changes in T-cell infiltration.

Conclusions

Overall, we show azithromycin prevents pro-fibrotic gene expression and myofibroblast differentiation and can help protect mice from developing SGS. This introduces azithromycin as a potential treatment for SGS.

### Impact of macrolide resistance on azithromycin for prevention of rehospitalization or death among children discharged from hospitals in Western Kenya [^113vGfnD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we explored potential gut-mediated mechanisms explaining a lack of individual-level treatment effect of azithromycin for preventing mortality and rehospitalization among Kenyan children discharged from inpatient care. We found evidence that 5-day treatment with azithromycin was associated with a 35% decrease in the risk of rehospitalization or death among children without the mef(A) macrolide resistance–conferring gene. Conversely, among children with the mef(A) macrolide gene, azithromycin was associated with an approximately 3-fold increase in the risk of rehospitalization or death. These findings were consistent when each outcome (mortality or death) was examined separately, albeit with low statistical power. However, we did not observe effect modification by other macrolide resistance–conferring genes, such as mph(A), despite being commonly detected.

The mef(A) gene encodes the transmembrane channel component of an ATP-binding cassette transporter that confers macrolide resistance. It has primarily been studied in gram-positive bacteria, in particular streptococci, which are a prominent constituent of the gut microbiota in young children with diarrhea in low-income countries. Gram-negative bacteria such as Shigella may also carry mef(A), and Shigella has been implicated in azithromycin effect mechanisms. However, the lack of effect modification by mef(A) in E coli, also a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, suggests that this may not be the case. The expansion of macrolide-resistant pathogens within the microbiota may explain the adverse impact of azithromycin on mef(A) -positive individuals. Further, if treatment of gram-positive pathogens is a key mechanism of azithromycin efficacy during the postdischarge period, it follows that we observed a treatment benefit among children without evidence of mef(A) resistance.

The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has raised concerns about a potential link between trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and an increased risk of acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARF/ARDS) in healthy adolescents and young adults.

Objective

To assess the association between TMP-SMX and the risk of ARF/ARDS using data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

Methods

We analyzed adverse drug events (ADEs) reported in FAERS from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2023. We focused on reports where TMP-SMX, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or azithromycin were the primary suspect drugs for ADEs in individuals aged 10 to 24 years. The outcomes of interest-ARF/ARDS-were identified using MedDRA-preferred terms. We used an active comparator-restricted disproportionality analysis (ACR-DA) to estimate the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for age, sex, acne, and urinary tract infections. Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Networks (BCPNN) were used to calculate the Information Components (IC 025). Due to the amount of missing information, a case-by-case analysis could not be performed.

Results

3171 ICSRs (810 for TMP-SMX, 1617 for azithromycin, and 744 for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) were included in the study. ACR-DA showed an unadjusted 8-fold increase in the reports of ARF/ARDS with TMP-SMX compared with azithromycin (unadjusted ROR, 7.98; 95% CI, 4.09 to 15.60) and an adjusted 3-fold increase after adjustment for age, sex, acne, and urinary tract infection (adjusted ROR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.28 to 6.11). BCPNN analysis confirmed significant disproportionality (IC 025, 0.75). No cases of ARF/ARDS were reported for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

Conclusion and Relevance

TMP-SMX may increase the risk of ARF/ARDS, requiring further validation in larger pharmacoepidemiological studies. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research to further investigate the safety profile of TMP-SMX in adolescent populations. If confirmed, prescribers should exercise greater caution when prescribing TMP-SMX to adolescents and young adults.

BPaL clinical monitoring — According to the Joint Panel opinion, patients should be monitored during treatment for response to treatment and for adverse events, with clinical, radiologic, and laboratory assessments, including baseline, monthly, and as needed; monitoring frequency should be increased for those of older age, people living with HIV, diabetes, baseline anemia, visual impairment, renal or liver disease, or if significant clinical, ECG, or laboratory abnormalities are found. Post-treatment monitoring for at least 1–2 years is recommended to identify recurrence. Baseline and follow-up ECGs with QTc measurement are necessary during bedaquiline treatment. For BPaL without additional QT-prolonging agents, ECG should be conducted at 2, 12, and 24 weeks after initiation, and with a concomitant QT-prolonging agent, including moxifloxacin, monthly ECGs are recommended.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1144iLMr]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Adverse effects and monitoring for second-line tuberculosis drugs — Other TB drugs have known side effects which should be monitored. Hypothyroidism has been associated with ethionamide and 4 (para)-aminosalicylic acid. Major adverse effects of aminoglycoside drugs are ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Ototoxicity can progress after termination of prolonged aminoglycoside use, and monitoring may be needed for 6 months after treatment completion. QT interval prolongation is an adverse effect of many new and newly repurposed medications used for MDR-TB treatment, including bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine, and the fluoroquinolones, especially moxifloxacin. Although the risk of severe QT interval prolongation (≥ 500 ms) appears to be low, regular electrocardiogram monitoring should be considered, especially when multiple QT-prolonging medications are combined in regimens. Linezolid is associated with frequent dose and duration dependent adverse effects that can be severe, including cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) and peripheral neuropathy; careful monitoring, especially for cytopenias in children, should be considered.

### QT-prolonging medications: prevalence of use and associated risks in CKD [^114wiE8C]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 10% of the global adult population and is associated with substantial cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Sudden cardiac death (often precipitated by ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes) is a leading cause of death in patients with CKD. Prolongation of the QT interval (a marker of delayed ventricular repolarization) is a significant risk factor for arrhythmia in patients with CKD, whether they are on dialysis or not. QT prolongation in CKD is multifactorial and may result from electrolyte imbalances, myocardial remodelling, autonomic dysfunction, and exposure to QT-prolonging drugs. Patients on haemodialysis are particularly vulnerable to QT prolongation, due to rapid intradialytic electrolyte and fluid shifts. Many drugs known to prolong the QT interval (including various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antibiotics, antiemetics, and antipsychotics) are frequently prescribed to patients with CKD, even though there are few data on their safety in this population. The results of several well-designed pharmaco-epidemiological analyses (all based on data from the United States Renal Data System) have shown associations between QT-prolonging drugs and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death among patients on dialysis. These findings are concerning, given the widespread use of such drug. The objective of this narrative review is to critically evaluate the pathophysiological relevance, prevalence, and cardiovascular consequences of QT-prolonging drug use in the CKD setting.

Amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) for pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome — safety, subgroup selection, implementation, and monitoring: The panel assessed undesirable effects as moderate, citing a moderate-to-high rate of adverse effects (50%) with 19% discontinuation in children, a smaller retrospective study (n = 14) observing drowsiness and weight gain in 28%, and 26% of adults terminating therapy due to adverse effects; risks include QTc prolongation (avoid with pertinent family history of QT prolongation or sudden cardiac death) and a black box warning regarding suicidal ideation, with cognitive dysfunction reported with amitriptyline and other anticholinergic agents. The panel suggests that amitriptyline be reserved for children with more frequent and more severe (ED visits and hospitalizations) disease after trials of lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacological interventions, abortive medications, and other prophylactic agents with more favorable side effect profiles, and notes it may be more effective with a family or personal history of migraine without precluding a trial in nonmigraine‑associated CVS. Implementation considerations include that an ECG with calculated QTc should be considered before starting and with any dose titration/addition of other QTc-prolonging agents and confirmed < 460 ms, caution for risk of serotonin syndrome in children treated with multi psychotropic agents, and follow-up of therapeutic and adverse effects should take place at least every 6 months; the page references standard doses (e.g., 1.0–1.5 mg/kg/day).

14.3 Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma

Clinical Trial in Relapsed sALCL (Study 2, NCT00866047)

The efficacy of ADCETRIS in patients with relapsed sALCL was evaluated in one open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial. This trial included patients who had sALCL that was relapsed after prior therapy. Fifty-eight (58) patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. An IRF performed efficacy evaluations which included overall response rate (ORR = complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) and duration of response as defined by clinical and radiographic measures including computed tomography (CT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) as defined in the 2007 Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (modified).

The 58 patients ranged in age from 14–76 years (median, 52 years) and most were male (57%) and white (83%). Patients had received a median of 2 prior therapies; 26% of patients had received prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Fifty percent (50%) of patients were relapsed, and 50% of patients were refractory to their most recent prior therapy. Seventy-two percent (72%) were anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-negative.

The efficacy results are summarized in Table 18. Duration of response is calculated from date of first response to date of progression or data cutoff date.
