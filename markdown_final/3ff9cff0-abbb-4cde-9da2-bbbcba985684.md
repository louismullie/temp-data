## Question

Overweight causing sleeping issues

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how being overweight causes sleeping issues and what mechanisms and clinical implications are involved in that relationship. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bidirectional nature of the sleep–obesity link and confirm directionality. Then, I should verify the principal causal pathway from obesity to sleep disturbance, especially obstructive sleep apnea and sleep fragmentation. Next, I will examine mechanistic contributors such as upper airway anatomy, inflammatory cytokines, and circadian disruption. After that, I should review consequences of poor sleep in people with obesity, including appetite dysregulation and weight-loss resistance. Finally, I will translate this into clinical implications and screening or treatment recommendations, making sure I double-check guideline-level sources for consensus statements and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the bidirectional relationship so I don't overstate causality in one direction. Epidemiologic and experimental data consistently link insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality with increased obesity risk, while obesity, in turn, increases the likelihood of sleep-disordered breathing and fragmented sleep, establishing a vicious cycle rather than a one-way street [^111XF7vU] [^114UmuNm] [^114cN51Z].

> Now, I will examine the primary causal pathway from overweight/obesity to sleep problems, and I need to ensure I anchor this in high-quality guidance. The dominant mechanism is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), driven by excess upper-body and visceral adiposity that narrows the pharyngeal airway, reduces upper-airway muscle tone during sleep, and promotes intermittent hypoxia and arousals; professional societies explicitly recommend screening for OSA in people with obesity and related risk features, reflecting the strength of this association [^117Gq9dh] [^112i25Cg].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of OSA risk in obesity so I don't under- or overestimate it. Approximately 60–70% of individuals with OSA are overweight or obese, and about 58% of moderate-to-severe OSA cases are attributable to excess weight, underscoring obesity as the single most important modifiable risk factor for OSA pathogenesis and severity [^113NBkuv].

> Next, I should review how obesity disrupts sleep architecture beyond frank apneas. Increased adipose tissue, particularly visceral fat, secretes proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 that can destabilize sleep–wake regulation and increase sleep fragmentation; mechanistic reviews also describe how obesity-related inflammatory signaling can alter circadian rhythmicity, further degrading sleep quality and metabolic coupling to sleep–wake cycles [^112PqYbV] [^115QjfJ1].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of circadian misalignment because modern lifestyles amplify this. Later meal timing, irregular sleep schedules, and nocturnal eating in obesity can misalign feeding with the internal circadian clock, impairing glucose tolerance and melatonin–insulin interactions, which may worsen sleep maintenance and metabolic consequences even when total sleep duration appears adequate [^112PqYbV] [^113UU3zv].

> I will now examine the consequences of these sleep disturbances in people with obesity, and I need to check whether these effects are mechanistically plausible and clinically observed. Sleep fragmentation and OSA-related hypoxia increase sympathetic activity, alter appetite hormones (higher ghrelin, lower leptin), and promote hyperphagia and cravings, while also reducing insulin sensitivity; these changes create a positive energy balance and can blunt the effectiveness of caloric restriction, thereby reinforcing obesity and creating a vicious cycle [^112PqYbV] [^1126LXtU] [^113qJb5D].

> But wait, what if poor sleep also undermines weight-loss efforts directly? Does that change clinical priorities? Multiple longitudinal and intervention studies show that baseline sleep fragmentation and poor sleep quality predict attenuated weight and fat loss during behavioral programs, and randomized data demonstrate that extending sleep in short-sleeping adults with overweight reduces energy intake by roughly 270 kcal/day without a compensatory change in expenditure, producing modest weight loss; taken together, sleep health appears to modulate both adherence and energy balance during weight-loss interventions [^112EzpeB] [^113MPud8] [^112KJn6J].

> Next, I should review clinical implications and make sure I align with consensus recommendations. For patients with obesity, clinicians should routinely screen for OSA symptoms and risk features, counsel on sleep hygiene and duration optimization, and refer for polysomnography when indicated. Importantly, weight loss — via comprehensive lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, or bariatric surgery — reduces OSA severity and can even lead to disease resolution in some cases, whereas CPAP alone does not reliably improve weight outcomes, reinforcing the need to treat both sleep and weight concurrently [^117Gq9dh] [^116gbdhg] [^111Vkt3c] [^115jUw44].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought exercise alone might substantially reduce OSA severity, but I should double-check that assumption. The American Thoracic Society guideline indicates that exercise without weight loss does not consistently reduce OSA severity, although it may improve sleep quality and other health domains; therefore, exercise remains valuable for global health, but meaningful reductions in AHI generally require concurrent weight loss or primary OSA therapies like CPAP when indicated [^112vW6FJ].

> Let me reconsider whether specific sleep dimensions beyond duration matter clinically, because this can refine counseling. Evidence across pediatric and adult populations supports that not only short sleep duration but also irregular timing, low efficiency, and poor satisfaction are associated with higher adiposity and worse weight-loss outcomes, suggesting that multidimensional sleep health — regularity, timing, efficiency, satisfaction, alertness, and duration — should be addressed in obesity care plans [^113MPud8] [^117L9bQg] [^114ssQEs].

> I should confirm practical screening thresholds and triggers for referral so this is actionable. Clinicians should screen for OSA in patients with obesity, especially with symptoms such as loud snoring, witnessed apneas, daytime sleepiness, or elevated neck circumference, and consider polysomnography when risk is high; in parallel, counsel on extending sleep toward 7–9 hours, stabilizing bed/wake times, avoiding late meals and caffeine near bedtime, and optimizing the bedroom environment to support sleep consolidation and circadian alignment [^117Gq9dh] [^112i25Cg] [^112PqYbV].

> In summary, I need to ensure the causal chain is explicit and evidence-based: excess adiposity increases the risk and severity of OSA and sleep fragmentation through mechanical and inflammatory pathways. Fragmented, insufficient, or mistimed sleep dysregulates appetite and metabolism, reduces energy expenditure, and undermines weight-loss adherence. This bidirectional loop strengthens over time, so effective obesity management should integrate concurrent screening and treatment of sleep disorders, structured weight-loss strategies, and multidimensional sleep-health optimization to break the cycle and improve outcomes [^112PqYbV] [^112KJn6J] [^117Gq9dh].

Excess weight causes sleep problems primarily through **obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)** [^113NBkuv], which is driven by upper airway collapse from fat deposition around the neck and pharynx, leading to repeated apneas, hypopneas, and oxygen desaturation that fragment sleep and cause daytime sleepiness [^112MXePb]. Obesity also increases **insulin resistance and inflammation** [^115QjfJ1], which disrupt sleep architecture and circadian rhythms, and raises the risk of insomnia and restless legs syndrome. Mechanical factors such as abdominal fat and reduced lung volumes further impair breathing during sleep, while hormonal changes (lower leptin, higher ghrelin) increase appetite and disturb sleep regulation [^112PqYbV]. These sleep disturbances worsen metabolic health, creating a vicious cycle of weight gain and sleep disruption [^114UmuNm].

---

## Mechanisms linking excess weight to sleep problems

### Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

- **Upper airway obstruction**: Fat deposition around the upper airway narrows the airway, increasing collapsibility during sleep and causing repeated apneas and hypopneas [^115TxjhP].

- **Oxygen desaturation**: Intermittent hypoxia from apneas triggers sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, and inflammation, worsening sleep fragmentation and cardiovascular risk [^112MXePb].

- **Daytime sleepiness**: Repeated arousals degrade sleep quality, causing excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive impairment, and reduced quality of life [^116qUKv5].

---

### Insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances

- **Insulin resistance**: Excess weight increases insulin resistance, altering glucose metabolism and promoting sleep fragmentation and poor sleep quality [^112MXePb].

- **Inflammation**: Elevated cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) disrupt sleep architecture and circadian rhythms, increasing insomnia risk [^115QjfJ1].

- **Hormonal dysregulation**: Altered leptin and ghrelin increase appetite and disrupt sleep-wake regulation [^112PqYbV].

---

### Mechanical factors

Mechanical factors include **reduced lung volumes** — abdominal fat restricts diaphragmatic excursion, lowering lung volumes and causing hypoventilation and hypoxemia during sleep — and **positional apnea**, where supine sleep increases upper-airway collapse and worsens OSA severity [^notfound].

---

### Hormonal and neurological influences

Hormonal and neurological influences include **leptin resistance**, in which reduced leptin sensitivity increases appetite and disrupts energy balance, worsening sleep disturbances, and **circadian misalignment**, whereby altered circadian rhythms from irregular sleep and eating patterns impair sleep quality and metabolic health [^112PqYbV].

## Specific sleep disorders associated with excess weight

| **Sleep disorder** | **Description** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) | Repeated apneas/hypopneas due to upper airway collapse | Fat deposition, reduced muscle tone, insulin resistance [^notfound] |
| Insomnia | Difficulty falling/staying asleep | Inflammation, hormonal dysregulation, anxiety [^notfound] |
| Restless legs syndrome (RLS) | Uncomfortable leg sensations with urge to move | Iron deficiency, dopamine dysregulation, obesity-related inflammation [^notfound] |
| Circadian rhythm disorders | Misalignment of sleep-wake cycles | Irregular sleep, late eating, shift work [^112PqYbV] |

## Consequences of sleep problems in individuals with excess weight

Sleep problems in individuals with excess weight have **significant consequences**:

- **Increased appetite**: Poor sleep increases ghrelin and decreases leptin, promoting overeating and weight gain [^notfound].

- **Insulin resistance**: Sleep fragmentation worsens insulin resistance, increasing diabetes risk [^115Z9mk8].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: OSA and sleep fragmentation elevate hypertension, stroke, and heart disease risk [^114P1mFB].

- **Reduced quality of life**: Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and cognitive impairment impair daily functioning [^115MuT2s].

---

## Clinical implications and interventions

Addressing sleep problems in individuals with excess weight requires **integrated care**:

- **Weight loss**: Comprehensive lifestyle interventions (diet, exercise, behavior) reduce OSA severity and improve sleep quality [^111Vkt3c].

- **CPAP therapy**: First-line treatment for moderate-to-severe OSA, improving sleep quality and reducing cardiovascular risk [^112i25Cg].

- **Sleep hygiene**: Regular sleep schedules, reduced caffeine/alcohol, and weight management improve sleep quality [^116gbdhg].

- **Medical management**: Pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery may be considered for severe obesity-related sleep disorders [^111XF7vU].

---

Excess weight causes sleep problems through multiple mechanisms, including OSA, insulin resistance, inflammation, mechanical factors, and hormonal dysregulation. These sleep disturbances further worsen metabolic health, creating a vicious cycle. Effective management requires **integrated interventions targeting both weight and sleep** [^117Gq9dh].

### Is sleep duration related to obesity? A critical review of the epidemiological evidence [^1113p71J]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

1. Observational studies have implicated habitual sleep duration as a risk factor for mortality and morbidity. Part of this association might be mediated by obesity, which has also been associated with habitual sleep duration. These studies generate wide media attention because of the public's health concerns surrounding increasing obesity and the temporal association with the other modern "epidemic" of sleep loss. Some commentators have recommended public health interventions to control obesity via habitual sleep duration modification. We conducted a critical review of the available literature describing the relationship between habitual sleep duration and obesity in community-based studies in both adults and children, with particular emphasis on longitudinal studies and on studies with objective measures of habitual sleep duration. 2. Existing data have variable consistency. Only one study objectively measured sleep duration for more than one 24-h period. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in adults often demonstrated an association of short sleep duration with BMI. However, some of these studies also showed that long sleep duration was also associated with obesity. In contrast, other studies showed that neither long nor short sleep was associated with obesity. In paediatric populations there appeared to be a clear pattern where shorter sleep durations were associated with obesity. We did not locate any interventional studies where sleep duration had been manipulated in order to prevent or treat obesity. 3. We contend that the evidence base is not yet strong enough to give public health advice to the general population or specific groups about sleep duration being a modifiable risk factor for obesity. We need to experimentally clarify whether sleep duration variability is a risk factor for obesity, in what manner, and in which populations. If a reliable aetiological model could be found, we would ideally then need community-based randomised controlled trials that show that sleep duration can be changed and that sleep duration manipulation produces actual weight loss and/or prevents the development of obesity without undue side-effects.

### Sleep and obesity among children: a systematic review of multiple sleep dimensions [^117XSEg4]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Similar to previous reviews, this study found strong evidence for a negative association between sleep duration and overweight and obesity among primary school‐aged children. However, inconsistencies in both measurement method and definition of sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and sleep timing limited the conclusions that could be drawn for these dimensions. To better understand the role of these dimensions on the sleep‐obesity association, future research would benefit from clarity on definitions across the different dimensions along with the use of valid and reliable tools. Furthermore, a combined approach should be incorporated in future research, to investigate these dimensions simultaneously and longitudinally so that the potential influence of the multiple dimensions of sleep on children's weight status can be analyzed overtime and as sleep needs change.

### Sleep disorders and the development of insulin resistance and obesity [^112MXePb]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Normal sleep is characterized both by reduced glucose turnover by the brain and other metabolically active tissues, and by changes in glucose tolerance. Sleep duration has decreased over the last several decades; data suggest a link between short sleep duration and type 2 diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) results in intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, and also is associated with impaired glucose tolerance. Obesity is a major risk factor for OSA, but whether OSA leads to obesity is unclear. The quality and quantity of sleep may profoundly affect obesity and glucose tolerance, and should be routinely assessed by clinicians.

### The association between sleep health and weight change during a 12-month behavioral weight loss intervention [^113MPud8]. International Journal of Obesity (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior research on the relationship between sleep and attempted weight loss failed to recognize the multidimensional nature of sleep. We examined the relationship between a composite measure of sleep health and change in weight and body composition among adults in a weight loss intervention.

Methods

Adults (N = 125) with overweight or obesity (50.3 ± 10.6 years, 91% female, 81% white) participated in a 12-month behavioral weight loss intervention, with assessments of sleep, weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Six sleep dimensions (regularity, satisfaction, alertness, timing, efficiency, and duration) were categorized as "good" or "poor" using questionnaires and actigraphy. A composite score was calculated by summing the number of "good" dimensions. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was assessed in a subsample (n = 117), using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) to determine OSA severity. Linear mixed modeling was used to examine the relationships between sleep health and outcomes of percent weight, fat mass, or fat-free mass change during the subsequent 6-month interval, adjusting for age, sex, bed partner, and race; an additional model adjusted for AHI.

Results

Mean baseline and 6-month sleep health was 4.5 ± 1.1 and 4.5 ± 1.2, respectively. Mean weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass changes from 0 to 6 months were -9.3 ± 6.1%, -16.9 ± 13.5%, and -3.4 ± 3.4%, respectively, and 0.4 ± 4.8%, -0.3 ± 10.3%, and 0.7 ± 4.1% from 6 to 12 months. Better sleep health was associated with greater subsequent weight loss (P = 0.016) and fat loss (P = 0.006), but not fat-free mass loss (P = 0.232). Following AHI adjustment, the association between sleep health and weight loss was attenuated (P = 0.102) but remained significant with fat loss (P = 0.040). Regularity, satisfaction, timing, and efficiency were each associated with weight and/or fat loss (P ≤ 0.041).

Conclusions

Better sleep health was associated with greater weight and fat loss, with associations attenuated after accounting for OSA severity. Future studies should explore whether improving sleep health, OSA, or the combination improves weight loss.

### Effect of liraglutide 3.0 mg in individuals with obesity and moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea: the SCALE sleep apnea randomized clinical trial [^113NBkuv]. International Journal of Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent yet underdiagnosed chronic disorder. Together with daytime hypersomnolence, it is estimated to occur in approximately 14% of men and 5% of women aged 30–70 years.OSA is associated with multiple comorbidities (including obesity), reduced quality of life, increased motor vehicle accidents and increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Excess weight is considered to be the most important risk factor for OSA. Moreover, the relationship between obesity and OSA appears to be bidirectional. Approximately 60–70% of individuals with OSA are overweight, and about 58% of moderate to severe OSA cases are attributable to excess weight.

Weight loss has been shown to reduce OSA severity and improve blood oxygen saturation and sleep architecture parameters, as well as self-reported quality of life. The beneficial effects of initial weight loss on OSA severity have been shown to persist over the long-term despite weight regain. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend weight loss for adults with excess weight and OSA.

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered to be the gold standard treatment for moderate to severe OSA. However, treatment adherence is often suboptimal (46–83% of individuals fail to adhere), and CPAP does not address the underlying pathophysiology (that is, excess weight) for overweight individuals with OSA. For individuals with obesity and moderate or severe OSA who cannot or will not use CPAP, treatment options are limited.

Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog with a 97% homology to human GLP-1, is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes at once-daily doses up to 1.8 mg. Liraglutide has recently received marketing approval for weight management at the 3.0 mg dose. Liraglutide's weight loss mechanism in humans is through a reduction in appetite with a subsequent decrease in energy intake, not increased energy expenditure.

The aim of this 32-week randomized, controlled trial was to investigate whether liraglutide 3.0 mg would reduce the severity of OSA when compared with placebo (both as adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity) in participants with obesity and moderate or severe OSA who were unwilling or unable to use CPAP therapy. Although both interventions were evaluated in conjunction with lifestyle modifications, they will be abbreviated as 'liraglutide' and 'placebo' hereafter. Liraglutide's weight loss efficacy, as well as the relationship between weight loss, sleep apnea end points and sleep/health-related quality of life, were also examined.

### Physical activity, inactivity and sleep during the diabetes remission clinical trial (DiRECT) [^116p1vqF]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sleep quality and quantity are important determinants of well‐being. Too little or too much sleep have both been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes and other chronic disease incidences. Despite sleep restriction or sleep prolongation having a direct effect on both insulin sensitivity and appetite, little is known about the effects of sleep on weight loss maintenance. Retrospective analyses show that people who report better quality sleep, or who were short sleepers and increased their sleep duration, were 33% more likely to achieve weight loss success. A very low‐energy diet improves sleep quality in people living with obesity who have obstructive sleep apnoea. In the present study, an intention to treat analysis showed no impact of the dietary intervention on sleep duration but small reductions in WASO, indicating better sleep quality. The small improvements in sleep quality could be driven by changes in weight or by the increased physical activity in those who had successful weight loss.

Limitations of the present study must be considered. More partipants were lost to follow‐up in the intervention group, which may have introduced bias. However, it is likely that the keenest participants were retained and the strikingly negative results are unlikely to have under‐reported any true difference. Secondly, accelerometer data for all three time points was not available for all of the intervention group, and those with missing data were slightly younger with higher body weight. Again, given the definitive demonstration of no change in physical activity as a result of the intervention, it is unlikely that a genuine effect would be missed. Thirdly, the exploratory analysis involves risk of type 1 statistical error. Fourthly, it is not possble to distinguish between the possibilities that the increase in physical activity in the ≥ 10% group was secondary to the weight loss itself, or reflected greater ability of some people to adhere to the range of advice given. Finally, the DiRECT population was largely of white European ethnicity and study of other ethnic groups is required.

Overall, these data demonstrate that repeated low‐intensity advice to increase physical activity in the DiRECT intervention group did not produce change. However, those people who had long‐term weight loss success with the low‐energy diet had positive changes in physical activity and inactivity. As this successful weight loss programme at 2 years produced major health benefits with remission of type 2 diabetes in 36%, and decreases in blood pressure with fewer drugs, it is now important to optimise long‐term weight loss maintenance by developing interventions encompassing restrained food intake together with effective but affordable physical activity/inactivity strategies.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^1155Rpx7]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Metabolic health in children — sleep duration and overweight/obesity and metabolic markers: Many studies targeted overweight/obesity with study sizes ranging from 62 to 81,390, and two meta-analyses found sleep duration inversely correlates with obesity in children 0–18 years. In a cohort of 1,930 children ages 0–13 years, in younger children ages 0–4 years, sleep duration of less than 11 hours was subsequently associated with increased risks of being overweight/obese, and in a cross-sectional study of 1,229 children ages 5 to 11 years, children who slept less than 10 hours per weeknight were 5 times more likely to be overweight than those who slept at least 12 hours on weeknights. Additional studies reported that in 6,576 children ages 7–11 years, children who slept < 9 hours per night had a higher risk for overweight, obesity, and abdominal obesity compared to those who slept 10–11 hours; in 6,324 children ages 7–15 years, boys who slept < 10 hours per night had increased odds of overweight compared to children sleeping > 10 hours; and in 3,311 children 12.5 to 17.5 years, shorter sleep duration < 8 hours was associated with increased BMI, body fat, and waist and hip circumferences. Beyond weight, a cohort of 1,303 children aged 5–29 months showed that children sleeping < 10 hours per night consumed approximately 50 more kcal per day than those sleeping 12–13 hours, higher HOMA indices were observed in high school–aged children who slept < 6.48 hours, and in children ages 4–7 years there was increased bone mineral content in those who slept longer than 8 hours. U-shaped relationships were also reported: among 62 obese 8- to 17-year-old children, metabolic parameters suggested an ideal range of 7.5–8.5 hours of sleep, and in 387 children ages 13–17 years HOMA-IR was 20% higher when sleep duration was < 5 hours or > 10.5 hours.

### Association of dietary insulin index (DII) and dietary insulin load (DIL) with circadian rhythm and quality of sleep among overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study [^112oHiqx]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Dietary nutrition is believed to significantly impact sleep disorders and disrupt CR. However, a complex relationship exists between sleep and nutritional components. A person's digestive and metabiotic functions play a significant role in their nutritional factors based on their diet pattern. Furthermore, nutrition exerts a profound influence on hormones and inflammation, both of which can contribute to insomnia directly or indirectly. It is widely accepted that the major macronutrient directly linked to postprandial blood sugar elevation is carbohydrates. Consequently, postprandial insulin secretion is primarily influenced by dietary carbohydrates. The Dietary Insulin Index (DII) quantifies insulin responses to isoenergetic components of foods in comparison to the reference food, which is determined based on postprandial insulin secretion. Additionally, aside from considering carbohydrate content, this index analyzes high-protein and high-fat compounds along with their interactions. Dietary Insulin Load (DIL) is another index calculated by multiplying the values of DII for each food by the energy content and frequency of consumption of each food. Excess insulin secretion has been associated with oxidative stress and accelerates beta-cell dysfunction in humans, increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Studies have shown that carbohydrate-rich diets, which elevate postprandial glucose and insulin levels, contribute to the development of IR, an increase in body fat, and undesirable lipid profiles.

Despite the association of obesity with the quality of sleep and CR evident in previous studies, no study has examined the association between DII and DIL with the quality of sleep and CR. This study explores how dietary factors affect sleep quality and chronic inflammation in overweight and obese women, focusing on the importance of DII in predicting poor sleep quality. Additionally, the study underscores this population's intricate relationship between dietary habits, sleep quality, and CRs.

### Sleep extension is a feasible lifestyle intervention in free-living adults who are habitually short sleepers: a potential strategy for decreasing intake of free sugars? A randomized controlled pilot study [^111WSwKY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

This SE RCT had good rates of participation, low rates of attrition, and satisfactory compliance in healthy, free-living adult short sleepers. These results show that a personalized behavioral consultation targeting sleep hygiene is a feasible lifestyle intervention and can be used to test the health effects of SE. Our pilot investigation of secondary outcomes indicates that adherence to advice to extend sleep may reduce free-sugars intake. No effects were observed on indexes of body composition, energy balance, cardiometabolic risk, appetite hormones, or heart rate variability as a result of the intervention.

To our knowledge, this is the first long-term RCT to show the feasibility of SE by addressing sleep hygiene under free-living conditions in healthy adults who are habitually short sleepers and uses objective measures of sleep to measure compliance. Previous long-term (≥ 1 mo) SE trials were conducted in prehypertensive adults or in overweight adults as part of a weight-loss program, sometimes relying on self-reported measures of sleep. Previous SE interventional studies in healthy, free-living short sleepers were nonrandomized. In the present study, the intervention increased TIB in the SE group, allowing for a longer sleep period, thus increasing sleep duration in comparison to the control group; however, they did not achieve the recommended 7–9 h of sleep. We also found that objective measures of sleep quality were modestly lower in the SE group than in the control group. The decline in sleep quality may be due to a period of adjustment to the prescribed longer TIB. This apparently negative consequence of earlier bedtimes may dissipate over time. A study conducted in young adults for 3 wk suggested that their graduated SE protocol preserved participants' sleep quality. Future SE trials should investigate maintenance of or improvement in sleep quality, as well as the potential benefits of introducing gradual behavioral changes.

### Obesity and sleep: a growing concern [^116qUKv5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The 'obesity epidemic' is a growing concern globally, and obesity trends are projected to continue increasing in both prevalence and overall mean BMI. Cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities have historically been well described; however, obesity-related respiratory disease is now increasingly prevalent, in particular, sleep disordered breathing. The surge in clinically significant obstructive sleep apnoea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome is associated with increased cardiopulmonary morbidity, quality-of-life impairment, and a potential rise in the frequency of road traffic accidents.

Recent Findings

We discuss recent trends in obesity and obesity-related sleep disordered breathing. We also discuss recently published international guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of sleep disordered breathing, and in particular, the role of weight management interventions, such as bariatric surgery, in this area. We discuss possible approaches to meet the growing demand for sleep assessment and management in the future.

Summary

Obesity-related respiratory disease reflects an increasing proportion of patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. It is important to recognize the impact of obesity on pulmonary physiology in order to appropriately care for this population, as well as plan for the future.

### Eating behavior traits and sleep as determinants of weight loss in overweight and obese adults [^112SLxvn]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

A large body of evidence shows that sleeping habits have an influence on body weight regulation. More specifically, studies report that short sleep duration and poor sleep quality are both associated with weight gain and obesity. Results of recent studies also suggest that lack of sufficient sleep can impact the success of weight-loss interventions. For example, Nedeltcheva et al. conducted a crossover study in overweight adults randomly assigned to either 5.5 or 8.5 h per night for 2 weeks in addition to moderate caloric restriction in a laboratory setting. They observed that sleep restriction led to less body fat loss and greater hunger compared with the experimental condition with adequate sleep.

We recently replicated these findings in a real-life setting and showed that both sleep duration (hours per night) and sleep quality (total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score) predicted fat mass loss during common dietary interventions in overweight and obese adults. In particular, we observed that a 1-h change in sleep duration was associated with a 0.7 kg change in fat mass after adjustment for covariates. Although the latter study also suggests that poor sleeping habits can undermine dietary efforts to reduce adiposity, the interaction between sleep and eating behaviors with regard to the magnitude of body weight, fat mass and waist circumference (WC) loss is unknown. A better understanding of the connections between sleep and eating behaviors is needed if we want to better tailor weight-loss programs, avoid patients' disappointment and maximize success.

The objective of the present study was therefore to examine the relationship between eating behaviors, sleep quality/quantity and loss of body weight, fat mass and WC in adults involved in diet-based weight-reducing programs. We hypothesized that having good sleeping habits together with adequate eating behavior traits would promote greater weight and fat loss in adults undergoing dietary interventions.

### Insufficient sleep and obesity: cause or consequence [^116x8Zo7]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sleep is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved biological process that, when disturbed, increases the risk for a variety of diseases in people, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancer. Although results from epidemiological studies support the link between insufficient sleep and an increased risk of obesity, the directionality of this link is unknown. Results from short‐term controlled clinical studies, conducted almost exclusively in people who are normal weight, demonstrate that sleep restriction increases hunger, appetite, energy intake, and body weight. However, the authors are not aware of any studies that have evaluated the effect of more than 3 weeks of experimental sleep restriction on obesity risk factors, and few studies have been conducted in people with preexisting obesity. This Perspective reviews the link between insufficient sleep and obesity risk and the potential therapeutic effects of sleep extension in people with chronic sleep insufficiency.

### Higher sleep fragmentation predicts a lower magnitude of weight loss in overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention [^115Z9mk8]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Background:

Sleep has been identified as having an influence on the success of weight-loss interventions; however, knowledge of the mechanisms and the extent to which sleep disturbances affect the magnitude of weight reduction is inconclusive.

Objective:

To determine if sleep duration and quality can predict the magnitude of weight reduction in a weight-loss intervention program for overweight and obese women.

Methods:

Ninety overweight and obese women aged 25–65 years completed the 7-month weight-loss phase of our weight-loss intervention. Sleep duration and quality were evaluated before the intervention by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a self-report questionnaire, and by actigraphy. Serum levels of ghrelin, leptin, cortisol and insulin also were measured at baseline. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

Results:

The mean reduction rate of body mass index (BMI) after the intervention was 13.6%. Multiple linear regression revealed that the number of wake episodes (WEs) per night had a significant relationship with the reduction of BMI even after adjusting for other clinical variables (β = −0.341, P = 0.001). The participants with five or more WEs per night (high-WE group) had a significantly lower reduction in BMI compared with those with fewer than five (normal-WE group), after adjusting for confounding variables. In contrast, the PSQI-assessed parameters, reflecting the subjective assessments of sleep quality and duration, failed to detect an association with the reduction in BMI. Baseline HOMA-IR was significantly higher in the high-WE group than in the normal-WE group after adjusting for confounding variables.

Conclusions:

Higher sleep fragmentation, as manifested by the increased number of WEs, predicts a lower magnitude of weight reduction in persons participating in weight-loss programs.

Sleep restriction and energy expenditure — evidence is mixed; studies using indirect calorimetry have found either no difference or a lower resting metabolic rate with sleep restriction relative to habitual sleep, and as part of a weight loss diet, sleep restriction leads to greater reduction in resting metabolic rate than habitual sleep; when 24-hour energy expenditure was measured by doubly labeled water, no difference was observed.

### Insufficient sleep and obesity: cause or consequence [^112b1276]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Sleep is an ancient and evolutionarily conserved biological process that, when disturbed, increases the risk for a variety of diseases in people, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancer. Although results from epidemiological studies support the link between insufficient sleep and an increased risk of obesity, the directionality of this link is unknown. Results from short-term controlled clinical studies, conducted almost exclusively in people who are normal weight, demonstrate that sleep restriction increases hunger, appetite, energy intake, and body weight. However, the authors are not aware of any studies that have evaluated the effect of more than 3weeks of experimental sleep restriction on obesity risk factors, and few studies have been conducted in people with preexisting obesity. This Perspective reviews the link between insufficient sleep and obesity risk and the potential therapeutic effects of sleep extension in people with chronic sleep insufficiency.

### Effects of poor and short sleep on glucose metabolism and obesity risk [^1126LXtU]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2009). Medium credibility.

The importance of sleep to hormones and glucose metabolism was first documented more than four decades ago. Since then, sleep curtailment has become an endemic behavior in modern society. In addition, the prevalence of sleep disorders, particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has increased. OSA is very common in endocrine and metabolic disorders, but often remains undiagnosed. This Review summarizes the laboratory and epidemiologic evidence that suggests how sleep loss, either behavioral or disease-related, and poor quality of sleep might promote the development of obesity and diabetes mellitus, and exacerbate existing endocrine conditions. Treatment of sleep disorders has the potential to improve glucose metabolism and energy balance. Screening for habitual sleep patterns and OSA might be critically important for patients with endocrine and metabolic disorders.

### Higher sleep fragmentation predicts a lower magnitude of weight loss in overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention [^112V1SpV]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sleep has been identified as having an influence on the success of weight-loss interventions; however, knowledge of the mechanisms and the extent to which sleep disturbances affect the magnitude of weight reduction is inconclusive.

Objective

To determine if sleep duration and quality can predict the magnitude of weight reduction in a weight-loss intervention program for overweight and obese women.

Methods

Ninety overweight and obese women aged 25–65 years completed the 7-month weight-loss phase of our weight-loss intervention. Sleep duration and quality were evaluated before the intervention by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a self-report questionnaire, and by actigraphy. Serum levels of ghrelin, leptin, cortisol and insulin also were measured at baseline. Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

Results

The mean reduction rate of body mass index (BMI) after the intervention was 13.6%. Multiple linear regression revealed that the number of wake episodes (WEs) per night had a significant relationship with the reduction of BMI even after adjusting for other clinical variables (β = -0.341, P = 0.001). The participants with five or more WEs per night (high-WE group) had a significantly lower reduction in BMI compared with those with fewer than five (normal-WE group), after adjusting for confounding variables. In contrast, the PSQI-assessed parameters, reflecting the subjective assessments of sleep quality and duration, failed to detect an association with the reduction in BMI. Baseline HOMA-IR was significantly higher in the high-WE group than in the normal-WE group after adjusting for confounding variables.

Conclusions

Higher sleep fragmentation, as manifested by the increased number of WEs, predicts a lower magnitude of weight reduction in persons participating in weight-loss programs.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^112i25Cg]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea — treatment approach and outcomes assessment: OSA should be approached as a chronic disease requiring long-term, multidisciplinary management, and positive airway pressure (PAP) is the treatment of choice for mild, moderate, and severe OSA and should be offered as an option to all patients (Consensus). A general OSA outcomes assessment should be performed on all patients following the initiation of therapy, including resolution of sleepiness, OSA specific quality of life measures, patient and spousal satisfaction, adherence to therapy, avoidance of factors worsening disease, obtaining an adequate amount of sleep, practicing proper sleep hygiene, and weight loss for overweight/obese patients (Consensus).

### Weight loss is integral to obstructive sleep apnea management. ten-year follow-up in sleep AHEAD [^111WTDBU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
ILI versus DSE

Interestingly, the authors found that although the change in weight predicted the improvement in AHI over time, weight loss alone did not explain the full extent of the intervention effects on OSA severity. Additionally, changes in waist circumference, a surrogate marker of visceral adiposity, did not independently influence AHI. So, what could be the potential explanations for these intriguing weight-independent intervention effects? In Sleep AHEAD, lifestyle intervention focused on modifications of diet and physical activity, and perhaps these healthier lifestyle behaviors contributed to the reduction in AHI. In adults from diverse backgrounds, diet quality is associated with OSA severity, after adjusting for confounders. To our knowledge, diet data are not available from Sleep AHEAD. Also, independent of body habitus, level of exercise is associated with OSA severity. Although physical activity data were not included in this report by Kuna and colleagues, the authors previously found that cardiorespiratory fitness does not predict change in AHI at 4-year follow-up, after adjusting for change in weight. There is evidence from RCTs to suggest that diet-only, exercise-only, and combined diet and exercise interventions all attenuate OSA severity despite highly variable changes in weight. These weight-independent effects of intervention on OSA severity are likely due to multifactorial mechanisms that may modulate upper airway stability, chemoreceptor sensitivity, visceral adiposity, neuroendocrine control, sleep quality, and other aspects of OSA pathophysiology, which are yet to be discovered.

It is worth noting that these new insights from Sleep AHEAD by Kuna and colleagues should be interpreted cautiously given some limitations. First, the sleep studies were missing in about half of the participants at the 10-year follow-up. The authors performed post hoc statistical analyses (e.g. multiple imputations and weighing for missingness) in an attempt to address this drawback. Sensitivity analyses in 96 participants who had complete AHI data at 10 years would have been useful to further support the authors' conclusions. Second, 16% of patients were receiving continuous positive airway pressure treatment for OSA, which may partly bias measured outcomes. Third, the potential effects of changes in medications that commonly influence weight, in particular the use of oral antidiabetic agents or insulin in this diabetic population, could be confounders. Lastly, Sleep AHEAD involved older adults with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes, which may limit the generalizability to more diverse populations.

### The role of weight management in the treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1144mryE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea weight management — reduced-calorie diet versus no diet: For patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who are overweight or obese, the guideline states "we suggest a reduced-calorie diet (with or without exercise/increased physical activity) rather than no diet (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the estimated effects)". Evidence cited includes two randomized trials; one was "designed to induce weight loss of 0.5 kg/wk", with "follow-up ranged from 5 to 8 months", and showed the weight-loss group had a larger decrease in non-REM apnea index "(MD, 30.3 fewer events/h; 95% CI, 1.9 to 58.7 fewer events/h)". A later trial "randomly assigned 29 patients with OSA to follow a reduced-calorie diet (∼800 kcal/d)… for 4 months", where the weight-loss group had larger decreases in BMI "(MD, 2.80 kg/m2 lower; 95% CI, 3.4–0.5 kg/m2 lower)", neck circumference "(MD, 0.8 cm smaller; 95% CI, 0.1–1.5 cm smaller)", and AHI "(7.35 fewer events/h; 95% CI, 0.8 to 13.9 fewer events/h)". The panel notes that a diet-focused program "was associated with decreases in BMI, neck circumference, and OSA severity", that "Adverse effects were not reported", and that "Neither trial reported on quality of life, daytime sleepiness, other OSA-related symptoms, cardiovascular events, mortality, or adverse events", concluding their confidence is "tempered by its very low certainty in the estimated effects".

### The causal relationship between sleep and obesity: novel insights and therapeutic target [^115QjfJ1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Sleep is a physiological part of human life under primarily neurobiologic regulation, and occupies between 20% and 40% of the day. The quality and quantity of sleep play an important role in the maintenance of health and wellbeing. Sleep disorders and insomnia are increasingly being diagnosed at all ages, affecting 25% to 30% of adults worldwide. Because sleep is involved with many physiologic systems, insufficient sleep duration and poor sleep quality have been associated with many adverse health outcomes. It is recognized as a public health concern in many countries. Numerous previous studies have revealed that sleep disorders are associated with the onset and progression of different diseases, including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, depression, mental disorders, cancer, Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and infectious diseases.

A large body of epidemiologic evidence has linked insufficient sleep duration and quality to the risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Sleep restriction has been consistently shown to increase hunger, appetite, and food intake. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most prevalent type of obesity-related sleep disorder that leads to an increased risk for numerous chronic health conditions. In addition, the increased visceral adipose tissue might induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines that could alter the sleep–wake rhythm. Although obesity could cause an alteration of sleep through several pathogenetic mechanisms, it has been reported that subjects suffering from sleep disorders are more prone to develop obesity. Experimental studies have shown that both decrease in the amount of sleep and impaired sleep quality could increase the risk of developing obesity. Sleep restriction also causes physiological, hormonal, and food behavioral changes that promote food intake, decrease in physical activity, and weight gain.

### Insufficient sleep and obesity: cause or consequence [^114UmuNm]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Insufficient sleep can be defined as a failure to obtain the adequate amount of sleep needed to support optimal mental and physiological function. Insufficient sleep is common in modern society and is likely caused by a variety of factors, including work, social and family obligations, stress, sleep disorders, and other medical illnesses. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine defines acute insufficient sleep as a reduction in total sleep time, usually lasting less than 1 week, whereas chronic insufficient sleep is defined as curtailed sleep that persists for 3 months or longer.

Insufficient sleep is associated with an increased risk of developing obesity, characterized by an inverse dose–response association between sleep duration and obesity risk. Data from a meta‐analysis of prospective cohort studies demonstrate that each 1‐hour decrease in sleep from a sleep duration of 7 h/d is associated with a 9% increased risk of obesity. However, epidemiological studies are unable to determine causality, and it is not clear whether insufficient sleep causes obesity or obesity causes insufficient sleep and/or additional sleep disturbances, or both (Figure 1).

### Sleep quality and BMI in pregnancy-a prospective cohort study [^112PuL97]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pregnancy associated sleep disturbances is a common pregnancy-related complication which can lead to significant maternal distress and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Sleep quality can be affected by multiple factors and obesity has been recognized as one of them. Various previous studies have demonstrated poorer sleep quality during pregnancy. However, most studies included assessment at only one point of pregnancy. This prospective cohort study aimed to better evaluate the effect of pregnancy on the quality of sleep throughout the antenatal period and how BMI affects antenatal sleep.

Methods

A total of 926 women were recruited before 14 weeks of gestation and followed throughout pregnancy. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI) was employed to assess sleep quality in 4 antenatal visits throughout pregnancy. Their weight was also recorded at each visit.

Results

The PSQI global score was higher towards the later part of pregnancy (6.4 to 8.0, p < 0.001) and highest at the 4th visit. Sleep latency was longer as pregnancy progressed (18.5 mins to 23.2 mins, p = 0.001). Sleep duration became shorter over time and was the shortest at the 4th visit (7.1 h to 6.5 h, p < 0.001). Sleep efficiency was the lowest at the 4th visit (85.2 to 81.6%, p < 0.001). The same trend was observed for subjects in different BMI groups throughput pregnancy. PSQI score increased and sleep duration decreased as BMI increased. The effect of increasing BMI on PSQI and sleep duration was only observed in the higher BMI groups (> 25 kg/m 2).

Conclusions

Our study showed that sleep quality gradually declined throughout pregnancy for all BMI groups. Higher BMI was associated with poorer sleep as represented by PSQI score and sleep duration, particularly in the overweight and obese subgroups.

### Higher sleep fragmentation predicts a lower magnitude of weight loss in overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention [^1133GLmA]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a major healthcare problem that contributes to a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, and it has enormous economic implications for society. The prevalence of obesity has increased markedly throughout the world in recent decades.

The development and persistence of obesity are known to be influenced by a variety of environmental factors, such as excessive daily food intake and physical inactivity. Accumulating evidence also supports the hypothesis that sleep disturbance is an important contributing factor to obesity. Numerous epidemiological studies conducted in different geographical regions have investigated the association between sleep and obesity among different populations. The majority of these studies have found a relationship between short sleep duration and an increased risk of obesity. For example, a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies of 603 519 adults reported a pooled obesity odds ratio of 1.55 in those who had fewer than 5 hours of sleep, and a decrease in body mass index (BMI) by 0.35 kg m −2 for each additional hour of sleep.

In addition to sleep duration, the quality of sleep has been suggested as an influential variable in the relationship between sleep and obesity. In the multivariate analysis of the Cardiovascular Health Epidemiology Study, in which sleep duration and quality were assessed by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the effect of sleep duration on the risk of obesity was rather modest. However, a significant association between poorer sleep quality and an increased BMI was found in women. The importance of sleep quality was reported in the Rotterdam Study, which found that BMI increased by 0.59 kg m −2 per s.d. of sleep fragmentation, as measured by actigraphy. This study also found that both short sleepers (< 5 h or–6 h per night) and long sleepers (> 8 h) were more likely to be obese in comparison with participants who slept between 7 and 8 hours, as measured by actigraphy. However, the association between short sleep and obesity was no longer significant after adjusting for actigraphy-assessed sleep fragmentation. Furthermore, self-reports of habitual sleep duration were not associated with BMI or obesity, which suggests the importance of conducting objective assessments in sleep studies.

### Relationship between sleep quality and quantity and weight loss in women participating in a weight-loss intervention trial [^116XuVKS]. Obesity (2012). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that individuals who report fewer total hours of sleep are more likely to be overweight or obese. Few studies have prospectively evaluated weight-loss success in relation to reported sleep quality and quantity. This analysis sought to determine the association between sleep characteristics and weight loss in overweight or obese women enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of a weight-loss program. We hypothesized that in overweight/obese women, significant weight loss would be demonstrated more frequently in women who report a better Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Global Score or sleep > 7 h/night as compared to women who report a worse PSQI score or sleep ≤ 7 h/night. Women of ages 45.5 ± 10.4 (mean ± SD) years and BMI of 33.9 ± 3.3 (n = 245) were randomized and completed PSQI at baseline and 6 months; 198 had weight change assessed through 24 months. At baseline, 52.7% reported PSQI scores above the clinical cutoff of 5. Better subjective sleep quality increased the likelihood of weight-loss success by 33% (relative risk (RR), 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52–0.86), as did sleeping > 7 h/night. A worse Global Score at 6 months was associated with a 28% lower likelihood of continued successful weight loss at 18 months, but unassociated by 24 months. These results suggest that sleep quality and quantity may contribute to weight loss in intervention-based studies designed to promote weight control in overweight/obese adult women.

### Sleep duration and weight loss among overweight / obese women enrolled in a behavioral weight loss program [^116MQhks]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to extend these observations by examining: (1) whether baseline sleep duration predicts weight loss outcomes in a randomized controlled trial examining a BWL intervention among overweight and obese (OW/OB) women with urinary incontinence; and (2) whether there are changes in sleep duration among participants in a BWL intervention. The present study also assesses these questions separately for Caucasian and African-American women, as there are well-established differences between self-reported sleep duration among Caucasian and African-American populations (for example, Lauderdale et al.). Investigation of participants' baseline characteristics across time in bed (TIB) categories presented previously, indicated that shorter TIB was associated with higher BMI and lower physical activity compared with the referent category of ' > 7–8 h', after adjusting for covariates. The present analyses focus on longitudinal associations between sleep and weight loss in this sample.

### The role of weight management in the treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111XF7vU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Overweight/obesity is a common, reversible risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea severity (OSA). The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of overweight/obesity in patients with OSA.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the literature. Clinical recommendations were formulated by a panel of pulmonary, sleep medicine, weight management, and behavioral science specialists.

Results

Behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical treatments promote weight loss and can reduce OSA severity, reverse common comorbidities, and improve quality of life, although published studies have methodological limitations. After considering the quality of evidence, feasibility, and acceptability of these interventions, the panel made a strong recommendation that patients with OSA who are overweight or obese be treated with comprehensive lifestyle intervention consisting of 1) a reduced-calorie diet, 2) exercise or increased physical activity, and 3) behavioral guidance. Conditional recommendations were made regarding reduced-calorie diet and exercise/increased physical activity as separate management tools. Pharmacological therapy and bariatric surgery are appropriate for selected patients who require further assistance with weight loss.

Conclusions

Weight-loss interventions, especially comprehensive lifestyle interventions, are associated with improvements in OSA severity, cardiometabolic comorbidities, and quality of life. The American Thoracic Society recommends that clinicians regularly assess weight and incorporate weight management strategies that are tailored to individual patient preferences into the routine treatment of adult patients with OSA who are overweight or obese.

### Sleep duration and weight loss among overweight / obese women enrolled in a behavioral weight loss program [^116VuQcc]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Objective:

The purpose of this study was to examine whether baseline sleep duration predicts weight loss outcomes in a randomized controlled trial examining a behavioral weight loss (BWL) intervention among overweight and obese (OW/OB) women with urinary incontinence; and whether participation in the BWL intervention is associated with changes in sleep duration.

Design:

Longitudinal, clinical intervention study of a 6-month BWL program.

Subjects:

Three hundred sixteen OW/OB women, with urinary incontinence (age: 30–81 years, body mass index (BMI; 25–50 kg m −2) enrolled from July 2004–April 2006.

Measurements:

Measured height and weight, self-report measures of demographics, sleep and physical activity.

Results:

Neither self-reported total sleep time (TST) nor time in bed (TIB) at baseline significantly predicted weight loss outcomes among OW/OB women in a BWL treatment. BWL treatment was successful regardless of how much subjects reported sleeping at baseline, with an average weight loss of 8.19 kg for OW/OB women receiving BWL treatment, versus a weight loss of 1.44 kg in the control condition. Similarly, changes in weight, BMI and incontinence episodes did not significantly predict changes in sleep duration or TIB across the treatment period.

Conclusion:

Although epidemiological and cross-sectional studies support a relationship between short sleep and increased BMI, the present study found no significant relationship between TST or TIB and weight loss for OW/OB women participating in a BWL treatment.

### Evidence-based guidelines for fatigue risk management in emergency medical services [^112hpB2s]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Emergency medical services (EMS) fatigue/sleep education and training — program scope, effects, costs, and frequency are described as follows: The panel found diverse delivery options, noting multiple formats, durations, instructors, and methods, and reported that an evidence review of 18 studies showed a favorable relationship between education/training and safety outcomes, with a meta-analysis of five studies showing improvements in shift worker sleep quality four to eight weeks after education and training. Being overweight or obese affects three-quarters of EMS personnel and 75% fail to meet recommendations for physical activity. Costs of general workplace health, wellness, and fitness programs range from 130 to 150 U.S. dollars per employee per year, and adding fatigue or sleep health modules to an existing program may be cost-neutral or minimal in real dollars for some EMS organizations. EMS personnel should receive fatigue education and training during new employee orientation/training, as well as every 2 years, and education and training in fatigue and sleep health should be a key component of a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the effects of fatigue related to EMS shift work, while the panel does not provide recommendations or suggest policies on the depth, breadth, or source of content.

### Sleep and obesity among children: a systematic review of multiple sleep dimensions [^113wDcZN]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is growing evidence internationally that declines in the duration of sleep children obtain is inversely associated with overweight and obesity (Ow/Ob). 1, 2, 3, 4 Studies have shown that where children were classified as sleeping for shorter or insufficient durations they had significantly increased odds of being affected by overweight/obesity, compared with those who slept for sufficient durations. 5, 6 The proposed etiology of this association suggests that insufficient sleep leads to an energy imbalance via altered hormone regulation, reducing physical activity levels, increasing sedentary time, and a higher caloric intake. 6, 7, 8 While several reviews have examined the available literature on the link between sleep duration and rates of overweight and obesity among children, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 there is argument that these overlook more nuanced and potentially important dimensions of children's sleep that might influence this association.

Buysse critiqued the reliance on duration as a measure of sleep, arguing that the dimensions of children's sleep such as efficiency, quality, and sleep timing (onset/off‐set) should also be considered as part of the sleep‐obesity relationship. 15 Definitions and categorization of these dimensions differ slightly across studies; however, as guided by definitions from the previous literature, 15, 16, 17 these four sleep dimensions can be defined as: Sleep duration: the quantity/length of sleep time obtained; Sleep quality: objectively measured architecture of sleep (adequacy of time spent in the different sleep wave cycles), or subjectively reported satisfaction/perceived problems with sleep; Sleep efficiency: a measure of sleep continuity, incorporating the ease to initiate (sleep latency) and maintain sleep (minimal wake episodes) in an efficient manner, or the percentage of sleep time achieved between bed and wake times; and Sleep timing: the placement of sleep within the 24‐hours of the day, including factors such as bed/wake times.

### Sleep duration and quality: impact on lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic health: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111ZSC3D]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Sleep restriction and energy intake — controlled studies commonly compare sleep restriction, usually 4 hours in bed, with habitual sleep, usually 8 to 10 hours in bed, and report increases in 24-hour energy intake with overeating ranging from ≈180 to 559 kcal/d; however, some studies reported no difference between sleep conditions, and related behavioral data show larger portion selections and greater food purchases after a night of total sleep deprivation relative to an 8-hour sleep opportunity.

### Effect of sleep extension on objectively assessed energy intake among adults with overweight in real-life settings: a randomized clinical trial [^115Uvmui]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Future similarly rigorous intervention studies of longer duration and using objective assessments of energy balance under real-life conditions are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to investigate whether sleep extension could be an effective, scalable strategy for reversing obesity in diverse populations. Along with a healthy diet and regular physical activity, healthy sleep habits should be integrated into public messages to help reduce the risk of obesity and related comorbidities.

### Does sleep quality affect balance? The perspective from the somatosensory, vestibular, and visual systems [^114jaJAo]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Previous studies have focused on the balance system's involvement in sleep deprivation or disorders. This study investigated how daily routine sleep quality affects the balance system of people without sleep deprivation or diagnosed sleep disorders.

Methods

The study included 45 participants with a BMI score of < 25. The PSQI was used to determine sleep quality. The SOT, HS-SOT, and ADT evaluated the vestibular system's functionality.

Results

In SOT, condition 3, 4, 5, and 6 composite scores, VIS and VEST composite balance scores, and HS-SOT 5 scores were lower in the HPSQI group. At the same time, there is a statistically significant negative correlation between these scores and PSQI scores.

Conclusion

Poor sleep quality may be a factor influencing the balance system. Sleep quality affects the visual and vestibular systems rather than the somatosensory system. The population should be made aware of this issue, and clinicians should consider the potential impact of sleep quality when evaluating the balance system.

### Sleep, ghrelin, leptin and changes in body weight during a 1-year moderate-intensity physical activity intervention [^1133Tn3W]. International Journal of Obesity (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships among exercise, sleep, ghrelin and leptin.

Methods

We randomly assigned 173 post-menopausal sedentary overweight (body mass index ≥ 24.0 kg/m(2) and > 33% body fat) women aged 50–75 years living in western Washington State to either a facility- and home-based moderate-intensity physical activity intervention or a stretching control group. Fasting plasma ghrelin, leptin, measured height, weight and self-reported sleep were assessed at baseline and 12 months.

Results

There were no consistent cross-sectional patterns between self-reported sleep measures and ghrelin or leptin at baseline. The weight loss differences between exercisers and stretchers were greater for those who slept less at follow-up than at baseline compared to those whose sleep duration did not change (-3.2 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.8, -0.5). Improvements in sleep quality were associated with significantly greater differences between exercisers and stretchers for ghrelin increases (improved vs same sleep quality: +115 pg/ml, 95% CI +25, +206) and leptin decreases (improved vs worsened sleep quality: -5.7 ng/ml, 95% CI -9.5, -1.5).

Conclusion

There was only limited evidence that changes in sleep duration or quality modified exercise-induced changes in weight, ghrelin or leptin. Moreover, the observed differences were not in the directions hypothesized. Future longitudinal studies including population-based samples using objective measures of sleep and long follow-up may help to clarify these relationships.

### The association between self-reported sleep quality and overweight in a Chinese population [^116g48Y8]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Sleep quality and obesity are associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. However, there is limited research on the association between sleep quality and obesity, and thus the aim of this study is to investigate this relationship in a Chinese population.

Design and Methods

Subjects were recruited from the Prevention Health Center of National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Anthropometric data and metabolic parameters were measured. Being overweight or obese was defined according to the recommendations of the Department of Health in Taiwan. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

Results

Of the total 2,803 subjects, 1,059 were classified as normal weight, 1,127 were overweight, and 617 were obese. The global PSQI score were 6.30 ± 2.56, 6.61 ± 2.96, and 7.02 ± 2.95 in subjects who were normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively (test for trend, P < 0.001). Of the variables tested in the multivariate linear regression model, female gender, being overweight, obesity, sleep duration, and alcohol drinking were significantly associated with global PSQI scores, and in the multivariate logistic regression model, female gender, being overweight, obesity, and sleep duration were independent predictors of poor sleepers after controlling for age, gender, BMI or different weight statuses, sleep duration, alcohol drinking, smoking, habitual exercise, hypertension, newly diagnosed diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and alanine aminotransferase.

Conclusions

In conclusion, female gender, being overweight, obesity, and sleep duration were associated with poor sleep quality independent of cardiometabolic risk factors. In clinical practice, subjects who are obese, or even only overweight, should be evaluated for the presence of sleep disturbance.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity / adiposity-based chronic disease-2025 update [^117Gq9dh]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Sleep — suboptimal sleep and circadian disruption are linked to adverse energy balance and cardiometabolic risks; counseling to extend sleep may aid weight reduction, and screening for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recommended in symptomatic or high-risk individuals, including those with high neck circumference thresholds. Suboptimal sleep duration (< 7–8 hours per night) and poor sleep quality can promote dysregulated energy intake, metabolic perturbations, and obesity, and inadequate sleep and circadian disruption are associated with increased appetite, increased energy intake, decreased energy expenditure, and cardiometabolic disease risk. For those with short sleep duration, individualized sleep hygiene counseling intended to extend sleep duration may reduce energy intake and increase weight reduction, and in the Sleep AHEAD trial, weight reduction resulted in significant improvements in OSA and the apnea-hypopnea index among people with obesity and type 2 diabetes; treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure only, however, does not seem to improve weight reduction. People with obesity should be counseled about the importance of adequate sleep and circadian health, and screening for OSA is recommended in those with typical symptoms, high neck circumference (> 17 inches in men and > 16 inches in women), or high risk for OSA.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114qN5LD]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This secondary analysis of an RCT has several limitations. First, the power calculation of sample size was based on visceral adipose tissue changes, the main outcome of the overall project. Thus, the current study may not be well powered to detect small but significant changes in sleep, mood, or quality of life. Second, study duration may limit the translation of the present findings to detect significant differences among the intervention groups. Third, participants could consume caffeinated beverages during the fasting windows, which was not controlled during the study period and may have influenced sleep. Fourth, chronotype was not accounted for in the analyses and may have influenced our results. However, as participants reported similar bedtimes and wake-up times across groups before and during the 12-week intervention, the potential impact of chronotype on our findings may have been minimized. Participants had only mildly impaired sleep quality at baseline; therefore, whether early, late, or self-selected TRE could benefit individuals with more severe sleep disturbances remains unknown. In addition, we have no information about the napping behavior during the intervention, as participants did not keep napping diaries and were instructed only to register bedtime and wake-up time in the mobile phone application. Nevertheless, self-reported nap data are often subject to recall bias and inconsistencies.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114s3NTZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

It remains largely unknown whether the timing of the eating window during time-restricted eating (TRE) affects sleep, mood, and quality of life differently.

Objective

To investigate whether 3 TRE schedules-an 8-hour eating window in the early part of the day, the late part of the day, or selected by the participant-combined with usual care (UC; a Mediterranean diet education program) were associated with changes in sleep, mood, and quality of life compared with UC alone in adults with overweight or obesity over a 12-week intervention.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a prespecified secondary analysis of a parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted from April 11, 2022, to March 6, 2023, in Granada (southern Spain) and Pamplona (northern Spain). Eligible participants were men and women aged 30 to 60 years with overweight or obesity. Data analyses for the current study were performed between March 14, 2024, and December 5, 2024.

Intervention

Participants in the UC group maintained their usual eating window (≥ 12 hours daily) and received an educational program based on the Mediterranean diet. Participants in the early TRE group had an 8-hour eating window starting before 10 am and the late TRE group, after 1 pm; self-selected TRE participants chose their own 8-hour window. All TRE participants also received the UC educational program. Group allocation was 1:1:1:1.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in sleep were objectively assessed using accelerometry for 2 weeks before the intervention and during the final 2 weeks of the intervention. Changes in mood dimensions-depression, anxiety, and stress-and quality of life were assessed before and after the 12-week intervention using self-administered questionnaires.

Results

A total of 197 participants (98 women [49.7%]; mean [SD] age, 46.1 [8.4] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 32.8 [3.2], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) were randomized to UC (n = 49), early TRE (n = 49), late TRE (n = 52), and self-selected TRE (n = 47). No significant differences were observed between the early TRE and UC groups for sleep (eg, mean difference in total sleep time, 0.2 [95% CI, -0.2 to 0.6] hours), mood (eg, mean difference in Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen score, 0.2 [95% CI, -1.0 to 1.3] points; mean difference in state anxiety score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, -1.2 [95% CI, -6.4 to 4.1] points; mean difference in Perceived Stress Scale score, 2.1 [95% CI, -1.8 to 5.9] points), and quality of life (eg, mean difference in general health score on the Rand 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, 3.3 [95% CI, -4.4 to 10.9] points). Results were also nonsignificant for the late TRE and self-selected TRE groups compared with the UC group as well as between the TRE groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 3 different TRE schedules, incorporating TRE into a UC intervention, regardless of the eating window timing, was not associated with significant changes in sleep, mood, or quality of life compared with UC alone in adults with overweight or obesity. The findings suggest TRE may be a viable nutritional weight management strategy without adverse effects on sleep, mood, or quality of life.

### The role of weight management in the treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112yfKgo]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — evidence synthesis and grading methods are as follows: Random-effects meta-analysis used the DerSimonian and Laird model implemented in Cochrane Review Manager, version 5.3; dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (MD), each with a 95% confidence interval (CI); statistical heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and chi-square, with significant heterogeneity defined as an I2 value greater than or equal to 50% or a chi-square P ≤ 0.05. The panel used the GRADE approach to assess certainty and rated recommendations as either "strong" or "conditional", basing decisions on benefits, burdens/adverse effects, quality of evidence, cost/cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability to patients. No relevant data were identified for two original PICO questions, which were dropped: 1) reduced-calorie diet plus exercise/increased physical activity versus exercise alone in patients with OSA who are overweight or obese, and 2) weight-loss medications versus no weight-loss intervention in patients with OSA who are overweight or obese.

### Is the cost-effectiveness of an early-childhood sleep intervention to prevent obesity affected by socioeconomic position? [^116fmyyk]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether the cost-effectiveness of an infant sleep intervention from the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) trial was influenced by socioeconomic position (SEP).

Methods

An SEP-specific economic evaluation of the sleep intervention was conducted. SEP-specific intervention costs and effects at age 5years, derived from the trial data, were applied to a representative cohort of 4,898 4- to 5-year-old Australian children. Quality-adjusted life years and health care costs were simulated until age 17years using a purpose-built SEP-specific model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and acceptability curves were derived for each SEP group.

Results

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, in Australian dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained, were smaller in the low- ($23,010) and mid-SEP ($18,206) groups compared with the high-SEP group ($31,981). The probability that the intervention was cost-effective was very high in the low- and mid-SEP groups (92%-100%) and moderately high in the high-SEP group (79%).

Conclusions

An infant sleep intervention is more cost-effective in low- and mid-SEP groups compared with high-SEP groups. Targeting this intervention to low-SEP groups would not require trade-offs between efficiency and equity.

### Eating behavior traits and sleep as determinants of weight loss in overweight and obese adults [^115PnUpD]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the associations between eating behavior traits and weight loss according to sleep quality and duration in adults enrolled in common weight-loss interventions.

Methods

Participants included overweight and obese men and women (n = 150) (mean ± s.d. age, 38.8 ± 8.6 years; mean ± s.d. body mass index (BMI), 33.3 ± 3.5kg m(-2)) who were subjected to a dietary intervention over a period of 12–16 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, eating behavior traits (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire), sleep quality (total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score) and sleep duration (hours per night, self-reported from the PSQI) were assessed at both baseline and post intervention. Linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationships between eating behavior traits and changes in anthropometric markers for all subjects and by sleep categories (short sleep: < 7h per night vs recommended sleep: ⩾7h per night; poor sleep quality: ⩾5 PSQI score vs good sleep quality: < 5 PSQI score). We adjusted for age, sex and baseline BMI in analyses.

Results

Baseline eating behavior traits were modest predictors of weight-loss success, but they were all significantly associated with their changes over the weight-loss intervention (P < 0.01). The diet intervention induced significant changes in eating behavior traits and even more for those having a non-favorable eating behavior profile at baseline. We observed that changes in flexible control and strategic dieting behavior were constantly negatively associated with changes in body weight and fat mass (P < 0.05) for recommended duration sleepers. The change in situational susceptibility to disinhibition was positively associated with the change in fat mass and body weight for those having healthy sleeping habits (P < 0.05). For poor quality sleepers, the change in avoidance of fattening foods was negatively associated with changes in adiposity (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Eating behavior traits and sleep may act together to influence the outcome of weight-loss programs.

### Sleep disturbance and changes in energy intake and body composition during weight loss in the POUNDS lost trial [^116BwDeh]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

To examine associations between sleep disturbance and changes in weight and body composition and the mediating role of changes of appetite and food cravings in the Preventing Overweight Using Novel Dietary Strategies (POUNDS Lost) 2-year weight-loss diet intervention trial, this study included 810 overweight or obese individuals with baseline sleep disturbance assessment who were randomly assigned one of four diets varying in macronutrient composition. Changes in body weight and fat distribution were assessed by DEXA and computed tomography during the 2-year intervention. Participants were asked to provide sleep disturbance levels (no, slight, moderate, or great) at baseline and to recall their sleep disturbances since last visit at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Weight loss during the first 6 months was followed by 1.5 years of steady weight regain. Participants with greater sleep disturbance from baseline to 6 months showed significant losses of body weight (Ptrend < 0.001) and waist circumference (Ptrend = 0.002) at 6 months, after multivariate adjustment. Compared with individuals without sleep disturbance at all from baseline to 6 months, those with slight, moderate, or great sleep disturbance showed an elevated risk of failure to lose weight (-5% or more loss) at 6 months, when the maximum weight loss was achieved, with an odds ratio of 1.24 (95% CI 0.87, 1.78), 1.27 (95% CI 0.75, 2.13), or 3.12 (95% CI 1.61, 6.03), respectively. In addition, we observed that the repeatedly measured levels of sleep disturbance over 2 years were inversely associated with the overall weight loss rate (weight changes per 6 months) (Ptrend < 0.001). Further, sleep disturbances during weight loss from baseline to 6 months and weight regain from 6 months to 24 months were significantly predictive of total fat, total fat mass percent, and trunk fat percent changes during the 2 years. Our results also indicated that food cravings for carbohydrates/starches, fast food fats, and sweets; cravings, prospective consumption, hunger of appetite measurements; and dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger subscales measured at 6 months significantly mediated the effects of sleep disturbance on weight loss. In conclusion, our results suggested that more severe sleep disturbance during weight loss was associated with an elevated risk of failure to lose weight during the dietary intervention. Food cravings and eating behaviors may partly mediate these associations.

### Sleep duration and weight loss among overweight / obese women enrolled in a behavioral weight loss program [^1115DgLV]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past several decades, there has been a precipitous rise in the rates of obesity among adults, as well as a concomitant decrease of 1–2 h per night in the average reported sleep duration. Epidemiological and cross-sectional studies have reported an association between short sleep duration and higher body mass index (BMI). Prospective studies examining the relationship between sleep duration and weight are limited, with mixed results emerging from these studies.,

There are few studies examining the relationship between sleep duration and outcomes from weight loss interventions. One recent study reported that baseline sleep duration significantly predicted success in a behavioral weight loss (BWL) program (defined as a weight loss of ⩾10%) but did not predict amount of actual weight loss. In contrast, in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study baseline sleep duration did not predict weight changes over 3 years.

The Finnish DPP study, is the only study we are aware of that examined the effect of participation in a BWL program on sleep duration. Participants in the BWL group who reported sleeping 6.5 h or less at baseline had a significant increase their self-reported sleep by 0.9 h at the 1-year follow-up compared with the group sleeping 7–8.5 h per night at baseline. Conversely, in the control group, at the 1-year follow-up those who reported sleeping 6.5 h or less at baseline had a significant decrease in their self-reported sleep by 1.2 h, and those who reported sleeping 10 h or more at baseline had a significant increase in their self-reported sleep by 0.7 h compared with the group sleeping 7–8.5 h per night at baseline.

### The relationship between multiple sleep dimensions and obesity in adolescents: a systematic review [^114ssQEs]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep is an involuntary behaviour, biologically fundamental to survival and wellbeing. However, sleep is increasingly neglected, with significant health implications. Recent research has identified associations between sleep duration, quality, timing and risk of overweight/obesity in children and adults. The aim of this review was to systematically identify and examine research that investigates the relationships between multiple objective and subjective sleep outcomes and objective adiposity measures in adolescents. A systematic review of literature, published to December 2022, was conducted using ten bibliographic databases. Search terms included objective and subjective sleep/circadian rhythm outcomes, objective adiposity measurements, and adolescents aged 8–18 years. Eighty-nine studies were included in the final review. Sleep outcomes were synthesized into three sleep domains: pre-sleep, during sleep and post-sleep outcomes. In summary, pre-sleep outcomes (including poor sleep hygiene, later chronotype and increased variability and later sleep timings) and increased sleep disturbance are consistently significantly associated with increased obesity and adiposity in adolescents. The relationship between during-sleep outcomes (sleep quality and efficiency) with adiposity and obesity measures was mixed. These findings suggest that adapting an individual's schedule to best suit chronotype preference and improving sleep hygiene, including a consistent bedtime routine, could reduce adiposity and obesity in adolescents.

### The role of weight management in the treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112vW6FJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Exercise/increased physical activity in overweight or obese adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) — evidence and recommendation: In 10 randomized trials comparing exercise versus no exercise or exercise plus reduced-calorie diet versus diet alone, exercise did not cause weight loss by body weight (MD, +2.1 kg; 95% CI, −4.3 to +8.6 kg), BMI (MD, −0.04 kg/m2; 95% CI, −1.7 to +1.6 kg/m2), or neck circumference (MD, +0.4 cm; 95% CI, −1.5 to +2.4 cm), and there were also no changes in the AHI (MD, −0.8 events/h; 95% CI, −13.4 to +11.8 events/h). The only pooled change was improved sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (MD, −2.7; 95% CI, −4.3 to −1.0), which was smaller than the minimal clinically important difference (≥ 3). In single trials, exercise decreased serum glucose and improved depression, fatigue, vigor, vitality, and physical functioning, but overall confidence in these effects was very low due to small trials, risk of bias, and short follow-up. For patients with OSA who are overweight or obese, we suggest exercise/increased physical activity rather than no exercise/increased physical activity, regardless of whether a reduced-calorie diet is added (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the estimated effects).

### The role of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in obesity [^112PqYbV]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Traditional risk factors for obesity and the metabolic syndrome, such as excess energy intake and lack of physical activity, cannot fully explain the high prevalence of these conditions. Insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment predispose individuals to poor metabolic health and promote weight gain and have received increased research attention in the past 10 years. Insufficient sleep is defined as sleeping less than recommended for health benefits, whereas circadian misalignment is defined as wakefulness and food intake occurring when the internal circadian system is promoting sleep. This Review discusses the impact of insufficient sleep and circadian misalignment in humans on appetite hormones (focusing on ghrelin, leptin and peptide-YY), energy expenditure, food intake and choice, and risk of obesity. Some potential strategies to reduce the adverse effects of sleep disruption on metabolic health are provided and future research priorities are highlighted. Millions of individuals worldwide do not obtain sufficient sleep for healthy metabolic functions. Furthermore, modern working patterns, lifestyles and technologies are often not conducive to adequate sleep at times when the internal physiological clock is promoting it (for example, late-night screen time, shift work and nocturnal social activities). Efforts are needed to highlight the importance of optimal sleep and circadian health in the maintenance of metabolic health and body weight regulation.

### Association between sleep quality and weight gain in pregnancy: a cross-sectional study [^1146373s]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sleep difficulties are common during pregnancy, due to anatomical, physiological and psychological changes typical of this stage of life, with emphasis on changes in the breathing pattern. Hormonal changes and the progressive mechanical impediment caused by fetal growth, lead to congestion of the airways and elevation of the diaphragm, impairing breathing and consequently sleep. Sleep deficiency during pregnancy can affect placental development, causing adverse events, such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and premature delivery; the newborn and the infant sleep can also be affected.

The pre-gestational nutritional status and the weight gain during pregnancy have been the focus of several studies, as a result, essential role in gestational outcomes. In this connection, the influence of weight and gestational weight gain on maternal health, gestation time, birth weight and possible pre- and postpartum complications should be included.

Given the above, pre-pregnancy nutritional status, sleep patterns, and gestational weight gain, when addressed individually, may influence perinatal outcomes. There is also evidence of the effect of pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI) and gestational weight gain on sleep duration.

International studies have shown that the BMI indicating excessive weight gain during pregnancy was associated with poor sleep quality at the end of pregnancy and that women with pre-gestational overweight and obesity experienced worse sleep quality when they exceeded the weight gain recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) during the gestational period; in addition those patients had longer labor and greater propensity to cesarean section delivery compared to those who did not experience changes in sleep patterns. In Brazil, research on the relationship between overweight and sleep quality pointed out that a large number of healthy pregnant women have compromised sleep quality and that those with pre-pregnancy overweight have even more impaired sleep than eutrophic women.

### Eating behavior traits and sleep as determinants of weight loss in overweight and obese adults [^111M55Ks]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Results from the present study show that eating behavior traits are related with weight-loss outcome and that sleep quality and duration seem to influence these relationships. Cognitive dietary restraint and its related subscores all increased in response to the diet intervention. Disinhibition and its related subscores all decreased in response to the weight-loss program. Those variations in eating behavior traits are associated with weight-loss success and maintenance. Susceptibility to hunger and its related subcores all diminished as a treatment effect. Those changes benefit weight losers because higher levels of susceptibility to hunger cause a problem for subsequent overconsumption of energy and are positively associated with the level of obesity.

Our results are in agreement with those of Teixeira et al. because baseline eating behavior traits were modest predictors of weight-loss success. This emphasizes the need to consider the effect of the dietary intervention on eating behavior traits to develop strategies for long-term treatment of obesity. Indeed, baseline situational susceptibility to disinhibition was negatively associated with weight-loss outcomes and the change in the latter revealed an opposite trend. One possible explanation might be that individualized dietary advice proposed by the dietician to highly disinhibited individuals at baseline favored higher control over food intake resulting in better compliance to the diet plan. Indeed, the diet intervention induced significant changes in eating behavior traits in the expected direction with weight loss for all participants. There were significant improvements in disinhibition traits for all participants and even more for those having a non-favorable eating behavior profile at baseline. As for cognitive dietary restraint, even though this eating behavior trait increased in response to the intervention, only flexible control predicted adiposity changes.

### Trajectories of night light exposure and risk of overweight and obesity: a 15-year longitudinal cohort study of 218, 239 Chinese children [^1152B6Zj]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for children's health and have rapidly evolved over the past decades to become one of the most pressing global health issues. Between 1985 and 2019, the average weight of adolescents worldwide increased much faster than their height, with China experiencing a particularly rapid increase in body mass index (BMI) among older teenagers. Previous studies have indicated that changes in BMI during school age are closely correlated with the risk of obesity and other metabolic diseases in adulthood, making this a critical period for obesity prevention. A deeper understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to BMI changes during this time is essential for informing effective public health strategies.

The causes of obesity are multifactorial. Alongside diet, exercise, genetics, and early life adversity factors that are currently being well studied, environmental factors, particularly light at night (LAN), have recently garnered attention due to their direct relationship with economic development. A cross-sectional study in 2016 identified LAN as a statistically significant and positive predictor of overweight and obesity, explaining 67% to 73% of the worldwide prevalence of adult overweight and obesity in over 80 countries. As interest in the relationship between LAN and obesity has grown, more population studies have emerged. For example, a cohort study of community-dwelling older adults in the USA found that habitual night light exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Similarly, another large cohort study of 43,722 women in the USA and Puerto Rico reported that exposure to artificial light during night sleep was associated with increased weight, independent of sleep duration, quality, or other sleep-related factors. Smaller studies in younger adults and countries outside the USA, as well as several systematic reviews, have also reported a relationship. However, most of these studies captured LAN exposure at a single time point. To date, little is known about how changes in LAN exposure over time affect BMI, particularly during the school-age years when BMI undergoes rapid development.

To address these knowledge gaps and uncover the long-term effects of LAN on children's BMI, we conducted a large-scale longitudinal study of school-aged children from Guangdong Province, China. Our research aimed to model the trajectories of LAN exposure throughout school years and to analyze variations in BMI levels among children with different LAN exposure profiles. Additionally, we examined the incidence of overweight and obesity among children classified as normal weight at baseline, evaluating how varying levels of LAN exposure influenced their risk of developing these conditions overt time.

### Sleep duration and quality: impact on lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic health: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115UGU2J]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Sleep is increasingly recognized as an important lifestyle contributor to health. However, this has not always been the case, and an increasing number of Americans choose to curtail sleep in favor of other social, leisure, or work-related activities. This has resulted in a decline in average sleep duration over time. Sleep duration, mostly short sleep, and sleep disorders have emerged as being related to adverse cardiometabolic risk, including obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Here, we review the evidence relating sleep duration and sleep disorders to cardiometabolic risk and call for health organizations to include evidence-based sleep recommendations in their guidelines for optimal health.

### Sleep and obesity among children: a systematic review of multiple sleep dimensions [^117Vg9q9]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review highlights a strong importance on assessing sleep as a behavioral factor associated with increased risk of Ow/Ob among primary school aged children across multiple studies set in multiple countries. Out of the 112 reviewed studies, 98 reported a significant association with a dimension of sleep and increased weight status. Supporting findings from previous reviews, the current review found 86 of 103 (83%) studies found a significant negative association between sleep duration and overweight and obesity among children aged between five to thirteen years old. As previously reported, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 this association has been demonstrated cross sectionally as well as longitudinally, using both subjectively and objectively measured duration of children's sleep.

Of particular interest to the current review, is the in‐depth investigation of the association between other dimensions of sleep (namely sleep efficiency, quality, and the timing of both bed and wake times) and Ow/Ob among primary school aged children. Beyond those of previous reviews, the current article highlights that outside the heavily researched influence of the duration of sleep, aspects of the outlined sleep dimensions potentially have significant and independent influence in the sleep‐obesity association.

Compared with sleep duration, we found less evidence of studies examining other dimensions of sleep, such as quality, efficiency and bed/wake times, in attempts to understand the sleep‐obesity relationship. Where studies exist, there is evidence of associations across these additional dimensions on the sleep‐obesity nexus, particularly supporting a positive association with later bed timing and increased weight status. Less consistent findings were found across studies exploring components of sleep efficiency and sleep quality; however, the variations in these findings appear to relate to the inconsistencies of outlined definitions and measurement tools utilized. From previous definitions, sleep efficiency relates to the ease and continuity of initiating and maintaining sleep, while quality surrounds either measurement of specific sleep wave or perceived satisfaction/perceived problems with sleep. 15, 16 The term sleep quality appeared to be used as an interchangeable/overreaching term for many of these aspect of sleep, some which appear more relevant to sleep maintenance/efficiency. Each of the reviewed studies also utilized a unique variation to obtain perceived quality or an overall sleep quality score. The variation in measurement approach and definition of these dimensions creates difficulties in comparing results across the literature. However, despite these discrepancies, this review indicates the importance of considering the influence of different dimensions when examining the sleep‐obesity nexus.

### Higher sleep fragmentation predicts a lower magnitude of weight loss in overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention [^112EzpeB]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, highly fragmented sleep, as revealed by the increased number of WEs on an actigraph, predicted a lower magnitude of weight loss in a sample of overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention. These results support the current view that sleep quality is an important factor contributing to weight reduction and indicate the importance of using objective sleep measures in the assessment of sleep quality.

Several clinical studies with longitudinal designs have found that baseline parameters of sleep can predict the efficacy of a long-term weight-loss intervention program. For example, sleep duration was reported to predict success in an intensive 6-month behavioral weight-loss program in 472 obese adult participants. Thomson et al. examined the baseline measures of sleep duration and quality of 245 overweight or obese women who participated in a 24-month commercial multifaceted weight-loss program, and thereafter, evaluated how sleep parameters assessed by the PSQI affected weight reduction. They found that in addition to the participants who reported sleeping ≤ 7 h per night, those with poor subjective sleep quality were significantly less likely to achieve successful weight loss. These findings suggest that sleep quality and sleep duration can predict the efficacy of long-term weight-loss interventions. However, because some of the sleep parameters were measured by subjective instruments (that is, self-report questionnaires), these sleep measures may be biased by the participants' own perceptions. The current study used actigraphy to assess the effects of sleep quality on weight loss, and the results suggested the importance of using objective sleep measures in addition to subjective ones in the assessment of sleep quality.

### Association of dietary insulin index (DII) and dietary insulin load (DIL) with circadian rhythm and quality of sleep among overweight and obese women: a cross-sectional study [^115SZTqz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a global issue, with over 1.9 billion adults overweight. Disruption of circadian rhythms (CR) leads to obesity and metabolic disorders. Dietary nutrition significantly impacts sleep disorders and disruption in CR, influencing hormones and inflammation, which can contribute to insomnia. The dietary insulin index (DII) and dietary insulin load (DIL) are important factors in determining sleep quality. The current study aims to investigate the association between DII and DIL with CR and sleep quality among with overweight and obesity women.

Methods

A case-control study involved 280 overweight/obese women aged 25–40 from Tehran University Medical Science. They were assessed for dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep using validated questionnaires. The study also assessed body composition, bioelectrical impedance analysis, biochemical components, anthropometric components, and blood pressure. Socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, such as age, educational level, physical activity, and smoking habits, were also assessed through questionnaires.

Result

In the crude and adjustment models, high adherence of DII compared with lower adherence increased the odds of poor sleep quality index among participants. This significant association remained even after adjustment for confounding variables (P < 0.05), such that the odds of poor sleep quality index was 1.92 times higher.

Conclusion

This study showed high adherence to DII and DIL may cause CR disruption. Furthermore, higher adherence to DII lead to poor sleep quality in women.

Despite the variations, understanding the impact of both sleep efficiency and quality of sleep on the sleep‐obesity association should be of interest of future research as some research has indicated this association could be independent from the duration of sleep. 67, 145 Delayed sleep initiation and poor sleep maintenance not only potentially reduce overall sleep duration but can also, as with delayed sleep timing, present available time for snacking. As the length of wake episodes is reportedly more influential on weight status outcomes, rather than simply the number of episodes, 20 it could be suggested that these periods provide opportunity for snacking. Higher caloric intake has been recorded among clinical samples of adults with sleep related eating disorders in America, where higher wake‐episode frequencies were associated with increased snacking after initial sleep onset and overall daily calorie consumption. 146, 147 However, research on this mechanism is limited, particularly among children. Future research would benefit from exploring how time in wake episodes is spent and the impact this might have on the sleep‐obesity nexus.

Furthermore, factors such as reduced sleep duration, later timing and poor sleep maintenance could impact sleep quality, altering hormone levels due to disrupted structure and timing of specific sleep wave cycles. 148 Optimal sleep quality usually involves around four cycles of sleep, through slow wave sleep to REM sleep, which is important for endocrine and metabolic regulation. Kim et al review how impeded sleep quality and disruptions to these sleep cycles has been linked with insulin insensitivity, dysregulation of appetite hormones (leptin and ghrelin), decreased melatonin and metabolic disruption among adults. 148 Sleep curtailment studies among adults have shown altered hormones such as leptin could negatively impact weight status outcomes through altered hunger signals, resulting in higher caloric consumptions. 149 Additionally, disruptions to melatonin have been associated with increased daytime sleepiness among clinical samples of adults and children, 150, 151, 152 which has been shown to influence physical activity levels and increased obesity risk among samples of adults in America 153, 154 and school‐aged children in Japan. 155

In agreeance with a recent review that evaluated the association between sleep quality and obesity among children and young adults, 145 more research is required to explore how these factors impact each other and the sleep‐obesity relationship, along with the need for clarity on defining and assessing these dimensions.

### Update on energy homeostasis and insufficient sleep [^113qJb5D]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Driven by the demands and opportunities of modern life, many people habitually sleep less than 6 h a night. In the sleep clinic, chronic sleep restriction is recognized by the diagnosis of insufficient sleep syndrome (ICSD-9, 307.49–4), which is receiving increased scrutiny as a potential risk to metabolic health. Its relevance for the practicing endocrinologist is highlighted by a stream of epidemiological data that show an association of insufficient sleep with increased incidence of obesity and related morbidities. A central theme of this update is the notion that sleep loss incurs additional metabolic cost, which triggers a set of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and behavioral adaptations aimed at increasing food intake and conserving energy. Although this coordinated response may have evolved to offset the metabolic demands of extended wakefulness in natural habitats with limited food availability, it can be maladaptive in the context of a modern environment that allows many to overeat while maintaining a sedentary lifestyle without sufficient sleep. Importantly, such sleep loss-related metabolic adaptation may undermine the success of behavioral interventions based on reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity to lower metabolic risk in obesity-prone individuals. This emerging perspective is based on data from recently published human interventional studies and requires further experimental support. Nevertheless, it now seems prudent to recommend that overweight and obese individuals attempting to reduce their caloric intake and maintain increased physical activity should obtain adequate sleep and, if needed, seek effective treatment for any coexisting sleep disorders.

### Eating behavior traits and sleep as determinants of weight loss in overweight and obese adults [^115dxYMf]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

This study is the first one to simultaneously examine the relationships between eating behaviors, sleep and adiposity loss. Although replication studies are clearly needed to confirm the observed findings, our results suggest that eating and sleeping may interact together to predict the outcome of weight-loss programs. One must nevertheless keep in mind that most significant associations reported in the present study had coefficients of correlation ranging between 0.2 and 0.3, suggesting that they explain a small part of the variability in the related variables. However, this is generally the case in the fields of obesity and nutrition because many factors are at play. Despite small effect sizes, we believe that more attention should be paid to eating behaviors and sleep hygiene during weight loss to maximize success.

Our results need to be interpreted in light of the following limitations. First, the small sample size and exploratory nature of this investigation preclude any definitive conclusion about the interconnections between eating behaviors, sleeping habits and fat loss. Second, the results come from a pool of four different weight-loss interventions with slightly different aims and interventions; the idea explored in the present study was thus a retrospective analysis. For example, the pre-post study design does not include a control group (i.e. individuals reviewed on a regular basis but with no instructions provided). Third, we have to keep in mind the limitations of self-reported measures as well as the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured variables. Fourth, the present study only allows for the identification of associations and does not permit causal inferences. Fifth, other dimensions of sleep (e.g. timing, architecture, consistency and continuity) have not been assessed and could be related to eating behaviors and adiposity loss. Likewise, obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis or daytime sleepiness were not available and could have provided relevant information. Sixth, the PSQI covers sleep quality over the month prior to administration, suggesting that the PSQI performed at the end of the weight-loss program covers sleep during part of the intervention. Seventh, we did not control for stress, personality traits and depression, which might be pertinent targets for health-care professionals as they seem to be important determinants of weight-loss success. Finally, the external generalizability is limited to the sample studied.

### Sleep and obesity in children and adolescents [^117H6mH2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive update of epidemiologic studies that have assessed the association between sleep and obesity risk. Data suggest that short sleep is associated with an increased risk for being or becoming overweight/obese or having increased body fat. Late bedtimes are also a risk factor for overweight/obesity. Findings also suggest that changes in eating pathways may lead to increased body fat. Future experimental studies are needed to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which sleep may play a role in the development and maintenance of childhood obesity.

### Higher sleep fragmentation predicts a lower magnitude of weight loss in overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention [^113qN2Rj]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, baseline measures of sleep fragmentation may predict the magnitude of weight reduction in weight-loss interventions. Clearly, further studies are needed to clarify whether or not improving sleep quality may actually increase the body's efficiency in weight reduction. Such studies could facilitate the development of novel strategies to tackle the pervasive problem of obesity.

### Effect of sleep on weight loss and adherence to diet and physical activity recommendations during an 18-month behavioral weight loss intervention [^115RWdwC]. International Journal of Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To examine the association between indices of sleep quantity and quality with dietary adherence, physical activity adherence, and weight loss during a behavioral weight loss intervention.

Methods

Adults (n = 156) with overweight and obesity (40 ± 9 years, 84% female, BMI: 34.4 ± 4.2kg/m 2) participated in an 18-month behavioral weight loss intervention which prescribed a reduced calorie diet (1200–1800 kcal/d) and increased physical activity (300min/wk). Body weight, indices of sleep (SenseWear armband; SWA), energy intake (EI, 3-day food records), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (SWA) were measured at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Linear mixed effects models examined the association between sleep and weight change over time. Additional models were adjusted for covariates including age, BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, study completion, randomization, EI, and physical activity. Secondary analyses examined the association between sleep and adherence to diet and physical activity recommendations.

Results

Mean weight loss was 7.7 ± 5.4, 8.4 ± 7.9, and 7.1 ± 9.0kg at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively. Lower sleep efficiency, higher wake after sleep onset (WASO), more awakenings, and higher sleep onset latency (SOL) were significantly associated with attenuated weight loss (p < 0.05). Lower sleep efficiency, more awakenings, and higher SOL remained significantly associated with blunted weight loss after adjustment for covariates (p < 0.05). Later waketime, longer time in bed, longer sleep duration, higher WASO, more awakenings, and higher SOL were associated with lower odds of achieving ≥ 300min/wk of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, adjusted for covariates (FDR p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Future studies should evaluate whether incorporating strategies to improve sleep health within a behavioral weight loss intervention leads to improved adherence to diet and physical activity recommendations and enhanced weight loss.

AACE 2023 complications-centric model for persons with overweight/obesity — lifestyle intervention is the essential foundation for management of persons with overweight and type 2 diabetes; beyond nutrition, weight loss, and exercise, plans should include assessment, counseling, and intervention for sleep hygiene and sleep disorders, promotion of healthy habits, moderation of alcohol intake, and cessation of smoking.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^111bzAju]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Findings from the present secondary analysis suggest that incorporating TRE into the UC intervention, regardless of the timing of the eating window, did not lead to additional changes in sleep, mood, or quality of life compared with UC alone (eating schedule ≥ 12 hours) in men and women with overweight or obesity. Although women are commonly more prone to sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, stress, and lower quality of life than men, the TRE intervention did not appear to influence these variables across any of the TRE groups in our study. We found that TRE, irrespective of the eating window timing, was not associated with adverse effects on sleep, mood, or quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity, suggesting it may be a safe weight-management nutritional strategy. Further research is needed to explore the broader health effects of different TRE schedules, particularly in populations with specific sleep disturbances (eg, shift workers) or mood disorders (eg, depression, anxiety, and stress) as well as in individuals with different chronotypes and those with chronic diseases, where metabolic and circadian factors may play a distinct role.

### Can healthy sleep improve long-term bariatric surgery outcomes? Results of a pilot study and call for further research [^1143BioL]. Obesity (2019). Medium credibility.

Healthy sleep is associated with lower body weight and could improve and sustain weight loss following bariatric surgery. To support this premise, preliminary data on the relation between sleep duration and quality and long-term weight change in a subsample of participants from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery are presented. Results indicate a relation between sleep duration and BMI and percent weight loss 9 years after surgery. Additionally, sleep quality explained 25% of the variance in weight change between 6- and 9-year follow-up visits. These data from a small exploratory study, in combination with the known effects of sleep on energy balance, suggest that sleep may play an important role in both immediate and sustained weight loss following bariatric surgery. Herein, a model of the proposed bidirectional relation between sleep and weight loss is presented as well as a call for systematic investigations of the influence of sleep on long-term weight management following bariatric surgery.

### Childhood sleep and obesity risk: a prospective cohort study of 10 000 Swedish children [^111EFeLo]. Pediatric Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify factors affecting early childhood sleep, and investigate the relationship between sleep and overweight/obesity in childhood.

Study Design

Data were collected using parental-completed questionnaires from N = 10.840 one-year-old children in the prospective ABIS-study (All Babies in Southeast Sweden), followed up until 8years of age. Chi-squared test and Pearson Correlation were used to assess the relationship between covariates affecting the children's sleep. Subsequently, longitudinal mixed model analyses were used to predict the effect of different sleep dimensions (bedtime, sleep duration, sleep quality, and the number of awakenings) on BMI Z-scores.

Results

Children to parents born in Sweden, parents with higher education, non-single parents, non-smoking mothers during pregnancy, and children with fewer siblings, were more likely to have appropriate sleep habits at 1year age. A greater number of awakenings and nocturnal feeds, and particularly later bedtime (β = -0.544, p < 0.0001) were linked to shorter sleep duration. Sleep duration early in life was negatively associated with BMI Z-scores (adjusted effect estimate [95% CI]: β = -0.09, [(-0.15) - (-0.03)], p = 0.005) later. In addition, higher birth weight, small size for gestational age, unhealthy food habits, children of mothers who smoked during pregnancy, and higher parental BMI resulted in higher BMI Z-scores.

Conclusion

The child's BMI Z-score increases by 0.09units with every hour shorter sleep duration, indicating that short sleep duration might increase the risk of overweight and obesity in children. Parental educational interventions advising appropriate sleeping patterns should be considered when implementing strategies to combat the development of childhood obesity.

### Sleep duration and quality: impact on lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic health: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^112M3ZKc]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Sleep restriction and body weight — short- and longer-term trials: Short-term ad libitum-feeding studies report weight gain, including an increase of 0.4 kg in women when sleep was restricted from > 8 h/night to 4 h/night over 4 nights, and weight gain over a 5-night period of 5 hours in bed relative to 9 hours in normal-weight adults. In a 2-arm study, restriction to 4 h/night for 5 nights led to greater weight gain than an 8-hour sleep opportunity, with larger gains in men than women and in blacks compared with whites. Longer-term studies showed no difference in body weight with a 5.5-hour versus 8.5 hours sleep opportunity for 14 days, or after 3 weeks of a 1.5-hour restriction relative to habitual sleep; in the latter, weight was initially reduced during sleep restriction and returned to baseline between weeks 2 and 3. In a controlled-feeding, 14-day crossover weight-loss study, participants lost more fat-free mass and less fat mass during sleep restriction than with an 8-hour sleep opportunity. Overall, sleep restriction increases energy intake without adequate compensatory energy expenditure, yielding a positive energy balance with increased food intake, particularly from fat and snacks, at least in the short term.

### Eating behavior traits and sleep as determinants of weight loss in overweight and obese adults [^114XC78p]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, sleep may modulate eating behavior in adults involved in different dietary interventions and may act together to influence the outcome of weight-loss programs. Although replication studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings, one must remember that multiple factors can impact the success of weight-loss programs. In particular, dietary practitioners should explore sleep hygiene and eating behavior traits as part of their overall assessment before prescribing any dietary plan if they want to improve the effectiveness of their intervention.

### Obesity: novel and unusual predisposing factors [^112LRfLY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

To optimize success of weight-loss strategies through changes in diet and physical activity, and success of maintenance of body weight following initial weight loss, it is imperative that we optimize sleep sufficiency within the populace. In our opinion, to achieve this will require multifactorial changes, including cultural beliefs regarding the importance of sleep, education of the populace regarding the importance of sleep and strategies to optimize sleep quality, particularly for our children. Our sleeping environments need optimization, with limitation of noise and light. Furthermore, it is known that the body needs to cool prior to sleep, therefore a cool bedroom temperature is important. (We discuss further the impact of ambient environmental temperature on metabolic rate below). Finally, our daily routines need modification to facilitate sleep. This includes avoidance of food, exercise, blue and bright light in the hour before sleep for example. Employers should adopt an appreciation for the importance of sleep, especially within profit-driven commercial corporations. Through avoidance of sleep deprivation, enhanced wellbeing of employees would likely translate into improved work ethic and efficiency. Finally, there is a need for more sleep-based research generally, including exploration of the importance of sleep sufficiency for maintenance of weight following weight loss.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114UsDr5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our results align with previous research on the effect of different TRE schedules on sleep, and concur with a recently published 6-month TRE trial in adults with type 2 diabetes. In brief, that RCT found that mid-to-late TRE (ie, 12to 8) did not lead to statistically significant differences in sleep duration or quality, as assessed using the PSQI, compared with both a caloric restriction group (25% energy restriction daily) and a control group instructed to maintain usual eating and daily routines. Similarly, an exploratory RCT found no significant differences in sleep quality changes, as assessed by the PSQI, between early TRE (eating window from 8to 4), late TRE (12to 8), either early or late TRE combined with caloric restriction, and a caloric restriction–only group (eating window from 8to 8) over an 8-week intervention in adults with overweight or obesity. A 4-week pilot trial conducted in our laboratory compared the effects of early, late, and self-selected TRE on sleep quality, as assessed by the PSQI, and found no significant differences across TRE groups in a sample of 22 adults with overweight or obesity. While it could be hypothesized that earlier eating windows may improve sleep by advancing sleep timingand better alignment of meal timing with circadian rhythms (thereby reducing melatonin-insulin interference, enhancing nighttime glucose regulation, and promoting satiety), the current evidence is inconclusive. In this study, there was no significant difference in the number of nights sleeping 7 hours or more, which is a marker of improved sleep health, in the early TRE group compared with the UC group and the late TRE group; however, while the differences between groups were not statistically significant, the observed pattern may warrant further investigation in future studies exploring the potential effects of early TRE on sleep health. Recent systematic reviews have either found no consistent association of early or late TRE with sleep or reported a lack of consensus, due to the limited number of studies investigating the mechanisms by which TRE may influence sleep and the significant variability in study designs. Although our team observed that the early TRE group exhibited reductions of approximately 6 mg/dL in fasting glucose and 9 mg/dL in nocturnal glucose levels compared with the UC, late TRE, and self-selected TRE groups, melatonin-insulin interference was not assessed, which may further elucidate the role of insulin and glycemic regulation in sleep outcomes. Of note is that participants in the trial did not receive sleep hygiene counseling and were allowed to consume noncaloric caffeinated beverages during the fasting windows, which could have influenced results. Therefore, future TRE trials incorporating behavioral interventions to improve sleep are warranted.

### Higher sleep fragmentation predicts a lower magnitude of weight loss in overweight and obese women participating in a weight-loss intervention [^116yLsej]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

It is clear that quantitative and qualitative aspects of sleep have profound effects on weight regulation. However, knowledge of how, and to what extent sleep disturbances affect weight regulation is inconclusive. There are a considerable number of discrepancies in study results based on subjective and objective parameters. To date, there are no studies that have reported the effects of objective sleep parameters on weight reduction in a weight-loss intervention program for obese people. If the effect of sleep on weight regulation can be measured before treatment, it should provide a useful tool for weight-loss intervention.

The aim of this study was to determine if objective and subjective sleep-related parameters at baseline predict the magnitude of weight loss in a sample of overweight and obese women, following a weight-loss intervention program.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113UU3zv]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is often associated with insufficient sleep, increased mood disturbances, and a lower quality of life. Caloric restriction programs leading to body weight loss appear to improve sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with excessive adiposity. However, long-term adherence to caloric restriction interventions remains limited, and weight regain after short-term loss is associated with poor sleep, mood disorder, and lower quality of life.

Time-restricted eating (TRE) has emerged as a promising nutritional strategy for weight loss, allowing ad libitum food intake within a limited eating window of 4 to 10 hours per day, followed by fasting for the remaining 14 to 20 hours.TRE has been associated with unintentional reduction of energy intake, inducing subsequent weight loss and modest improvements in cardiometabolic health, which could lead to improvements in sleep, mood, and quality of life. Concerns remain that limiting eating to 4 to 10 hours per day may increase intake of energy-dense foods and caffeine to boost energy, potentially disrupting sleep, mood, and quality of life. However, it remains uncertain whether the timing of the eating window could differently impact sleep, mood, and quality of life.

Earlier eating windows may improve sleep by aligning meal timing with the body's natural circadian rhythms. Eating earlier in the day reduces the overlap between meal times and the body's melatonin production, which typically increases in the evening to signal the onset of sleep. This alignment may improve nighttime glycemic control by reducing melatonin-insulin interference. Early meals can also enhance satiety and reduce late-night eating, associated with disrupted sleep and postprandial hyperglycemia. These factors may contribute to better overall sleep efficiency. Preliminary evidence suggests that TRE does not adversely affect sleep quality in adults with overweight or obesity, yet the timing of the eating window may influence these findings, as studies have varied in their use of early TRE windows (eg, 7to 3or 10to 6), late TRE windows (eg, 12to 8), or self-selected TRE windows.

### Sleep loss and sleepiness: current issues [^115MuT2s]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Awareness of the consequences of sleep loss and its implications for public health and safety is increasing. Sleep loss has been shown to generally impair the entire spectrum of mental abilities, ranging from simple psychomotor performance to executive mental functions. Sleep loss may also impact metabolism in a manner that contributes to obesity and its attendant health consequences. Although objective measures of alertness and performance remain degraded, individuals subjectively habituate to chronic partial sleep loss (eg, sleep restriction), and recovery from this type of sleep loss is slow, factors that may help to explain the observation that many individuals in the general population are chronically sleep restricted. Individual differences in habitual sleep duration appear to be a trait-like characteristic that is determined by several factors, including genetic polymorphisms.

### Sleep and obesity among children: a systematic review of multiple sleep dimensions [^117L9bQg]. Pediatric Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Beyond the prominent focus of children's sleep duration on the sleep‐obesity association of previous reviews, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 there is emerging literature for each of these additional dimensions. For example Jarrin et al studied 240 Canadian children and adolescents (aged 8‐17 years) and found that, independent of self‐reported sleep duration, children with delayed sleep timing (late to bed and late to wake) related to a higher risk of being affected by overweight and obesity relative to early to bed/wake counterparts. 18 An Australian study found later bedtimes were linked with higher body mass index (BMI) z‐scores and lower diet quality scores regardless of self‐reported wake time. 19 Sleep quality and sleep efficiency have also been highlighted as important dimensions of sleep associated with overweight and obesity risk among children. 20, 21, 22 Lui et al used polysomnography (PSG) to analyze sleep quality by recording stages of sleep among a sample of American children and adolescents (7‐17 years). It is suggested that nonrapid eye movement (REM) sleep could be an important stage of sleep for endocrine and metabolic regulation as reduced REM was associated with higher BMI z‐scores. 23 Furthermore, the authors also reported that higher sleep efficiency (determined by the percentage of time spent asleep between sleep onset to wake time, measured via PSG) was a significant dimension of sleep associated with reduced risk of overweight and obesity. 23 While PSG is considered the gold standard for measuring multiple sleep components, it is quite invasive and costly and therefore not always practical for use in larger samples. 24 Self‐reported proxies for sleep quality and efficiency have therefore often been used, with results appearing to support those from more objective measures. Studies have reported that those with lower self‐perceived sleep quality (ie, less likely to report sleeping "well") or lower perceived sleep efficiency (reported issues around waking up during the night or issues falling asleep) are more likely to experiences poorer weight status outcomes. 25

### A 12-month weight loss intervention in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea: is timing important? A step wedge randomised trial [^115TxjhP]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) share a complex and bi-directional relationship making simultaneous treatment of both at an individual level, challenging. Excess weight, in particular in the abdominal and upper airway regions, contributes both to OSA aetiology and progression of symptoms. The fragmented sleep associated with OSA may contribute to reinforcing the obese state due to adverse alterations in eating behaviours including increased appetite as well as reductions in both satiety and physical activity.

The first line treatment in adults newly diagnosed with moderate-severe OSA is continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP). However, adherence after CPAP initiation can decline rapidly, with non-adherence rates as low as 38% six-months after treatment initiation, and individual mean usage as low as 50% in the long term. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that lifestyle interventions can improve OSA severity with a mean reduction in apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) and BMI of 9 events/hr and 2.46 kg/m 2, respectively. As such, current guidelines recommend weight loss in conjunction with CPAP use for the treatment of OSA in those above a healthy weight. In 2019, a meta-analysis revealed only three randomised controlled trials which had assessed the efficacy of CPAP in conjunction with a lifestyle intervention in adults with moderate-severe OSA and obesity. Whilst reporting reductions in both AHI (−8.7 events/hr) and BMI (−3.5 kg/m 2), two of the studies were of short duration (≤ 9 weeks) and none included a post-intervention follow-up period.

### Eating behavior traits and sleep as determinants of weight loss in overweight and obese adults [^116BxpYF]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Objective:

To examine the associations between eating behavior traits and weight loss according to sleep quality and duration in adults enrolled in common weight-loss interventions.

Methods:

Participants included overweight and obese men and women (n = 150) (mean ± s.d. age, 38.8 ± 8.6 years; mean ± s.d. body mass index (BMI), 33.3 ± 3.5 kg m −2) who were subjected to a dietary intervention over a period of 12–16 weeks. Anthropometric measurements, eating behavior traits (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire), sleep quality (total Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score) and sleep duration (hours per night, self-reported from the PSQI) were assessed at both baseline and post intervention. Linear regression analysis was used to quantify the relationships between eating behavior traits and changes in anthropometric markers for all subjects and by sleep categories (short sleep: < 7 h per night vs recommended sleep: ⩾7 h per night; poor sleep quality: ⩾5 PSQI score vs good sleep quality: < 5 PSQI score). We adjusted for age, sex and baseline BMI in analyses.

Results:

Baseline eating behavior traits were modest predictors of weight-loss success, but they were all significantly associated with their changes over the weight-loss intervention (P < 0.01). The diet intervention induced significant changes in eating behavior traits and even more for those having a non-favorable eating behavior profile at baseline. We observed that changes in flexible control and strategic dieting behavior were constantly negatively associated with changes in body weight and fat mass (P < 0.05) for recommended duration sleepers. The change in situational susceptibility to disinhibition was positively associated with the change in fat mass and body weight for those having healthy sleeping habits (P < 0.05). For poor quality sleepers, the change in avoidance of fattening foods was negatively associated with changes in adiposity (P < 0.05).

Conclusion:

Eating behavior traits and sleep may act together to influence the outcome of weight-loss programs.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116yz3BS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — sleep patterns and obesity risk — 3.4 We suggest fostering healthy sleep patterns in children and adolescents to decrease the likelihood of developing obesity due to changes in caloric intake and metabolism related to disordered sleep. (2|⊕⊕○○) Evidence on the page notes that disordered sleep length and quality in adults, children, and adolescents affects appetite and decreases insulin sensitivity, Table 4 lists 8 studies showing how different sleep durations or changes in sleep duration affect dietary intake in children and adolescents, and these results suggest that sleep duration affects obesity development, although 2 other studies challenge these findings, weakening the strength of the evidence. The values statement adds that The National Sleep Foundation recommends 8 to 11 hours of sleep for school age children and adolescents.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115gqsj9]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Regarding mood, we observed that a 12-week TRE intervention, irrespective of the eating window timing, was not associated with significant changes in depression, anxiety, or stress compared with UC in men and women with overweight or obesity. Our findings align with current literature, indicating that TRE seems to be a valid nutritional strategy for obesity management without apparent adverse effects on mood in adults with obesity. Similarly, the 12-week TRE intervention, regardless of the eating window timing, was not associated with additional changes in quality of life compared with UC in men and women with overweight or obesity. A longer 12-month RCT comparing an 8-hour TRE window (ie, 12to 8) with a caloric restriction group (25% energy restriction daily) and a control group that was instructed to maintain their usual eating and daily habits found no significant differences between groups in quality of life. Thus, it can be suggested that a TRE intervention may not provide superior benefits to or detrimental effects on quality of life compared with other nutrition-based obesity management strategies, such as caloric restriction or Mediterranean dietary pattern–based education programs. Although the TRE groups achieved greater body weight loss than the UC group, the amount lost may have been insufficient to elicit significant changes in sleep, mood, and quality of life. Additionally, the duration of the intervention might have been too short to detect such differences. Further, longer trials are required to confirm these findings.

### Insufficient sleep and obesity: cause or consequence [^113jLB2W]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

SLEEP EXTENSION

Extending sleep duration in people who have chronic sleep insufficiency may reverse some of the deleterious consequences of sleep loss. However, the effect of sleep extension on food intake and body weight is not clear because of conflicting results from studies that have reported decreases in appetite and sugar intake or no effect on appetite, diet selection, appetitive hormones, energy expenditure, and body weight. The reason for the discordance in outcomes among studies is not clear but it could be related to the amount of the increase in sleep duration. It is possible that the clinical benefits of sleep extension require a minimum threshold of daily sleep of at least 6 h/night. In a recently completed randomized controlled clinical trial, the effects of increasing sleep duration to 8.5 h/night for 2 weeks were evaluated in people with overweight who habitually slept less than 6.5 h/night. During sleep extension, participants reduced their estimated daily energy intake by 270 kcal, without a measurable change in total energy expenditure (assessed by using the doubly labeled water technique), resulting in a small (0.5 kg), but statistically significant, decrease in body weight.

### Is sleep education an effective tool for sleep improvement and minimizing metabolic disturbance and obesity in adolescents? [^113fMP1b]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The prevalence of childhood obesity has increased significantly in recent years. Obesity is associated with a range of adverse physiological, psychological and social outcomes and places a huge economical burden on healthcare systems around the world. Insufficient sleep duration is common in adolescents and exacerbated by contemporary lifestyles, but may be a contributor to obesity onset and metabolic disruption. We briefly review the current evidence surrounding the associations between sleep and obesity as well as diabetes. Sleep improvement programs have been suggested as a potential avenue to raise awareness of the importance of sleep and ultimately enhance sleep behaviors/routines. A review of the current literature supporting the efficacy of such programs is tentative. Furthermore, very few studies have investigated if sleep enhancement has downstream positive effects on metabolic function or body weight in adolescents. We highlight biological and social factors that intensify sleep loss in adolescents and recommend that these be targeted components in future interventions aimed at improving adolescent sleep.

### Insufficient sleep and obesity: cause or consequence [^1141hwK7]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Acute insufficient sleep combined with ad libitum access to food increases energy expenditure, food intake, and body weight in people who are lean. However, the long‐term effects of experimental sleep restriction (> 3 weeks) on the risk of developing obesity are not known. In addition, we are not aware of studies that have evaluated the effect of experimental sleep restriction without dietary manipulations on body weight, hunger and appetite, or neuroendocrine hormones in people with overweight or obesity. Additional studies are needed to do the following: 1) evaluate the effect of longer duration sleep restriction and reduced sleep quality on energy balance and body composition; 2) determine the effect of experimental sleep restriction on body weight in people with overweight/obesity; 3) provide a better understanding of the importance of reduced sleep quality in the pathogenesis of obesity; 4) provide a better understanding of the potential health benefits of sleep extension in people with obesity and chronic sleep insufficiency; and 5) determine whether optimizing sleep as part of a weight management program enhances weight loss.

### Time-restricted eating and sleep, mood, and quality of life in adults with overweight or obesity: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113EPRm3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The impact of the eating window timing on mood and quality of life remains unclear. Women are more susceptible to sleep disturbances, mood disorders, and reduced quality of life, underscoring the need to consider sex when assessing the impact of weight loss interventions on these outcomes. Previous trials had notable limitations, including small sample sizes, short durations (≤ 8 weeks), and/or underrepresentation of women. Therefore, our team conducted a 12-week randomized clinical trial (RCT)including both sexes and objectively assessed sleep using actigraphy, unlike other studies that relied on subjective measures.,

Our team's trial showed that early, late, and self-selected TRE groups led to approximately 3 kg greater body weight loss than usual care (UC) over 12 weeks, with no significant differences among TRE groups and high adherence (85%-88%). In this study, we investigated whether the 3 different TRE schedules — early, late, and self-selected — combined with UC (a Mediterranean diet education program) compared with UC alone were associated with changes in sleep, mood, and quality of life among men and women with overweight or obesity. We hypothesized that early TRE could improve sleep by aligning meal timing with circadian rhythms, whereas late TRE may disrupt this alignment, limiting benefits to sleep, mood, and quality of life.

### Sleep duration and quality: impact on lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic health: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115jUw44]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Behavioral weight loss interventions in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) reduced AHI and sometimes resolved disease: a very-low-calorie diet achieving a 20-kg (95% CI, 18–21) weight loss lowered AHI at 9 weeks (–25 ± 17 events/h) versus usual diet controls (–2 ± 11 events/h), with improvements maintained at 52 weeks (–17 events/hour; 95% CI, –13 to –21 events/h); 10% achieved complete resolution of OSA at 12 months and 48% no longer required continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); greater AHI reductions occurred in severe OSA (AHI > 30 events/h) (–38 events/h) than in moderate OSA (–12 events/h); in an ancillary LookAHEAD trial, intensive lifestyle intervention reduced AHI by –9.7 ± 2, –8 ± 2, and –7.7 ± 2.3 events/ h at 12, 24, and 48 months, with complete resolution of OSA being 5 times more likely versus control; in mild OSA (AHI = 5–15 events/h), a 12-week very-low-calorie diet plus lifestyle counseling versus counseling alone (n = 26 each) created a 5.4kg/m2 body mass index difference but no significant difference in AHI.

### Effect of sleep extension on objectively assessed energy intake among adults with overweight in real-life settings: a randomized clinical trial [^112rQKHi]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study Home Sleep and Metabolism was published by Esra Tasali and colleagues in 2022 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity and Insomnia. In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the trial question was: what is the effect of sleep extension among adults with overweight who habitually decreased their sleep duration? In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the population was: 80 patients (39 female, 41 male). The inclusion criteria were overweight adults with habitual sleep duration < 6.5 hours per night. The key exclusion criteria were obstructive sleep apnea; insomnia or history of any other sleep disorder; night shift; rotating shift work; patients following a weight-loss regimen. In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the interventions were: n = 40 sleep extension (sleep hygiene counseling aiming to extend sleep duration to 8.5 hours for 2 weeks) n = 40 habitual sleep (continued habitual sleep without intervention for 2 weeks). In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in energy intake (-155.5 kcal/d vs. 114.9 kcal/d; AD -270.4 kcal/d, 95% CI -393.4 to -147.4). In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in total energy expenditure (-46.7 kcal/d vs. 7.2 kcal/d; AD -53.9 kcal/d, 95% CI -134.9 to 27.1) Significant decrease in weight (-0.48 kg vs. 0.39 kg; AD -0.87 kg, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.35) Significant decrease in fat-free mass (-0.36 kg vs. 0.26 kg; AD -0.62 kg, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.23). In the Home Sleep and Metabolism study, the conclusion was: in overweight adults with habitual sleep duration < 6.5 hours per night, sleep extension was superior to habitual sleep with respect to energy intake.

### Effect of sleep extension on objectively assessed energy intake among adults with overweight in real-life settings: a randomized clinical trial [^112KJn6J]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The findings of decreased energy intake, negative energy balance, and weight reduction resulting from sleep extension are in agreement with the findings of short-term laboratory sleep-restriction studies showing increased energy intake and weight gainas well as the findings of prospective epidemiologic studies linking sleep restriction to obesity risk. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled laboratory studies found that short-term sleep restriction over 1 to 14 days of duration in healthy individuals was associated with increases of mean energy intake by approximately 253 kcal/d, as assessed during a single meal. Another meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found that the risk of obesity increased by 9% for each 1-hour decrease in sleep duration. We did not observe a statistically significant change in total energy expenditure by doubly labeled water method or mean daytime activity counts by actigraphy (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Although some laboratory sleep-restriction studies reported an increase in total energy expenditure of approximately 92 to 111 kcal/d, using a whole-room calorimeter, other studies observed no change. We found a modest reduction in weight after sleep extension, and the composition of weight change was primarily in fat-free mass, which is consistent with the short-term changes in body composition. If sleep is extended over longer periods, weight loss in the form of fat mass would likely increase over time. A few observations suggest that sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night is associated with greater success in weight loss interventions.,

In this RCT, we found an overall increase in objective sleep duration of approximately 1.2 hours in participants who habitually slept less than 6.5 hours per night. The change in sleep duration from baseline varied between participants and from night to night in the real-life setting. Overall, the sleep extension group compared with the control group had significantly higher subjective scores in obtaining sufficient sleep, with more daytime energy and alertness and better mood (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Similar to a previous study of sleep extension, the present RCT used an individualized counseling approach. Another study used bedtime extension in habitual short sleepers in real-life conditions but obtained variable benefits on sleep, likely because of a lack of an individualized approach or appropriate blinding. None of these previous studies objectively measured energy intake.

### The role of weight management in the treatment of adult obstructive sleep apnea. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111Vkt3c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea comprehensive lifestyle interventions — In adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who are overweight or obese, comprehensive lifestyle interventions combining reduced-calorie diet, exercise/increased physical activity, and behavioral modifications were associated with reduced OSA severity and daytime sleepiness, with pooled effects showing change in apnea–hypopnea index (AHI): MD, −8.5 events/h; 95% CI, −10.8 to −6.3 events/h and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS): MD, −2.4 points; 95% CI, −5.4 to −0.5 points. Notably, the decrease in AHI correlated with the magnitude of weight loss. Additional single-trial outcomes included increased resolution of OSA (defined as AHI ≤ 5 events/h at end of study) 57.1% vs. 30.6% (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.06–3.31), reduced snoring (MD, 7.2 points; 95% CI, 1.4 to 13.1 points), and reduced neck circumference (MD, −1.3 cm; 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.8 cm). The panel's confidence in the estimated effects ranged from very low to moderate; conclusions state these interventions are associated with numerous desirable consequences and no significant demonstrable harm, while the impact on quality of life and glucose control was uncertain owing to inconsistent results.

### Sleep deprivation and obesity in adults: a brief narrative review [^114fGdyP]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sleep deprivation occurs when an individual's biological sleep need is not met. In epidemiological studies, definitions vary, but sleep deprivation is typically considered obtaining less than 7 hours of sleep. There are numerous studies in the scientific literature that suggest that sleep deprivation has metabolic effects that predispose to weight gain. Currently, developed nations are facing an epidemic of obesity. For example, the prevalence of obesity in the USA increased from 22.9% in 1988–1994 to 37.7% in 2013–2014. By 2014, the rate of obesity had reached 35.0% among adult men and 40.4% among adult women. Also, data indicate that the adult population in the USA is getting less sleep, and a significant proportion receives less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night. In 1998, 26% of people reported sleeping less than 8 hours, whereas in 2005, the proportion was 35%. In the National Health Interview survey of 110 442 civilian employed workers between 2004 and 2007, the weighted prevalence of self-reported short sleep duration, defined as ≤ 6 hours per day, was 29.9%.
