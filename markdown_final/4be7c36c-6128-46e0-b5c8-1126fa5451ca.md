## Question

Is Gilbert's a contraindication to paxlovid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Gilbert's syndrome is a contraindication to Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) and how to manage it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Gilbert's syndrome is and how it affects drug metabolism. Then, I should verify Paxlovid's hepatic safety profile and labeled contraindications. Next, I will check whether any guideline or label explicitly lists Gilbert's as a contraindication. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility for harm or benefit. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with monitoring and drug–drug interaction screening, anchoring to FDA labeling and IDSA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Gilbert's syndrome is a benign, inherited deficiency of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) that causes mild, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, typically without cholestasis or hepatocellular injury, and it is generally not associated with clinically significant liver dysfunction or fibrosis in the absence of other disease, though it can confound interpretation of some liver-based biomarkers [^114dZipN] [^112t2hog].

> Now, I need to verify Paxlovid's hepatic guidance. The FDA labeling states no dosage adjustment is needed in mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, but Paxlovid is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) due to lack of data. Importantly, there is no mention of Gilbert's syndrome as a contraindication or as requiring dose modification [^1165D6z4] [^116oPo2D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm whether any authoritative source lists Gilbert's as a contraindication. I will now examine the FDA contraindications and IDSA drug–drug interaction tables. Neither the FDA label nor IDSA guidance lists Gilbert's syndrome among contraindications or special precautions, which instead focus on severe hepatic impairment, hypersensitivity, and specific interacting medications that are strong CYP3A inducers or high-risk CYP3A substrates [^115VkDcr] [^112sA8ry] [^114QRV2M].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic angle. Gilbert's impairs glucuronidation via UGT1A1, whereas Paxlovid's ritonavir component is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. These are distinct pathways, so there is no direct pharmacokinetic conflict between UGT1A1 deficiency and CYP3A inhibition, which supports the absence of a mechanistic rationale for avoiding Paxlovid solely due to Gilbert's syndrome [^115oxeP4] [^112t2hog].

> But wait, what if the presence of Gilbert's signals broader liver disease that could matter? I should double-check that Gilbert's alone does not equate to hepatic impairment. Gilbert's is not categorized as hepatic impairment in Child-Pugh scoring, and patients with Gilbert's typically have normal synthetic liver function; thus, Gilbert's by itself should not be equated with Child-Pugh A/B/C or with decompensated liver disease, which are the contexts that drive Paxlovid precautions or non-recommendation [^1123rvHF] [^1165D6z4].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing steps. I need to ensure standard screening for Paxlovid: confirm indication within 5 days of symptom onset, assess renal function for dose adjustment, screen for contraindicated interacting drugs, and consider baseline liver enzymes if clinically indicated. None of these steps change because a patient has Gilbert's syndrome, though a baseline bilirubin can document the patient's baseline unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia for comparison if symptoms arise [^112eotbS] [^116oPo2D] [^112vsy4v].

> I will now examine whether any special monitoring is warranted. Given that ritonavir can be associated with transaminase elevations and rare clinical hepatitis, it is reasonable to consider checking AST/ALT if the patient is symptomatic or if there are additional risk factors, but routine extra monitoring solely for Gilbert's is not mandated. If bilirubin rises modestly during therapy, I should confirm the pattern remains unconjugated and stable, consistent with Gilbert's physiology, rather than mixed or cholestatic injury [^115bDMR2] [^112A7EL4].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. Gilbert's syndrome is not a contraindication to Paxlovid, no dose adjustment is indicated, and no special hepatic precautions beyond standard practice are required. The key steps remain timely initiation, renal dosing, and rigorous drug–drug interaction review, with clinical judgment for baseline or symptom-triggered labs in patients with additional liver risk factors [^1165D6z4] [^112eotbS].

Gilbert's syndrome is **not a contraindication** to Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) [^1165D6z4]. Paxlovid is **safe to use in patients with Gilbert's syndrome** without dose adjustment, as it does not significantly affect bilirubin metabolism or cause clinically meaningful drug interactions in this context. The main concern is **hepatic impairment**, which is not a feature of uncomplicated Gilbert's syndrome. Routine liver function monitoring is not required solely for Gilbert's syndrome, but standard precautions for hepatic impairment should be followed if liver disease is suspected or confirmed [^115bDMR2].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Gilbert's syndrome results from **reduced UGT1A1 activity**, causing mild, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, typically without significant liver dysfunction [^112t2hog]. Paxlovid comprises nirmatrelvir (a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor) and ritonavir (a CYP3A inhibitor) [^1131pYvb]. Ritonavir can inhibit CYP3A and UGT enzymes, potentially increasing bilirubin levels; however, in Gilbert's syndrome, this effect is generally mild and clinically insignificant [^115oxeP4].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no evidence** that Gilbert's syndrome significantly increases the risk of adverse effects with Paxlovid. Major guidelines (FDA, IDSA) do not list Gilbert's syndrome as a contraindication or require special precautions [^115VkDcr] [^112sA8ry]. Paxlovid is **contraindicated only in severe hepatic impairment** (Child-Pugh C), which is not typical of Gilbert's syndrome [^1165D6z4] [^117XuSLF].

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **No dose adjustment**: Paxlovid does not require dose adjustment for Gilbert's syndrome [^notfound].
- **No routine monitoring**: Routine liver function tests are not required solely for Gilbert's syndrome.
- **Standard precautions**: Use standard precautions for hepatic impairment if liver disease is suspected or confirmed [^115bDMR2].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

Although Gilbert's syndrome itself does not pose significant risks with Paxlovid, clinicians should remain vigilant for rare adverse effects, such as **transaminase elevations or jaundice**, which ritonavir can cause [^115bDMR2]. These effects are uncommon and usually mild, but patients should be advised to report any new or worsening symptoms promptly.

---

## Gilbert's syndrome and Paxlovid

| **Factor** | **Consideration** |
|-|-|
| Gilbert's syndrome | Mild, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without significant liver dysfunction |
| Paxlovid metabolism | - Nirmatrelvir: minimal hepatic metabolism <br/> - Ritonavir: CYP3A and UGT inhibition |
| Clinical evidence | No evidence of significant adverse effects in Gilbert's syndrome |
| Guidelines | - No contraindication <br/> - No dose adjustment required |
| Monitoring | No routine liver function tests required |
| Precautions | Standard hepatic impairment precautions if liver disease is suspected |

---

Gilbert's syndrome is **not a contraindication** to Paxlovid. Paxlovid can be safely administered to patients with Gilbert's syndrome without dose adjustment or routine liver function monitoring, as it does not significantly affect bilirubin metabolism or cause clinically meaningful drug interactions in this context.

Introduction

Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has had immense health, economic, and social impacts globally. With new infection rates remaining high, SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose an urgent health threat. The main protease (M pro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a homo-dimeric cysteine protease responsible for cleaving the viral polyproteins into its mature substituents, including M pro itself, during viral replication. M pro is a validated drug target and is inhibited by nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), which is the active agent in Pfizer's oral COVID-19 drug, Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir combination). While Paxlovid is one of the most effective COVID-19 treatments to date, M pro has demonstrated that it is prone to mutations in and outside the active site, many of which have resulted in SARS-CoV-2 variants showing in vitro resistance to nirmatrelvir –, as well as several in immunocompromised patients –.

### Strategies and efforts in circumventing the emergence of antiviral resistance against conventional antivirals [^114rSA78]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetic enhancement was also applied for COVID-19, such is the case of Paxlovid, which is the combination of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3C-like protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir and ritonavir, which also reduced the metabolism of nirmatrelvir in the liver, allowing for prolonged nirmatrelvir antiviral effect(Fig. 5B).

Another way of improving the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug is by changing the delivery system such as by delivery to the target site. Antivirals against respiratory infections such influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronaviruses had better bioavailability at the target site, when delivered by inhalation through devices like nebulisers and aerosol inhalers, and also lower systematic exposure and toxicity. Also being explored are delivery methods like biocompatible targeted nanoparticles carrying drugs which have improved antiviral effect when compared to the same drug administered in vitro without nanoparticle delivery. Such delivery systems offer advantages of site specificity, controlled and sustained release, and compound stability. Additionally, hydrophobicity composition, size and surface to volume ratio of the particle can be modified to suit targeting needs, reducing off-target and undesirable side-effects, while improving bioavailability and lowering frequency of administration.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir use, dosing, interactions, and safety: Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir may be administered with other ARVs, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption or modification to the child's usual antiretroviral therapy (AIII). Children taking an ARV regimen that includes ritonavir or cobicistat should be monitored for increased side effects, but doses of ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and/or other ARVs do not need to be adjusted. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled HIV could theoretically develop PI resistance while taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir. Renal and hepatic function should be evaluated prior to initiating ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and doses should be adjusted if needed. Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset (BII*) and administered orally twice daily for 5 days. Patients should be advised that a small proportion experience rebound 2 to 8 days after taking ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir, and the potential for viral rebound should not dissuade providers from offering it to patients at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 who could potentially benefit (AIII). Ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir has potential for drug–drug interactions due to being both a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor and a CYP3A substrate; providers should consult the FDA Paxlovid Emergency Use Authorization Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers, the Infectious Diseases Society of America resource, and/or the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website for guidance. Other potential side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), altered taste, and increased blood pressure.

### A case report of drug interaction between co-packaged nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and tacrolimus causing hyponatremia in a lung transplant recipient [^1141oiKa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in lung transplant recipients can be lethal owing to the use of immunosuppressants. Antiviral agents may be administered to these patients. Co-packaged nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is a new agent currently being used in combination.

Case Presentation

In this report, we present a case of a 64-year-old woman, a lung transplant recipient, who experienced hyponatremia and showed a high serum tacrolimus concentration following the administration of the co-packaged nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination.

Conclusion

Although the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and tacrolimus combination is not contraindicated, other treatment strategies should be considered first, if available, and the dose of tacrolimus should be reduced when using the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir combination. In cases where combination therapy is necessary, serum tacrolimus levels should be closely monitored in lung transplant recipients. Documentation of more such reports is important to identify drug interactions between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and other agents, with the aim of preventing severe adverse effects.

### Independent FDA analyses of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir resistance in the phase 2 / 3 trials EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR [^114gbFEr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

PAXLOVID consists of nirmatrelvir, an inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro), copackaged with ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir received emergency use authorization in the United States in 2021 and was approved in 2023. However, there is limited published information on SARS-CoV-2 clinical resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

To investigate SARS-CoV-2 resistance development to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in treated patients, we analyzed baseline and matching post-baseline SARS-CoV-2 next-generation sequencing data from 1862 participants (912 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, 950 placebo) in Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) and Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard-Risk Patients (EPIC-SR), which were Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in participants with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Potential resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) were defined as those that were enriched in nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-treated participants or occurred at Mpro positions of interest, defined using nonclinical data. SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases were analyzed to characterize temporal frequencies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS in circulating viruses.

Results

In EPIC-HR, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS included Mpro T21I (n = 1), E166V (n = 3), A173T (n = 1), and T304I (n = 1), with E166V being the clearest RAS observed. In EPIC-SR, no RAS were detected. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS were not associated with hospitalization or death. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequence databases did not reveal concerning increases in the frequencies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS over time.

Conclusions

In clinical trials, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was infrequent (< 0.3%-1.1%). Surveillance data currently indicate a low frequency of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir RAS. Collectively, these results provide the most comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in the clinical setting to date. Viral sequences should continue to be closely monitored to identify the potential emergence of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir-resistant variants.

### Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus azvudine for adult inpatients with severe or critical COVID-19 [^112qJ6k5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) missing information on the treatment or discharge diagnosis; (2) renal failure with dialysis or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 within the past 6 months; (3) contraindication or allergy to the components of the two drugs (Paxlovid or azvudine); (4) no use of either Paxlovid or azvudine; (5) use of both Paxlovid and azvudine; and (6) HIV infection.

The discharge criteria were dependent on the criteria of the 10th trial edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 in China: (1) all clinical conditions improved significantly; (2) the vital signs were stable, and the patient remained afebrile for more than 24 hours; (3) the acute exudative lesions had improved significantly on the lung imaging; (4) the patient depended mildly on oral drugs; and (5) no complications required further management.

Demographic characteristics, comorbidities identified by diagnosis codes, related therapies, clinical results, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and other related clinical and laboratory examinations were collected. We defined Day 1 as the day of initiation of antiviral therapy. Related clinical and laboratory tests were performed within the next 7 days. All the above parameters were obtained from the worst results for each day.

Cohort definition

After hospitalisation, in the Paxlovid group, Paxlovid was prescribed as 300 mg of nirmatrelvir and 100 mg of ritonavir or 150 mg of nirmatrelvir plus 50 mg of ritonavir if the patient's GFR was within the range from 45 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 every 12 hours for 5 days. In the azvudine group, patients were treated with azvudine once daily at night. In addition, all patients in both groups received standard treatment based on the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (10th trial edition).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, the improvement in multiorgan dysfunction reflected by the SOFA score and the ratio of patients with an improvement in the SOFA score ≥ 2 on Day 7. Other related clinical laboratory tests were also analysed on Day 7. Further exploratory subgroup analyses were performed based on the course of the disease.

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^111yvEov]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

In this cohort study, we applied individual medical contraindications listed by the US Food and Drug Administration for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir to a large sample of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, ascertained by a positive reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction test, in 36 greater Paris University hospitals from January 24, 2020, to November 30, 2021. No patients received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. We examined the proportion of patients with contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in this sample and in those who died within 28 days of hospital admission, who thereby would have needed therapy other than nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in the ambulatory setting. We also stratified the analysis by sex, age (≤ 65 y vs > 65 y), and comorbidity based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) main chapters. Medical contraindications of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and criteria used to approximate them are detailed in Table 1. Analyses were performed using R software version 3.6.3. This study received approval from the institutional review board of the Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris clinical data warehouse. Patient consent was not applicable because this study did not contain factors necessitating it. The study was performed in accordance withreporting guidelines.

WARNING: SIGNIFICANT DRUG INTERACTIONS WITH PAXLOVID

PAXLOVID includes ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, which may lead to greater exposure of certain concomitant medications, resulting in potentially severe, life-threatening, or fatal events [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Drug Interactions (7)].
Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID: 1) Review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions with a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID and 2) Determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity despite anti-viral treatment in immunodeficient patients [^115QryuG]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

From December 2021, the NHS authorised additional COVID-19 treatments for the highest risk non-hospitalised patients. This policy enabled use of another nMab, Sotrovimab, or oral antiviral treatments (Molnupiravir or Paxlovid) to be prescribed to non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in clearly defined high risk groups. Treatment is delivered by hubs known as Covid Medicine Delivery Units (CMDUs) across the country within 5–7 days of symptom onset and with a positive COVID PCR or lateral flow test.

The nMab Sotrovimab targets an epitope of the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Data from the COMET-ICE trial demonstrated reduction in hospitalisation and death in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 treated with Sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is active against BA.1 and BA.1.1 variants and therefore was the first line treatment offered when these variants were dominant. After BA.2 became the dominant circulating subvariant, the antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) has been used as first line treatment via CMDUs unless there are contraindications. Anti-viral treatments Molnupiravir (a ribosomal dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor which drives viral mutagenesis) and nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (Paxlovid; a ritonavir-boosted 3C-protease inhibitor) have been demonstrated to reduce hospitalisation and death in patients with mild to moderate infection in the MOVe-Out and EPIC HR trials respectively.

Despite promising immediate clinical outcomes with the use of Ronapreve, sotrovimab, molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, it is currently unclear whether sustained viral clearance is achieved in immunodeficient patients. Although, persistent SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity following infection is recognised in immunocompetent hosts and may be of limited significance, the same cannot be assumed for immunodeficient patients at risk of chronic or relapsing infection. We therefore aimed to establish the long-term virological outcomes in the immunodeficient patients treated at our centre.

### Antiviral efficacy of RAY1216 monotherapy and combination therapy with ritonavir in patients with COVID-19: a phase 2, single centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116tV9AE]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rapid global dissemination and widespread devastation have resulted from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The spike protein is the target of the majority of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. However, the Omicron variant of the spike protein has now become the dominant variant globally, resulting in increased vaccine breakthrough rates and widespread resistance to neutralising antibodies. As a result, finding effective therapies for COVID-19 patients that do not target the spike protein remains a top priority in order to overcome the upcoming unexpected mutations before the COVID-19 epidemic can be fully controlled.

For a specific viral replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) is essential for the processing of viral polyproteins into functional units, making it an attractive antiviral target. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 replication can be inhibited by drugs selectively inhibiting 3CLpro, and there is a low likelihood of off-target activity due to the lack of known human analogues. Paxlovid is an oral antiviral drug developed by Pfizer that combines nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir is a 3CLpro inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2, and ritonavir works as a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor to slow the metabolism of nirmatrelvir and raise its serum levels. On December 22, 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorisation for Paxlovid to treat COVID-19 in adults and children (≥ 12 years old and weighing ≥ 40 kg) at high risk of developing severe COVID-19. However, Paxlovid has complex interactions with other medications, such as systemic corticosteroids, antiarrhythmic drugs, anticancer drugs, calcium channel blockers, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Due to the ritonavir component of the combination, Paxlovid is not recommended for those with certain medical conditions. Therefore, because of the rising number of cases and fatalities globally as well as the extremely limited treatment options, there is an urgent unmet medical need for new efficient 3CLpro inhibitors with fewer restrictions on combined medication that can control COVID-19.

### Virologic response and safety of ibuzatrelvir, A novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, in adults with COVID-19 [^112frWKo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Vaccination, naturally acquired immunity, antiviral therapies such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r; Paxlovid; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), and improved understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management have led to better outcomes for patients with COVID-19 compared with early during the pandemic. However, new variants evade immune response, allowing COVID-19 to continue causing high mortality and straining global healthcare systems. This burden persists partly because antiviral therapies for patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 are underused; one reason for this is potential risk of drug–drug interactions with NMV/r. New, efficacious antiviral therapies with safety profiles appropriate for a broader population are needed.

Ibuzatrelvir (PF-07817883) is a second-generation, orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M pro inhibitor that has demonstrated potent, pan-human coronavirus antiviral activity. Ibuzatrelvir achieves expected therapeutic systemic concentrations (> 90% of the population achieving free minimum observed plasma concentration [C min] ≥ 90% maximal effective concentration [EC 90]) without the need for a co-administered agent (eg, ritonavir) to increase drug exposures. Because ritonavir is a potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitor, administration of ibuzatrelvir alone (without ritonavir), as well as low potential of ibuzatrelvir to affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of other drugs, may simplify clinical management. Our aim in this study was to evaluate virologic response and safety of different ibuzatrelvir doses among nonhospitalized adults with confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19.

COVID-19 treatment in children with HIV — remdesivir use and dosing: For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years and at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but "remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated (BI*)". For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged < 12 years and at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, "remdesivir is currently the only treatment option but may be logistically challenging to administer and may not be available in all locations". Among hospitalized children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days and weigh ≥ 3 kg with laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected acute COVID-19, "remdesivir should be considered in children who are receiving supplemental oxygen (BII*) and should be administered in children who are severely or critically ill, have a rapidly increasing oxygen requirement, and/or who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by CDC (AI*)". Administration is specified as "intravenously once daily for 3 days to non-hospitalized patients and for 5 days or until discharge (whichever occurs first) in hospitalized patients", with duration for those "who are critically ill or have immunosuppression" able to be "extended to 10 days". Timing guidance states, "Ideally, remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset", though in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression, antiviral therapy "could be considered even if presenting with > 7 days of symptoms (CIII)". Reported adverse effects include "nausea/vomiting and elevation of transaminases", and while remdesivir has potential for drug–drug interactions, "the potential for interactions with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs is thought to be unlikely"; clinicians are advised to use a resource "such as the University of Liverpool COVID-19 Drug–Drug Interaction website, for further guidance".

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^1134LxBc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, contradictions to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were prevalent in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, as previously suggested. These findings also alert researchers to the risk of confounding by contraindication in observational studies focused on nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, which may overestimate treatment efficacy if not excluding patients with contraindications to this treatment. In addition, some of the contraindicated medications listed here could be temporarily held in the context of using nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

Study limitations include that even if not contraindicated, treatment may not have been given to some patients due to symptom duration of longer than 5 days or limited supply, and information about vaccination, race and ethnicity, and weight was unavailable. These findings support the need to anticipate supplies for alternative approved treatments and those that are under regulatory review (eg, SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors), and for continued research on less expensive treatment options for low- and middle-income countries.

### The small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro EDP-235 prevents viral replication and transmission in vivo [^114q6fGD]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

To date, the FDA has approved the use of one anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent that inhibits the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid). Ritonavir, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, is co-administered with nirmatrelvir to increase nirmatrelvir's pharmacokinetic half-life –. The EPIC-HR trial demonstrated that Paxlovid is typically well-tolerated in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. However, there are adverse reactions and contraindications that may arise with the use of ritonavir, which has limited the approved populations for which this therapeutic is recommended.

The development of antiviral resistance is a concern, particularly for RNA viruses. Unfortunately, the continued emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants increases the possibility of rendering current treatment measures less efficacious –. To reduce the medical impact of viral evolution and escape from immune and antiviral countermeasures, it is critical to continue developing novel therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2. To date, widespread transmission of nirmatrelvir-resistant variants has not been reported. However, it is possible that drug selective pressure could drive the development of clinically meaningful resistance. Indeed, several in vitro studies have determined that nirmatrelvir can select for variants bearing mutations in 3CLpro which may impact its efficacy. A recent case report determined that two of these in-vitro-generated mutations, E166V and L50F, were isolated from an immunocompromised individual infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with Paxlovid.

### Hospitalization and emergency department encounters for COVID-19 after paxlovid treatment-California, December 2021-may 2022 [^112EA9GD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) is a combination protease inhibitor that blocks replication of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and has been shown to reduce the risk for hospitalization and death among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to severe disease* (1). In December 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for early treatment with Paxlovid among persons with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease (2). FDA and a small number of published case reports have documented recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms or a positive viral test result (COVID-19 rebound) 2–8 days after recovery or a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result among patients treated with Paxlovid (3–7); however, large-scale studies investigating severe illness after Paxlovid treatment are limited. This study used electronic health record (EHR) data from a large integrated health care system in California (Kaiser Permanente Southern California [KPSC]) to describe hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) encounters related to SARS-CoV-2 infections during the 5–15 days after pharmacy dispensation of a 5-day treatment course of Paxlovid. Among 5,287 persons aged ≥ 12 years who received Paxlovid during December 31, 2021-May 26, 2022, 73% had received ≥ 3 doses of COVID-19 vaccine †, and 8% were unvaccinated. During the 5–15 days after Paxlovid treatment was dispensed, six hospitalizations and 39 ED encounters considered to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified, representing < 1% of all patients to whom Paxlovid treatment was dispensed during the study period. Among these 45 persons, 21 (47%) were aged ≥ 65 years, and 35 (78%) had at least one underlying medical condition § (8). This study found that hospitalization or ED encounters for COVID-19 during the 5–15 days after Paxlovid treatment was dispensed for mild to moderate COVID-19 illness were rarely identified. When administered as an early-stage treatment, Paxlovid might prevent COVID-19-related hospitalization among persons with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to severe disease.

### PaxlovidInformation from FDA and guidance for AES members [^116TZB95]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

This American Epilepsy Society (AES) official statement provides information and preliminary guidance to Society members related to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) December 22, 2021 Emergency Use Authorization for Paxlovid™ for the oral treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg). Paxlovid is likely to be widely prescribed, and important considerations for patients on antiseizure medications (ASMs) include key contraindications and potential toxicity or dose adjustments while taking Paxlovid. This statement highlights concerns and provides information about their pharmacologic basis. Of particular concern, concomitant use of Paxlovid with the ASMs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone is contraindicated, because they are strong inducers of the CYP3A4 isozyme that metabolizes Paxlovid and thereby could cause loss of virologic response and development of resistance. Alternate oral or intravenous COVID-19 treatments should be considered. A second concern is that Paxlovid may increase the plasma concentrations of many ASMs, because it inhibits the CYP3A4 isozyme. ASMs that are metabolized, at least in part, by CYP3A4 include cannabidiol, carbamazepine, clobazam, clonazepam, diazepam, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, lacosamide, midazolam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, stiripentol, tiagabine, and zonisamide. Patients receiving these medications may warrant closer monitoring while being treated with Paxlovid.

Blood-based biomarker characteristics and limitations — technical remarks: Direct and indirect blood biomarkers include components (bilirubin, aminotransferases, platelets, and other acute-phase reactants) that may be associated with false-positive or false-negative results in disorders such as acute hepatitis, hemolysis, Gilbert's syndrome, HIV-induced thrombocytopenia, splenectomy, and disease or treatment-related elevation in bilirubin or aminotransferases. Blood-based biomarkers have high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for "ruling out" advanced fibrosis in NAFLD but low positive predictive value (PPV) to "rule-in" advanced fibrosis in low prevalence cohorts. There are no validated blood-based biomarker thresholds that correlate with fibrosis stage following sustained virologic response (SVR) in HCV, and both indirect and direct biomarkers are associated with high false-negative rates for advanced fibrosis following antiviral therapy in patients with HBV or HCV. Although not included in the systematic review, NFS can be used to detect F3–4 in those with NAFLD.

### PaxlovidInformation from FDA and guidance for AES members [^115gXY7W]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Considerations for Patients on Antiseizure Medications

There are two major considerations when Paxlovid is given to patients taking some antiseizure medications (ASMs), consistent with previously documented interactions of ASMs and antiretroviral drugs, including ritonavir. The first major consideration is the effect of some ASMs on Paxlovid. The ASMs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone (although primidone is not listed in the EUA) are contraindicated, because they are strong inducers of the CYP3A4 isozymes that metabolize Paxlovid. Due to the strong enzymatic induction caused by these medications, there is concern for possible loss of virologic response to Paxlovid and development of resistance.

Paxlovid needs to be started soon after diagnosis of COVID-19. Clinically, if patients were to stop taking these strong enzyme-inducing ASMs, the time-dependent process of de-induction of CYP3A4 isozymes would take more time than is likely feasible, so other treatments for COVID-19, including molnupiravir or IV therapies like remdesivir, may be appropriate. The EUA for molnupiravir, another COVID-19 oral therapy for patients ≥ 18 years old, states that the drug is not a substrate of CYP enzymes or major drug transporters, and in vitro studies do not suggest inhibitory actions.

### SARS-CoV-2 3CLmutations selected in a VSV-based system confer resistance to nirmatrelvir, ensitrelvir, and GC376 [^116Cmqt4]. Science Translational Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In late 2019, the zoonotic transmission of a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), into the human population, has led to worldwide efforts to find effective treatments against the various pathologies caused by the virus. Inhibitors of viral enzymes, such as proteases, have proven to be highly potent drugs in the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis C virus infections. However, resistant viruses rapidly emerge unless the protease inhibitors are given in combination with other directly acting antivirals. SARS-CoV-2 encodes two proteases. The 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro) cleaves 11 sites in the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab and is also referred to as the main protease (M pro) or non-structural protein 5 (nsp5), indicating that it cleaves more sites than the second protease and its location within the polyproteins, respectively. The second viral protease, Papain-like protease (PL pro) cleaves three additional sites in pp1a and pp1ab. Thus, both proteases are essential for viral replication and therefore interesting drug targets.

Recently, the 3CL pro inhibitor nirmatrelvir was approved for clinical use. Nirmatrelvir acts as a peptidomimetic, covalent inhibitor binding to the catalytic site cysteine (C145), thereby blocking its function. Nirmatrelvir has been authorized in combination with ritonavir by the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) for emergency use in high-risk SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals under the trade name Paxlovid (EUA 105 Pfizer Paxlovid, 22.12.2021). In the studies leading to the Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) emergency use authorization (EUA), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 3CL pro was used as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro to generate resistance data, which may not be the ideal system. In addition, very recently several preprints have described nirmatrelvir resistance mutations in authentic SARS-CoV-2, either generated de novo, found in isolates, or modelled in silico. Working with SARS-CoV-2 requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) installations due to its virulence. Even more so, performing SARS-CoV-2 antibody or antiviral resistance studies demand utmost caution to avoid biosafety breaches and subsequent spread of mutant variants.

Levels of immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, or sirolimus can be increased when administered with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. Hormonal contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol may possibly have reduced effectiveness due to lowered ethinyl estradiol levels when administered with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and women of childbearing potential should be counseled to use a back-up, non-hormonal method of contraception.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PAXLOVID include subjects 65 years of age and older and their data contributes to the overall assessment of safety and efficacy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of the total number of subjects in the integrated dataset consisting of EPIC-HR and EPIC-SR who were randomized to and received PAXLOVID (N = 1,578), 165 (10%) were 65 years of age and older and 39 (2%) were 75 years of age and older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal impairment increases nirmatrelvir exposure, which may increase the risk of PAXLOVID adverse reactions. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dosage in patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min). Reduce the PAXLOVID dose and dose frequency in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), including those requiring hemodialysis. On days when patients undergo hemodialysis, the PAXLOVID dose should be administered after hemodialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Prescriptions should specify the numeric dose of each active ingredient within PAXLOVID. Providers should counsel patients about renal dosing instructions [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment of PAXLOVID is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of nirmatrelvir or ritonavir in subjects with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment, therefore, PAXLOVID is not recommended for use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Introduction

Near seven million people have died globally from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hong Kong had been seriously hit by the fifth wave of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant BA.2 and BA.5 since 31 December 2021. Over 13 months, 2.8 millions of Hong Kong citizens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The reported mortality rate of 37.7 per million population was one of the highest worldwide. The peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis populations had high mortality with 19.4 and 21.9 deaths per 1000 dialysis population, respectively. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are likely to have worse outcome including higher incidence of hospitalisation. Early effective antiviral therapy is therefore crucial for this group of patients. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir have been widely used in Hong Kong since their availability. Nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor. It is 70% protein bound and excretion is 35% through the kidneys. Ritonavir is given together to enhance bioavailability of nirmatrelvir. Unlike nirmatrelvir, ritonavir is metabolised mainly in the liver. Nirmatrelvir is dosed at 300 mg twice a day for eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and 150 mg twice a day for eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is an effective anti-viral that has been shown to reduce hospitalisation or death by day 28 in EPIC-HR trial. Yet, patients with advanced kidney disease (CKD stage 4, i.e. eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) were excluded from the trial because of theoretical concern about drug safety as accumulation of nirmatrelvir is expected in patients with impaired renal function. In the product monograph, it is stated that the drug is 'not recommended' for those with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Molnupiravir, on the other hand, is safe for patients with CKD stage 4 or above, including those on dialysis. It has been the conventional oral antiviral drug for this group of vulnerable high-risk patients. Molnupiravir inhibits viral replication by promoting widespread viral mutation when its metabolite incorporated into the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In MOVe-OUT trial, it has been shown that early treatment with molnupiravir, when compared with placebo, reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death in at-risk, unvaccinated patients with COVID-19. However, among high-risk vaccinated adults in the community, Butler et al. showed that molnupiravir did not reduce the frequency of COVID-19-associated hospitalisation or death. Efficacy of molnupiravir in vaccinated adults is therefore a concern. Before another effective antiviral drug is discovered, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is perhaps a feasible treatment option in patients with CKD stage 4 and above as demonstrated by a prospective trial in Hong Kong. Effectiveness of viral load suppression and the clinical outcome in terms of symptoms resolution were similar to those with better renal function. For molnupiravir, several case series have also demonstrated its safety. While individual antiviral has been demonstrated to be safe in advanced kidney disease, studies regarding direct comparison between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir is lacking. Here, we take another perspective to compare the safety profile and efficacy between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir in advanced kidney disease.

### An IgM-like inhalable ACE2 fusion protein broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants [^114CV2KL]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The vast scale of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the suboptimal protection efficacy for the viral infection after vaccination have provided a fertile ground for the emergence of variants with adaptive advantages, including increased transmissibility and the ability to escape from neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2's receptor-binding domain (RBD). The currently prevailing Omicron variants harbor more than thirty mutations in the S protein, and are markedly resistant to neutralization by serum from convalescent patients or vaccinated individuals –. These variants also escape the majority of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies of diverse epitopes –. Notably, three antibody regimens (Bamlanivimab plus Etesevimab, Casirivimab plus Imdevimab, and Sotrovimab) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA for treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in 2021 have now been limited in use for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible SARS-CoV-2 variants (i.e. not for the Omicron variant). Two small molecule oral antivirals (Molnupiravir and Paxlovid) granted EUA by the FDA in Dec. 2021 showed clinical benefit in Omicron variant-infected and hospitalized patients not requiring oxygen therapy on admission. However, each has its own limitations: Molnupiravir has potential host mutagenic risk and can potentially increase SARS-CoV-2 mutation frequencies. Paxlovid (Ritonavir-Boosted Nirmatrelvir) is contraindicated with drugs for drug-drug interactions owing to Ritonavir's CYP3A induction effect, limiting its widespread use. Moreover, a recent study reported that the effect of Paxlovid in patients under 65 is limited.

### PaxlovidInformation from FDA and guidance for AES members [^115bjmbS]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Paxlovid should be used with caution with ASMs that are weak to moderate inducers of CYP3A4. ASMs in this category that may affect Paxlovid effectiveness include the following: cenobamate, eslicarbazepine, oxcarbazepine, rufinamide, and topiramate. See Table 1 for a full list of ASMs that are CYP3A4 inducers.

Table 1.
Antiseizure Medications Enzymatic Considerations.

The second major consideration is the effect of Paxlovid on the plasma levels of several drugs. ASMs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 are listed in the top left cell of Table 1. Patients receiving these ASMs may warrant closer monitoring while being treated with Paxlovid. Because ritonavir is a potent, mechanism-based inhibitor (irreversible) of CYP3A4, Paxlovid may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Co-administration of Paxlovid with drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Of note, because of its mechanism, ritonavir de-inhibition will be slower in offset, and inhibition of metabolism by CYP3A4 may persist for at least several days following Paxlovid discontinuation. Although perampanel is a major substrate for CYP3A4, short-term addition of CYP3A4 inhibitors is unlikely to have lasting impact on perampanel concentrations due to its very long half-life.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116DuU1R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

COVID-19 outpatient treatment for children with HIV — ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) should be considered for laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected mild to moderate COVID-19 in children with HIV who are aged ≥ 12 years, weigh ≥ 40 kg, and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 due to advanced or untreated HIV or another high-risk condition as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir should be started within 5 days of symptom onset; it may be administered with antiretrovirals, including those that contain ritonavir or cobicistat, without any interruption of or modification to the antiretroviral therapy. Remdesivir (Veklury) may be considered in the outpatient setting for children with HIV who are aged ≥ 28 days, weigh ≥ 3 kg, and are at high risk as defined by CDC, and remdesivir should be started within 7 days of symptom onset, but its use could be considered in children with HIV with severe immunosuppression who have had > 7 days of symptoms. For non-hospitalized children with HIV aged ≥ 12 years at high risk, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is the preferred treatment, but remdesivir may be considered if ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir is unavailable or contraindicated.

### Persistence of an infectious form of SARS-CoV-2 after protease inhibitor treatment of permissive cells in vitro [^111tJFJv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Paxlovid, a Food and Drug Administration approved drug to treat symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in elderly and high-risk individuals, is an oral combination of nirmatrelvir, an inhibitor of the main protease (3CL) of SARS-CoV-2, and ritonavir, a CY3PA inhibitor that boosts the plasma concentration of nirmatrelvir. Other protease inhibitors approved for clinical use include ensitrelvir (also known as S-217622) in Japan, and simnotrelvir (also known as SIM0417) in China.

Numerous coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients receiving the recommended 5-day course of Paxlovid (300 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours) became symptomatically better and virus negative only to have a rebound of detectable SARS-CoV-2 again 2–8 days later. Many of these cases had a recurrence of symptoms, albeit mild. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory because of concerns for forward transmission of the virus during its recrudescence, even as another case series was reported. Several retrospective studies suggested the prevalence of "Paxlovid rebound" was low at approximately 1%–2%, but a couple of prospective studies have shown the rates to be as high as 20%–27%, as many medical practitioners have noted anecdotally. These reports showed that the low prevalence found in prior retrospective studies was largely due to inadequate posttreatment sampling to detect the virus. Additionally, several studies suggested viral relapse was common in untreated patients, but these were descriptions of viral "blips" that were not sustained. Moreover, the infrequency (0.7%) of SARS-CoV-2 rebound in the absence of therapy is well documented in a large study of infected individuals (n = 999) who were closely monitored. An explanation for the viral relapse remained elusive, although viral resistance to nirmatrelvir, inadequate adaptive immunity, and reinfection were ruled out. In this study, we probed the underlying cause of the viral rebound by assessing the persistence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in several permissive cell lines after treatment with high doses of nirmatrelvir or ensitrelvir in vitro.

### Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir: oral coronavirus disease 2019 antiviral drugs [^117LJ3kP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

At a crucial time with rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant globally, the United States Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization for 2 oral antivirals, molnupiravir (in persons aged ≥ 18 years) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) (in persons aged ≥ 12 years weighing ≥ 40 kg), for the outpatient treatment of patients with mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who are at risk for progression. Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue, whereas nirmatrelvir is a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor, and ritonavir is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease inhibitor. Drug interactions are a major concern for nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir demonstrated a greater risk reduction in hospitalization and death than molnupiravir compared to placebo. Both drugs need to be started within 5 days of symptoms onset and given for 5 days' duration. This article reviews the 2 oral COVID-19 antiviral drugs including the mechanisms of action, antiviral activity, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, clinical experience including trials, adverse events, recommended indications, and formulary considerations.

### Effectiveness of molnupiravir vs nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in non-hospitalised and hospitalised patients with COVID-19: a target trial emulation study [^111pXUKJ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the need for effective antiviral treatments. Two oral antiviral drugs, molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) have shown promise as novel treatment options for adults with COVID-19 from phase III randomised controlled trials, namely the Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients (EPIC-HR) trial and the Molnupiravir for Oral Treatment of COVID-19 in an Outpatient Setting (MOVe-OUT) trial. There is limited evidence directly comparing the effectiveness of these two antiviral treatments. Nevertheless, several clinical guidelines, including National Institutes of Health from US and National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia, recommend nirmatrelvir–ritonavir over molnupiravir, provided that patients do not have any contraindications to either drugs. Consequently, understanding their relative effectiveness profiles is crucial for informing public health policy and guiding clinical practice.

### Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (paxlovid) for mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy and lactation [^116iPmXa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid) is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy. Data on use in pregnancy, including prescribing patterns and patient experience (adverse effects, incidence of rebound), are limited. We performed a cross-sectional study in which we surveyed a cohort of vaccinated pregnant or lactating individuals with breakthrough COVID-19. Of 35 pregnant respondents, 51.4% were prescribed and 34.3% took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; of these, 91.7% experienced dysgeusia and 50.0% had rebound (50.0% positive test result, 33.3% return of symptoms). Three of five lactating respondents were prescribed and two took nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. There were no significant adverse outcomes. Unknown risk was the most common reason for declining nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. More research is needed to establish the safety of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in pregnancy and lactation, to improve public health messaging, and to increase uptake of this treatment.

### Prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at risk for progression to severe disease [^113NKrsB]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The availability of outpatient treatment options for COVID-19, such as nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and monoclonal antibodies, raises hopes for reducing COVID-19–related morbidity and mortality. Among these options, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (Paxlovid)may be preferred for most high-risk patients because of the convenience of oral dosing and its high efficacy vs placebo in reducing hospitalization or death, as reported in a phase 2/3 trial.

However, there are circumstances in which nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should not be used, due to the effect of ritonavir. Ritonavir may elevate the concentrations of drugs highly dependent on hepatic cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) metabolism, potentially resulting in serious reactions. Conversely, coadministration with potent CYP3A inducers can significantly reduce nirmatrelvir concentrations, potentially leading to the loss of virologic response. Furthermore, patients with severe kidney impairment and severe liver impairment were excluded from the clinical trials. These medical contraindications may be prevalent in patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression to severe disease, as suggested by a recent study.

We examined the prevalence of contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that the rate would be high in these patients.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^111Ddqnq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Nirmatrelvir is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antiviral drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

Ritonavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor but is not active against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of nirmatrelvir, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of nirmatrelvir.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At 3 times the steady state peak plasma concentration (Cmax) at the recommended dose, nirmatrelvir does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Nirmatrelvir AUC increased in a less than dose proportional manner over a single dose range from 250 mg to 750 mg (0.83 to 2.5 times the approved recommended dose) and multiple dose range from 75 mg to 500 mg (0.25 to 1.67 times the approved recommended dose), when administered in combination with 100 mg ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir steady state was achieved on Day 2 following administration of the approved recommended dosage and the mean accumulation ratio was approximately 2-fold.

The pharmacokinetic properties of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are displayed in Table 3.

The predicted Day 5 nirmatrelvir exposure parameters in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were treated with PAXLOVID in EPIC-HR are presented in Table 4.

Effect of Food

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir were observed following administration of a high fat meal (800–1,000 calories; 50% fat) to healthy subjects.

There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir based on age (18 to 86 years), sex, or race/ethnicity.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.

### Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic-led guidance for patients with cystic fibrosis taking elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19 [^113ozXiy]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

One notable therapeutic challenge is in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2)). In people with CF, viral respiratory tract infections can lead to acute pulmonary exacerbations with a negative impact on lung function.COVID‐19 infection triggers a cytokine storm which can lead to the life‐threatening respiratory distress syndrome, potentially putting the population with CF infected with COVID‐19 at high risk of serious illness. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently issued an emergency use authorization for the use of the nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir (Paxlovid) for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID‐19. Nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir treatment significantly reduces hospital admissions and deaths among people with COVID‐19 who are at high risk of severe illness. Nirmatrelvir is coadministered with ritonavir, a CYP3A inhibitor, to boost nirmatrelvir concentrations to achieve therapeutic levels. However, due to the potent inhibition effect of ritonavir, it may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Therefore, coadministration of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is contraindicated with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life‐threatening reactions. Since all three components of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor are eliminated mainly through CYP3A, nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir is expected to exhibit a significant drug interaction with elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor. Thus, the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir in people with CF would require an adjusted dosing regimen of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor to prevent increased plasma concentrations and potential adverse drug reactions. However, there are currently no clinical data available regarding the interactions of elexacaftor‐tezacaftor‐ivacaftor with nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir, and no specific dosing guidelines have been established. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the proper guidance regarding the use of nirmatrelvir‐ritonavir for people with CF to prevent progression of COVID‐19 to severe disease.

### Comparing molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir / ritonavir efficacy and the effects on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in animal models [^116hRp46]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 are underutilized. Two oral drugs, molnupiravir and paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), have received emergency use authorization. Initial trials suggested greater efficacy of paxlovid, but recent studies indicated comparable potency in older adults. Here, we compare both drugs in two animal models; the Roborovski dwarf hamster model for severe COVID-19-like lung infection and the ferret SARS-CoV-2 transmission model. Dwarf hamsters treated with either drug survive VOC omicron infection with equivalent lung titer reduction. Viral RNA copies in the upper respiratory tract of female ferrets receiving 1.25mg/kg molnupiravir twice-daily are not significantly reduced, but infectious titers are lowered by > 2log orders and direct-contact transmission is stopped. Female ferrets dosed with 20 or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice-daily show 1–2log order reduction of viral RNA copies and infectious titers, which correlates with low nirmatrelvir exposure in nasal turbinates. Virus replication resurges towards nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment end and virus transmits efficiently (20mg/kg group) or partially (100mg/kg group). Prophylactic treatment with 20mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir does not prevent spread from infected ferrets, but prophylactic 5mg/kg molnupiravir or 100mg/kg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir block productive transmission. These data confirm reports of similar efficacy in older adults and inform on possible epidemiologic benefit of antiviral treatment.

### Effectiveness of nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in children and adolescents aged 12–17 years following SARS-CoV-2 omicron infection: a target trial emulation [^1158eVpf]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Currently there is a lack of randomized trial data examining the use of the antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This target trial emulation study aims to address this gap by evaluating the use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in non-hospitalized paediatric patients aged 12–17years with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection. Among paediatric patients diagnosed between 16th March 2022 and 5th February 2023, exposure was defined as outpatient nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment within 5days of symptom onset or COVID-19 diagnosis. Primary outcome was 28day all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization, while secondary outcomes were 28day in-hospital disease progression, 28day COVID-19-specific hospitalization, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), acute liver injury, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Overall, 49,378 eligible paediatric patients were included. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment was associated with reduced 28day all-cause hospitalization (absolute risk reduction = 0.23%, 95%CI = 0.19%-0.31%; relative risk = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.56–0.71). No events of mortality, in-hospital disease progression, or adverse clinical outcomes were observed among nirmatrelvir/ritonavir users. The findings confirmed the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in reducing all-cause hospitalization risk among non-hospitalized pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection.

Considerations for antiviral drug selection

There are key differences in drug effectiveness, profile of adverse effects, and other factors among the 3 authorized or approved antiviral medications (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir) that inform tailored drug selection. Several clinical considerations are outlined in Table 1. Of note, much of the antiviral effectiveness data were generated from studies of unvaccinated populations and/or preceded the contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variant era; real-world data continue to accrue.

Table 1.
Major Considerations and Comparison Among United States FDA Authorized or Approved Antivirals to Treat COVID-19 in the Outpatient Setting

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has shown high effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes in older individuals and those with incomplete vaccination. A key consideration in prescribing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is ensuring careful assessment of possible drug–drug interactions because ritonavir potently affects the activity of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes; the effect may also endure after drug discontinuation during enzyme regeneration. Several excellent resources are available for point-of-care reference to avoid and reduce clinically important interactions including those stewarded by the University of Liverpool and National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines; notably, in the United States, licensed pharmacists are permitted to prescribe nirmatrelvir/ritonavir after medication review. Important drug classes to consider include immunosuppressants (eg, tacrolimus), antiarrhythmics (eg, amiodarone), antiepileptics (eg, phenytoin), anticoagulants (eg, direct-acting oral anticoagulants, such as rivaroxaban), and lipid-lowering medications (eg, atorvastatin). Additionally, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is not recommended for individuals with severe decompensated liver disease or renal impairment because of limited safety and efficacy data in these patient populations; there are dose adjustments for persons with moderate chronic kidney disease. In sum, primary considerations for use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for a high-risk individual include manageability of drug–drug interactions and assessment of end-organ function. The phenomenon of "rebound" syndromes after antiviral discontinuation is later discussed in "Additional Considerations".

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Nirmatrelvir, a novel inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has shown high efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19)–related hospitalization or all‐cause death among individuals at increased risk of progression to severe disease when administered in combination with ritonavir. Preliminary data have highlighted the importance of the renal pathway in nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics when given with ritonavir, which inhibits the metabolism of nirmatrelvir.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ This study evaluated whether renal impairment was associated with altered nirmatrelvir pharmacokinetics.

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Increases in nirmatrelvir systemic exposure were observed with increasing renal impairment severity following a single nirmatrelvir dose enhanced with ritonavir, particularly in the moderate (approximately twofold higher than normal renal function) and severe (approximately threefold higher) renal impairment groups. Nirmatrelvir renal clearance was correspondingly lower in these groups. The safety profile of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was acceptable in all groups.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Findings from this study were used to specify dosing recommendations for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for patients with renal disease.

### Impact of extended-course oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir in established long COVID: a case series [^113foMCY]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior case series suggest that a 5-day course of oral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) benefits some people with Long COVID, within and/or outside of the context of an acute reinfection. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no prior case series of people with Long COVID who have attempted longer courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Methods

We documented a case series of 13 individuals with Long COVID who initiated extended courses (> 5 days; range: 7.5–30 days) of oral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside (n = 11) of and within (n = 2) the context of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants reported on symptoms and health experiences before, during, and after their use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Results

Among those who take an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir outside of the context of an acute infection, some experience a meaningful reduction in symptoms, although not all benefits persist. Others experience no effect on symptoms. One participant stopped early due to intense stomach pain. For the two participants who took an extended course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within the context of an acute reinfection, both report eventually returning to their pre-re-infection baseline.

Conclusions

Extended courses of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may have meaningful benefits for some people with Long COVID but not others. We encourage researchers to study how and why nirmatrelvir/ritonavir benefits some and what course length is most effective, with the goal of informing clinical recommendations for using nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and/or other antivirals as a potential treatment for Long COVID.

Outcomes

Effectiveness outcomes included occurrence of (i) all-cause mortality, (ii) ICU admission, (iii) ventilatory support, (iv) hospitalisation, (v) hepatic impairment, (vi) ischaemic stroke, and (vii) myocardial infarction within 90 days after the index date. Use of ventilatory support was identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) procedure codes (39.65, 89.18, 93.90, 93.95, 93.96, 96.7, 96.04). Hepatic impairment was defined as patients who fulfil the criteria for any level of severity (mild, moderate, moderate to severe, severe) of drug induced liver injury. The level of severity is categorised based on the International Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Expert Working Group classification. According to the Asia Pacific Association of Study of Liver consensus guidelines, the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were defined as 40 U/L, 40 U/L, and 135 U/L, respectively. Ischaemic stroke was defined based on ICD-9-CM codes 433.01, 433.11, 433.21, 433.31, 433.81, 433.91, 434, 436, 437.0, and 437.1. Myocardial infarction was defined based on ICD-9-CM codes 410.

### Innovative randomized phase I study and dosing regimen selection to accelerate and inform pivotal COVID-19 trial of nirmatrelvir [^112xMeMm]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a continued leading cause of hospitalization and death. Safe, efficacious COVID-19 antivirals are needed urgently. Nirmatrelvir (PF-07321332), the first orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) M pro inhibitor against the coronaviridae family, has demonstrated potent preclinical antiviral activity and benign safety profile. We report safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data of nirmatrelvir with and without ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, from an accelerated randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study. Two interleaving single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were evaluated in a three-period crossover. Multiple-ascending dose (MAD) with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily (b.i.d.) dosing was evaluated over 10 days in five parallel cohorts. Safety was assessed, including in a supratherapeutic exposure cohort. Dose and dosing regimen for clinical efficacy evaluation in phase II/III clinical trials were supported by integrating modeling and simulations of SAD/MAD data with nonclinical data and a quantitative systems pharmacology model (QSP). In SAD, MAD, and supratherapeutic exposure cohorts, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was safe and well-tolerated. Nirmatrelvir exposure and half-life were considerably increased by ritonavir, enabling selection of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose and regimen for phase II/III trials (300/100 mg b.i.d.), to achieve concentrations continuously above those required for 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro. The QSP model suggested that a 5-day regimen would significantly decrease viral load in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients which may prevent development of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. In conclusion, an innovative and seamless trial design expedited establishment of phase I safety and pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, enabling high confidence in phase II/III dose selection and accelerated pivotal trials' initiation (NCT04756531).

Management of liver toxicity

Gilbert's syndrome

Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is a mild liver disorder caused by an inherited deficiency in the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is responsible for processing bilirubin. This results in elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream, leading to intermittent jaundice in some individuals. Despite its relatively benign nature, patients with GS are often excluded from clinical trials. The board paid particular attention to the management of the disease, and the panel agreed that SG use in patients with GS, particularly those with total bilirubin levels below 3 mg/dL, may be considered, as it does not represent an absolute contraindication. However, SG should be considered carefully in GS patients with UGT *28/*28, and monitoring is essential due to the liver's role in drug metabolism and the potential for bilirubin levels to fluctuate. Although Gilbert's disease is a benign condition typically characterized by mild hyperbilirubinemia, the underlying impairment in glucuronidation may influence the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs. Excluding individuals with Gilbert's syndrome from clinical trials means that the results may not fully represent the diversity of the population, and it could limit the generalizability of results and the understanding of how such individuals might respond to SG.

Liver

Hepatic toxicity has been reported for temozolomide and may include increased liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia, and cholestasis. Monitoring liver function before and during temozolomide treatment, for example, every 4–8 weeks, is recommended. Abnormal liver function tests should trigger the exclusion of changes in coagulation parameters. Furthermore, HCV infection should be ruled out by virus serology and abdominal sonography should be obtained to confirm that TMZ is the main cause of liver dysfunction. Laboratory abnormalities should be managed with dose reductions, treatment interruption, or discontinuation. Meulengracht's disease is no contraindication for chemotherapy. Advice from hepatology experts should be sought before potentially active antitumor treatment is halted or discontinued.

Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values are common findings patients receiving NTRK inhibitors, mostly occurring in the first 3 months of treatment. Interruption or discontinuation of these drugs should be considered depending on the severity of the liver injury. For BRAF inhibitors, liver toxicity, sometimes severe, has been reported. For antiangiogenic drugs, especially regorafenib, liver function abnormalities have been frequently observed. Therefore, it is recommended to perform liver function tests before initiation of treatment and to monitor these parameters closely. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia may occur in patients with Gilbert's syndrome and is no contraindication for chemotherapy. Similar to other drugs which exert liver toxicity, dose modification as well as treatment interruption or discontinuation have to be considered.

### Postmarketing reporting of paxlovid-related dysgeusia: a real-world pharmacovigilance study [^115vycJZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

A novel COVID-19 therapeutic, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), is commonly associated with reports of dysgeusia. The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database was used to determine the real-world reporting of Paxlovid-associated dysgeusia (PAD), identify associated factors, and describe the relative reporting rates of dysgeusia for Paxlovid compared to other COVID-19 therapeutics (OCT), ritonavir alone, and other protease inhibitors (OPI).

Study Design

Observational retrospective.

Setting

Tertiary academic medical center.

Methods

We collected patient and adverse event characteristics reported in the FAERS database between January 1968 and September 2022. Disproportionality analyses were used to compare the reporting of PAD to dysgeusia reported for OCT, ritonavir, and OPI.

Results

345,229 adverse events were included in the present study. Dysgeusia was a frequently reported Paxlovid-associated adverse event (17.5%) and was associated with nonserious COVID-19 infection (reporting odds ratio [ROR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 1.7) and female sex (ROR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.6, 1.9). Paxlovid was more likely to be associated with the reporting of dysgeusia compared to OCT (ROR 305.4; 95% CI 164.1, 568.5), ritonavir (ROR 28.0; 95% CI 24.1, 32.7), and OPI (ROR 49.0; 95% CI 42.8, 56.1).

Conclusion

Dysgeusia is much more likely to be reported by patients receiving Paxlovid than those receiving OCT, ritonavir alone, or OPI. These findings suggest a potential mechanism of dysgeusia that causes distorted taste out of proportion to the background effects of COVID-19 infection and specific to nirmatrelvir. Future studies are needed to determine the underlying pathophysiology and long-term clinical implications for patients who report dysgeusia with Paxlovid.

### Comparison of safety and efficacy between nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir in the treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with advanced kidney disease: a retrospective observational study [^112QuY7G]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study design and eligibility criteria

This study was a target trial emulation using territory-wide electronic health record databases in Hong Kong. Target trial emulation was adopted to reduce some typical challenges in observational studies such as immortal time and selection biases. The specification and emulation of the target trial is detailed in Supplementary Table S1. The subject inclusion period commenced from 16 March 2022 (when both molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir became available in Hong Kong) to 31 December 2022, during which there was an outbreak of Omicron BA.2 and its subvariants in Hong Kong. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who had COVID-19 infection (documented as a PCR/RAT positive result confirmed by DH), received COVID-19 oral antivirals (molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) within five days, and advanced kidney disease (history of eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) before index date were eligible. The index date was defined as the date of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir prescription. Exclusion criteria include: patients who (i) had a history of COVID-19 infection before index date, (ii) on remdesivir, tocilizumab, baricitinib and interferon beta-1b within 90 days before index date, (iii) hospitalised at least 5 days before index date, (iv) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or received ventilatory support on or before index date, (v) received first drug treatment > 5 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, and (vi) with contraindications to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or molnupiravir, including severe liver impairment (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver transplant), and use of interacting drugs (i.e. amiodarone, apalutamide, rifampicin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, primidone, phenobarbital, or phenytoin, direct oral anticoagulants) within 90 days before index date. During the analysis of each outcome, patients who had a history of the outcomes before index date were also excluded.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

In HIV-infected patients age greater than 1 month to 21 years, the antiviral activity and adverse event profile seen during clinical trials and through postmarketing experience were similar to that for adult patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of ritonavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of ritonavir is necessary for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of PAXLOVID can alter the plasma concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the plasma concentrations of PAXLOVID. Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PAXLOVID therapy and review concomitant medications during PAXLOVID therapy. (4, 5.1, 7, 12.3)

7.1	Potential for PAXLOVID to Affect Other Drugs

PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir co-packaged with ritonavir) is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, and an inhibitor of CYP2D6, P-gp and OATP1B1. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp or OATP1B1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs and increase the risk of adverse events. Co-administration of PAXLOVID with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2]. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 2.

7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PAXLOVID

Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are CYP3A substrates; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease nirmatrelvir and ritonavir plasma concentrations and reduce PAXLOVID therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.3) Table 2].

7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 2 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor such as ritonavir.

### Nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid) [^115bDMR2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions

Initiation of PAXLOVID, which contains ritonavir, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving PAXLOVID, may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A. Medications that induce CYP3A may decrease concentrations of PAXLOVID. These interactions may lead to:

Clinically significant adverse reactions, potentially leading to severe, life-threatening, or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications.
Loss of therapeutic effect of PAXLOVID and possible development of viral resistance.

Severe, life-threatening, and/or fatal adverse reactions due to drug interactions have been reported in patients treated with PAXLOVID. The most commonly reported concomitant medications resulting in serious adverse reactions were calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), followed by calcium channel blockers.

Prior to prescribing PAXLOVID, review all medications taken by the patient to assess potential drug-drug interactions and determine if concomitant medications require a dose adjustment, interruption, and/or additional monitoring (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors) [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions, including contraindicated drugs. Drugs listed in Table 2 are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with PAXLOVID.

Consider the benefit of PAXLOVID treatment in reducing hospitalization and death, and whether the risk of potential drug-drug interactions for an individual patient can be appropriately managed [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Studies (14)].

5.2	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (including toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome), and other hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with PAXLOVID [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue PAXLOVID and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care.

5.3	Hepatotoxicity

Hepatic transaminase elevations, clinical hepatitis, and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering PAXLOVID to patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver enzyme abnormalities, or hepatitis.

### Tacrolimus drug-drug interaction with nirmatrelvir / ritonavir (paxlovid ™) managed with phenytoin [^112KesNg]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on communities and health systems. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Pfizer's nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid™) through an EUA for the treatment of mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease. Patients with a history of transplant who test positive for COVID-19 are considered high risk because of their immunosuppression and are therefore candidates for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Case Report

This is a case of a 67-year-old female with a past medical history of orthotopic heart transplant who received tacrolimus as part of her immunosuppressive regimen. She originally presented with complaints of dyspnea and cough for several days in the setting of COVID-19. The patient was started on nirmatrelvir/ritonavir due to her high risk for progression to severe disease. Four days after starting nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, she presented to the ED for slowed speech, fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite. Upon admission she was found to have a supratherapeutic tacrolimus level of 176.4 ng/mL and an acute kidney injury. In this case, phenytoin was used as a CYP3A4 inducer to quickly decrease the tacrolimus level to within therapeutic range.

Conclusion

This case highlights the strong and important drug-drug interaction between tacrolimus and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir leading to toxic levels of tacrolimus. It also demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of phenytoin as a "rescue" medication for tacrolimus toxicity.

### A mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 immunity predicts paxlovid rebound [^117Fs8Ci]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), an oral antiviral medication targeting SARS-CoV-2, remains an important treatment for COVID-19. Initial studies of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were performed in SARS-CoV-2 unvaccinated patients without prior confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, most individuals have now either been vaccinated and/or have experienced SARS-CoV-2 infection. After nirmatrelvir/ritonavir became widely available, reports surfaced of "Paxlovid rebound", a phenomenon in which symptoms (and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity) would initially resolve, but after finishing treatment, symptoms and test positivity would return. We used a previously described parsimonious mathematical model of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection to model the effect of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment in unvaccinated and vaccinated patients. Model simulations show that viral rebound after treatment occurs only in vaccinated patients, while unvaccinated (SARS-COV-2 naïve) patients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir do not experience any rebound in viral load. This work suggests that an approach combining parsimonious models of the immune system could be used to gain important insights in the context of emerging pathogens.

### Gilbert syndrome and the development of antiretroviral therapy-associated hyperbilirubinemia [^112t2hog]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from Gilbert syndrome and from antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing protease inhibitors. An understanding of the interaction between genetic predisposition and ART may help to identify individuals at highest risk for developing jaundice.

Methods

We quantified the contribution of UGT1A1*28 and ART to hyperbilirubinemia by longitudinally modeling 1386 total bilirubin levels in 96 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals during a median of 6 years.

Results

The estimated average bilirubin level was 8.8 micromol/L (0.51 mg/dL). Atazanavir increased bilirubin levels by 15 mu mol/L (0.87 mg/dL), and indinavir increased bilirubin levels by 8 micromol/L (0.46 mg/dL). Ritonavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir had no or minimal effect on bilirubin levels. Homozygous UGT1A1*28 increased bilirubin levels by 5.2 micromol/L (0.3 mg/dL). As a consequence, 67% of individuals homozygous for UGT1A1*28 and receiving atazanavir or indinavir had ≥ 2 episodes of hyperbilirubinemia in the jaundice range (> 43 micromol/L [> 2.5 mg/dL]), versus 7% of those with the common allele and not receiving either of those protease inhibitors (P < .001). Efavirenz resulted in decreased bilirubin levels, which is consistent with the induction of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1.

Conclusions

Genotyping for UGT1A1*28 before initiation of ART would identify HIV-infected individuals at risk for hyperbilirubinemia and decrease episodes of jaundice.

### Vaccines and therapeutics for immunocompromised patients with COVID-19 [^116teKNf]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Antiviral therapy

Nirmatrelvir dramatically reduces risk of hospitalization and death in high-risk outpatients with COVID-19. It is co-packaged with the pharmacologic booster ritonavir (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir; Paxlovid). Ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and as such significantly and dangerously increases the serum levels of drugs such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, everolimus and sirolimus, which are frequently used in immunocompromised patients (particularly transplant recipients). Use of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir should be approached with extreme caution in transplant recipients.

Molnupiravir is the other major orally available antiviral agent. It does not have the drug interactions associated with ritonavir, but is contraindicated in patients under 18 and in pregnancy as it may harm bone and cartilage growth and can cause embryo-fetal toxicities. Molnupiravir efficacy is uncertain. There are also concerns that this drug may drive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 mutations to potentially generate variants of concern, and have long-term risk for mutagenicity in humans. Both of these concerns are heightened in immunocompromised patients. In unvaccinated outpatients with COVID-19, its use was associated with moderate reductions in hospitalizations and deaths but its efficacy in vaccinated people is less clear. An open labeled study of over 25,000 vaccinated outpatients (about 9% of which were immunocompromised), which compared molnupiravir to usual care, showed that molnupiravir treatment resulted in more rapid time to recovery, but did not reduce need for hospitalization (1% in both groups). Of note, the highest risk patients in either arm were eligible to also receive mAb, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and those in the usual care arm could even receive molnupiravir. Although no head-to-head RCTs have been performed comparing the two orally available drugs, response rate outcomes from an observational comparative study in Hong Kong suggest that nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is the more effective of the two drugs.

Harms — nirmatrelvir/ritonavir emphasize safety signals and interactions: Limited evidence from hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 receiving nirmatrelvir/ritonavir suggest increased serious adverse events and adverse events (RR 1.20; 95% CI: 0.38, 3.84; low CoE and RR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.65, 3.04; low CoE). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were not reported in the FDA EUA. Given co-formulation with ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic booster, there is potential for significant drug interactions. Contraindications exist between agents that can have their levels increased or decreased by nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir and agents that can increase the metabolism of the components of nirmatrelvir and/or ritonavir, resulting in a loss of virologic response and possible resistance. These drug interactions can result in treatment failure or serious adverse events.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

PAXLOVID is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions [e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Stevens-Johnson syndrome] to its active ingredients (nirmatrelvir or ritonavir) or any other components of the product.

PAXLOVID is contraindicated with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions and drugs that are strong CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced nirmatrelvir or ritonavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance. There are certain other drugs for which concomitant use with PAXLOVID should be avoided and/or dose adjustment, interruption, or therapeutic monitoring is recommended. Drugs listed in this section are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all drugs that may be contraindicated with PAXLOVID. The healthcare provider should consult other appropriate resources such as the prescribing information for the interacting drug for comprehensive information on dosing or monitoring with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor like PAXLOVID [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]:

### Hyperbilirubinaemia in HIV-HCV co-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy: drug effect or liver disease severity? [^11656cDd]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As long-term prognosis of HIV continues to improve, clinicians are tasked with identifying and treating non-HIV comorbidities. Of these various comorbidities, liver disease has become an increasingly frequent non-HIV cause of death, particularly in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV. Co-infected patients represent a significant portion of the HIV-infected population, with the rate of HIV–HCV co-infection in the USA and Europe estimated to be approximately 33%, varying widely depending on the presumed mode of HIV transmission.

As such, prompt recognition, evaluation, and treatment of liver disease in this patient population is of great importance. While HIV–HCV co-infected patients are at risk for developing primary hepatic dysfunction, a number of HAART medications are commonly implicated in the development of abnormal liver function tests. The severity of these adverse effects is broad, with presentations ranging from benign, self-limited HB to severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The majority of hepatotoxicity was observed with first-generation PIs introduced in the mid-1990s, most significantly high-dose ritonavir (incidence of severe hepatotoxicity 5.3–9.5%), with recent iterations of PIs such as ATZ, IND, nelfinavir and ritonavir-boosted PIs being much less likely to cause significant elevation in liver enzymes. Instead, these drugs are commonly implicated in the development of HB via drug-induced inhibition of the bilirubin conjugation enzyme bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. This results in impaired conjugation and excretion of bilirubin, creating a pattern of unconjugated HB similar to that found in Gilbert's syndrome.

### Innovative randomized phase I study and dosing regimen selection to accelerate and inform pivotal COVID-19 trial of nirmatrelvir [^116BvkqS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a continued leading cause of hospitalization and death. Safe, efficacious COVID‐19 antivirals are needed urgently. Nirmatrelvir (PF‐07321332), the first orally bioavailable, severe acute respiratory syndrome‐coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) M pro inhibitor against the coronaviridae family, has demonstrated potent preclinical antiviral activity and benign safety profile. We report safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data of nirmatrelvir with and without ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, from an accelerated randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase I study. Two interleaving single‐ascending dose (SAD) cohorts were evaluated in a three‐period crossover. Multiple‐ascending dose (MAD) with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily (b.i.d.) dosing was evaluated over 10 days in five parallel cohorts. Safety was assessed, including in a supratherapeutic exposure cohort. Dose and dosing regimen for clinical efficacy evaluation in phase II/III clinical trials were supported by integrating modeling and simulations of SAD/MAD data with nonclinical data and a quantitative systems pharmacology model (QSP). In SAD, MAD, and supratherapeutic exposure cohorts, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was safe and well‐tolerated. Nirmatrelvir exposure and half‐life were considerably increased by ritonavir, enabling selection of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir dose and regimen for phase II/III trials (300/100 mg b.i.d.), to achieve concentrations continuously above those required for 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro. The QSP model suggested that a 5‐day regimen would significantly decrease viral load in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected patients which may prevent development of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. In conclusion, an innovative and seamless trial design expedited establishment of phase I safety and pharmacokinetics of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, enabling high confidence in phase II/III dose selection and accelerated pivotal trials' initiation (NCT04756531).

### Pharmacokinetics of oral nirmatrelvir / ritonavir, a protease inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, in subjects with renal impairment [^1128d2cT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Predicted nirmatrelvir C trough plasma concentrations by dosing regimen and clearance. Open circles represent predicted C trough; red symbols represent group means; blue lines represent 10th and 90th percentiles; red dashed line is EC 90 of 292 ng/mL for SARS‐CoV‐2. (a) 150/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir every 12 hours, with clearance reduced by one‐half (i.e. moderate renal impairment); (b) 300/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir every 12 hours, with clearance reduced by one‐third (i.e. mild renal impairment); (c) 300/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir every 12 hours, with no reduction in clearance (reference group). C trough, trough concentration; EC 90, 90% effective concentration; SARS‐CoV‐2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

In light of these results, no change in dose is recommended for mild renal impairment (i.e. 300/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily for 5 days). A dose reduction to 150/100 mg nirmatrelvir/ritonavir twice daily for 5 days is recommended for moderate renal impairment; nirmatrelvir is not currently recommended in severe renal impairment until further PK and safety data are collected and a suitable formulation becomes available.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Contraception

Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

In HIV-infected patients age greater than 1 month to 21 years, the antiviral activity and adverse event profile seen during clinical trials and through postmarketing experience were similar to that for adult patients.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of ritonavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment of ritonavir is necessary for patients with either mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Long-term stroke and mortality risk reduction associated with acute-phase paxlovid use in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [^113ET9Ch]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

This retrospective cohort study investigated whether Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) use during the acute phase of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 reduces the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke occurring more than 3 months post-diagnosis, a condition classified as long COVID. Utilizing TriNetX electronic health records comprising 118 million patients in the United States, adults aged 18 years or older with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses from 2022 to 2023 were categorized into Paxlovid (administered within 5 days of diagnosis) and non-Paxlovid groups. Exclusion criteria included prior cerebrovascular disease, mortality within 3 months, use of specific antivirals, and severe clinical conditions such as ICU admission, intubation, mechanical support, SpO₂ < 90%, respiratory rate > 30/min, sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The index date was the initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio controlled for confounding factors, and stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and mortality were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Among 181992 matched pairs, Paxlovid use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.80–0.89) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.63–0.73) during the long COVID period, defined as more than 90 days post-diagnosis. Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent protective effects across age, sex, BMI, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, and vaccination status. Notably, older adults (HR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.76–0.86) and individuals with metabolic conditions, including obesity (HR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78–0.96), exhibited pronounced benefits, and the protective effects were observed irrespective of vaccination status. These findings highlight that Paxlovid use during the acute phase of COVID-19 significantly reduces the risk of long-term cerebrovascular events and mortality, emphasizing its critical role in mitigating long-term complications associated with COVID-19.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — ambulatory mild-to-moderate disease and inhaled corticosteroids: The guideline panel suggests against inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The panel notes drug–drug interaction concerns, stating more information is needed about the interaction of inhaled corticosteroids with a 5-day course of ritonavir as part of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir treatment, and cautions that when potent CYP 3A4 pharmacokinetic boosters like ritonavir or cobicistat are utilized for durations greater than 5 days in patients with HIV or hepatitis C, most inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended for coadministration due to the risk of Cushing's syndrome and adrenal suppression, which may be a consideration when prescribing inhaled steroids if concomitantly used with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

### Molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir plus usual care versus usual care alone in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^111NfRos]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

The study RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) was published by RECOVERY Collaborative Group. and colleagues in 2025 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the trial question was: what is the role of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19? In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the population was: 137 patients (60 female, 77 male). The inclusion criteria were patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The key exclusion criteria were first trimester of pregnancy; severe liver impairment; severe renal impairment; receipt of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir during current illness; receipt of a concomitant medication with CYP3A4 dependent metabolism risking a severe drug-drug interaction. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the interventions were: n = 68 nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (at a dose of 300 mg/100 mg PO BID for 5 days plus standard of care) n = 69 usual care (standard of care only). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death at day 28 (19% vs. 19%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.23). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of discharged alive within 28 days (71% vs. 78%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.2) No significant difference in invasive mechanical ventilation or death (21% vs. 19%; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.08) No significant difference in receipt of ventilation (8% vs. 17%; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.33). In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the RECOVERY (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) study, the conclusion was: in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir was not superior to usual care with respect to death at day 28.
