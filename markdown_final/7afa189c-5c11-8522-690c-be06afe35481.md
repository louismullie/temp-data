## Question

Treatment of severe cellulitis in a patient with liver cirrhosis who got cut in the lake of the leg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of severe cellulitis in a patient with liver cirrhosis who sustained a freshwater laceration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the likely pathogens from freshwater exposure and how cirrhosis shifts the microbiology. Next, I will review empiric antibiotic choices and dosing, including MRSA and gram-negative coverage, and confirm duration. After that, I need to check indications for surgical consultation and debridement. I will then consider disposition, monitoring, and adjustments based on cultures. Finally, I should address special issues in cirrhosis, including renal dosing, antifungal considerations, and recurrence prevention, and close with a concise, actionable plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and severity. Severe cellulitis in a cirrhotic patient after a freshwater laceration implies systemic involvement or risk of rapid deterioration, and cirrhosis confers immunocompromise with higher risks of sepsis, necrotizing infection, and mortality, so I should not under-treat or delay escalation [^e957fa91] [^06804ee3] [^68ebd76d].

> Wait, let me verify the likely pathogens from freshwater exposure. Aeromonas hydrophila is the most dangerous freshwater pathogen and can cause rapidly progressive cellulitis and necrotizing soft tissue infection, particularly after traumatic inoculation, so empiric therapy must cover gram-negative rods including Aeromonas and Pseudomonas, while also remembering that cirrhosis increases the risk of gram-negative bacteremia from bacterial translocation, so I should maintain broad gram-negative coverage until cultures return [^4804e6bc] [^be49dc8f] [^57892661].

> I should confirm the empiric antibiotic regimen. For severe infection with systemic signs or concern for necrotizing disease, vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam is a guideline-supported backbone that covers MRSA and broad gram-negatives including Pseudomonas and many Aeromonas species; if piperacillin-tazobactam is unavailable or contraindicated, vancomycin plus a carbapenem such as meropenem is reasonable, and in penicillin-allergic patients, vancomycin plus a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin can be used, recognizing that some Aeromonas are resistant to fluoroquinolones and that local susceptibility patterns should guide choices [^5d934d82] [^955c5117] [^88d90fb3].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing and pharmacokinetics in cirrhosis. Standard vancomycin dosing with early trough or AUC monitoring is appropriate, and piperacillin-tazobactam should be renally dosed given the high risk of AKI in cirrhosis; if creatinine clearance is reduced, extend the interval or reduce the dose per institutional protocols, and consider early clinical response assessment at 48–72 hours to de-escalate if improving [^notfound].

> Next, I should review duration and when to narrow. If the patient improves clinically, 7–10 days is typical for severe cellulitis, but I need to ensure at least 5 days of effective therapy and extend if there is slow response or deeper infection; once cultures return, I should narrow to the narrowest effective agent, and if Aeromonas is identified, a fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin may suffice depending on susceptibilities, whereas Pseudomonas typically warrants piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem [^d3b916cf] [^88d90fb3].

> I will now examine the need for surgical consultation. Any signs of necrotizing infection such as pain out of proportion, anesthesia, crepitus, skin necrosis, or systemic toxicity mandate urgent surgical evaluation and debridement within 12 hours when feasible, as delays worsen outcomes; even without clear necrosis, early surgical input is prudent in cirrhosis given rapid deterioration risk [^86bff444] [^09fb3c53].

> Let me consider disposition and monitoring. Given cirrhosis and severe infection, hospitalization is indicated for IV therapy, close hemodynamic and renal monitoring, and frequent reassessment of the limb; I should monitor for sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, and AKI, and escalate to ICU if there is hemodynamic instability or organ dysfunction, aligning with cirrhosis-specific sepsis principles [^83fdbfec] [^68ebd76d].

> But wait, what if cultures reveal fungi rather than bacteria. In immunocompromised hosts, including cirrhosis, fungal cellulitis can occur and may be missed if I assume bacterial disease; if there is poor response to appropriate antibacterial therapy or risk factors, I should obtain tissue for histology and culture and consider empiric antifungal therapy such as an echinocandin or lipid amphotericin while awaiting results, as illustrated by case reports of Candida tropicalis cellulitis in cirrhosis [^42fae864].

> I should double-check recurrence prevention once the acute episode resolves. Cirrhotic patients have high recurrence rates for cellulitis, and small studies suggest that prophylactic antibiotics such as norfloxacin or rifaximin at discharge reduce recurrence, though this remains controversial and should be individualized; concurrently, I must address predisposing factors like edema, skin breakdown, and toe-web infections to durably lower risk [^f7739a4b] [^f97f9913].

> Let me reconsider the overall plan to ensure internal consistency. Immediate IV vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam, early surgical consultation, hospitalization with close monitoring, cultures of blood and any purulent material, and de-escalation at 48–72 hours based on response and cultures are the pillars; I should maintain a low threshold to escalate to ICU care and broaden to antifungals if the clinical trajectory is atypical or refractory, and I should plan for at least 7–10 days of therapy if severe, adjusting to clinical response and culture data [^5d934d82] [^83fdbfec] [^86bff444].

For severe cellulitis in cirrhosis after a freshwater cut, **start IV vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam** to cover MRSA and gram-negatives (including Aeromonas) [^5d934d82] [^4804e6bc]. If Vibrio is suspected from saltwater exposure, add **doxycycline 100 mg IV/PO BID** [^bbfaeafd]. Give **early surgical consult** for necrotizing infection or compartment syndrome [^09fb3c53] [^86bff444]. Treat for 7–14 days, adjusting to clinical response and culture results, and monitor closely for sepsis, AKI, and hepatic decompensation [^e957fa91] [^68ebd76d].

---

## Clinical assessment and risk stratification

Assess severity by looking for **systemic toxicity** (fever, tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status) and local signs of **necrotizing infection** (pain out of proportion, crepitus, bullae, skin necrosis) [^0cca2533]. Cirrhosis increases the risk of **rapid progression to sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, and mortality**, so early aggressive management is essential [^06804ee3] [^68ebd76d].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should cover **MRSA, gram-negatives (including Pseudomonas and Aeromonas), and gram-positives** [^5d934d82] [^4804e6bc].

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV q8–12h | MRSA coverage | - First-line for severe SSTI with MRSA risk [^5d934d82] <br/> - Adjust dose for renal function [^notfound] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h | - Gram-negatives <br/> - Including Pseudomonas and Aeromonas | - Broad gram-negative coverage [^notfound] <br/> - Including freshwater pathogens [^notfound] |
| Doxycycline 100 mg IV/PO BID | Add if Vibrio suspected (saltwater exposure) | - Covers Vibrio vulnificus [^bbfaeafd] <br/> - Rapid bacteriostatic activity |

---

## Adjunctive measures

- **Early surgical consultation**: For suspected necrotizing infection, compartment syndrome, or failure to improve [^09fb3c53] [^86bff444].
- **Wound care**: Debridement, irrigation, and elevation of the limb [^8292b17d] [^83fdbfec].
- **Supportive care**: Fluid resuscitation, pain control, and monitoring for complications (sepsis, AKI, hepatic encephalopathy) [^68ebd76d].

---

## Duration of therapy and monitoring

Treat for **7–14 days**, tailoring to clinical response and culture results. Monitor for clinical improvement (reduced erythema, pain, and systemic symptoms), and watch for complications such as sepsis, AKI, and hepatic encephalopathy [^68ebd76d].

---

## Special considerations in cirrhosis

- **Altered pharmacokinetics**: Adjust antibiotic dosing for hepatic impairment and renal function [^notfound].
- **Increased risk of nephrotoxicity**: Monitor renal function closely, especially with vancomycin [^f8a54429].
- **Fungal infections**: Consider Candida in refractory cases or immunocompromised hosts [^42fae864].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Empiric therapy**: Vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam; add doxycycline if Vibrio is suspected [^5d934d82] [^bbfaeafd].
- **Duration**: 7–14 days, adjusted to clinical response.
- **Adjuncts**: Early surgical consultation, wound care, and supportive management [^09fb3c53] [^83fdbfec].
- **Monitoring**: Close observation for clinical response and complications [^68ebd76d].

---

Severe cellulitis in cirrhosis after a freshwater cut requires **broad-spectrum empiric therapy** with vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam, early surgical evaluation, and close monitoring for complications. Adjust therapy to culture results and clinical response, and maintain vigilance for sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Treatment of bacterial infections

The commonest infection in cirrhotic patients is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), followed by urinary tract infection, pneumonia, bacteremia following a therapeutic procedure, cellulitis, and spontaneous bacteremia. Culture positive infections are reported in 50-70% of cases. The causative organisms of community acquired infection are Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), especially Escherichia coli (E. coli), in about 60%, Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in about 30-35% and mixed in 5-10%. The figures are reversed for nosocomial infections; 60% GPC and 30-35% GNB, due to previous antibiotic exposure. With E. coli being the commonest in community, the next most frequently isolated bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). In the case of SBP, less-virulent strains of E. coli may be causative as liver function deteriorates, suggesting that in advanced cirrhosis, bacteria do not need to develop strategies to confound host defences and invade the host. Fungal infections (Candida spp.) are responsible for up to 15% of severe sepsis in patients with cirrhosis.

Pregnancy

All β-lactams are considered safe during pregnancy. Amikacin and gentamicin have no fetal toxicity at standard doses and can be prescribed, preferably once daily. Vancomycin should be preferred to daptomycin and linezolid, as there is limited data available on the latter two antibiotics in pregnant patients. Among fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin has the most extensive safety data and should be preferred to levofloxacin.

Specific pathogens

Infections caused by Vibrio spp. (primarily V. vulnificus but also occasionally V. alginolyticus non-serogroup 01, V. cholerae, and V. parahaemolyticus), can complicate traumatic wound sustained in saltwater (or brackish inland waters) or from exposure to drippings from raw seafood and subsequently progress to NSTIs. A rapidly progressive primary bacteremia caused by V. vulnificus may occur after entry of the organism through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. consumption of raw oysters) rather than through abraded skin. NSTI often occurs rapidly after the bacteremia. Hepatic diseases are associated with infections and complications from V. vulnificus. Tetracyclines have been considered for the treatment of V. vulnificus infections, with cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin as alternatives. Infections caused by V. vulnificus should be considered when choosing the empirical antibiotic coverage for NSTIs occurring in warm coastal environments after the ingestion of shellfish. These infections are more frequent during the summer months and in patients with liver cirrhosis or other forms of immunosuppression.

A. hydrophila, an environmental gram-negative bacillus commonly found in lakes, rivers, and soil, may produce NSTIs following inoculation through a laceration sustained during freshwater exposure. Skin and soft-tissue infections due to Aeromonas sp. have been reported in Australia, Asia, South America, Europe and the Indian Ocean. Most isolates of Aeromonas are susceptible in vitro to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, antipseudomonal aminoglycosides, third-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems and tetracyclines. Aeromonas sp. Coverage should be considered for NSTIs occurring in aquatic environments.

### Cellulitis: a review [^e957fa91]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cellulitis is an infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting with expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness, and swelling. Cellulitis is a common global health burden, with more than 650,000 admissions per year in the United States alone.

Observations

In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million cases annually of cellulitis account for $3.7 billion in ambulatory care costs alone. The majority of cases of cellulitis are nonculturable and therefore the causative bacteria are unknown. In the 15% of cellulitis cases in which organisms are identified, most are due to β-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. There are no effective diagnostic modalities, and many clinical conditions appear similar. Treatment of primary and recurrent cellulitis should initially cover Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, with expansion for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in cases of cellulitis associated with specific risk factors, such as athletes, children, men who have sex with men, prisoners, military recruits, residents of long-term care facilities, those with prior MRSA exposure, and intravenous drug users. Five days of treatment is sufficient with extension if symptoms are not improved. Addressing predisposing factors can minimize risk of recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

The diagnosis of cellulitis is based primarily on history and physical examination. Treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis should be directed against Streptococcus and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Failure to improve with appropriate first-line antibiotics should prompt consideration for resistant organisms, secondary conditions that mimic cellulitis, or underlying complicating conditions such as immunosuppression, chronic liver disease, or chronic kidney disease.

Erysipelas and cellulitis—evaluation and treatment recommendations are as follows: Cultures of blood or cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs are not routinely recommended (strong, moderate). Cultures of blood are recommended (strong, moderate), and cutaneous and microscopic examination of cutaneous aspirates, biopsies, or swabs should be considered in patients with malignancy on chemotherapy, neutropenia, severe cell-mediated immunodeficiency, immersion injuries, and animal bites (weak, moderate). Typical cases of cellulitis without systemic signs of infection should receive an antimicrobial agent that is active against streptococci (mild; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). For cellulitis with systemic signs of infection (moderate nonpurulent SSTI; Figure 1) systemic antibiotics are indicated. Many clinicians could include coverage against MSSA (weak, low). For patients whose cellulitis is associated with penetrating trauma, evidence of MRSA infection elsewhere, nasal colonization with MRSA, injection drug use, or SIRS (severe nonpurulent; Figure 1), vancomycin or another antimicrobial effective against both MRSA and streptococci is recommended (strong, moderate). In severely compromised patients (as defined in question 13), broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage may be considered (weak, moderate). Vancomycin plus either piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem-meropenem is recommended as a reasonable empiric regimen for severe infection (strong, moderate). The recommended duration of antimicrobial therapy is 5 days, but treatment should be extended if the infection has not improved within this time period (strong, high). Elevation of the affected area and treatment of predisposing factors, such as edema or underlying cutaneous disorders, are recommended (strong, moderate). In lower extremity cellulitis, clinicians should carefully examine the interdigital toe spaces because treating fissuring, scaling, or maceration may eradicate colonization with pathogens and reduce the incidence of recurrent infection (strong, moderate). Outpatient therapy is recommended for patients who do not have SIRS, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability (mild nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate). Hospitalization is recommended if there is concern for a deeper or necrotizing infection, for patients with poor adherence to therapy, for infection in a severely immunocompromised patient, or if outpatient treatment is failing (moderate or severe nonpurulent; Figure 1) (strong, moderate).

- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors increase a person's risk. Breaks in the skin Disruption of the cutaneous barrier is a risk factor for developing cellulitis:
- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Fungal skin infections
- Injection drug use
- Injuries and wounds.

Medical conditions
- Chronic edema
- Impaired lymphatic drainage of the limbs
- Obesity
- Venous insufficiency Increased risk for repeat infections The following conditions increase a person's risk of recurrent cellulitis infections:
- Impaired lymphatic drainage of the limbs
- Venous insufficiency
- Due to saphenous vein removal for coronary artery bypass grafting. Treatment Never delay the initiation of treatment while waiting for culture results. Use culture results, when available, to tailor antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep. Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:
- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis.

### Risk factors and antibiotic prophylaxis of cellulitis in cirrhosis [^e0e9b0a4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We read the article by Hamza et al with great interest. The authors have investigated the risk factors and whether antibiotic prophylaxis helps prevent recurrence of cellulitis in cirrhosis. We agree with the authors that bacterial infections are frequent in cirrhotic patients because of their defective defense mechanisms and that these infections precipitate decompensation of cirrhosis. Of note, an association between high MELD for end-stage liver disease score and hepatic encephalopathy with cellulitis are expected as mentioned in phase 1 results of the study.

However, since the most common infection in advanced cirrhosis is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), antibiotics for selective intestinal decontamination, such as quinolones, are often prescribed as prophylaxis against SBP recurrence. The effect of widespread norfloxacin use on the epidemiology of severe infections in cirrhotic patients is poorly known. A 5-year retrospective study evaluated the effect of long-term administration of norfloxacin on the epidemiology of severe hospital-acquired infections and showed that long-term norfloxacin administration resulted in a sharp increase in staphylococcal SBP and bacteremia, while the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and streptococci fell and did not change, respectively.

Although gram-negative bacteria-induced cellulitis has been reported in cirrhotic patients, gram-positive bacteria are still the predominant organism isolated from cellulitis. Recommended use of broad-spectrum antibiotics as prophylactic treatment of such patients may lead to the emergence of gram-positive pathogens rather than preventation of skin infections.

Discussion

To date, there are only very few studies in the literature conducted to assess the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhotic patients. In this hospital-based case-control study we found that hypoalbuminemia, high MELD score, and HE are the factors significantly associated with cellulitis in cirrhotic patients.

In our study, MELD score >15 (OR 2.95, CI 1.39-6.27) was observed as a significant risk factor for cellulitis. Poor liver function results in increased susceptibility to infection due to immune system defects, including the defective bactericidal function of immunoglobulin, decreased polymorphonuclear leukocyte activity, complement deficiency, and reduced number of Kupffer cells. The majority of cellulitis patients (68%) belonged to Child C status. Gut BT is found to be significantly increased in Child C than in Child A and B patients. However, our study did not show Child to be a significant variable. This could be due to the fact that the control group were selected from the patients who were admitted with complications of cirrhosis (other than cellulitis), which might have reflected as high CTP score in the control group.

Our data showed that low serum albumin (<2.5 g/dL, OR 2.80, CI 1.32-5.92) is significantly associated with the development of cellulitis. This finding is comparable with the observation in another south Indian study. This finding also points to the fact that poor functional status of the liver is the predisposing factor for cellulitis in cirrhosis. Other studies have shown that in cellulitis patients, hypoalbuminemia is significantly associated with mortality in cirrhotic patients as well as the general population.

In our study, HE was significantly associated with cellulitis in cirrhotic patients (OR 2.95, CI 1.01-8.45). This association of HE with cellulitis could be either a cause or an effect. Cellulitis may be the predisposing factor for HE. Bacterial translocation is considered to be important in the pathogenesis of both HE and cellulitis. The gut mucosa of cirrhotic patients is more permeable to bacteria than normal mucosa. Portal systemic shunt circulation in cirrhotic patients will help the organism that gained access to the gastrointestinal tract to escape phagocytosis by hepatic reticuloendothelial system, thereby establishing systemic bacteremia. This bacteremia may result either in primary septicemia or localized infections like cellulitis. Likewise, because of the hepatocyte dysfunction and portosystemic shunting there are increased circulating levels of ammonia, primarily produced in the colon, which is the major neurotoxin involved in HE. On the other hand, HE in cirrhotic patients may predispose them to minor injuries of the lower limbs, of which the patient may be unaware, or they may neglect it due to encephalopathy. These injuries serve as an entry port of bacteria and subsequently develop cellulitis. Our patients had both cellulitis and HE on admission and we could not establish which event occurred first.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin (burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers)?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in the prevention of infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic, and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. In general, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites, respectively.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders (e.g. S. aureus and GAS). Along with Staphylococcus ssp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus ssp. (including S. pyogenes), the commonly isolated pathogens include Pasteurella spp. (Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis), Capnocytophagia canimorsus, anaerobes (Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp.), and others. Streptococci can be isolated from 50% of human bite wounds, S. aureus from 40%, and Eikenella corrodens (a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus) from 30%. Human bites can transmit HBV, HCV, and HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in every case.

Water-Associated Infections—Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) can occur after exposure to fresh, brackish, or salt water, particularly if the skin's surface is compromised, including from abrasions or lacerations during swimming or wading, bites or stings from marine or aquatic creatures, and punctures from fishhooks. The most virulent SSTI associated with marine and estuarine exposures are due to Vibrio vulnificus and related non-cholera Vibrio spp., whereas for freshwater exposures Aeromonas hydrophila is the most dangerous pathogen. Manifestations can include abscess formation, cellulitis, ecthyma gangrenosum, and necrotizing fasciitis. Pending identification of a specific organism, treat acute infections related to aquatic injury with an antibiotic that provides both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage (e.g., fluoroquinolone or third-generation cephalosporin).

### Authors' reply [^0c369ecf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

We appreciate the comments of Dr. Basyigit on our recent study showing that antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients can reduce recurrence of cellulitis mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria. Dr. Basyigit’s concern on the increased gram-negative cellulitis found in our cirrhotic patients is based on a recent study that reported gram-positive bacteria as a common cause of cellulitis in the general population, and not particularly in cirrhotics. To support our findings, relative literature has already been cited. In a position statement, based on EASL special conference 2013, the role of bacterial translocation as cause for infection in cirrhotic patients has clearly been pointed out. Dr. Basyigit posed the possibility that drug-resistant bacteria might emerge using antibiotic prophylaxis. Though it might be true, antibiotic prophylaxis is still being used to prevent conditions such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis thereby reducing mortality. Finally, Dr. Basyigit claimed that antibiotic prophylaxis will lead to resistant microorganisms rather than prevention from skin infection. We strongly oppose this view because bacterial infection increases 3.75-fold the mortality of patients with decompensated cirrhosis, reaching a rate of 30% at 1 month and 63% at 1 year. If we can prevent recurrence of bacterial cellulitis in cirrhotic patients as we have shown in our study, it might help reduce mortality. However, since we have not examined the benefit from the prevention of cellulitis recurrence on the mortality of cirrhotic patients, further studies are warranted to elucidate this issue.

Treatment

The patients were initially treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nineteen patients (27%) were switched over to piperacillin- tazobactam due to poor response to cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was initiated for one patient with Pseudomonas infection, linezolid was given to patients with MRSA and cefoperazone for 2 patients with Klebsiella infection as per culture and sensitivity. There was a significant difference in the mean number of days of hospitalization, among cases (6.4 days) and controls (5 days) P=013.

Risk factors of cellulitis

On univariate analysis, presence of diabetes, HE, platelet count, serum albumin level, and MELD score showed a significant difference between cases and controls. On logistic regression (Table 3), HE (P=0.048, OR 2.925, C.I 1.012-8.458), albumin <2.5 g/dL (P=0.007, OR 2.804, CI 1.328-5.922), and MELD score >15 (P=0.005, OR 2.958, CI 1.395-6.27) showed significant differences between the two groups.

Recurrence and mortality

On follow up in phase 2, out of 61 cellulitis cases, 12 (20%) had recurrence of cellulitis within 6 months. Of these, 51 were in group 1 (those patients who were started on antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of discharge) and 10 patients were in group 2 (discharged without antibiotic prophylaxis). The recurrence rate in group 1 was 14% (7/51) whereas in group 2 it was 50% (5/10) which was statistically significant (P=0.048), with a relative risk of 0.27 and the NNT was 3. Table 4 shows baseline characteristics of group 1 and group 2. In univariate analysis none of the other variables showed a significant difference between these two groups. Logistic regression showed that antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the recurrence of cellulitis (P=0.011, OR 0.099, CI 0.017-0.583) (Table 5).

Water and soil-borne necrotizing infections

Aeromonas hydrophila is a rod-shaped, motile, and Gram-negative bacterium. It is found in wastewater, sewage, and food. Wound infection of A. hydrophila in humans is the second most frequent after oral infection and is associated with traumatic events and wounds exposed to water and soil. Most cases of A. hydrophila wound infection occur in healthy people. In particular, A. hydrophila wound infection is reported following natural disasters, such as the tsunami and hurricane. The wound infections due to A. hydrophila can progress rapidly to NSTIs.

Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic, Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the Vibrio genus and Vibrionaceae family.

V. vulnificus can be transmitted through the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish, and skin exposure to contaminated seawater. The sensitivity of the host is crucial for the development of V. vulnificus infection, which commonly occurs in patients with chronic liver diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hemochromatosis. The wound infections due to V. vulnificus can progress to NSTIs.

Mortality for V. vulnificus serious wound infections have been shown to increase with greater delays between onset of illness and initiation of antibiotic treatment and aggressive debridement. Thus, patients with a presumptive diagnosis of V. vulnificus should be treated immediately by antibiotics and managed aggressively by a prompt debridement and resuscitation in an intensive care unit to minimize the possible consequences of hypotension, septic shock, and the risk of multiorgan system failure.

The contact history of patients with a rapid onset of cellulitis can alert clinicians to a differential diagnosis of soft-tissue infection with V vulnificus (contact with seawater) or A. hydrophila (contact with fresh or brackish water, soil, or wood).

Patients and methods

Study design and setting

The study was conducted in two phases (Phase 1 and Phase 2), in the Medical Gastroenterology department of a tertiary care hospital in South India. Phase 1 was a case control study to identify the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis. Consecutive patients admitted with cirrhosis and cellulitis (n=70), between August 2011 and August 2013 were included as cases. Controls were age- and sex-matched cirrhotic patients without cellulitis or without past history of cellulitis, selected from the same center (n=73). Patients with a history of significant trauma and known cases of filariasis were excluded. Cellulitis was diagnosed by the presence of erythema, warmth and swelling of the affected area. Doppler ultrasound was used to exclude deep vein thrombosis in suspicious cases.

Phase 2 was a cohort study to look for the role of antibiotics in preventing recurrence of cellulitis in cirrhosis. Of the 70 cases with cellulitis in phase 1, five died during admission, four were lost to follow up, and the rest of the 61 cases were included in phase 2.

Method of patient evaluation

In phase 1, data regarding age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, comorbidities, duration of liver disease, site of cellulitis, Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, presence of edema, ascites, SBP, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), acute kidney injury (AKI), alcoholic hepatitis (AH), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), hemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, international normalized ratio, serum creatinine, bilirubin, albumin, and sodium levels were collected and compared with those of controls. Report of blood culture or culture from the infected skin was also noted.

In phase 2, two cohorts were identified from cellulitis cases of phase 1 based on the initiation of antibiotic (norfloxacin or rifaximin) at the time of discharge (as primary or secondary prophylaxis for SBP, or for HE). Those who were initiated on antibiotic prophylaxis were assigned to group 1 and those who were not initiated on antibiotic prophylaxis were assigned to group 2. Both groups were followed up and data regarding recurrence of cellulitis within six months were collected. We compared the recurrence of cellulitis between the two groups.

The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and the hospital review board.

### Clinical and epidemiologic characteristics and therapeutic management of patients with Vibrio infections, bay of biscay, France, 2001-2019 [^ed7e9130]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Some opportunistic pathogens associated with marine environments are already known but until now have caused rare infectious diseases. Among those pathogens are Vibrio spp. other than the well-known V. cholerae belonging to serogroups O1 and O139, which causes cholera. Vibrio spp. are gram negative, curved, rod-shaped bacteria that are natural inhabitants of the aquatic environment. Vibrio infections can be very severe or even fatal; they cause gastroenteritis, severe bacterial cellulitis, or necrotizing fasciitis and can lead to septic shock. Infections are more common in patients with multiple underlying conditions, including liver disease, heart failure, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, and immunocompromising conditions (–). Vibrio spp. can also cause mild diseases, such as chronic ear infections, which are more likely to affect younger patients. Humans acquire Vibrio infections after eating contaminated raw seafood, especially oysters, or after exposing an injury to the marine environment. Infections occur mainly during the hot summer months, which is probably attributable to higher water temperatures and to increased seawater-related activities.

Because vibriosis is a relatively rare disease and is not reported in most national surveillance systems, the global incidence rate of Vibrio spp. infections other than V. cholerae O1/O139 is underestimated. In the United States, where those infections are notifiable, a marked seasonal distribution and an increasing incidence rate have been observed (–). Because of their rarity, Vibrio infections are very poorly known and therefore probably underdiagnosed. Delays in therapeutic management and, in particular, in the prescription of a targeted antibiotic regimen have been documented. Our study aimed to make an inventory of Vibrio infections diagnosed in hospitals in the Bay of Biscay on the west coast of France and to describe the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of the patients and their therapeutic management.

### Risk factors for the outcome of cirrhotic patients with soft tissue infections [^06804ee3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Goal

The aims of this study were to identify risk factors that influence outcomes of cirrhotic patients with soft tissue infections and to describe specific management for such patients.

Background

Soft tissue infections account for 11% of infections overall in cirrhotic patients and the severe form of necrotizing infection carries a high mortality rate. It is essential that clinicians make an early diagnosis and start appropriate treatment to improve outcomes of cirrhotic patients with soft tissue infections.

Methods

Cirrhotic patients who had been admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of soft tissue infection from June 1, 2003 to June 1, 2005 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and microbiologic results were recorded and compared between survivor and nonsurvivor groups.

Results

There was a total of 118 episodes of admission for soft tissue infection with 26 episodes resulting in mortality and 92 in survival. The following clinical parameters showed significant differences between the 2 groups: Child-Pugh grade C, pain, altered consciousness, emergence of hemorrhagic bullae, and local injury. The following laboratory data showed significant differences between the 2 groups: appearance of band form, serum creatinine, serum albumin below 2.5 g/dL, serum bilirubin above 3 mg/dL, and prothrombin time prolongation greater than 5 seconds. Gram-negative bacterial infection was predominant in the nonsurvivor group and was statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that the emergence of hemorrhagic bullae and Child-Pugh grade C were independent predictive factors for outcome.

Conclusions

When treating soft tissue infection in cirrhotic patients, especially in those with Child-Pugh C liver function or emergence of hemorrhagic bullae, it is essential to start surgical evaluation and specific broad-spectrum antibiotics early to reduce the high mortality associated with this disease.

Recurrent cellulitis—evaluation and prophylaxis: Identify and treat predisposing conditions such as edema, obesity, eczema, venous insufficiency, and toe web abnormalities (strong, moderate), and perform these practices as part of routine patient care and certainly during the acute stage of cellulitis (strong, moderate). Administration of prophylactic antibiotics, such as oral penicillin or erythromycin bid for 4–52 weeks, or intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, should be considered in patients who have 3–4 episodes of cellulitis per year despite attempts to treat or control predisposing factors (weak, moderate), and this program should be continued so long as the predisposing factors persist (strong, moderate).

### Distinguishing cellulitis from its noninfectious mimics: approach to the red leg [^e3b8f532]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Cellulitis is a common clinical diagnosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting; studies have demonstrated a surprisingly high misdiagnosis rate: nearly one-third of cases are other conditions (ie, pseudocellulitis). This high rate of misdiagnosis is thought to contribute to nearly $515 million in avoidable health care spending in the United States each year; leading to the delayed or missed diagnosis of pseudocellulitis and to delays in appropriate treatment. There is a broad differential diagnosis for pseudocellulitis, which includes inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions of the skin. Accurate diagnosis of the specific condition causing pseudocellulitis is crucial to management, which varies greatly.

### Management of sepsis in patients with cirrhosis: current evidence and practical approach [^68ebd76d]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sepsis in patients with cirrhosis is associated with high mortality. An impaired immune response accounts for the increased infection risk observed in these patients. Hemodynamic and systemic changes suggestive of sepsis may be observed in patients with cirrhosis in the absence of infection; therefore, diagnosis and treatment of sepsis may be delayed. The optimal management of the critically ill patient with sepsis and cirrhosis has not been well established and is generally extrapolated from consensus guidelines and expert recommendations made for management of patients without cirrhosis with sepsis. Despite the lack of strong evidence, we propose a contemporary pragmatic approach to sepsis management in patients with cirrhosis, including the choice of fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

Necrotizing fasciitis—definition, clinical features, and bacteriology are detailed. Necrotizing fasciitis is “an aggressive subcutaneous infection that tracks along the superficial fascia,” and “it is the superficial fascia that is most commonly involved.” The initial presentation “is that of cellulitis,” progressing with “systemic toxicity, often including high temperatures, disorientation, and lethargy,” and a distinguishing feature is “the wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues.” In the monomicrobial form, pathogens “are S. pyogenes, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila, and anaerobic streptococci (Peptostreptococcus),” with most infections “community acquired and present in the limbs, with approximately two-thirds in the lower extremities.” Cases after varicella or trivial injuries are “usually due to S. pyogenes,” and in group A streptococcal disease with hypotension and organ failure, mortality is “ranging from 30% to 70%.” Among S. pyogenes cases, “Nearly 50%” have “no portal of entry” and instead develop deep infection at a site of nonpenetrating trauma. Polymicrobial infection is “most commonly associated with 4 clinical settings” including perianal/abdominal sources, decubitus ulcers, injection sites in illicit drug users, and spread from genital sites.

Abdominal distension attributable to refractory ascites—palliative options and outcomes include the following: Large volume paracentesis (LVP) requires multiple visits to the hospital and can be burdensome, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an option but many patients with refractory ascites are not candidates because of encephalopathy, cardiac contraindications, or high MELD scores. Indwelling peritoneal drains or catheters have been evaluated for palliation, and a systematic review including 176 patients reported patients’ MELD scores ranged from 10 to 22, technical success was 100% with noninfectious complications generally low (<12%), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurred in 0%–42% with an overall combined rate of 17%, and other complications included cellulitis at the catheter insertion site (6%), transient hyponatremia (11%), and increased serum creatinine (8%). A 12-week, small feasibility, unblinded randomized controlled trial compared LVP to long-term abdominal drains in 36 transplant-ineligible patients with refractory ascites, noted no drain-related serious adverse events or drain removals attributable to complications, found patients in the LVP group had more than double the ascites-related hospital time than the drain group, observed self-limiting cellulitis/leakage 41% versus 11% and peritonitis 6% versus 11%, and reported overall attrition 42% with deaths 7 of 16 and 5 of 18; at study end, all surviving drain participants elected to retain the drains.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^24c981f1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhotic patients are more prone to serious bacterial infections. These infections precipitate decompensation of cirrhosis and thus lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The increased infections in cirrhotic patients are due to the defect in the immune system which includes both humoral and cellular immunity [-]. Cellulitis is one of the major bacterial infections seen in cirrhosis apart from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary and respiratory tract infections. The prevalence of cellulitis in cirrhosis is 10.5-12.5%. A nationwide population based study in Taiwan has shown that cirrhotic patients are at increased risk of cellulitis than non-cirrhotics.

Cellulitis in cirrhotic patients is different from that of the general population regarding microorganisms, pathogenesis and prognosis. Bacterial translocation (BT) from gut is postulated to be a major source of infections in cirrhosis. As opposed to cellulitis in the general population, where the major etiological organisms are gram positive bacteria (Group A streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus) cellulitis due to gram negative organisms are frequently reported in cirrhotic patients. This suggests that, as in the case of SBP, BT from the gut may play a major role in pathogenesis of cellulitis in cirrhosis. Norfloxacin prophylaxis has helped reduce the one-year probability of developing SBP from 61% to 7% and recurrence of SBP decreased from 68 to 20%. We hypothesize that in cirrhotic patients with cellulitis antibiotic prophylaxis might help prevent the recurrence of cellulitis. The present study aimed to identify the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and to assess the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing the recurrence of cellulitis.

### Outcomes among inpatients with cirrhosis andinfection in the modern era: results from an analysis of the national inpatient sample [^3a3b8e71]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

AKI is an independent prognostic risk factor for mortality among patients with CDI and without cirrhosis. Prior studies have observed that CDI was more commonly associated with concurrent AKI (35.1%) compared to urinary tract infections, pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and cellulitis in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis. While spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a strong association with both AKI and hepatorenal syndrome, CDI significantly increased the risk of both of these conditions. Our study observed that while 24.31% of patients with cirrhosis and 23.29% of patients without cirrhosis had AKI, patients with cirrhosis were less likely to develop AKI than patients without cirrhosis, another key finding of this study. This could potentially be related to the earlier recognition of AKI and hence earlier intervention in patients with cirrhosis.

While using a de-identified population database such as NIS permits the study of clinical outcomes and associations across a spectrum of the nation’s healthcare systems, it has inherent limitations. The NIS does not identify hospital-acquired vs. community-acquired CDI or distinguish recurrent hospitalizations, which are relevant risk factors in the transmission of infections. Inpatient observation and medical care received across multiple healthcare settings may be underrepresented. Lack of granular data points precluded the assessment of severity of CDI, disease recurrence, methods of testing, timing of diagnosis, and treatment. Complications including sepsis, shock, and death are presumably related to CDI, since it has been analyzed as a primary diagnosis. However, limitations of the database preclude discriminating between direct consequence vs. sequelae of critical illness or other process. Inability to review medication lists also precludes identification of potential associated protective and risk factors, implemented treatments and changes in therapy.

### When to use antibiotics in the cirrhotic patient? The evidence base [^c386ff0c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial infections are commoner in patients with cirrhosis than in the general population, and those with decompensated cirrhosis are more susceptible to infection than those with a compensated lesion. The absence of clinical signs of infection in the cirrhotic patient is frequent, and the limited diagnostic capacity of C-reactive protein and systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria in the cirrhotic population often delay the diagnosis of bacterial infection. The application of preventive measures against infection is therefore of utmost importance in cirrhotic patients. When they are in the hospital environment essential measures include appropriate hand hygiene of nursing and medical staff, use of chlorhexidine solution for skin preparation, full-barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters, and the use of the subclavian vein as the preferred site for insertion of the catheter, with the removal of any unnecessary central lines or urinary catheter. Failing to ensure good care of central and peripheral intravenous lines, as well as urinary catheters increases the risk of infection. Furthermore, antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in patients with cirrhosis who have gastrointestinal bleeding, as well as in invasive procedures such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^63df43d5]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotics known to be highly nephrotoxic in patients with cirrhosis, such as vancomycin or aminoglycosides, in cases of severe infections sustained by extensively drug-resistant bacteria. Monitor serum levels of these drugs in accordance with local policy thresholds.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^4502bb79]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has certain strengths and limitations. This is the first study to assess the role of antibiotics in preventing recurrence of cellulitis in cirrhosis and is one of the very few case control studies which looked into the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhotic patients. The study has demonstrated the novel finding that antibiotic prophylaxis is useful in preventing recurrence of cellulitis. This finding has important clinical implications, because it may help to reduce repeated hospital admissions in these patients. The limitation of the study is that as the data are collected from inpatients of a tertiary care center, the sample may not exactly represent the general population of cirrhotic patients. The number of patients in group 2 in the follow-up phase was lower. Since most of the patient had indication for initiation of SBP prophylaxis (primary or secondary prophylaxis) based on AASLD recommendations, we were bound to start antibiotics. Also many patients had HE, for which antibiotics were needed. Thus patients in the non prophylactic group became less in number. Even though the number is small, the statistical significance suggests that the association is relevant. Another limitation of our study is that we could not retrieve the data regarding antibiotic exposure prior to development of cellulitis.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that hypoalbuminemia and high MELD score are the risk factors for cellulitis in cirrhosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with cellulitis will help prevent recurrence of cellulitis. This also points to the need for further studies which will guide for primary or secondary antibiotic prophylaxis for cellulitis in cirrhotic patients who have high-risk factors.

Results

There were 70 patients with cellulitis (cases) and 73 patients without cellulitis (controls). Univariate analysis of various parameters of cases and controls is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Among the cases, 61 (87%) were males and 9 (13%) were females. Mean age was 51.7 years. Etiology of cirrhosis were alcoholic liver disease in 47 (67%) patients, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in 9 (12.8%), chronic hepatitis B in 8 (11.4%), chronic hepatitis C in 5 (7.1%), and Wilson disease in 1 (1.4%). Forty eight (68%) were Child C, 20 (29%) were Child B and 2 (3%) were Child A. Mean duration between diagnosis of cirrhosis and development of cellulitis was 19.3 months. Twenty seven (39%) were diabetics. Ascites was present in 54 (77%) and SBP was present in 25 (36%). Twenty one cases (30%) had HE, 14 (22%) had AKI, 14 (22%) had AH, 6 (8.6%) had hepatocellular carcinoma, and 5 (4%) developed HRS. Fifty four patients had edema of lower limbs, and 7 had scrotal edema. Sixty cases (85%) presented with cellulitis of lower limbs, 9 (13%) had scrotal cellulitis, and one had anterior abdominal wall cellulitis. Culture was positive in 31% (22/70) either from blood or from skin aspirates (10 from blood, 9 from skin, and 3 from both). 73% of culture (16/22) showed growth of gram negative organisms. The organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae in 6 (27%) patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 6 (27%) and Escherichia coli in 4 (18%) cases. Twenty seven percent (6/22) had Staphylococcus aureus of which two were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Out of 45 cellulitis patients without SBP, 10 had culture positivity of which 8 were gram negative organisms (2 Pseudomonas, 4 Klebsiella, 2 E. coli) and 2 were gram positive (Staphylococcus). Of the 9 cellulitis cases where the skin culture was positive, 8 cases showed growth of gram negative organisms.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^3532cf46]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is a commonly encountered bacterial infection among cirrhotic patients apart from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract and respiratory infections. This study aimed to determine the risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and whether antibiotic prophylaxis helps prevent recurrence of cellulitis.

Methods

The study was conducted in two phases. In phase 1, all cirrhotic patients admitted with cellulitis from August 2011 to August 2013 were taken as cases (n=70) and cirrhotic patients without cellulitis were included as controls (n=73). Baseline demographic data, comorbidities and investigations were noted and compared. In phase 2, the cases of phase 1 were divided into two groups, based on initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of discharge and were followed up for six months for recurrence of cellulitis.

Results

The main etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol and 68% of cases were Child C. Factors which showed significance in univariate analysis were presence of diabetes mellitus, hepatic encephalopathy, platelet count, albumin level and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Using logistic regression, hepatic encephalopathy (OR 2.95, CI 1.01-8.45), albumin level <2.5 g/dL (OR 2.80, CI 1.32-5.92) and MELD >15 (OR 2.95, CI 1.39-6.27) emerged as significant factors associated with cellulitis. Cellulitis recurred in 20% and recurrence was significantly low among antibiotic prophylaxis group (15% vs. 50% P=0.048).

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia, and high MELD score are the risk factors for cellulitis in cirrhosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the recurrence of cellulitis as in the case of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Necrotizing soft-tissue infections and sepsis caused by Vibrio vulnificus compared with those caused by Aeromonas species [^93b2a678]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Vibrio and Aeromonas species, which can cause necrotizing fasciitis and primary septicemia, are members of the Vibrionaceae family and thrive in aquatic environments. Because the clinical symptoms and signs of necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis caused by these two bacteria are similar, the purposes of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics of Vibrio vulnificus and Aeromonas infections, to analyze the risk factors for death, and to compare the effects of surgical treatment on the outcome.

Methods

The cases of thirty-two patients with necrotizing soft-tissue infections and sepsis caused by Vibrio vulnificus (seventeen patients) and Aeromonas species (fifteen patients) were retrospectively reviewed over a four-year period. Surgical débridement or immediate limb amputation was initially performed in all patients. Demographic data, underlying diseases, laboratory results, and clinical outcome were analyzed for each patient in both groups.

Results

Six patients in the Vibrio vulnificus group and four patients in the Aeromonas group died. The patients who died had significantly lower serum albumin levels than did the patients who survived (p < 0.05). The patients with a combination of hepatic dysfunction and diabetes mellitus had a higher mortality rate than those with either hepatic disease or diabetes mellitus alone (p < 0.05). The patients with Vibrio vulnificus infections had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at presentation (p = 0.006). The patients with Aeromonas infections who died had significantly lower white blood-cell counts (p = 0.03) with significantly fewer numbers of segmented white blood cells than those who died in the Vibrio vulnificus group (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

The contact history of patients with a rapid onset of cellulitis can alert clinicians to a differential diagnosis of soft-tissue infection with Vibrio vulnificus (contact with seawater or raw seafood) or Aeromonas species (contact with fresh or brackish water, soil, or wood). Early fasciotomy and culture-directed antimicrobial therapy should be aggressively performed in those patients with hypotensive shock, leukopenia, severe hypoalbuminemia, and underlying chronic illness, especially a combination of hepatic dysfunction and diabetes mellitus.

### Risk factors of cellulitis in cirrhosis and antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing recurrence [^4e4ee62e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In our study, 77% of cellulitis patients had ascites, and 36% had SBP. This shows that cellulitis can occur independently in patients with cirrhosis without ascites or SBP. Gram-positive bacteria are the predominant organism isolated from cellulitis patients of the general population. But gram-negative bacteria are the major organism involved in cellulitis of cirrhotic patients. In our study, 73% of culture from blood or pus showed growth of gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and E. coli), and 27% showed growth of Staphylococcus. The predominance of gut flora in the cultures from cellulitis patients with cirrhosis is probably related to intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased BT. Though diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cellulitis in the general population, surprisingly, our study did not find diabetes as a risk factor in cirrhotic patients.

This is the first study to assess the role of antibiotics in preventing recurrence of cellulitis in cirrhosis. On follow up 20% of cases had recurrence of cellulitis within 6 months which is comparable with 21.4% recurrence rate reported by Catherine et al. The follow-up group showed decreased recurrence of cellulitis among patients who were started on antibiotic prophylaxis compared with those who were not on prophylaxis (15% vs. 50%, P=0.048). The NNT was 3. Logistic regression analysis showed that antibiotic prophylaxis independently reduced the rate of cellulitis recurrence. This novel finding suggests that the administration of prophylactic antibiotics in cirrhotic patients with cellulitis will help decrease the recurrence of cellulitis. However this should be analyzed in further larger prospective studies. Another hypothesis, we would like to suggest is that antibiotic prophylaxis may help prevent the development of cellulitis in at risk cirrhotic patients, with albumin <2.5 g/dL and MELD score >15.

Table 2. 
Summary of Recently Approved Antibiotics for the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Structure Infection

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for ABSSSIs. To provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA, an understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility patterns is essential. For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when the initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS. Further, including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism (nasal colonization or prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration). Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, which is considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline (Table 3). Other agents with reliable MRSA activity that have been approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin. Additional factors for administering these medications include tolerability, formulation, cost, and dosing limitations associated with these agents, such as vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity and linezolid-associated myelosuppression.

We report the case of a 56-year-old man, previously well, who presented with a spontaneous right-sided periorbital necrotising soft tissue infection and subsequently found to have undiagnosed hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis. The patient presented with rapid onset right eye pain, periorbital swelling and septic shock. CT scan revealed diffuse inflammatory changes to the soft tissue anterior to the right eye. The initial treatment included intravenous antibiotics, emergency debridement of necrotic tissue and admission to intensive care. Group A streptococcus was cultured from the debrided tissue. The patient developed decompensated liver failure and life-threatening haematemesis. Liver screening detected hepatitis C positive serology, the only risk factor for which was an old tattoo. The patient was effectively managed by early involvement of multiple clinical teams. We review the literature surrounding periorbital necrotising fasciitis, discuss the evidence for hepatic disorders as a potential cause and make recommendations for managing these patients.

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.
