## Question

A 45-year-old woman with a diagnosis of idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension is being seen in your hepatology clinic for routine follow-up. She has stable platelet counts, no history of variceal bleeding, and her liver function tests are within normal limits. She is asymptomatic and reports no new complaints. Her last abdominal Doppler ultrasound was performed 7 months ago and showed patent portal and hepatic veins with no evidence of thrombosis.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the most appropriate next step in monitoring this patient for portal vein thrombosis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in monitoring a 45-year-old woman with idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension for portal vein thrombosis, given she is asymptomatic, has stable labs, no variceal bleeding history, and a normal Doppler ultrasound from 7 months ago. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk of portal vein thrombosis in INCPH. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for surveillance in INCPH. Next, I will consider whether routine screening is advised in compensated, noncirrhotic portal hypertension. After that, I should review the role and timing of Doppler ultrasound versus cross-sectional imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation and note any exceptions or triggers for earlier imaging.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and risk profile. Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension is characterized by portal hypertension without cirrhosis, and patients with INCPH are at increased risk of portal vein thrombosis compared with the general population, which is why surveillance strategies differ from those in cirrhosis and warrant closer follow-up in many guidelines [^113WExnp].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance on surveillance in INCPH. The EASL vascular liver disease guideline explicitly recommends screening patients with INCPH at least every 6 months for the occurrence of portal vein thrombosis, which directly addresses this scenario and supports periodic surveillance rather than relying on symptoms alone [^113WExnp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging modality. I initially thought cross-sectional imaging might be preferred for surveillance, but that would be a misinterpretation; Doppler ultrasound remains the first-line modality for detecting portal vein thrombosis because of its safety, accessibility, and strong negative predictive value, whereas contrast-enhanced CT or MRI are reserved to confirm, characterize extent, or exclude malignant thrombus when PVT is suspected or identified on ultrasound [^112HohsL] [^114FWc8R] [^114LsLYH].

> I need to check the timing relative to the last study. The last Doppler was 7 months ago, which exceeds the 6-month surveillance interval recommended for INCPH; therefore, repeating a Doppler ultrasound now aligns with EASL guidance and is the most appropriate next step to detect interval development of portal vein thrombosis [^113WExnp].

> But wait, what if the patient were cirrhotic rather than noncirrhotic; would routine screening still be advised? I should double-check that distinction. In compensated cirrhosis, major U.S. guidance recommends against routine screening for PVT because benefits are uncertain and harms may occur from overtreatment, so the 6-month Doppler approach here is specific to INCPH and not generalizable to cirrhosis [^114upzFP] [^114XVKKd] [^117DboNH].

> Next, I should review what to do if the Doppler is abnormal. If Doppler suggests PVT, I should confirm with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to define extent, degree of occlusion, chronicity, and exclude neoplastic thrombus, and then consider anticoagulation based on acuity, extent, and symptoms, recognizing that in noncirrhotic PVT, anticoagulation is generally favored to prevent progression and ischemia when no contraindications exist [^112XpF6q] [^1126eaXs] [^111BzzJS].

> I will now examine practical implementation. Scheduling a Doppler ultrasound now, and then establishing 6-month interval surveillance thereafter, is consistent with EASL and balances early detection with resource use; if new symptoms such as abdominal pain, worsening portal hypertension, or decompensation occur, I should shorten the interval or escalate to cross-sectional imaging as clinically indicated [^113WExnp] [^112XpF6q].

> Final recommendation: Repeat abdominal Doppler ultrasound now to screen for portal vein thrombosis, and if results are normal, continue surveillance every 6 months thereafter. If Doppler suggests thrombosis, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for confirmation and characterization, and then manage according to acuity, extent, and symptom status, including consideration of anticoagulation in appropriate noncirrhotic cases [^113WExnp] [^112HohsL] [^112XpF6q] [^1126eaXs].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **repeat Doppler ultrasound every 6 months** [^113WExnp] to screen for portal vein thrombosis in idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension, as this is the only guideline-recommended surveillance interval for this condition. Routine cross-sectional imaging or anticoagulation is not indicated in the absence of symptoms or new findings. If ultrasound suggests thrombosis, then proceed to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to confirm and characterize the clot [^112XpF6q] [^113jhroD].

---

## Recommended surveillance strategy

### Doppler ultrasound surveillance

- **Frequency**: Every 6 months [^113WExnp] is recommended for patients with INCPH to screen for PVT.
- **Rationale**: Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive, widely available, and effective for detecting PVT in this setting [^112HohsL].
- **Current status**: The patient's last Doppler was 7 months ago, so repeating it now aligns with guideline-recommended surveillance [^113WExnp].

---

### Role of cross-sectional imaging

Reserve **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** for cases where ultrasound suggests thrombosis or when malignancy is suspected, to confirm and characterize the clot and exclude neoplastic obstruction [^112XpF6q] [^113jhroD]. Routine CT or MRI is not recommended for asymptomatic patients with stable INCPH.

---

### Indications for anticoagulation

Anticoagulation is **not indicated** in the absence of confirmed PVT or symptoms; reserve it for confirmed acute or subacute PVT, particularly with symptoms or progression, after weighing bleeding risk [^1126eaXs] [^111BzzJS].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| Asymptomatic INCPH, stable labs, no PVT on prior ultrasound | Repeat Doppler ultrasound every 6 months [^113WExnp] |
| Ultrasound suggests PVT or malignancy suspected | Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to confirm and characterize [^112XpF6q] [^113jhroD] |
| Confirmed acute or subacute PVT with symptoms or progression | Consider anticoagulation after assessing bleeding risk [^1126eaXs] [^111BzzJS] |

---

The next step is to **repeat Doppler ultrasound now** and continue surveillance every 6 months; escalate to CT/MRI or anticoagulation only if new findings or symptoms arise.

### Portal vein thrombosis [^114LsLYH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis is a condition not infrequently encountered by clinicians. It results from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic risk factors. The presentation of acute thrombosis varies widely from an asymptomatic state to presence of life-threatening intestinal ischemia and infarction. In the chronic stage, patients typically present with variceal bleeding or other complications of portal hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound color Doppler imaging has a 98% negative predictive value, and is considered the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing portal vein thrombosis. Controlled clinical trials to assist with clinical decision-making are lacking in both acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant therapy is initiated if the risks of bleeding are low, but long-term anticoagulation is generally not recommended in patients with concomitant hepatic cirrhosis. The roles of invasive therapeutic approaches such as thrombolysis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt continue to evolve. This review conflates dissenting views into a rational approach of managing patients with portal vein thrombosis for the general internist.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — risk factors and screening: Best Practice Advice 1 states that "Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT", and risk factors for PVT in cirrhosis include portal hypertension, slow portal flow, metabolic syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are no symptoms specific to PVT in patients with compensated cirrhosis; it is reasonable, however, to perform Doppler ultrasound to evaluate for PVT if evidence of unexplained worsening portal hypertension (worsening varices, new or progressive ascites) is seen. Transplantation candidates should be evaluated for PVT as part of the transplantation evaluation, a multiphase, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can evaluate for both hepatocellular carcinoma and PVT in the same setting, and symptoms of new-onset abdominal pain should prompt evaluation for acute symptomatic PVT; recurrent PVT is pragmatically defined as occurring within the last 6 months based on data that lack of recanalization within 6 months is unlikely to respond to anticoagulation.

Among patients with portal and/or MVT, intestinal ischemia is suspected with the development of fever, ascites, rebound abdominal tenderness, leukocytosis, and elevated serum lactate levels. Doppler ultrasound examination of the hepatic vasculature should be obtained in patients with (i) new diagnosis of cirrhosis, (ii) onset of PH, or (iii) hepatic decompensation. Endoscopic evaluation should be performed in patients with chronic PVT to assess for esophageal and/or gastric varices. More data are needed before implementing routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation for prevention of PVT in patients with cirrhosis.

### Imaging in clinical decision-making for portal vein thrombosis [^114yaQQT]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Thrombosis of the portal venous system is a frequent and potentially life-threatening condition that can take place in a number of different clinical settings including liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, other solid tumours, abdominal septic foci, acute pancreatitis, haematological malignancies and congenital or acquired prothrombotic disorders. Clinical decision-making in patients with thrombosis of the portal venous system is a particularly complex process owing to the heterogeneity of the population affected by this condition and the lack of high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials for the use of anticoagulation therapy in these patients. This Review discusses the available data regarding how imaging can provide assistance to physicians involved in this decision-making process in different clinical settings. A flowchart illustrating how to use imaging in this setting, based on current evidence and on the experience of the Vascular Liver Diseases Group of the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, is also presented.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^115JPF5U]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — diagnostic imaging and thrombophilia workup: The initial diagnosis of PVT in cirrhosis is established on Doppler ultrasound, which has 89%–93% sensitivity and 92%–99% specificity for PVT. Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be performed to assess for concurrent hepatic malignancy, confirm diagnosis of PVT, characterize PVT by extent, degree of occlusion, chronicity, and establish a baseline for longitudinal assessment, and both CT and MRI have excellent sensitivity and specificity for PVT. Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboembolism or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia, and as portal hypertension is the main driver of PVT development in cirrhosis, routine screening for thrombophilic disorders is not warranted in the absence of risk factors such as personal history of additional thrombi, family history of thromboembolic disease, or laboratory evidence of bone marrow disorder.

Description

Portal vein thromboses (PVTs) are common in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with advanced portal hypertension and mortality. The treatment of PVTs remains a clinical challenge due to limited evidence and competing risks of PVT-associated complications vs bleeding risk of anticoagulation. Significant heterogeneity in PVT phenotype based on anatomic, host, and disease characteristics, and an emerging spectrum of therapeutic options further complicate PVT management. This Clinical Practice Update (CPU) aims to provide best practice advice for the evaluation and management of PVT in cirrhosis, including the role of direct oral anticoagulants and endovascular interventions.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with PVTs identified on Doppler ultrasound should undergo cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate for malignancy, and document the degree of lumen occlusion, clot extent, and chronicity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboemboli or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT with evidence of intestinal ischemia require urgent anticoagulation to minimize ischemic injury. If available, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and hepatology, interventional radiology, hematology, and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Consider observation, with repeat imaging every 3 months until clot regression, in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia and recent (< 6 months) thrombosis involving the intrahepatic portal vein branches or when there is < 50% occlusion of the main portal vein, splenic vein, or mesenteric veins. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Anticoagulation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia who develop recent (< 6 months) PVT that is > 50% occlusive or involves the main portal vein or mesenteric vessels. Patients who have increased benefit of recanalization include those with involvement of more than 1 vascular bed, those with thrombus progression, potential liver transplantation candidates, and those with inherited thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Anticoagulation is not advised for patients with cirrhosis with chronic (> 6 months) PVT with complete occlusion with collateralization (cavernous transformation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are all reasonable anticoagulant options for patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Decision making should be individualized and informed by patient preference and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class. Direct oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients with compensated Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B cirrhosis and offer convenience as their dosages are independent of international normalized ratio monitoring. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response to treatment. If clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in nontransplantation patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may be considered for selected patients with cirrhosis and PVT who have additional indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, such as those with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding. Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may also be considered for transplantation candidates if recanalization can facilitate the technical feasibility of transplantation.

Guidance statements for HVT/BCS — diagnosis, surveillance, and therapy: "HVT-BCS should be considered in any patient with liver disease (recent or chronic) of unknown etiology. Suspicion should be even higher in a patient with a recognized prothrombotic disorder". For imaging, "Doppler ultrasound, performed by an experienced operator, is the reference imaging study for HVT/BCS". Hematologic evaluation is advised: "At the time of HVT/BCS diagnosis, a full thrombophilia workup is recommended, and even when one causal factor is identified, additional factors should be investigated. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended". Cancer surveillance is specified: "Surveillance for HCC in patients with chronic HVT/BCS is recommended as in the general cirrhosis population, with ultrasound every 6 months with or without alpha-fetoprotein determination". Given vascular perturbation, "HCC diagnosis in these patients should not rely on imaging criteria alone and should require histological confirmation". Treatment sequencing and referral are emphasized: "A progressive "step-up" therapeutic strategy according to the clinical response from less to more invasive therapies is recommended for HVT/BCS. Early referral to tertiary care centers with expertise in this disorder is recommended". Anticoagulation and shunt therapy are defined: "All patients with HVT/BCS, even in the absence of a recognized prothrombotic disorder, should receive therapeutic anticoagulation". and "TIPS or DIPS using PTFE-covered stents is the treatment of choice for HVT/BCS when medical therapy or angioplasty fail or are not feasible".

Portal vein thrombosis is an infrequent condition occurring in several different clinical scenarios. In the last years it has been increasingly recognised due to the broad use of radiological methods. In this review we underline the central role of imaging in diagnosing portal vein thrombosis, in clarifying its etiology, choosing the best therapeutic approach and screening possible complications. Special attention is given to the role of imaging to differentiate portal vein thrombosis from neoplastic invasion of the portal vein, and to new diagnostic methods available for clinical practice in this field.

HVT/BCS diagnosis — noninvasive imaging to demonstrate hepatic venous flow obstruction — is based on Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance (MR), with Doppler ultrasound by an experienced operator having a sensitivity > 75%; typical ultrasound signs include thrombus, nonvisualization of the HV, collateral veins, transformation of the HV into a cord lacking flow signals, caudate lobe hypertrophy, and a caudate vein > 3 mm, while contrast-enhanced MR or CT is used for confirmation and is the diagnostic study of choice when an experienced ultrasound operator is unavailable; hepatic venography can show a "spider web" collateral pattern in uncertain cases, and liver biopsy is not necessary unless small intrahepatic vein obstruction is suspected where histology is required for definitive diagnosis.

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^115FuHXV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Indeed, in the majority of patients with cirrhosis, PVT is an incidental finding, often during routine ultrasound, CT or MRI evaluation. The first-line technique for PVT detection is Doppler ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced imaging techniques are useful in further characterization of PVT. Intra-thrombus vascularity, observed in the arterial phase of contrast imaging studies, has been reported to be specific for malignant PVT on both CT and MRI. CEUS seems to be superior to Doppler US for the characterization and further evaluation of PVT, and consequently staging of HCC. In general, the sensitivity range for partial PVT detection for all imaging techniques is rather low (14.3–50%). Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding the benefit of systematic screening of cirrhotic patients for PVT.

Sarin et al recently suggested a pretest probability assessment based on major (Child's class B or C, prior history of resolved PVT, prothrombotic risk factors such as factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, MTHFR mutation) and minor (evidence of a large portosystemic shunt, large isolated gastric varices, HCC, previous/or active systemic venous thrombotic events or abortions, acute abdomen, new onset or worsening portal hypertension complications, recent endoscopic, radiological or surgical abdominal interventions, portal flow velocity < 15 cm/sec) criteria. The pretest scoring system requires assessment and validation in prospective clinical studies.

Portal vein thrombosis

Increased levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) and decreased levels of protein C (anticoagulant driver), combined with reduced portal vein flow velocity and endothelial injury, increase the risk of portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

Many patients are asymptomatic; the diagnosis is often made on routine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance, or coincidentally during liver decompensation. However, PVT is independently associated with worsening decompensation, including variceal bleeding and with increased mortality in liver transplant candidates.

Initial diagnosis is made on Doppler US or CT imaging. MR/CT imaging should be performed to evaluate the extent of the thrombus and rule out neoplastic PVT/HCC. Consider screening for underlying thrombophilic conditions if there are extensive clots or other thromboses.

The management of PVT in cirrhosis is summarised in figure 2. Initial treatment is with anticoagulation, although treatment is not required in all cases. Chances of responding to anticoagulation are higher if treatment is started within 6 months of diagnosis. The recent Baveno VII guidelines recommend treatment in patients with cirrhosis and recent (< 6 months) PVT involving > 50% of the portal vein trunk lumen, any symptomatic PVT or PVT in potential liver transplant candidates. Treatment can also be considered if there is progression of thrombosis on early follow-up (1–3 months), or compromise of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

### Portal vein thrombosis in patients with chronic liver diseases: from conventional to quantitative imaging [^113bVBaG]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis is a pathological condition characterized by the lumen occlusion of the portal vein and its intrahepatic branches, commonly associated to chronic liver diseases. Portal vein thrombosis is often asymptomatic and discovered as an incidental finding in the follow-up of chronic hepatopathy. Imaging plays a pivotal role in the detection and characterization of portal vein thrombosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Ultrasound and Color-Doppler ultrasound are usually the first-line imaging modalities for its detection, but they have limits related to operator-experience, patient size, meteorism and the restrained field-of view. Unenhanced cross-sectional imaging doesn't provide specific signs of portal vein thrombosis except under certain specific circumstances. Conventional contrast-enhanced imaging can depict portal vein thrombosis as an endoluminal filling defect best detected in venous phase and can differentiate between non-neoplastic and neoplastic thrombus based on the contrast enhanced uptake, but not always rule-out the malignant nature. Functional and quantitative imaging techniques and software seem to be more accurate. The purpose of this work is to provide the reader with an accurate overview focused on the main imaging features of portal vein thrombosis.

### Hepatic venous pressure gradient and elastography in porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder… [^111X9GJX]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder is considered a rare cause of portal hypertension, resulting from specific histological alterations that essentially affect the small portal branches and sinusoids, in the absence of cirrhosis. In recent years, the recognition and importance of PSVD has increased, notably due to the widespread use of transient elastography. However, the definitive diagnosis of PSVD can only be established through liver biopsy. Recent data show that PSVD should be suspected in patients with PH and TE ≤ 20 kPa and liver biopsy should be considered in this context. The investigators hypothesize that hepatic venous pressure gradient and magnetic resonance liver elastography may help in the selection of liver biopsy candidates for the diagnosis of PSVD. The primary objective of the study is to describe HVPG and MRE values and liver biopsy findings in patients with PH and TE ≤ 20 kPa.

The search for serum markers that can distinguish these patients from those with cirrhotic portal hypertension without the need for liver biopsy will also be the object of this study. 50 patients will be included, prospectively and retrospectively, in a comparative study between diagnostic methods, with a cross-sectional design. Porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder is considered a rare cause of portal hypertension, resulting from specific histological alterations that essentially affect the small portal branches and sinusoids, in the absence of cirrhosis.

The investigators hypothesize that hepatic venous pressure gradient and magnetic resonance liver elastography may help in the selection of liver biopsy candidates for the diagnosis of PSVD. Primary objectives are:

- To describe the measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with portal hypertension and transient hepatic elastography ≤ 20 kPa.
- To describe hepatic and splenic stiffness measured by magnetic resonance elastography in patients with portal hypertension and transient hepatic elastography ≤ 20 kPa.
- To describe the frequency of major histological findings for the diagnosis of portal sinusoidal vascular disorder in patients with portal hypertension and transient hepatic elastography ≤ 20 kPa. Secondary objectives are:

- To describe the frequency of hepatic vein-to-vein communications in patients with portal hypertension and transient hepatic elastography ≤ 20 kPa.
- To describe the frequency of minor histological findings for the diagnosis of portal sinusoidal vascular disease in patients with portal hypertension and transient hepatic elastography ≤ 20 kPa.
- To compare the serum values of von Willebrand antigen factor between patients diagnosed with porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder and those diagnosed with cirrhosis, after analysis of liver biopsy.
- To compare the serum titers of procollagen III amino-terminal peptide between patients diagnosed with portosinusoidal vascular disorder and those diagnosed with cirrhosis, after analysis of liver biopsy.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) refers to the development of a non-malignant obstruction of the portal vein, its branches, its radicles, or a combination. This Review first provides a comprehensive overview of all aspects of PVT, namely the specifics of the portal venous system, the risk factors for PVT, the pathophysiology of portal hypertension in PVT, the interest in non-invasive tests, as well as therapeutic approaches including the effect of treating risk factors for PVT or cause of cirrhosis, anticoagulation, portal vein recanalisation by interventional radiology, and prevention and management of variceal bleeding in patients with PVT. Specific issues are also addressed including portal cholangiopathy, mesenteric ischaemia and intestinal necrosis, quality of life, fertility, contraception and pregnancy, and PVT in children. This Review will then present endpoints for future clinical studies in PVT, both in patients with and without cirrhosis, agreed by a large panel of experts through a Delphi consensus process. These endpoints include classification of portal vein thrombus extension, classification of PVT evolution, timing of assessment of PVT, and global endpoints for studies on PVT including clinical outcomes. These endpoints will help homogenise studies on PVT and thus facilitate reporting, comparison between studies, and validation of future studies and trials on PVT.

### AASLD AST practice guideline on adult liver transplantation: diagnosis and management of graft-related complications [^11456FPT]. Liver Transplantation (2025). High credibility.

Adult liver transplantation (LT) — vascular imaging and management of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) and portal vein thrombosis are outlined as follows: Most centers obtain at least one doppler ultrasound within the first five days after LT, and contrast-enhanced CT angiography or venography provides more detail when doppler ultrasound is inconclusive; MR imaging (MRI) can be used as an alternative test when there is a contraindication to contrast-enhanced CT scan. Early HAT within five days of LT is usually corrected surgically or endovascularly, with anticoagulation, and endovascular management can confer some risk of hepatic artery injury and rupture in the very early post-operative period but can be the first line therapy when the patient's condition precludes surgery; when early HAT leads to progressive liver failure, urgent retransplantation (re-LT) is needed to avoid a high mortality risk. If HAT is identified within seven days of LT, patients are prioritized as status 1 on the transplant waitlist. Late onset HAT can be addressed with percutaneous interventions and/or anticoagulation alone, but gradual cases may develop adequate collateralization allowing graft survival without intervention, although ischemic cholangiopathy that may require re-LT may still develop. Early portal vein thrombosis or stenosis can be addressed surgically or endovascularly with anticoagulation, whereas later cases are managed endovascularly with or without anticoagulation, or with anticoagulation alone, and the choice of intervention is mainly driven by center practice and the condition of the patient.

Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization". Observational data show that initiation of anticoagulation within 6 months correlated with recanalization (relative risk, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2–9.4; P = 0.004), and initiation within 2 weeks was associated with improved recanalization vs beyond 2 weeks. Meta-analyses including more than 800 patients suggest anticoagulation does not increase the risk of portal hypertensive bleeding, and a retrospective series reported a post-ligation bleeding rate of 9% on anticoagulation, comparable to rates without anticoagulation.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt in the management of portal hypertension [^112sBbC6]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations: TIPSS procedure

All TIPSS should be performed using PTFE-covered stents as they are associated with better patency rates than bare stents (strong recommendation, high level of evidence).
The portal pressure gradient should be measured as that between the portal pressure and IVC, and measured pre- and post-stent deployment (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence)
The portal pressure gradient should be reduced to < 12 mmHg or by ≥ 20% of baseline in the case of variceal bleeding (strong recommendation, high level of evidence). For other indications, further reductions in the portal pressure gradient needs to balance efficacy with risk of hepatic encephalopathy, and should be individualised (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
The role of embolisation with TIPSS is not clear and decisions should be individualised and based on cross-sectional imaging and portography showing large varices when portal pressure reduction alone may not be sufficient (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
A Doppler ultrasound is recommended a week after TIPSS implantation in patients with prothrombotic conditions, and in other patients where TIPSS dysfunction is suspected (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Doppler ultrasound is recommended at 6–12 monthly intervals or 6-monthly in patients undergoing HCC surveillance (weak recommendation, low level of evidence).
Patients with prothrombotic conditions such as BCS require follow-up with Doppler ultrasound with careful consideration for TIPSS venography as determined by the interventional radiologist. There is no indication for routine venography in other patients (strong recommendation, low level of evidence).

Recommendations: service delivery and development

Units offering a TIPSS service should be performing a minimum of 10 cases per annum (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
It is recommended that centres offering complex TIPSS (thrombosed hepatic or portal veins or in transplant recipients) should perform at least 20 cases per annum (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
Patients being referred for emergency TIPSS should be prioritised for transfer (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Idiopathic portal vein thrombosis not related to hepatic disease or malignancy [^114qKd95]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare disorder defined by the sudden occlusion of the portal vein, which could be partial or complete. Prothrombotic states, inherited or acquired, are thought to be the cause in patients without cirrhosis or malignancy. However, the aetiology of some cases remains idiopathic despite a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. The initial diagnostic modality to confirm PVT is either contrast-enhanced abdominal (CT) or MRI; as it can identify predisposing factors, and detect evidence of complications. Eliciting the underlying aetiology is critical to guide overall management and prevent future recurrence. The purpose of treatment is to stop thrombus extension and achieve portal vein patency by anticoagulation to optimise outcomes. Herein, we present an unusual case of spontaneous PVT in a young woman. We will also discuss the evaluation of patients without obvious aetiology.

### Optimizing portal hypertension with TIPS and interval metabolic… [^114ii76T]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Cirrhosis is a form of advanced liver disease that can lead to serious complications, especially when combined with severe obesity. Many patients with cirrhosis also develop a condition called clinically significant portal hypertension, which is increased pressure in the veins of the liver. CSPH raises the risk of life-threatening events like internal bleeding and liver failure. Unfortunately, treatment options for people who have both cirrhosis and severe obesity are very limited, especially when portal hypertension is present. The study will compare two groups:

- One group will receive TIPS followed by sleeve gastrectomy.
- The other group will receive medical weight management.

All participants will have severe obesity and cirrhosis with CSPH but will not have decompensated liver disease. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. This study hopes to provide high-quality evidence for a novel, stepwise treatment strategy that may help people with obesity and liver disease live longer, healthier lives. If successful, it could change how advanced liver disease and obesity are managed together, especially in patients who currently have few safe and effective options. All study care is provided at Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease are now among the leading global causes of cirrhosis.

Up to one-third of individuals with cirrhosis also have class II or III obesity, which exacerbates portal hypertension, accelerates liver disease progression, and can limit eligibility for liver transplantation. The trial will enroll 70 adults aged 18 to 70 years with a body mass index between 35 and 70 kg/m², biopsy-proven or elastography-confirmed cirrhosis, and objective evidence of CSPH. Inclusion criteria include Child-Pugh class A or B liver function, MELD 3. 0 score ≤ 15, and platelet count ≥ 50, 000 /µL. Key exclusion criteria include decompensated cirrhosis, defined as moderate-to-large volume ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or patients undergoing liver transplant evaluation. Patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage or small-volume ascites may still be eligible. Other exclusions include MELD 3.

0 > 15, portal vein thrombosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, prior metabolic surgery, pregnancy, active substance use, untreated psychiatric illness, and severe cardiopulmonary disease that would preclude surgery or anesthesia. After informed consent, participants will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to one of two arms. The intervention group will undergo TIPS placement, aiming for at least a 50 percent reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient or a final HVPG less than 12 mmHg, followed by sleeve gastrectomy approximately 4 to 6 weeks later. The control group will receive structured lifestyle counseling and, when clinically indicated, FDA-approved pharmacologic therapies for weight management and diabetes. Follow-up visits at 1, 3, and 6 months will assess weight, vital signs, adverse events, and MELD 3. 0 laboratory values. Liver Doppler ultrasound will be performed in the intervention group to assess TIPS patency per standard of care.

On day 7, a decrease in protein C (30%, reference range 72–146%) and protein S (30%, reference range 70–140%) was detected. However, both parameters had never been altered in past assessments. A genetic screening did not show relevant mutations. Treatments with intravenous antithrombin and oral ciprofloxacin were discontinued. On day 11, a follow-up abdominal CT scan, with contrast medium, displayed the persistence of thrombosis in portal trunk, left portal vein branch and superior mesenteric vein, with a reduction of intestinal distension and ascites. Moreover, an abdominal Doppler confirmed an almost complete PVT. Throughout the hospitalization, the patient had some episodes of red bloody stool excretion, which were ascribed to his venous stasis.

On day 15, the severity of postprandial pain decreased significantly, and the patient was discharged. After discharge, he remained on fondaparinux for 12 days, and then he was switched to warfarin with the goal of maintaining the international normalized ratio within the therapeutic range of 2–3. Thirty days later, a follow-up ultrasound did not show appreciable signs of PVT. At 2 years from discharge, several follow-up visits have shown that the patient persists on a stable mild liver disea s e and he has not experienced further thrombotic events.

For duration, we suggest at least 6 months of anticoagulation when the etiology is reversible and indefinite anticoagulation in patients with thrombophilia (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For initial therapy, we suggest either unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) once a decision is made to initiate anticoagulation, considering the pros and cons of either approach (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For maintenance, we suggest either LMWH or warfarin, noting limited experience with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), that some monitoring of therapy is recommended, and that tests can rule out substantial drug effect; pros and cons, including availability of reversal agents, should be considered (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

Budd–Chiari syndrome — diagnostic work-up and imaging recommendations: Investigation for acquired and inherited thrombotic conditions should be performed in all patients with BCS. Owing to the high prevalence of two or more risk factors in BCS, investigation for secondary prothrombotic factors is recommended even in the presence of 1 conspicuous thrombophilia disorder. The hepatic venous outflow tract should be investigated in all patients with acute or chronic liver disease without an obvious cause, particularly in the setting of new-onset ascites and/or abdominal pain. Hepatic venogram and/or liver biopsy are rarely required to make a diagnosis of BCS. For imaging selection in new-onset ascites, the guideline asks, "Should Doppler US, contrast-enhanced CT scan, or MRI be obtained to diagnose BCS in patients with new-onset ascites?" and states, "We recommend Doppler US as the initial diagnostic test for evaluation for BCS. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans should be obtained to assess thrombus extension, rule out tumor thrombus, determine response to anticoagulation therapy, evaluate indeterminate hepatic nodules, and whenever there is high clinical suspicion of BCS despite negative or inconclusive Doppler US results (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence)".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^113bURJZ]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — bleeding prophylaxis and anticoagulant selection for PVT in cirrhosis notes that patients warrant gastroesophageal variceal screening if not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis and to avoid delays in starting anticoagulation as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization; vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are all reasonable options, with decision making individualized by patient preference and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class, and direct oral anticoagulants may be considered in compensated Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and class B cirrhosis with the convenience that dosages are independent of international normalized ratio monitoring.

### Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated portal vein thrombosis in a healthy, immunocompetent man [^114zbq2R]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We present a previously healthy man in his 30s who presented with typical viral prodrome symptoms and worsening abdominal pain. He was found to have portal vein thrombosis, with extensive hypercoagulability workup performed. It was determined that the aetiology of thrombus was secondary to acute cytomegalovirus infection. The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy, with later clot resolution demonstrated on abdominal Doppler ultrasound and abdominal CT scan. Given the atypical presentation of this common virus, we performed a literature review of cytomegalovirus-associated portal vein thrombosis in healthy individuals; we found that most patients present with non-specific symptoms of fever and abdominal pain in the setting of a viral prodrome. This case and literature review suggest physicians must consider cytomegalovirus-associated portal vein thrombosis as a potential diagnosis when patients present with abdominal pain and viral symptoms. The literature highlights the need for a consensus on anticoagulation and antiviral therapy.

Hepatic artery aneurysms — epidemiology, imaging, and management: Most HAAs are true arterial aneurysms. The primary causes are atherosclerosis, mediointimal degeneration, trauma, and, less commonly, infection. Most true HAAs are asymptomatic and found incidentally on cross-sectional imaging obtained for other reasons. The reported incidence of rupture in patients with true HAAs is up to 25%, and the mortality rate from rupture of an HAA is > 30%. Doppler ultrasound studies and CT readily demonstrate HAAs, and multidetector CT arteriography is the optimal tool for defining these lesions, assessing the collateral circulation, and planning treatment. In a retrospective review of 22 patients with a mean HAA diameter of 2.3 cm (range, 1.5–5.0) who were followed up and untreated for a mean of 68.4 months (range, 1–372), no complications were identified. Patients treated using endovascular approaches appear to have less morbidity and mortality; however, the actual benefit-to-risk ratio of treating aneurysms deemed to be at higher risk of rupture has not been evaluated, and there are no data on which to base recommendations for surveillance of HAAs in the setting of expectant management.

Abstract

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints encountered in the pediatric emergency department. The use of point-of-care ultrasonography by emergency physicians has been shown to expedite the diagnosis of a large variety of conditions and can be used to accurately identify intra-abdominal pathology in children. We describe the case of a pediatric patient who presented to the pediatric emergency department with acute abdominal pain, in whom point-of-care ultrasonography helped expedite the diagnosis of acute portal vein thrombosis and liver abscess.

Guidance statements — management of recent PVT by clinical setting and extent of portal vein (PV) occlusion are as follows: "In all patients with recent PVT and concern for intestinal ischemia, immediate consultation with surgery, critical care, interventional radiology, and hematology is recommended, with the need for surgery in cases of intestinal infarction". "In patients without cirrhosis and with recent PVT, directed antithrombotic therapy should be considered in order to avoid intestinal ischemia and prevent the development of chronic PVT with portal hypertension". For patients with cirrhosis, "Treatment should be considered on a case-by- case basis", and "Decisions for treatment of an individual patient should be based on expected benefit and minimization of clot extension risk". In cirrhosis with minimally occlusive "(< 50% obstruction of the lumen)" thrombosis of the main PV, "observation with serial imaging every 3 months without therapy is reasonable. Treatment for progressive clot should then be considered in this setting". The guidance also notes a separate scenario of "occlusive or partially occlusive (> 50% obstruction of the lumen) thrombosis of the main PV or mesenteric veins".

Hepatic vein thrombosis/Budd-Chiari syndrome (HVT/BCS) — vascular decompression and TIPS strategy: In inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction/stenosis, an infrahepatic pressure threshold and atrial gradient predict shunt inadequacy: "an infrahepatic IVC pressure > 20 mm Hg or a gradient between the IVC and right atrium of 15 mm Hg is predictive of inadequate shunt function". "Currently, surgical shunts have been almost completely replaced by TIPS". Among HVT/BCS patients unresponsive to medical therapy and treated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), "5-year transplant-free survival was 72%". Regarding timing, "Placement of TIPS soon after symptomatic HVT/ BCS diagnosis has been recently suggested", although "most evidence suggests that a step-wise strategy is effective and safe, provided that patients are followed closely and TIPS is implemented soon after less invasive therapies yield no improvement". Noninvasive monitoring is noted: "Recent data suggest that liver elastography measurements may be a good noninvasive test to monitor HVT/BCS evolution".

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^116BmY3F]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis leads to intrahepatic resistance, which causes portal hypertension and, at later stages, hepatic insufficiency, which disrupts the liver's normal metabolic functions. Together these features cause gut-barrier disruption and portosystemic shunting, resulting in the multisystem complications of cirrhosis, eg, hepatic encephalopathy, sarcopenia, ascites, and kidney injury. While physical examination findings may be suggestive, it is recommended to stratify risk for all using the FIB-4 followed by elastography for at-risk patients. After identifying patients with cirrhosis, optimal care may involve referral to a hepatologist, liver cancer screening, and consideration of endoscopy for varices screening and/or initiation of nonselective β-blockers. BMI indicates body mass index. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by liver biopsy but may also be diagnosed noninvasively.

Elastography, a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness measured in kilopascals, can typically confirm cirrhosis at levels of 15 kPa or greater. Approximately 40% of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when they present with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. Approximately 1% to 4% of patients with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma each year, which is associated with a 5-year survival of approximately 20%. In a 3-year randomized clinical trial of 201 patients with portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers reduced the risk of decompensation or death compared with placebo. What can be done to improve survival among patients with compensated cirrhosis. Survival for patients with cirrhosis is improved with control of their underlying chronic liver disease.

Beyond that, screening for liver cancer with biannual ultrasound and α-fetoprotein is associated with higher rates of curative treatment when cancer is detected. When patients develop portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers are associated with lower rates of decompensation or death. Chronic inflammatory liver injury causes activation of hepatic myofibroblasts and macrophages, which increase collagen accumulation in the extracellular matrix. This process disrupts the connection between hepatocytes and sinusoids where blood flows, leads to formation of nodules of fibrosis, and impedes portal inflow resulting in portal venous hypertension. Chronic liver injury results in increased vasoconstrictor signaling and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow. Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance.

In both NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease, heritable factors in lipid metabolism have been associated with progression of liver disease. 57 In addition, chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte loss and reduces the liver's capacity for metabolic activity including protein synthesis, detoxification, nutrient storage, and bilirubin clearance. Over time, patients may progress from compensated cirrhosis without clinical manifestations to decompensated cirrhosis with variceal hemorrhage, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension, defined as a pressure gradient between the hepatic and portal vein of 10 mm Hg or greater, promotes development of varices.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^1177LRU3]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — PVT is the most common VTE event in cirrhosis with increased rates during decompensation; incident PVT ranges from 5% at 1 year to 40% at 10 years, with highest rates in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and in those with more advanced liver disease undergoing liver transplantation; risk factors include prior VTE, thrombophilia, low portal vein flow velocity, malignancy, intra-abdominal infection, and recent interventions; patients with cirrhosis who develop PVT and have no other history of clotting do not require a hypercoagulable workup; stability, regression, or resolution appears more common than clot progression; anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin appears safe and effective, and two recent randomized controlled trials documented superiority of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy compared to warfarin therapy in decreasing PVT clot burden with no difference in overall rate of bleeding, with one study showing improved survival in DOAC-treated patients compared to warfarin-treated patients.

### Case report: gallbladder varices in a patient with portal vein thrombosis secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma [^117C1GJX]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Gallbladder varices are a rare form of collateralization that develop in patients with portal hypertension. We present here a case of gallbladder varices accurately diagnosed by contrast enhanced CT imaging of the abdomen and confirmed by Color Doppler Sonography. A 76-year-old patient with hepatocellular carcinoma developed portal vein thrombosis due to tumor extension during the course of treatment and was incidentally discovered to have gallbladder varices. While most commonly asymptomatic, gallbladder varices are associated with increased risk of massive bleeding, either spontaneously or during cholecystectomy. As a result, the existence of such varices should be well documented if the patient is to undergo any abdominal surgical procedures. In addition, because of a particular association with portal vein thrombosis, patients with portal hypertension that are found to possess gallbladder varices should be evaluated for portal vein thrombosis.

We report two cases in which visualization of the segmental branch of the hepatic portal vein with the colour Doppler ultrasonography (US) technique was useful for the early diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease. The change in blood flow in the segmental branch of the portal vein occurred 5 and 6 d before the clinical criteria were fulfilled in the two cases. Reverse flow in the segmental branch began partially in the liver at first, and then spread to the whole liver several days later. All the US findings in both cases disappeared after thrombolytic therapy.

Methods

Patients

We collected data on 1,223 patients diagnosed with cirrhosis at Quanzhou First Hospital from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2023. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 247 patients were included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) meeting the diagnostic criteria for cirrhosis according to the guidelines in "Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management (2023)"; and (2) regular follow-up (every 12 months) with portal vein CTV (computed tomography venography) or portal vein Doppler ultrasound. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who underwent liver transplantation, splenectomy, splenic artery embolization, or pericardial devascularization surgery; (2) history of gastrointestinal bleeding prior to first hospitalization; (3) patients who received anticoagulation therapy, thrombolytic therapy, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for PVT; (4) patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction, active infections, or other conditions that might affect coagulation; and (5) patients with incomplete follow-up data or unclear records of the onset of PVT or EGVB. In the 10-year retrospective follow-up, each patient was followed until their last hospitalization (Fig. 1).

Patient screening flowchart

Data collection

The data collected included basic information (age, sex, presence of HCC, etiology), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, renal insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), comorbidities (splenic hyperfunction, abdominal infections, cholecystitis, ascites), auxiliary examination indicators (liver function grading, portal vein diameter, hemoglobin, platelets, INR ratio), and the time of the first occurrence of EGVB and the first appearance of PVT. Unlike EGVB, PVT must have formed some time before it was detected in examinations. However, since there is no better method to record the exact time of PVT formation, this study records the time PVT was discovered through portal vein CTV or Doppler ultrasound. To minimize the time discrepancy between the "detection" and "formation" of PVT, all patients included in this study were regularly (every 12 months) re-examined with portal vein CTV/portal vein Doppler ultrasound.

### Portal vein thrombosis: an unexpected finding in a 28-year-old male with abdominal pain [^116BFueX]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is a common primary care complaint. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare cause of abdominal pain, typically associated with cirrhosis or thrombophilia. The following describes the presentation of PVT in a young male, the search for risk factors and underlying etiology, and the debate of anticoagulation therapy.

Case

A 28-year-old male presented with periumbilical pain, post-prandial nausea, and sporadic hematemesis for 3 weeks. The diagnosis was confirmed with a triphasic liver computerized tomography after obtaining an abnormal right upper quadrant ultrasound. This unexpected finding prompted investigation for intrinsic hepatic disease and potential hypercoagulable disorders. Laboratory analysis revealed a heterozygous genotype for the prothrombin 20210G/A mutation, an identified risk factor for venous thrombosis.

Discussion

Recommendations concerning anticoagulation for PVT in the absence of cirrhosis are not clearly defined. Current literature describes the following factors as indications for anticoagulation: acute thrombus, lack of cavernous transformation, absence of esophageal varices, and mesenteric venous thrombosis. This patient had clinical indications both for and against anticoagulation. Weighing this individual's clinical circumstances, we concluded the risk of thrombus in the setting of a hypercoagulable disorder outweighed the risk of variceal bleeding. A minimum of 6 months of anticoagulation was initiated.

Conclusion

PVT is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain, and the absence of hepatic disease should raise the index of suspicion for an underlying thrombophilia. Specific recommendations for anticoagulation are not well defined, demonstrating the importance of weighing the individual risks and benefits in treatment with anticoagulation for young persons with thrombophilia.

### AASLD practice guidance on the use of TIPS, variceal embolization, and retrograde transvenous obliteration in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^114XYF5d]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Post-TIPS Doppler ultrasound (Doppler-US) surveillance — schedule, prediction rule, and escalation are specified. In patients who underwent TIPS placement for prevention or treatment of variceal hemorrhage, a proactive follow-up plan with Doppler-US of the TIPS is recommended to detect subclinical TIPS dysfunction, and with covered stents, initial Doppler-US evaluation is usually performed 1–4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after TIPS creation and every 6 months thereafter. The combined use of mean maximum flow velocity (mVpmax) at the TIPS with the direction of intrahepatic portal flow predict TIPS dysfunction with high sensitivity and good negative likelihood ratio, and the prediction rule for TIPS dysfunction is derived from this model (mVpmax < 28 cm/s when flow is hepatofugal or mVpmax < 39 cm/s when flow is hepatopetal) had 90% sensitivity, 45% specificity, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.23. Endovascular evaluation and therapy are recommended when Doppler-US demonstrates TIPS stenosis or occlusion, and a negative Doppler-US in the setting of recurrent portal hypertension signs or symptoms should not necessarily preclude direct shunt interrogation by catheter venography.

### Neonatal portal vein thrombosis: a retrospective study of management and follow-up at one institution [^115EDcVb]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of neonatal portal vein thrombosis (PVT), a relatively common type of pediatric deep vein thrombosis, is not completely standardized. Questions remain about the benefit of anticoagulation (ATC) therapy and about the optimal frequency and duration of doppler ultrasound (US) surveillance for liver complications such as portal hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding. Current guidelines suggest reserving ATC only for occlusive PVT, highlighting a need for explicit grading of PVT in radiologic reports and a consensus approach to imaging and management.

Methods

To address these issues, we implemented an institutional Neonatal PVT Management Algorithm using plan-do-study-act (PDSA) methodology. We aimed to standardize screening tests, reduce unnecessary ATC, and optimize imaging checkpoints. A five-year retrospective review established baseline data, which we compared to outcomes five years post-implementation of the algorithm.

Results

The algorithm recommended ATC only for occlusive PVT and advised US imaging at Week 1, Month 1, Month 3, and Month 6 from diagnosis, with annual surveillance for unresolved or abnormal cases. Post-implementation analysis revealed improvements in radiologic documentation of PVT grading, a reduction in the use of ATC for subocclusive PVT, and a decrease in the median duration of ATC for all patients. Follow-up imaging adherence did not improve between the pre- and post-implementation periods.

Conclusions

The algorithm successfully enhanced documentation of PVT grading and reduced unnecessary ATC but highlighted persistent challenges in follow-up adherence, suggesting a need for further refinement in future PDSA cycles.
