## Question

Post menopause management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postmenopausal management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming menopausal status and establishing baseline risk. Then, I should classify symptom domains and severity. Next, I will weigh menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) benefits and risks using the "window of opportunity" concept and shared decision-making. After that, I will select MHT formulations and dosing, followed by nonhormonal options for vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. I will then address bone health, cardiovascular risk, and cancer screening. Finally, I will set monitoring and discontinuation plans, and consider special populations such as breast cancer survivors and those with early menopause, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline risk profile, because management hinges on accurate menopausal status and risk stratification. I should confirm menopause clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in the appropriate age range, and if the history is unclear or there has been hysterectomy, I should check FSH and estradiol to support the diagnosis, while remembering that labs can be equivocal in the perimenopause and must be interpreted in context [^111fQFew]. I need to assess cardiovascular risk using standard tools, breast cancer risk with validated models, and venous thromboembolism risk factors, and I should document gynecologic history including hysterectomy and contraindications to estrogen or progestogen therapy, as these will shape therapy choice and safety [^112PurCg] [^11721zwT].

> Next, I should review symptom domains and severity, because treatment selection is symptom-driven. Vasomotor symptoms are common and can persist beyond a decade, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is progressive without treatment, and mood, sleep, and cognitive changes are frequent and impactful, so I need to quantify severity and functional impact to prioritize interventions and track response [^1139iWPf] [^111HYfxb]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not conflating GSM with urinary incontinence; GSM includes dryness, dyspareunia, and irritative urinary symptoms, whereas stress urinary incontinence is a separate entity, though topical vaginal estrogen may still improve incontinence-related symptoms in the right context [^111Pi3pL].

> Now, I will examine the role of MHT using the "window of opportunity" framework. For women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause without contraindications, MHT is the most effective therapy for vasomotor symptoms and confers bone benefits, with a generally favorable benefit–risk balance when individualized, so I should discuss this candidly using absolute risk language and shared decision-making [^1146c7m1] [^113scWk6] [^117HZMei]. Wait, let me verify the timing nuance: while many guidelines emphasize initiation in this window, emerging analyses suggest that rigid chronological cutoffs may exclude some who could benefit, so I should individualize beyond age and years-since-menopause when benefits clearly outweigh risks and the patient prefers MHT after counseling [^113Vxb4F].

> I need to ensure I am clear about what MHT does not do. I should confirm that MHT is not indicated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, dementia, or breast cancer, and I should communicate this to avoid misaligned expectations and to align with USPSTF recommendations against hormone therapy for chronic disease prevention [^115rXhAK] [^113nDTdC]. But wait, what if the patient is interested in bone protection? In appropriately selected women, MHT can be considered for fracture prevention when other therapies are unsuitable, but that is a secondary benefit within a symptom-treatment framework rather than a primary prevention indication [^114zbvE8].

> Let me consider contraindications and risk modifiers before proposing MHT. Absolute contraindications include estrogen-dependent cancers, undiagnosed genital bleeding, active venous thromboembolism, and severe liver disease, while relative cautions include high cardiovascular risk, high breast cancer risk, and certain autoimmune or thrombophilic conditions, so I should screen carefully and document counseling [^114G5C8R]. I should double-check that transdermal routes reduce venous thromboembolism risk compared with oral, which can be advantageous in women with intermediate thrombotic risk or metabolic syndrome, though I must still individualize and monitor [^111Jkgg2].

> For women with a uterus, I should confirm that combined estrogen–progestogen therapy is required to protect the endometrium, whereas women after hysterectomy can use estrogen alone, and I should tailor the progestogen to minimize risks and side effects. Let me verify formulation choices: micronized progesterone is associated with lower breast cancer risk than synthetic progestins in some observational data, and continuous combined therapy may be preferred over sequential in older perimenopausal women to reduce bleeding, but I should align this with patient preference and tolerance [^1146c7m1]. Hold on, I should verify that conjugated estrogens with bazedoxifene is a reasonable option for those with a uterus who want to avoid progestogen exposure, and yes, guidelines support this where available [^114FhMrT].

> I will now examine dosing principles and monitoring. I should start with the lowest effective dose and titrate to symptom control, favor transdermal estradiol when VTE risk is a concern, and avoid routine estradiol level monitoring unless symptoms persist despite dose changes or I am troubleshooting absorption or adherence issues [^1134k2WV]. I need to ensure follow-up at 3 months to assess efficacy and adverse effects, then every 6 to 12 months, and I should reassess annually to determine ongoing need, aiming for the shortest effective duration while respecting patient goals and evolving risk [^1169oVcS] [^115vZyd6].

> For women who decline MHT or have contraindications, I should review nonhormonal options for vasomotor symptoms. Paroxetine salt is the only FDA-approved nonhormonal medication for vasomotor symptoms, and SSRIs/SNRIs and gabapentinoids are effective alternatives, with CBT and clinical hypnosis offering additional benefit, particularly for sleep and quality of life, though I must avoid paroxetine with tamoxifen due to CYP2D6 inhibition [^117V3R6d] [^116waCcN]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for exercise and acupuncture; the data are mixed and generally not sufficient to rely on for vasomotor symptom reduction alone, so I should frame these as adjuncts rather than substitutes for evidence-based pharmacotherapy when symptoms are moderate to severe [^117V3R6d].

> Turning to GSM, I should confirm that low-dose vaginal estrogen is highly effective and safe for most women, with vaginal DHEA and ospemifene as oral alternatives for moderate to severe symptoms, while moisturizers and lubricants suffice for many with mild symptoms. I need to check endometrial safety: with low-dose vaginal estrogen, systemic absorption is minimal and a progestogen is generally not required, though long-term endometrial safety data beyond one year are limited, so I should individualize and monitor bleeding [^111HYfxb]. Hold on, I should verify the breast cancer caveat: safety of local estrogen, DHEA, and ospemifene after breast cancer is uncertain, so decisions should be coordinated with oncology and documented via shared decision-making [^111HYfxb].

> Next, I should review bone health proactively, because accelerated bone loss begins at menopause. I need to ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing and resistance exercise, smoking cessation, and moderation of alcohol, and I should screen with DEXA at age 65 or earlier if risk factors are present, initiating pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis when indicated and considering MHT for fracture prevention in appropriately selected women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause who also have vasomotor symptoms and no contraindications [^117Bg992] [^114zbvE8]. Let me reconsider whether tibolone is an option; tibolone can be considered for symptom relief and fracture prevention in selected women, but availability and contraindications vary, so I should confirm local access and patient-specific risks before prescribing [^114cub77].

> I should confirm cardiovascular risk management as a parallel priority, since menopause heralds adverse metabolic shifts. I need to check blood pressure, lipids, glucose, weight and waist circumference, counsel on diet and physical activity, and manage modifiable risks, recognizing that transdermal estrogen may carry lower thrombotic risk than oral in some women, though I must still individualize based on global cardiovascular risk [^112PurCg] [^111Jkgg2]. But wait, what if the patient has diabetes? Guidelines suggest MHT can be considered for symptom relief in women with diabetes when otherwise appropriate, with careful risk assessment and monitoring, so I should not reflexively exclude them [^114k1cKu].

> Cancer screening and prevention should be addressed at this visit as well. I need to ensure age-appropriate mammography, cervical screening per local guidelines, and colon cancer screening, and I should counsel on lifestyle measures that reduce cancer risk, integrating this into the broader preventive care plan during the menopausal transition [^115ujiXQ]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying MHT prevents breast cancer; it does not, and combined therapy may increase breast cancer risk with long-term use, so screening and risk counseling remain essential [^115rXhAK].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with breast cancer survivors. Systemic MHT is generally not recommended after breast cancer due to recurrence risk, so I should prioritize nonhormonal therapies for vasomotor symptoms and GSM, coordinate with oncology, and if a survivor strongly prefers local vaginal estrogen for refractory GSM, I should use the lowest effective dose with informed consent and oncologist input, acknowledging evidence gaps [^113xGxS7] [^111HYfxb]. Wait, let me verify the evolving consensus on MHT after breast cancer; some expert panels support shared decision-making about off-label systemic MHT in select cases, accepting potential relapse risk in exchange for quality of life, but this remains controversial and should be approached with extreme caution and documentation [^114gS8rC].

> For women with early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency, I should confirm that estrogen therapy is generally recommended at least until the average age of natural menopause to mitigate symptoms and prevent bone loss, often requiring higher initial doses with later taper, and I should provide more intensive cardiovascular and bone health surveillance given elevated long-term risks [^1165eqt2] [^117HZMei]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even if they are asymptomatic; yes, bone protection is a key rationale even when vasomotor symptoms are mild or absent in this group [^117HZMei].

> Finally, I need to ensure a clear monitoring and discontinuation plan. Follow-up at 3 months then 6 to 12 months allows dose titration, assessment of bleeding patterns, blood pressure, weight, and breast symptoms, and annual reassessment should prompt discussion of tapering versus continuation based on symptoms, risks, and patient preference, using shared decision-making for any discontinuation strategy [^115vZyd6] [^112qfBPr]. I should double-check that unscheduled bleeding on therapy warrants evaluation for endometrial pathology, and I must reinforce adherence to age-appropriate cancer screening throughout treatment [^115vZyd6].

Postmenopausal management centers on **individualized care** [^111HZcPG] and **shared decision-making** [^117D87TK] to address vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome, and long-term cardiometabolic and bone health risks [^116moZ1N]. MHT is the **most effective therapy** [^1146c7m1] for vasomotor symptoms and GSM [^111HYfxb], with the best benefit–risk profile when started in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause [^113scWk6] and without contraindications [^113fU5gr]. Nonhormonal options (SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, CBT, clinical hypnosis) [^114G5C8R] are appropriate for those who decline or cannot use MHT [^117V3R6d]. Lifestyle measures (weight control, exercise, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation) [^115gN15V] and bone health strategies (calcium/vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, pharmacotherapy) [^117Bg992] are essential for all patients [^1167Yxif]. Regular reassessment of symptoms, risks, and treatment goals is recommended [^1169oVcS], with annual reviews to adjust therapy as needed [^115vZyd6].

## Vasomotor symptoms (VMS)

### Hormonal therapy

- **MHT efficacy**: Reduces hot flashes/night sweats by ~75% and severity by ~87% [^115ShanZ]; most effective treatment [^114G5C8R].
- **Timing**: Initiate in women < 60 or < 10 years postmenopause without contraindications [^113scWk6] [^1146c7m1].
- **Formulations**: Transdermal estrogen lowers VTE risk vs oral; add progestogen if uterus intact [^111Jkgg2] [^1146c7m1].
- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration; reassess annually [^117Ky3uP] [^1169oVcS].

---

### Nonhormonal therapy

- **SSRIs/SNRIs**: Paroxetine, venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram reduce VMS [^116waCcN] [^117V3R6d].
- **Gabapentin**: Effective for VMS, especially with sleep disturbance [^116waCcN] [^117V3R6d].
- **CBT/hypnosis**: Reduce VMS and improve sleep/QOL [^116waCcN] [^117V3R6d].

---

## Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)

### Hormonal therapy

- **Local estrogen**: Highly effective for moderate–severe GSM [^111HYfxb]; minimal systemic absorption; no routine progestogen needed [^112tLDqM].
- **Vaginal DHEA**: Effective for dyspareunia and vaginal dryness [^116waCcN].
- **Ospemifene**: Oral SERM for moderate–severe dyspareunia [^112tLDqM].

---

### Nonhormonal therapy

Nonhormonal options include **moisturizers/lubricants** for mild GSM symptoms [^111HYfxb] and **pelvic floor therapy** for urinary symptoms and sexual function [^notfound].

---

## Cardiometabolic health

### Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions include **weight control** to reduce cardiovascular risk [^116moZ1N] and **regular aerobic/resistance exercise** to improve cardiovascular and metabolic health [^115gN15V]. Alcohol moderation and smoking cessation further reduce cardiometabolic risk [^notfound].

---

### Hormonal therapy considerations

Hormonal therapy considerations include **timing**, as initiating MHT in the window may improve cardiovascular outcomes, and **formulation**, where transdermal estrogen is preferred for higher VTE risk [^111Jkgg2].

---

## Bone health

### Lifestyle and supplementation

- **Calcium/vitamin D**: 1,200–1,500 mg calcium and 800–1,000 IU vitamin D daily [^notfound].
- **Weight-bearing exercise**: Essential for bone maintenance [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking cessation and alcohol moderation support bone health [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy includes **bisphosphonates, denosumab, and SERMs** as first-line for osteoporosis, and **MHT** for women < 60 or < 10 years postmenopause with low fracture risk and no contraindications [^114zbvE8] [^113RPtfX].

---

## Mental health and cognitive function

Mental health and cognitive function benefit from **CBT** for mood, anxiety, and sleep [^115JDni8] and **SSRIs/SNRIs** for depression and anxiety during menopause [^115JDni8].

---

## Individualized care and shared decision-making

Individualized care and shared decision-making emphasize **regular reassessment** of symptoms, risks, and preferences, with annual reviews to adjust therapy [^1169oVcS] [^1121nsY2]. Patient education should cover risks, benefits, and alternatives to support **informed choices** [^111HZcPG].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **breast cancer survivors**, for whom nonhormonal options are preferred and vaginal estrogen may be considered case-by-case with oncology input [^113xGxS7] [^111HYfxb], and **early menopause**, where MHT is recommended until the average age of menopause unless contraindicated [^1134k2WV] [^117HZMei].

---

Postmenopausal management should be **comprehensive and individualized**, integrating MHT, nonhormonal therapies, and lifestyle interventions to optimize symptom control and long-term health.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113fU5gr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this document is to generate a practice guideline for the management and treatment of symptoms of the menopause.

Participants

The Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause Task Force included six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, all appointed by The Endocrine Society.

Evidence

The Task Force developed this evidenced-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials.

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting determined consensus. Committees of The Endocrine Society, representatives from endorsing societies, and members of The Endocrine Society reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines. The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.

Conclusions

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117D87TK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

Some women experience bothersome symptoms around the time of menopause that may have a negative impact on their quality of life and prompt them to seek treatments. Menopausal hormone therapy was historically the treatment of choice. However, medical contraindications and personal preference for nonhormonal therapy have prompted the evaluation of a range of nonhormonal pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies. This review provides an update focusing on the latest evidence-based approach for the management of bothersome symptoms of menopause.

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### The menopause transition: signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transition state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and nonhormonal management of clinicopathology attributed to it.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

Evidence Synthesis

The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for greater than 10 years.

Conclusions

The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms of the transition and be prepared to offer treatment to mitigate these symptoms. Many safe and effective options, including HT, are available.

### An empowerment model for managing menopause [^111HZcPG]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Menopause eventually happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries, and almost one billion women worldwide are postmenopausal. Although the biology of typical menopause is ubiquitous, the experience varies substantially. Factors contributing to the experience include not only individual factors, such as the nature and severity of symptoms, but also psychological, social, and contextual considerations, many of which are modifiable. In this first paper in the Lancet Series on menopause, we argue for a new approach that goes beyond the treatment of specific symptoms, to encompass a broad model to support women transitioning this life stage, using the model of empowerment. WHO defines empowerment as an active process of gaining knowledge, confidence, and self-determination to self-manage health and make informed decisions about care. Rather than focusing on menopause as an endocrine deficiency, we propose an empowerment model that recognises factors modifying the experience, in which the patient is an expert in their own condition and the health-care worker supports the patient to become an equal and active partner in managing their own care.

### The 2020 genitourinary syndrome of menopause position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111HYfxb]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the 2013 position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), of which symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component.

Methods

A Panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on vaginal hormone therapies as well as on other management options available or in development for GSM. A search of PubMed was conducted identifying medical literature on VVA and GSM published since the 2013 position statement on the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for VVA in postmenopausal women. The Panel revised and added recommendations on the basis of current evidence. The Panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women and can significantly impair health, sexual function, and quality of life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. In most cases, symptoms can be effectively managed. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogens and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), systemic hormone therapy, and the estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene. Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of vaginal estrogen, vaginal DHEA, and ospemifene are lacking. There are insufficient placebo-controlled trials of energy-based therapies, including laser, to draw conclusions on efficacy and safety or to make treatment recommendations.

Conclusions

Clinicians can resolve many distressing genitourinary symptoms and improve sexual health and the quality of life of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing GSM. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of treatments for the individual patient, and patient preference. Nonhormone therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. Low-dose vaginal estrogens, vaginal DHEA, systemic estrogen therapy, and ospemifene are effective treatments for moderate to severe GSM. When low-dose vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene is administered, a progestogen is not indicated; however, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data at present to confirm the safety of vaginal estrogen or DHEA or ospemifene in women with breast cancer; management of GSM should consider the woman's needs and the recommendations of her oncologist.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and menopausal symptoms [^11112nGf]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

A majority of women will experience bothersome symptoms related to declining and/or fluctuating levels of estrogen during their menopausal transition. Vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and depressed mood have all been found to worsen during the menopausal transition. While vasomotor symptoms gradually improve after menopause, the time course can be many years. Vaginal dryness does not improve without treatment, while the long-term course of sleep and mood deterioration is not clearly defined at this time. A small minority of women have vasomotor symptoms that persist throughout the remainder of their lives. These common menopausal symptoms all improve with estrogen treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in enthusiasm for menopausal hormone therapy, despite its high efficacy relative to other treatments. We have also seen the emergence of sound, evidence-based clinical trials of non-hormonal alternatives that can control the common menopausal symptoms. Understanding the natural history of menopausal symptoms, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal alternatives, helps the clinician individualize management plans to improve quality of life.

### Counseling in menopausal women: how to address the benefits and risks of menopause hormone therapy. A FIGO position paper [^116yTPVn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and current health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks. Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs, and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens, to provide indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women in peri- and postmenopause, worldwide.

### Menopause [^116M6Lgb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause is an inevitable component of ageing and encompasses the loss of ovarian reproductive function, either occurring spontaneously or secondary to other conditions. It is not yet possible to accurately predict the onset of menopause, especially early menopause, to give women improved control of their fertility. The decline in ovarian oestrogen production at menopause can cause physical symptoms that may be debilitating, including hot flushes and night sweats, urogenital atrophy, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, bone loss, and metabolic changes that predispose to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The individual experience of the menopause transition varies widely. Important influential factors include the age at which menopause occurs, personal health and wellbeing, and each woman's environment and culture. Management options range from lifestyle assessment and intervention through to hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacotherapy, each of which has specific benefits and risks. Decisions about therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women depend on symptomatology, health status, immediate and long-term health risks, personal life expectations, and the availability and cost of therapies. More effective and safe therapies for the management of menopausal symptoms need to be developed, particularly for women who have absolute contraindications to hormone therapy.

### Management of menopause: a view towards prevention [^116moZ1N]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Women spend approximately one-third of their lives with menopause, which occurs around 50 years of age. It is now appreciated that several important metabolic and cardiovascular disease risks emerge during the menopausal transition. Many important conditions occur 10–15 years after menopause, including weight gain and obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, osteoporosis, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancer; therefore, the occurrence of menopause heralds an important opportunity to institute preventative strategies. These strategies will lead to improved quality of life and decreased mortality. Various strategies are presented for treating symptoms of menopause and diseases that are asymptomatic. Among several strategies is the use of hormone therapy, which has efficacy for symptoms and osteoporosis, and can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health. When instituted early, which is key, in younger postmenopausal women (under 60 years) oestrogen has been found to consistently decrease mortality with a favourable risk-benefit profile in low-risk women. Prospective data show that long-term therapy might not be required for this benefit.

Decision-making in management of VMS in cancer patients

Comprehensive guidelines have been developed to guide the management of menopausal symptoms such as VMS. These generally recommend HT as first-line therapy due to superior efficacy and tolerability as compared with nonhormone options. However, decision-making may be more complex in cancer patients. In many cases, HT is avoided due to concern for recurrence or growth of hormone-sensitive cancers or risk of venous thromboembolism. In the subsequent sections, efficacy and safety of hormone- and nonhormone-based management options in cancer patients will be discussed.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^111pUBBb]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Robust epidemiologic evidence supports the existence of a 'window of vulnerability' for the occurrence of depression (new onset or recurrent) during the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years. Similar to that observed in other periods in life, antidepressants and psychotherapies continue to be the treatments of choice for depression occurring in midlife women. Nonetheless, accumulated preclinical and clinical data support the benefits of estrogen-based therapies to improve mood and other menopause-related symptoms during this critical window. As such, estrogen should be considered part of the treatment armamentarium for depression, along with other well established benefits (for example, for vasomotor, sexual and other menopause-related complaints). Lastly, the use of specific screening and diagnostic tools for depression in women should help physicians and health professionals to improve early detection and clinical management. Ultimately, treatment strategies should be tailored and incorporate all the resources available to reduce the significant burden and functional impairment associated with depression in women undergoing menopause.

### Managing menopausal symptoms: common questions and answers [^116waCcN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms are widespread and significantly impact quality of life. Common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor (i.e., hot flashes and night sweats) and genitourinary (e.g., vulvovaginal irritation and dryness, dyspareunia, urinary problems), although women may also experience changes in sexual function, mood, and sleep. Estrogen-containing hormone therapy is effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms. Nonhormonal medications for vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentin. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be administered to women taking tamoxifen. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances, but data are lacking to support the effectiveness of other nonpharmacologic treatments such as herbal or botanicalsupplements, exercise, and acupuncture. Hormone-free vaginal moisturizers are noninferior to estrogen-based therapies for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Other treatment options for vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with menopause include ospemifene and intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone. Management of menopausal symptoms should involve shared decision-making that is informed by the best available evidence and individual risks and preferences.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^117Bg992]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Target Population

Postmenopausal patients with primary osteoporosis.

Methods

This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team consisting of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that moved forward to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team based on standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

Recommendations

This Clinical Practice Guideline includes updated recommendations on who should receive osteoporosis pharmacotherapy, the benefits and risks of available pharmacotherapy options, treatment monitoring and follow-up, and the role of calcium and vitamin D in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide guidance when a formal recommendation could not be made because of inadequate or nonexistent evidence.

A clear understanding of the physiology of the menopausal transition, clinical symptoms, and physical changes is essential for individualized patient management, maximizing benefits and minimizing risks for the present and the future. Menopause, defined by amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months, is determined retrospectively and represents a permanent end to menses. Many physical changes occur during the menopausal transition and beyond. Knowledge of symptoms and findings experienced by women undergoing the menopausal transition allow individualized care- improving quality of life and enhancing wellbeing for years to come.

### Current recommendations: what is the clinician to do? [^111Jkgg2]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has complex biologic effects but continues to have an important clinical role in the management of vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. The rational use of menopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of HT and have provided insights to improve decision making. Several clinical characteristics have utility in identifying women for whom benefits of HT are likely to outweigh the risks. Age and time since menopause are strong predictors of health outcomes and absolute risks associated with HT, and differences by age have been particularly apparent for estrogen alone. In the WHI trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, younger women (50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index, but not for stroke and venous thrombosis. Age trends were less clear for CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate, owing to increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thrombosis in all age groups. Absolute risks of adverse events were lower in younger than in older women in both trials, however. Other predictors of lower vascular risk from HT include favorable lipid status and absence of the metabolic syndrome. Transdermal administration may be associated with lower risks of venous thrombosis and stroke, but additional research is needed. The use of risk stratification and personalized risk assessment offers promise for improved benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. One approach to decision making is presented. Key elements include: assessment of whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the primary indication for initiating systemic HT (vaginal estrogen may be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms); understanding the patient's own preference regarding therapy; evaluating the patient for the presence of any contraindications to HT, as well as the time since menopause onset and baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer; reviewing carefully the benefits and risks of treatment with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect; and, if HT is initiated, regularly reviewing the patient's need for continued treatment.

### Menopause and cancers [^112FJm4w]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Cancer is a disease of aging, and therefore is more prevalent after menopause. Menopausal symptoms resulting from cancer treatments are an important survivorship issue in cancer care. This article reviews the preventive strategies, utilization of health resources, and management of menopausal symptoms after cancer treatment. Preventive screening as informed by genetic and lifestyle risk, and lifestyle modification, may mitigate the risk of cancer and cancer mortality. Despite potential benefits to quality of life, hormone replacement is rarely prescribed to survivors of gynecologic malignancies. Special considerations are needed for the treatment and supportive care of menopausal symptoms in cancer survivors.

### Menopause preparedness: perspectives for patient, provider, and policymaker consideration [^112gV4qo]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Menopause is often stigmatized and framed as if it were a disease, as opposed to a natural part of a woman's life cycle. A holistic patient care model that emphasizes earlier and more robust education about the menopause transition for patients and providers would aid in the normalization of this life transition and improve quality of life for patients. Menopausal symptoms and experiences vary widely based on age of onset, overall patient health, and the specific type of menopause an individual experiences. All of these considerations should contribute to a personalized approach to care. Providers should consider which symptoms individuals are experiencing that hinder quality of life and what types of interventions — medical, lifestyle, and/or behavioral — are available to address them. A better understanding of these options and their potential outcomes requires a global increase in awareness and education among providers, patients, and even policymakers. Collecting data from diverse populations on the intersections of menopause and race, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status will better inform key stakeholders in the development of personalized care, innovative treatment options, and relevant policy solutions to improve the menopause experience for all individuals.

### Qualitative assessment of information and decision support needs for managing menopausal symptoms after breast cancer [^116dnpSx]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Our study findings reflect a larger issue in the literature regarding the long-term management of cancer survivors and where survivorship care is best located. The lack of national or international clinical guidelines regarding menopausal symptom management in women with BrCa is a significant gap that requires immediate attention. Rigorous, well-designed clinical research focused on CTs and menopausal symptom management in BrCa populations is also needed to address the growing interest by BrCa survivors in CTs. As this body of clinical research expands, decision support interventions will be required that summarize the latest evidence related to the efficacy and safety of these therapies and translate this knowledge to the bedside. From BrCa survivors' perspective, such interventions must provide clear treatment recommendations to help alleviate their fear and uncertainty and to support their participation in shared decision-making with HCPs.

Implications for CT decision support

The challenges experienced by BrCa survivors and HCPs to engage in informed, evidence-based discussions about CT options for menopausal symptom management point to the need for effective and tailored knowledge translation and decision support strategies that can be easily implemented within varied clinical settings. Patient DAs are one strategy that efficiently translates evidence-based health information and support shared decision-making between individuals and their HCP, as well as acknowledging patients' unique beliefs and values. A patient DA would address BrCa survivors' information needs related to CT and menopausal symptom management by concisely summarizing what is currently known and unknown about conventional and complementary treatment options, account for survivors' health and healthcare experiences (e.g. diagnosis, severity of menopausal symptoms, treatment preferences), and be utilized in both oncology and primary care settings.

Limitations

Although efforts to ensure survivor diversity within the sampling process were undertaken, the composition of a largely Caucasian, well educated, early stage (I and II) BrCa sample limits broad applicability of the study findings. For example, women with later stage disease (> II) may assess risk and make decisions about the use of CTs differently than those with earlier stage disease. Purposeful sampling from two different urban centers, while adding some diversity, does not include perspectives of women living in rural and remote settings, where access to CTs and the influence of sociocultural practices may differentially influence menopause management strategies and CT choices. Patient DAs tailored to women's unique menopause-related CT needs and accounting for their social context may provide an accessible and feasible form of decision support.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for breast cancer patients: what is the current evidence? [^114gS8rC]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Many breast cancer survivors struggle with menopausal symptoms due to oncological treatment-induced hormone deficiency, or because they experience menopause some years after completing treatment, but have limited menopause treatment options. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but is not recommended after breast cancer because it can﻿ increase the risk of relapse. Our objectives were to review the evidence and develop a consensus statement to define the role of menopausal hormone therapy after breast cancer, and to highlight evidence gaps to inform future research.

Methods

A 25-member multidisciplinary panel developed the consensus statements using a modified Delphi methodology. The panel consisted of 18 senior doctors who voted (5 GP menopause specialists, 5 gynecologists, 4 medical oncologists, 3 breast surgical oncologists, and 1 breast radiologist), and 7 members﻿ who did not vote ﻿(4 patient representatives, 1 medical oncologist, 1 urologist and 1 administrator). Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement with low-to-moderate variation in extent of agreement (mean absolute deviation from median of ≤ 0.75). We reviewed current evidence relating to use of vaginal and systemic menopausal hormone therapy ("MHT",﻿ also known as "hormone therapy", "HT" or "hormone replacement therapy", "HRT") after breast cancer diagnosis, and adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy, and developed a narrative synthesis. Finally, four additional breast cancer specialists peer-reviewed the manuscript.

Discussion and Conclusions

The panel agreed that some women may choose to take MHT, (off-label use) and accept an increased risk of relapse in exchange for relief from menopausal symptoms and an improved quality of life, and that preferences may vary according to individual circumstances and the absolute risk of relapse. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed with statements supporting shared decision making and individualized menopause care (MADM 0.29). In our review of the literature, we found mainly moderate quality evidence concerning use of vaginal and systemic estrogen after breast cancer, and high quality evidence concerning the benefits of anti-estrogen therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Based on the available data, we recommend that shared decisions are based on (1) an individual's menopausal symptoms and impact on quality of life, (2) the potential increase in an individual's risk of relapse by use of menopausal hormone therapy, and (3) patient preferences, views and treatment goals. Clinicians and patients can use our findings to make informed menopause treatment choices after breast cancer. We strongly recommend registering all patients considering MHT after breast cancer in a clinical study (eg, MENopausal hormone therapy and Outcomes After Breast Cancer, the MENO-ABC trial).

### Management of menopausal symptoms [^1163783f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Most menopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms with bothersome symptoms often lasting longer than one decade. Hormone therapy (HT) represents the most effective treatment for these symptoms with oral and transdermal estrogen formulations having comparable efficacy. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative and other recent randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of combination estrogen-progestin and estrogen-alone therapy. Absolute risks observed with HT tended to be small, especially in younger women. Neither regimen increased all-cause mortality rates. Given the lower rates of adverse events on HT among women close to menopause onset and at lower baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, risk stratification and personalized risk assessment appear to represent a sound strategy for optimizing the benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. Systemic HT should not be arbitrarily stopped at age 65 years; instead treatment duration should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and personal preferences. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause represents a common condition that adversely affects the quality of life of many menopausal women. Without treatment, symptoms worsen over time. Low-dose vaginal estrogen represents highly effective treatment for this condition. Because custom-compounded hormones have not been tested for efficacy or safety, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HT is preferred. A low-dose formulation of paroxetine mesylate currently represents the only nonhormonal medication FDA-approved to treat vasomotor symptoms. Gynecologists and other clinicians who remain abreast of data addressing the benefit-risk profile of hormonal and nonhormonal treatments can help menopausal women make sound choices regarding management of menopausal symptoms.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) evidence and selection — In postmenopausal women, estrogen therapy (ET) improves menopause-associated symptoms and "reduces menopause-related bone loss, lowers the risk of fragility fractures in older women, and reduces the incidence of self-reported diabetes", and combined estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) "reduced the risk of colorectal cancer and, in cumulative follow-up of the WHI, endometrial cancer". MHT "is not appropriate for all symptomatic menopausal women", and "there are no commonly recognized lists of absolute or relative contraindications to MHT as published in professional society guidelines", although "US product labeling (regulated by the FDA) does include contraindications to MHT… [and] caution is also advised for women with certain additional medical conditions". Women with conditions precluding MHT, those "who are unwilling to take MHT, or at substantial risk for breast cancer or CVD, can consider nonhormonal options for symptom relief".

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117HZMei]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Systemic hormone therapy — indications, timing, and cautions for bone health: The primary indication for systemic HT is for relief of vasomotor (VMS) and other menopause symptoms in postmenopausal women aged younger than 60 years and within 10 years of menopause, with secondary benefit on bone protection. Extended use of HT is an option for well-counseled women who have a low bone mass for prevention of further bone loss and/or reduction of fracture risk when alternate therapies are not appropriate or when the benefits of extended use exceed the risks. Despite positive effects on bone, initiating HT in women aged older than 60 years or more than 10 years beyond menopause is generally not recommended because of concerns about cardiovascular safety, and ET or EPT should largely be used in the early years after menopause. For women with primary ovarian insufficiency, premature menopause, or early surgical menopause, an estrogen preparation should be considered, unless there are contraindications, to prevent bone loss as well as treat menopause symptoms, at least until the average age of natural menopause; higher doses of HT may be needed in younger women, particularly those aged younger than 40 years.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Clinical considerations for menopause and associated symptoms in women with HIV [^117K9q8U]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, more women with HIV are aging and entering menopause. Although a limited number of evidenced-based care recommendations are published, formal guidelines for the management of menopause in women with HIV are not available. Many women with HIV receive primary care from HIV infectious disease specialists, without any detailed assessment of menopause. Women's healthcare professionals specializing in menopause may have limited knowledge regarding the care of women with HIV. Clinical considerations for menopausal women with HIV include distinguishing menopause from amenorrhea because of other etiologies, early assessment of symptoms, and recognizing unique clinical, social, and behavioral comorbidities to facilitate care management.

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

### Menopause preparedness: perspectives for patient, provider, and policymaker consideration [^115kn15J]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective:

The aim of the study was to identify priorities to address unmet needs in clinical care, education, and access to treatment to improve quality of life for individuals during the menopause transition.

Methods:

The Society for Women's Health Research convened a working group of 13 experts to discuss updates in research, clinical practice, and policy on menopause. Participants included patient advocates, policy leaders, and clinical specialists and researchers from gynecology, reproductive endocrinology, psychiatry, and epidemiology. Overarching themes and recommendations for improving menopause care were identified and determined by consensus agreement of the participants at the conclusion of the meeting.

Results:

The Society for Women's Health Research Menopause Working Group identified gaps in clinical care, policy, and patient and provider education. Limited understanding of menopause by patients and clinicians contributes to delays in recognizing the menopause transition and engaging in symptom management. Recent studies on hormone therapy and alternative treatment options provide evidence to inform updates on existing policy recommendations and coverage.

Conclusions:

To improve care and quality of life for individuals during the menopause transition and after menopause, the working group recommends developing a more standardized approach to menopause preparedness that includes education for both patients and providers, as well as considering policy solutions to address regulatory barriers to care. Providers also need to factor in the diverse needs of individuals experiencing menopause in the development of their personalized care.

### Managing menopausal symptoms and associated clinical issues in breast cancer survivors [^113xGxS7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Review evidence to guide management of menopausal signs and symptoms in women after breast cancer and make recommendations accordingly.

Evidence

Randomized controlled clinical trials, observational studies, evidence-based guidelines, and expert opinion from professional societies.

Background

Symptoms and clinical problems associated with estrogen depletion-sleep disorders, vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), vasomotor symptoms (VMS), mood changes, depressive symptoms, cardiovascular disease, osteopenia, and osteoporosis-confront the estimated 9.3 million breast cancer survivors globally.

Recommendations

Following breast cancer, women should not generally be treated with menopausal hormone therapy or tibolone but should optimize lifestyle. Women with moderate to severe symptoms may benefit from mind-brain behavior or nonhormone, pharmacologic therapy. The selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and gabapentenoid agents improve VMS and quality of life. For osteoporosis, nonhormonal agents are available. Treatment of VVA remains an area of unmet need. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is absorbed in small amounts with blood levels remaining within the normal postmenopausal range but could potentially stimulate occult breast cancer cells, and although poorly studied, is not generally advised, particularly for those on aromatase inhibitors. Intravaginal dehydroepiandrosterone and oral ospemiphene have been approved to treat dyspareunia, but safety after breast cancer has not been established. Vaginal laser therapy is being used for VVA but efficacy from sham-controlled studies is lacking. Therapies undergoing development include lasofoxifene, neurokinin B inhibitors, stellate ganglion blockade, vaginal testosterone, and estetrol.

Conclusions

Nonhormone options and therapies are available for treatment of estrogen depletion symptoms and clinical problems after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Individualization of treatment is essential.

### Nonhormonal management of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms: 2015 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^117V3R6d]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To update and expand The North American Menopause Society's evidence-based position on nonhormonal management of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms (VMS), previously a portion of the position statement on the management of VMS.

Methods

NAMS enlisted clinical and research experts in the field and a reference librarian to identify and review available evidence. Five different electronic search engines were used to cull relevant literature. Using the literature, experts created a document for final approval by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Nonhormonal management of VMS is an important consideration when hormone therapy is not an option, either because of medical contraindications or a woman's personal choice. Nonhormonal therapies include lifestyle changes, mind-body techniques, dietary management and supplements, prescription therapies, and others. The costs, time, and effort involved as well as adverse effects, lack of long-term studies, and potential interactions with medications all need to be carefully weighed against potential effectiveness during decision making.

Conclusions

Clinicians need to be well informed about the level of evidence available for the wide array of nonhormonal management options currently available to midlife women to help prevent underuse of effective therapies or use of inappropriate or ineffective therapies. Recommended: Cognitive-behavioral therapy and, to a lesser extent, clinical hypnosis have been shown to be effective in reducing VMS. Paroxetine salt is the only nonhormonal medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of VMS, although other selective serotonin reuptake/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids, and clonidine show evidence of efficacy. Recommend with caution: Some therapies that may be beneficial for alleviating VMS are weight loss, mindfulness-based stress reduction, the S-equol derivatives of soy isoflavones, and stellate ganglion block, but additional studies of these therapies are warranted. Do not recommend at this time: There are negative, insufficient, or inconclusive data suggesting the following should not be recommended as proven therapies for managing VMS: cooling techniques, avoidance of triggers, exercise, yoga, paced respiration, relaxation, over-the-counter supplements and herbal therapies, acupuncture, calibration of neural oscillations, and chiropractic interventions. Incorporating the available evidence into clinical practice will help ensure that women receive evidence-based recommendations along with appropriate cautions for appropriate and timely management of VMS.

### Qualitative assessment of information and decision support needs for managing menopausal symptoms after breast cancer [^117RGF52]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

BrCa survivors suffer profoundly from hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms associated with cancer treatment. Faced with limited treatment options, many women consider CTs for relief of their symptoms. Survivors and HCPs, however, lack credible and concise information about the efficacy and safety of CTs. High-quality clinical trials are needed that expand the evidence base regarding the efficacy and safety of CTs in the management of menopausal symptoms following BrCa treatment. Patient DAs are one decision support strategy that may help synthesize and translate research on CTs as well as empower BrCa survivors and HCPs to engage in shared decision-making about the full range of therapeutic options for managing menopausal symptoms.

### Management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy: 2013 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112tLDqM]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To update and expand the previous position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking. Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms.

Conclusions

Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year. There are insufficient data to confirm the safety of local estrogen in women with breast cancer; management of VVA should take the woman's needs and the recommendation of her oncologist into consideration. Research on the vaginal microbiome may lead to other therapies in the future.

### A practical guide to the management of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients [^112XW6T4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in Canadian women. As a result of increased screening and improved treatment, more women are becoming long-term breast cancer survivors. However, due to either their treatment or prolonged survival, many of these women now have to face the consequences of premature menopause and prolonged estrogen deprivation. Hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy (HRT/ERT) has, in the past, been recommended to healthy women at menopause not only for relief of short-term menopausal changes, particularly hot flashes, but also for its benefits on bone density, fracture reduction, and genitourinary symptoms. Recent studies have demonstrated that not only is HRT associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, but it also has been shown to increase the risk of recurrence in those with a breast cancer history. Until the safety of HRT/ERT in breast cancer patients can be more fully clarified, it would be wise to develop alternative strategies for the management of menopausal symptoms in these patients. This paper will discuss nonestrogen-based therapies for hot flashes, osteoporosis, and genitourinary symptoms, with emphasis on efficacy and safety in breast cancer survivors.

### Mood disorders in midlife women: understanding the critical window and its clinical implications [^111LT9Ne]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years have been described as a "window of vulnerability" for the development of depressive symptoms or depression (new or recurrent) in some women. This article aims to review contributing factors to the emergence of menopause-related depression, some of the key challenges to its proper identification and management, and evidence on effective treatment strategies.

Methods

A body of evidence (animal data, epidemiologic studies, and clinical studies) was reviewed to disentangle some of the complex interactions between changes in sex hormones and reproductive function, physical health, and mood in midlife women. Special focus was given to the window of vulnerability framework.

Results

Despite evidence of a critical window for new onset of depression, a prior depressive episode (particularly if related to reproductive events) remains the strongest predictor of mood symptoms or depression during midlife years. Vasomotor symptoms, anxiety, and other health-related issues also modulate the risk for depression. Mechanistically, estrogen plays an important role in mood and cognitive regulation. Transdermal estradiol, as well as serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants, have shown efficacy in the management of depression in this population. Other evidence-based treatment options (hormonal, pharmacologic, and behavioral) are available to clinicians and health professionals.

Conclusions

A more comprehensive diagnostic approach should be used in symptomatic midlife women. Ultimately, researchers hope to develop preventive strategies and treatments that could be tailored to multiple symptom domains and improve overall functioning.

### Optimising health after early menopause [^1165eqt2]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The typical age at menopause is 50–51 years in high-income countries. However, early menopause is common, with around 8% of women in high-income countries and 12% of women globally experiencing menopause between the ages of 40 years and 44 years. Menopause before age 40 years (premature ovarian insufficiency) affects an additional 2–4% of women. Both early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency can herald an increased risk of chronic disease, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. People who enter menopause at younger ages might also experience distress and feel less supported than those who reach menopause at the average age. Clinical practice guidelines are available for the diagnosis and management of premature ovarian insufficiency, but there is a gap in clinical guidance for early menopause. We argue that instead of distinct age thresholds being applied, early menopause should be seen on a spectrum between premature ovarian insufficiency and menopause at the average age. This Series paper presents evidence for the short-term and long-term consequences of early menopause. We offer a practical framework for clinicians to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause, which considers the nature and severity of symptoms, age and medical history, and the individual's wishes and priorities to optimise their quality of life and short-term and long-term health. We conclude with recommendations for future research to address key gaps in the current evidence.

How Does the Difference Between Formulations of Hormone Therapy Affect Shared Decision-Making About Therapy Choice and Duration. What Nonpharmacologic Treatments Are Effective for Vasomotor Symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapy and clinical hypnosis are effective for short-term reduction of vasomotor symptoms and associated sleep disturbances. 9, 32–34 Black cohosh and isoflavones are shown to be effective compared with placebo but not significantly more than hormonal preparations, and they lack standard formulations. 35–37 Additional nonpharmacologic therapies include other dietary supplements, exercise, and acupuncture, but there are low-quality data available to support effectiveness. 9, 34, 38–41.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY A 2018 meta-analysis of women in natural or treatment-induced menopause found that behavioral interventions significantly decreased short-term and medium-term perceived severity, but not frequency, of vasomotor symptoms. 32 The interventions included mostly group-based, one- to two-hour CBT, relaxation therapy, or mindfulness-based stress reduction sessions occurring weekly for two to 10 weeks. 32 Telephone-based CBT has been shown to improve sleep in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with insomnia due to hot flashes. 33 Two small RCTs of weekly clinical hypnosis sessions over a five-week period appear to reduce hot flash severity and frequency in breast cancer survivors and postmenopausal women with frequent hot flashes.

9 Regular exercise, yoga, biofeedback, and other mindfulness-based therapies are likely safe and may reduce stress associated with menopausal symptoms but are generally not effective for vasomotor symptoms. 34 The effectiveness and safety of the herbal supplement black cohosh and improving dyspareunia and sexual function scores.

### USPSTF: No HRT after menopause for chronic conditions… [^114JMJKB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Nov. 10, 2022, 4: 14 p. m. News Staff — The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force is advising family physicians and other health care professionals to avoid administering hormone replacement therapy to patients for the primary prevention of chronic conditions after menopause. The task force's final recommendation statement, issued Nov. 1 and accompanied by a final evidence review and evidence summary, recommended against the use of combined estrogen and progestin to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people and against the use of estrogen alone to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people who have had a hysterectomy. Both recommendations received "D" grades, meaning that the task force concluded with moderate certainty that these treatments had no net benefit. Overall, the recommendation statement is consistent with the task force's 2017 recommendation on the topic.

"For people who have already gone through menopause, using hormone therapy is not an effective way to prevent chronic conditions because the potential harms cancel out any potential benefit, " said Carol Mangione, M. D. M. S. P. H., the task force's chair, in a USPSTF Bulletin. "Fortunately, the task force has many other evidence-based recommendations on ways people can stay healthy as they age". only for people who are considering hormone therapy to prevent chronic conditions after going through menopause, " explained James Stevermer, M. D. M. S. P. H., a member of the task force who also serves as vice chair for clinical affairs and a professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia, and medical director of MU Health Care Family Medicine-Callaway Physicians in Fulton, Mo. "Those who wish to manage symptoms of menopause with hormone therapy are encouraged to talk with their health care professional".

For individuals who should not receive HRT, the USPSTF pointed to a number of recommendations it has issued related to preventing cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in adults. These include the use of aspirin to prevent CVD, screening for hypertension, screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, behavioral counseling to promote a healthy lifestyle to prevent CVD in adults, and screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures. The task force also recommended that patients and health care professionals work together to determine the best way to maintain good health throughout one's lifespan.
