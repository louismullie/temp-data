## Question

at what level to treat hyperkalemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what serum potassium level to treat hyperkalemia and how management should be guided by severity, ECG findings, and patient context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how hyperkalemia is defined and classified by severity. Then, I should verify the thresholds that trigger urgent versus nonurgent treatment. Next, I will review the role of ECG changes and why they cannot be the sole determinant of urgency. After that, I need to check the recommended treatment algorithms for severe, moderate, and mild hyperkalemia, including membrane stabilization, intracellular shifting, and potassium removal. I will then examine special populations such as CKD, heart failure, and dialysis. Finally, I should confirm monitoring cadence, medication adjustments, and the role of potassium binders, and close with a concise decision framework summary.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and severity cutoffs, because treatment hinges on them. Hyperkalemia is generally defined as serum potassium greater than 5.0 mmol/L, with severity commonly stratified as mild 5.5–5.9 mmol/L, moderate 6.0–6.4 mmol/L, and severe 6.5 mmol/L or higher, although some societies use slightly different thresholds, so I need to be explicit about which guideline I am applying in a given context [^115h7Ejq] [^1172XMC2] [^114ypRXH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment based on the number alone; I should verify the thresholds that mandate urgent therapy. Urgent treatment is indicated for severe hyperkalemia at or above 6.5 mmol/L, or for any potassium level accompanied by ECG changes suggestive of hyperkalemia, or by significant neuromuscular symptoms such as weakness or paralysis, because of the risk of malignant arrhythmias and cardiac arrest [^111pfUau] [^112KvyxG] [^115h7Ejq].

> Wait, let me verify the role of ECG because relying on it can be misleading. ECG changes correlate poorly with serum potassium, and the first reproducible ECG abnormalities may not appear until potassium exceeds about 7.0–7.2 mmol/L, so absence of ECG changes does not exclude danger, and conversely, artifact or pseudohyperkalemia can confound the picture; therefore, urgent treatment decisions should integrate potassium level, ECG, and clinical context rather than ECG alone [^116DJ3Gh] [^116wEk37] [^117QSbyY].

> I will now examine the treatment algorithm for severe hyperkalemia, and I need to ensure I sequence it correctly. The standard approach is three-pronged: stabilize the cardiac membrane with intravenous calcium, shift potassium intracellularly with insulin plus dextrose and consider adjunct beta-agonists, and remove potassium from the body with loop diuretics if euvolemic or hypervolemic, gastrointestinal binders, and urgent dialysis if refractory or in the setting of kidney failure; this sequence should proceed in parallel when indicated [^1148w6NC] [^115Gqbhv] [^115bePMV] [^113p5yDq] [^111rPxfY].

> Let me think about membrane stabilization first. Intravenous calcium is first-line when there are ECG changes or severe hyperkalemia; typical dosing is 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over about 10 minutes, or 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride over about 5 minutes in arrest settings, with repeat dosing guided by ECG response; I should double-check that the dose is expressed as elemental calcium equivalents and that the clinical setting dictates the formulation choice [^114N7A4i].

> Next, I should review intracellular shifting. Insulin 10 units with 25 g dextrose reduces serum potassium by about 0.5–1.0 mmol/L within 15–30 minutes, and I need to remember to give dextrose even if the baseline glucose is normal to mitigate hypoglycemia; nebulized salbutamol 10–20 mg can be used as adjunct, with onset in 15–30 minutes and a similar magnitude of effect, and it is reasonable to combine with insulin for additive benefit; sodium bicarbonate is reserved for patients with concurrent metabolic acidosis rather than routine use [^115bePMV] [^113p5yDq] [^1152AJgs] [^111EprnF].

> I should confirm potassium removal strategies now. Loop diuretics are appropriate when the patient is euvolemic or hypervolemic and has adequate renal function; potassium binders such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are effective for persistent hyperkalemia and can facilitate continuation of RAAS inhibitors; urgent dialysis is indicated for refractory cases, for severe hyperkalemia with kidney failure, or when life-threatening arrhythmias are imminent despite medical therapy [^111k6kg1] [^116L8Ux5] [^111rPxfY].

> For moderate hyperkalemia, I need to ensure I do not over-treat while still acting promptly. Hospital assessment is advised, continuous ECG monitoring is reasonable if the patient is clinically unwell or if a rapid rise is anticipated, and treatment with insulin–dextrose and consideration of beta-agonists is appropriate; I should also obtain an urgent 12-lead ECG at or above 6.0 mmol/L and arrange close laboratory follow-up to detect rebound [^1124Vteu] [^1151R4sV] [^117CXvpp].

> For mild hyperkalemia, let me reconsider whether inpatient therapy is always necessary. Outpatient management is acceptable if the patient is stable, with repeat potassium within 1–3 days depending on severity, attention to contributing medications, and dietary counseling by a renal dietitian; I should confirm that persistent mild hyperkalemia prompts evaluation for reversible causes and binder initiation if it remains 6.0 mmol/L or higher in appropriate CKD or heart failure patients [^111t4bJ8] [^112gR5dH] [^111GoG94] [^111k6kg1].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD or is on dialysis; I need to tailor thresholds and tactics. In CKD, potassium binders are reasonable for persistent hyperkalemia to preserve RAAS inhibitor therapy, and dialysis patients with severe hyperkalemia should receive standard medical therapies if dialysis is not immediately available, with IV calcium for toxic ECG changes even when dialysis is imminent; interdialytic binder use can mitigate recurrent hyperkalemia [^111k6kg1] [^1156gGZL] [^111KzM2S] [^111fBBNc].

> I should double-check medication-related guidance because RAAS inhibitors complicate decisions. Avoid initiating MRAs if baseline potassium exceeds 5.0 mmol/L or eGFR is below 30 mL/min, monitor potassium closely after starting or adjusting RAAS blockade, and consider dose reduction if potassium is 5.5–5.9 mmol/L; if potassium reaches 6.0 mmol/L or higher and cannot be controlled with binders, discontinuation is advised, recognizing the potential harm from loss of RAAS inhibition and the need to rechallenge when safe [^1137mjsn] [^116NkTYS] [^113pqGhr] [^1172e6Fe].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence to avoid missing rebounds. After treating moderate or severe hyperkalemia, check potassium at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours, and maintain continuous ECG monitoring for levels at or above 6.5 mmol/L or when ECG changes are present; in outpatients, repeat within 1 day after a moderate episode and within 3 days after a mild episode to ensure trajectory is improving [^117CXvpp] [^1124Vteu] [^112gR5dH] [^111t4bJ8].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should verify it aligns with high-quality guidance. Treat immediately if potassium is 6.5 mmol/L or higher, or if there are ECG changes or significant symptoms regardless of the number; treat promptly if potassium is 6.0–6.4 mmol/L, especially with renal impairment or ongoing rises; treat nonurgently if potassium is 5.5–5.9 mmol/L with close follow-up; and for 5.0–5.4 mmol/L, address contributors and recheck, escalating if persistent or rising, always integrating ECG, symptoms, and comorbid risk [^111pfUau] [^112KvyxG] [^1163ayFF] [^1172XMC2].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have not overlooked pseudohyperkalemia and sample integrity. Hemolysis, delayed processing, and extreme leukocytosis can artifactually elevate potassium; if the clinical picture does not fit, I should repeat testing with proper handling and consider whole-blood potassium or a blood gas analyzer in emergencies while awaiting formal lab confirmation to avoid iatrogenic harm from treating a spurious value [^117QSbyY] [^114AFj3b].

Treat hyperkalemia based on severity and clinical context: **≥ 6.5 mmol/L or any ECG changes require urgent therapy** [^112KvyxG] (IV calcium, insulin/dextrose, beta-agonists, and dialysis if refractory) [^111ncDVe] [^111rPxfY]. For **5.5–6.4 mmol/L without ECG changes**, use prompt inpatient therapy (insulin/dextrose, beta-agonists, loop diuretics, and potassium binders) [^116mZYBi] [^115h7Ejq]. For **5.0–5.4 mmol/L**, manage outpatient with medication review, dietary counseling, and close follow-up [^1163ayFF] [^115h7Ejq]. Always address underlying causes and monitor potassium closely [^112RLHGt].

## Classification of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia is classified by **serum potassium concentration** [^notfound]:

| **Severity** | **Serum potassium (mmol/l)** |
|-|-|
| Mild | 5.0–5.4 |
| Moderate | 5.5–6.4 |
| Severe | ≥ 6.5 |

---

## Indications for urgent treatment

Urgent treatment is indicated for **severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L)** or when ECG changes are present, regardless of potassium level [^112KvyxG] [^1169cUZx]. ECG changes include peaked T waves, PR interval prolongation, QRS widening, sine wave pattern, and ventricular fibrillation [^111cd3TY].

---

## Treatment strategies by severity

### Severe hyperkalemia (≥ 6.5 mmol/L or ECG changes)

- **IV calcium**: Stabilize cardiac membrane (calcium gluconate 10% 10 mL IV over 2–3 min; repeat as needed) [^114N7A4i].
- **Insulin/dextrose**: Shift potassium intracellularly (regular insulin 10 units + dextrose 50% 50 mL IV) [^115bePMV].
- **Beta-agonists**: Albuterol 10–20 mg nebulized; repeat once if needed [^113p5yDq].
- **Dialysis**: If refractory or renal failure [^111rPxfY].

---

### Moderate hyperkalemia (5.5–6.4 mmol/L without ECG changes)

- **Insulin/dextrose**: 10 units regular insulin + 25 g dextrose IV [^115bePMV].
- **Beta-agonists**: Albuterol 10–20 mg nebulized [^1152AJgs].
- **Loop diuretics**: Furosemide 40–80 mg IV if euvolemic.
- **Potassium binders**: Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate [^111k6kg1] [^116L8Ux5].

---

### Mild hyperkalemia (5.0–5.4 mmol/L)

- **Medication review**: Stop/reduce potassium-raising drugs (e.g. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs) [^112sDH5S].
- **Dietary counseling**: Limit potassium intake [^114sTgDs].
- **Close follow-up**: Recheck potassium within 1–3 days [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Higher risk of recurrence; consider potassium binders and frequent monitoring [^116NkTYS] [^113fXfCY].
- **Heart failure**: Hyperkalemia limits RAAS inhibitor use; potassium binders can enable continued RAAS inhibition [^1162h5y3] [^113mw5TK].
- **Dialysis patients**: Use standard therapies if dialysis is not immediately available; consider potassium binders interdialytically [^1156gGZL] [^111fBBNc].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **frequent potassium checks** after treatment (at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours) [^117CXvpp] and continuous ECG monitoring for severe hyperkalemia or ECG changes [^1124Vteu]. Outpatient follow-up should include **repeat potassium within 1–3 days** after an episode and regular monitoring for chronic hyperkalemia [^111t4bJ8] [^116NkTYS].

---

## Summary of treatment thresholds

| **Severity** | **Serum potassium (mmol/l)** | **Treatment approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 5.0–5.4 | Outpatient management, medication review, dietary counseling |
| Moderate | 5.5–6.4 | Inpatient therapy, insulin/dextrose, beta-agonists, loop diuretics, potassium binders |
| Severe | ≥ 6.5 or ECG changes | Urgent therapy, IV calcium, insulin/dextrose, beta-agonists, dialysis |

---

Treatment of hyperkalemia is **guided by severity, ECG changes, and clinical context** [^115KhjSU]. Severe hyperkalemia or ECG changes require urgent therapy, while mild cases can be managed outpatient with close follow-up [^112KvyxG] [^111t4bJ8].

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Management of hyperkalemia: an update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Because many such medications (especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represent an undesirable clinical compromise. The emergence of 2 new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management. We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies, and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### An evidence-based narrative review of the emergency department management of acute hyperkalemia [^111ncDVe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The normal range for potassium is within narrow limits. Hyperkalemia is an electrolyte disorder that frequently affects patients in the emergency department (ED), and can result in significant morbidity and mortality if not identified and treated rapidly.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based narrative review of the management of hyperkalemia, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Methods

We searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles in English published in peer-reviewed journals and indexed up until May 2020. We used multiple search terms, including hyperkalemia, potassium, acute hyperkalemia, emergency department, dyskalemia, potassium disorders, kidney disease, epidemiology, electrolyte disturbance, severe hyperkalemia, and emergency management.

Discussion

In the ED, interventions aimed to protect patients from the immediate dangers of elevated serum potassium are divided into the following: stabilizing cardiac membrane potentials, reducing serum potassium levels through shift from the extracellular fluid to intracellular fluid, and elimination of potassium through excretion via urinary or fecal excretion. Calcium is widely recommended to stabilize the myocardial cell membrane, but additional research is necessary to establish criteria for use, dosages, and preferred solutions. Redistribution of potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cells is based on intravenous insulin or nebulized β2-agonists.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in the ED. Because of the risk of fatal dysrhythmia due to cardiac membrane instability, hyperkalemia is a medical emergency. There is a lack of scientific evidence on the optimal management of hyperkalemia and more research is needed to establish optimal strategies to manage acute hyperkalemia in the emergency department.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115h7Ejq]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia occur when serum potassium levels are less than 3.5 mEq per L or greater than 5.0 mEq per L, respectively. The World Health Organization recommends a potassium intake of at least 3,510 mg per day for optimal cardiovascular health. Hypokalemia is caused by decreased intake, renal losses, gastrointestinal losses, or transcellular shifts. Severe features of hypokalemia that require urgent treatment include a serum potassium level of 2.5 mEq per L or less, electrocardiography abnormalities, or neuromuscular symptoms. The underlying cause should be addressed, and potassium levels replenished. An oral route is preferred if the patient has a functioning gastrointestinal tract and a serum potassium level greater than 2.5 mEq per L. Hyperkalemia is caused by impaired renal excretion, transcellular shifts, or increased potassium intake. Electrocardiography identifies cardiac conduction disturbances but may not correlate with serum potassium levels. Emergent treatment is recommended for patients with clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., muscle weakness, paralysis) or if electrocardiography abnormalities are present. Acute treatment may include intravenous calcium, insulin, sodium bicarbonate, diuretics, and beta agonists. Dialysis may be considered in the presence of end-stage renal disease, severe renal impairment, or ongoing potassium release. Patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate are newer potassium binders and may be used in chronic or acute hyperkalemia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is associated with serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term management of potassium disturbances includes correcting underlying conditions, dietary counseling, and adjusting causative medications.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is imparied. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Recent Findings

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents (patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate) are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Summary

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Consensus-based recommendations for the management of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting [^112Ruzdf]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia (serum K + > 5.0 mmol/L) is commonly observed among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis and associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Current international guidelines may not reflect the latest evidence on managing hyperkalemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and there is a lack of high-quality published studies in this area. This consensus guideline aims to provide recommendations in relation to clinical practice. Available published evidence was evaluated through a systematic literature review, and the nominal group technique was used to develop consensus recommendations from a panel of experienced nephrologists, covering monitoring, dietary restrictions, prescription of K + binders, and concomitant prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Recent studies have shown that K + binders reduce the incidence of hyperkalemia, but further evidence is needed in areas including whether reduced-K + diets or treatment with K + binders improve patient-centered outcomes. Treatment of hyperkalemia in the hemodialysis setting is complex, and decisions need to be tailored for individual patients.

### Hyperkalemia treatment standard [^11415M5d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disturbance in both inpatient and outpatient clinical practice. The severity and associated risk depends on the underlying cause and rate of potassium (K+) increase. Acute hyperkalemia requires immediate attention due to potentially life-threatening manifestations resulting from the rapid increase in plasma K+ concentration. Treatment is initially focused on stabilizing the cardiac membrane, followed by maneuvers to shift K+ into the cells, and ultimately initiating strategies to decrease total body K+ content. Chronic hyperkalemia develops over a more extended period of time and manifestations tend to be less severe. Nevertheless, the disorder is not benign since chronic hyperkalemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with chronic hyperkalemia begins with a review of medications potentially responsible for the disorder, ensuring effective diuretic therapy and correcting metabolic acidosis if present. The practice of restricting foods high in K+ to manage hyperkalemia is being reassessed since the evidence supporting the effectiveness of this strategy is lacking. Rather, dietary restriction should be more nuanced, focusing on reducing the intake of nonplant sources of K+. Down-titration and/or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors should be discouraged since these drugs improve outcomes in patients with heart failure and proteinuric kidney disease. In addition to other conservative measures, K+ binding drugs and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors can assist in maintaining the use of these drugs.

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^115KhjSU]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia and hyperkalemia are common electrolyte disorders caused by changes in potassium intake, altered excretion, or transcellular shifts. Diuretic use and gastrointestinal losses are common causes of hypokalemia, whereas kidney disease, hyperglycemia, and medication use are common causes of hyperkalemia. When severe, potassium disorders can lead to life-threatening cardiac conduction disturbances and neuromuscular dysfunction. Therefore, a first priority is determining the need for urgent treatment through a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory, and electrocardiography findings. Indications for urgent treatment include severe or symptomatic hypokalemia or hyperkalemia; abrupt changes in potassium levels; electrocardiography changes; or the presence of certain comorbid conditions. Hypokalemia is treated with oral or intravenous potassium. To prevent cardiac conduction disturbances, intravenous calcium is administered to patients with hyperkalemic electrocardiography changes. Insulin, usually with concomitant glucose, and albuterol are preferred to lower serum potassium levels in the acute setting; sodium polystyrene sulfonate is reserved for subacute treatment. For both disorders, it is important to consider potential causes of transcellular shifts because patients are at increased risk of rebound potassium disturbances.

### What is the optimal serum potassium level in cardiovascular patients? [^115fZ5rc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Humans are prone to sodium overload and potassium depletion. This electrolyte imbalance is important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death. Avoiding hypokalemia is beneficial in several cardiovascular disease states including acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension. The evidence highlighting the importance of potassium homeostasis in cardiovascular disease and possible mechanisms explaining potassium's benefits are reviewed. Targets for serum potassium concentration are suggested.

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia? [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder appreciated with greater frequency in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and with use of certain medications such as renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. The traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that particular levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypic presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations of morbidity and mortality in patients with hyperkalemia but these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and in differing clinical presentations. Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and degree of concurrent illness might predispose certain patients presenting with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked; yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia is in determining patient outcome. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments of hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia [^116MgUnZ]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening metabolic problem caused by inability of the kidneys to excrete potassium, impairment of the mechanisms that move potassium from the circulation into the cells, or a combination of these factors. Acute episodes of hyperkalemia commonly are triggered by the introduction of a medication affecting potassium homeostasis; illness or dehydration also can be triggers. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, hyperkalemia may be caused by the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. The presence of typical electrocardiographic changes or a rapid rise in serum potassium indicates that hyperkalemia is potentially life threatening. Urine potassium, creatinine, and osmolarity should be obtained as a first step in determining the cause of hyperkalemia, which directs long-term treatment. Intravenous calcium is effective in reversing electrocardiographic changes and reducing the risk of arrhythmias but does not lower serum potassium. Serum potassium levels can be lowered acutely by using intravenous insulin and glucose, nebulized beta2 agonists, or both. Sodium polystyrene therapy, sometimes with intravenous furosemide and saline, is then initiated to lower total body potassium levels.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1162h5y3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome with high morbidity and mortality that has acquired pandemic dimensions, affecting more than 38 million people worldwide. 1 In addition, the progressive nature of HF makes it a leading cause of hospitalization, due to the deleterious effects of sustained neurohormonal activation and comorbidities. 2 Electrolytic disturbances, most usually of potassium levels, very often accompany HF, are a hindrance to the optimization of medication and impose a further burden on the patient. Since potassium plays a major role in cardiac excitability and arrhythmias, dyskalemia is an important clinical problem that is associated with significant life‐threatening complications. 3, 4 Although the definition is not consistent always, hyperkalemia is generally defined as a serum potassium level > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L and can be further classified as mild (5.6‐6.0 mEq/L), moderate (6.1‐7.0 mEq/L), and severe (> 7.0 mEq/L). Potassium secretion is highly dependent on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) activity and renal perfusion, as well as sodium availability to the distal nephron. Hyperkalemia represents both a direct risk for cardiovascular morbidity and a potential biomarker of adverse prognosis and disease severity. Patients with HF are at particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely to reflect some medical comorbidity, especially renal dysfunction. In addition, it is one of the most common factors that impede the optimum pharmaceutical approach to HF, leading to underuse of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), which are the drugs that offer the most help and have changed the outcomes of HF patients. 5 Unfortunately, some additional independent risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced age and renal insufficiency, that exacerbate all‐cause and in‐hospital mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients, also further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. At the opposite end of the scale is hypokalemia, which can also be observed in HF patients and can increase the risk of mortality, mainly via arrhythmogenic complications. 6, 7, 8 Thus, both high and low potassium levels are unacceptable in HF patients. Data from the literature highlight the need for careful potassium monitoring, especially in the presence of comorbidities, with special emphasis being placed on patients with a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). 5

### Management of hyperkalaemia in chronic kidney disease [^114C8jgq]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2014). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalaemia is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in part because of the effects of kidney dysfunction on potassium homeostasis and in part because of the cluster of comorbidities (and their associated treatments) that occur in patients with CKD. Owing to its electrophysiological effects, severe hyperkalaemia represents a medical emergency that usually requires prompt intervention, whereas the prevention of hazardous hyperkalaemic episodes in at-risk patients requires measures aimed at the long-term normalization of potassium homeostasis. The options for effective and safe medical interventions to restore chronic potassium balance are few, and long-term management of hyperkalaemia is primarily limited to the correction of modifiable exacerbating factors. This situation can result in a difficult trade-off in patients with CKD, because drugs that are beneficial to these patients (for example, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system antagonists) are often the most prominent cause of their hyperkalaemia. Maintaining the use of these beneficial medications while implementing various strategies to control potassium balance is desirable; however, discontinuation rates remain high. The emergence of new medications that specifically target hyperkalaemia could lead to a therapeutic paradigm shift, emphasizing preventive management over ad hoc treatment of incidentally discovered elevations in serum potassium levels.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^114N7A4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

2 SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND

2.1 Definition of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can be classified as acute (as occurring in an emergent setting), chronic, or recurrent, depending on the onset and number of hyperkalemia episodes that have occurred. The decision of whether emergency therapy is warranted is largely based on subjective clinical judgement. The lack of robust and evidence‐based treatment guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia in the emergency department poses a challenge for treatment.

Although the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), and other organizations, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Hearth Failure Society of America (HFSA)have issued guidelines, the concentration of potassium that is labelled as hyperkalemia varies. Serum potassium concentrations of 5.0,5.5, or 6.0 mmol/Lare commonly used cutoffs for the definition of hyperkalemia.

The KDIGO controversies' conference report defines the severity of hyperkalemia by both serum potassium concentration and ECG changes. The most common ECG change is peaked T waves, followed by QRS prolongation. Hyperkalemia is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on potassium concentration and the presence or absence of ECG changes. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 5.0–5.9 mmol/L are typically defined as mild and ≥ 6.0–6.4 mmol/L as moderate. Serum potassium concentrations ≥ 6.5 mmol/L are typically defined as severe.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^116A99hS]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Severe hyperkalemia, requiring hospitalization and prompt treatment, occurs in patients with diverse medical conditions; precipitating factors also vary. The mortality rate increases in patients with greater differences between the admission and highest serum K + levels, in patients with MOF or cardiac arrest (or both) at the time of hyperkalemia diagnosis, in those with severe underlying diseases, in those with coexisting medical conditions, and in those who develop AKI from normal baseline renal function, as opposed to those with underlying CKD, with or without AKI.

Consequently, controlling and maintaining the serum K + level within a safe range have great importance in the clinical setting. Determining additional risk factors for severe hyperkalemia may be valuable and instructive to clinicians in the identification of high-risk patients and in the effective management of severe hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: foe or friend? [^1136PaYq]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the management of hyperkalemia in these patient populations may include reduction or discontinuation of RAASi, this may have a negative impact on outcomes. Adverse cardiorenal outcomes have been observed to increase with RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, particularly in cohorts with CKD and HF. 50 Therefore, optimizing the therapeutic dosage of RAASi is encouraged, despite any difficulties in managing hyperkalemia. Due to the high prevalence of comorbidities among patients with HF, there is a risk that target doses of the disease‐modifying drugs cannot be achieved, reducing the effectiveness of the therapy.

Although the problem of hyperkalemia in these patients appears significant, one if its clear causes are the lack of sufficient control of potassium levels in primary care, which leads to the hyperkalemia rates described above, together with their complications. Nilsson et al. examined patients starting MRA therapy between 2007 and 2010 in Sweden and found that only 24% were adequately monitored at the recommended intervals. 51 The prompt recognition of hyperkalemia usually leads to its treatment, improving the rates of optimum treatment in HF patients.

In general, HF patients with renal dysfunction, high potassium levels (> 5.0 mEq/L) or bilateral renal stenosis might need a rechecking of potassium levels within 1 to 2 weeks after the initiation of RAASi and then every 3 to 5 months, while treatment may be stopped or the dose reduced when potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L. Regarding MRAs in these patients, potassium is checked after 1 week, then 4, and then every 3 months; again, treatment is stopped or tapered when the potassium level reaches > 5.5 mEq/L.

In every case, we should try to restart treatment. HF treatment guidelines do not encourage MRAs use in patients with an eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L. In addition, it is important to instigate dietary counseling regarding potassium and reappraise concomitant medications (eg, potassium supplements, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, etc.) in those patients.

5 PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF POTASSIUM

Diets high in potassium have been associated with a lower incidence of hypertension and heart failure. 37 Experimental data show that high potassium protects against hypertensive and sodium‐induced endothelial dysfunction, independently of blood pressure. 38, 39, 40 In animal models, increasing plasma potassium improves endothelial function and arterial stiffness, reducing the rate of thrombosis on endothelial lesions. 39, 40 Notably, high potassium levels have been shown to have protective effects against stroke and kidney disease in hypertensive rats. 41

In general terms, serum potassium 4 to 4.9 mEq/L is optimal and 5 to 5.5 mEq/L appears relatively safe in HF. 7 In a large cohort of patients with acute HF, patients with higher serum potassium were found to have a better diuretic response and low potassium was one of the strongest predictors of a poor diuretic response. 16 It also appears that eGFR is lower in HF patients with higher potassium levels, which probably means that high potassium levels reflect worse renal function and may be a risk marker rather than a risk factor. 16

In the EPHESUS trial, eplerenone also reduced the risk of hypokalemia, which was twice as large as the risk of serious hyperkalemia. 32 Important findings from EMPHASIS‐HF suggest that the favorable effects of eplerenone on all‐cause death were independent of the incidence of hyperkalemia or worsening renal function. 42, 43 On the other hand, a sub‐study from the RALES trial in chronic HF found that an increase in potassium levels after spironolactone treatment was not associated with an increase in mortality. 31 In the RALES trial, the benefit of spironolactone was maintained in the setting of moderate hyperkalemia, and clinical outcomes with spironolactone were superior to those with placebo when potassium levels remained < 6.0 mEq/L. 31 In this trial, 13.5% and 40% of participants exhibited hyperkalemia when treated with 25 and 50 mg daily of spironolactone, indicating that hyperkalemia in HF is not always an ominous sign. Results from a recent, large, network‐wide analysis suggested that there was no difference in outcomes between patients with normal or mildly elevated potassium levels. 31 Notably, serious hyperkalemia occurred in only 2% and 1% of patients in the spironolactone and placebo arms, respectively. 31

### Potassium disorders: hypokalemia and hyperkalemia [^113hTA5U]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyperkalemia:

- Definition: Hyperkalemia is defined as an increase in serum potassium levels > 5.0 mmol/L.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of hyperkalemia involves disruptions in potassium balance due to excess potassium intake, impaired potassium excretion, or transcellular shifts. The etiology is often multifactorial, with impaired renal function, medication use, and hyperglycemia being the most common contributors.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of hyperkalemia in the US is estimated at 1,550 per 100,000 population.
- Disease course: Mild and moderate hyperkalemia are usually asymptomatic. Severe cases may manifest as muscle weakness, ascending paralysis, heart palpitations, and paresthesias. ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia include peaked T waves, P-wave flattening, PR-interval prolongation, widening of the QRS complex, and sine waves.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of hyperkalemia is dependent on the severity of the condition and the promptness of treatment. Severe untreated hyperkalemia can lead to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of a patient with hypokalemia [^113NFDQ5]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is common and can be associated with serious adverse consequences, including paralysis, ileus, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. As a result, the body maintains serum potassium concentration within very narrow limits by tightly regulated feedback and feed-forward systems. Whereas the consequences of symptomatic hypokalemia and severe potassium depletion are well appreciated, chronic mild hypokalemia can accelerate the progression of chronic kidney disease, exacerbate systemic hypertension, and increase mortality. Persistent hypokalemia may reflect total-body potassium depletion or increased renal potassium clearance. In a patient with simple potassium depletion, potassium replacement therapy should correct serum potassium concentration, but may have little effect when renal potassium clearance is abnormally increased from potassium wasting. In such cases, the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics might be helpful. Serum potassium concentration is an inaccurate marker of total-body potassium deficit. Mild hypokalemia may be associated with significant total-body potassium deficits and conversely, total-body potassium stores can be normal in patients with hypokalemia due to redistribution. The speed and extent of potassium replacement should be dictated by the clinical picture and guided by frequent reassessment of serum potassium concentration(.) The goals of therapy should be to correct a potassium deficit, if present, without provoking hyperkalemia. Oral replacement is preferred except when there is no functioning bowel or in the setting of electrocardiogram changes, neurologic symptoms, cardiac ischemia, or digitalis therapy.

### Pharmacological interventions for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults [^114mdtLH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. Renal replacement therapy is known to be effective in treating hyperkalaemia, but safe and effective pharmacological interventions are needed to prevent dialysis or avoid the complications of hyperkalaemia until dialysis is performed.

Objectives

This review looked at the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used in the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults. This review evaluated the therapies that reduce serum potassium as well as those that prevent complications of hyperkalaemia.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 18 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at any pharmacological intervention for the acute management of hyperkalaemia in adults were included in this review. Non-standard study designs such as cross-over studies were also included. Eligible studies enrolled adults (aged 18 years and over) with hyperkalaemia, defined as serum potassium concentration ≥ 4.9 mmol/L, to receive pharmacological therapy to reduce serum potassium or to prevent arrhythmias. Patients with artificially induced hyperkalaemia were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three authors screened titles and abstracts, and data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed independently by at least two authors. Studies reported in non-English language journals were translated before assessment. Authors were contacted when information about results or study methodology was missing from the original publication. Although we planned to group all studies of a particular pharmacological therapy regardless of administration route or dose for analysis, we were unable to conduct meta-analyses because of the small numbers of studies evaluating any given treatment. For continuous data we reported mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included seven studies (241 participants) in this review. Meta-analysis of these seven included studies was not possible due to heterogeneity of the treatments and because many of the studies did not provide sufficient statistical information with their results. Allocation and blinding methodology was poorly described in most studies. No study evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for preventing clinically relevant outcomes such as mortality and cardiac arrhythmias; however there is evidence that several commonly used therapies effectively reduce serum potassium levels. Salbutamol administered via either nebulizer or metered-dose inhaler (MDI) significantly reduced serum potassium compared with placebo. The peak effect of 10 mg nebulised salbutamol was seen at 120 minutes (MD -1.29 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.94) and at 90 minutes for 20 mg nebulised salbutamol (1 study: MD -1.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.54 to -0.82). One study reported 1.2 mg salbutamol via MDI 1.2 mg produced a significant decrease in serum potassium beginning at 10 minutes (MD -0.20 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and a maximal decrease at 60 minutes (MD -0.34 mmol/L, P < 0.0001). Intravenous (IV) and nebulised salbutamol produced comparable effects (2 studies). When compared to other interventions, salbutamol had similar effect to insulin-dextrose (2 studies) but was more effective than bicarbonate at 60 minutes (MD -0.46 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.10; 1 study). Insulin-dextrose was more effective than IV bicarbonate (1 study) and aminophylline (1 study). Insulin-dextrose, bicarbonate and aminophylline were not studied in any placebo-controlled studies. None of the included studies evaluated the effect of IV calcium or potassium binding resins in the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the acute pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia is limited, with no clinical studies demonstrating a reduction in adverse patient outcomes. Of the studied agents, salbutamol via any route and IV insulin-dextrose appear to be most effective at reducing serum potassium. There is limited evidence to support the use of other interventions, such as IV sodium bicarbonate or aminophylline. The effectiveness of potassium binding resins and IV calcium salts has not been tested in RCTs and requires further study before firm recommendations for clinical practice can be made.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hyperkalemia [^114dKtnY]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia generally is attributable to cell shifts or abnormal renal potassium excretion. Cell shifts account for transient increases in serum potassium levels, whereas sustained hyperkalemia generally is caused by decreased renal potassium excretion. Impaired renal potassium excretion can be caused by a primary decrease in distal sodium delivery, a primary decrease in mineralocorticoid level or activity, or abnormal cortical collecting duct function. Excessive potassium intake is an infrequent cause of hyperkalemia by itself, but can worsen the severity of hyperkalemia when renal excretion is impaired. Before concluding that a cell shift or renal defect in potassium excretion is present, pseudohyperkalemia should be excluded.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia in heart failure: probably not O"K" [^111b1mZi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is routinely defined as a serum potassium level > 5 mmol/L and is a common occurrence in patients with acute and chronic heart failure (HF). For example, prior work has demonstrated that hyperkalemia is present in ≈9% of patients admitted for acute HF, 1 and the total annual charges for Medicare admissions related to a primary diagnosis of hyperkalemia are substantial, with estimates as high as $697 million in 2011. 2 Elevated potassium levels may affect the activity of myocardial potassium channels, leading to more rapid membrane depolarization. The downstream effects of this may translate into slower myocardial electrical conduction, resulting in malignant tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias. Hyperkalemia, especially with potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/L, has been consistently linked to poor clinical outcomes in patients with HF. 3, 4 Recent estimates from the PARADIGM‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial suggest the incidence of hyperkalemia in a trial population receiving treatment with renin‐angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) was ≈16% over a median follow‐up time of 27 months, despite a highly selected and carefully monitored clinical trial population. 5 Similarly, in a large cohort from the United Kingdom of 19 194 patients with new‐onset HF, 11% developed hyperkalemia during a 4‐year follow‐up. 6 Multiple prior analyses of clinical trials and population‐based studies identify renal dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the use of mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) and RASi as major risk factors for hyperkalemia. Given that 5.7 million people in the United States alone have HF and this number is increasing, there is an overwhelming number of patients at risk for hyperkalemia and associated adverse events. 7 Patients with HF are at a particularly high risk for hyperkalemia, which is likely reflective of their medical comorbidity, including renal dysfunction. In addition, several of the current medical therapies for the management of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) add to this risk. These include cornerstone therapies, such as the following: (1) RASi, including angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor inhibitors with or without neprilysin inhibition; and (2) MRAs, such as spironolactone and eplerenone. Whether a consequence of a real or perceived risk of hyperkalemia, evidence supports that these therapies are underused, and when used there is suboptimal dose titration. 8, 9 Although there are data to support that mild hyperkalemia (potassium level, 5–5.5 mmol/L) in the setting of RASi and MRA therapy might not be associated with poor clinical outcomes, hyperkalemia in HF remains a major clinical dilemma. 3, 10

Although hyperkalemia was increased in both trials, the incidence of hyperkalemia‐related adverse events with clinical impact was low, with hyperkalemia‐related permanent treatment discontinuation in only 1.7% of patients receiving finerenone versus 0.6% with placebo. Potassium intake was not restricted during the trials, but finerenone or placebo was withheld in cases where potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L were detected until potassium concentrations fell to < 5.0 mmol/L. With a robust potassium management strategy guided by regular monitoring of serum potassium, there were no hyperkalemia‐related deaths in more than 13,000 patients over a median follow‐up of 3 years.

End points

The primary end point was the change in serum potassium from baseline during the 48 h after the first dose. The time of onset for patiromer was defined as the earliest time point at which the mean change in potassium from baseline was significant < 0 mEq/l (P < 0.05). The secondary end point was the change in serum potassium from baseline in prespecified subgroups defined by severity of hyperkalemia at baseline: moderate (serum potassium 5.5–6.0 mEq/l) and severe hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 6.0–6.5 mEq/l). The proportion of patients achieving normokalemia (serum potassium 3.5–5.0 mEq/l) was a prespecified exploratory end point. An ad hoc exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate the change in serum potassium from the last dose of patiromer and a post hoc analysis evaluated the time to first serum potassium ≤ 5.5 mEq/l. Adverse events that occurred through the post-treatment follow-up phase are summarized descriptively.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition predominantly seen in patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease (CKD) who may also have diabetes, heart failure, or both.

Objectives

To select starting doses for a phase 3 study and to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of a potassium-binding polymer, patiromer, in outpatients with hyperkalemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging, randomized clinical trial (AMETHYST-DN), conducted at 48 sites in Europe from June 2011 to June 2013 evaluating patiromer in 306 outpatients with type 2 diabetes (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 15 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium level > 5.0 mEq/L). All patients received RAAS inhibitors prior to and during study treatment.

Interventions

Patients were stratified by baseline serum potassium level into mild or moderate hyperkalemia groups and received 1 of 3 randomized starting doses of patiromer (4.2 g [n = 74], 8.4 g [n = 74], or 12.6 g [n = 74] twice daily [mild hyperkalemia] or 8.4 g [n = 26], 12.6 g [n = 28], or 16.8 g [n = 30] twice daily [moderate hyperkalemia]). Patiromer was titrated to achieve and maintain serum potassium level 5.0 mEq/L or lower.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was mean change in serum potassium level from baseline to week 4 or prior to initiation of dose titration. The primary safety end point was adverse events through 52 weeks. Secondary efficacy end points included mean change in serum potassium level through 52 weeks.

Results

A total of 306 patients were randomized. The least squares mean reduction from baseline in serum potassium level at week 4 or time of first dose titration in patients with mild hyperkalemia was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.22–0.48) mEq/L for the 4.2 g twice daily starting-dose group, 0.51 (95% CI, 0.38–0.64) mEq/L for the 8.4 g twice daily starting-dose group, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.42–0.68) mEq/L for the 12.6 g twice daily starting-dose group. In those with moderate hyperkalemia, the reduction was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.60–1.14) mEq/L for the 8.4 g twice daily starting-dose group, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.70–1.23) mEq/L for the 12.6 g twice daily starting-dose group, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67–1.17) mEq/L for the 16.8 g twice daily starting-dose group (P < .001 for all changes vs baseline by hyperkalemia starting-dose groups within strata). From week 4 through week 52, statistically significant mean decreases in serum potassium levels were observed at each monthly point in patients with mild and moderate hyperkalemia. Over the 52 weeks, hypomagnesemia (7.2%) was the most common treatment-related adverse event, mild to moderate constipation (6.3%) was the most common gastrointestinal adverse event, and hypokalemia (< 3.5 mEq/L) occurred in 5.6% of patients.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with hyperkalemia and diabetic kidney disease, patiromer starting doses of 4.2 to 16.8 g twice daily resulted in statistically significant decreases in serum potassium level after 4 weeks of treatment, lasting through 52 weeks.

8.7 Renal Impairment

Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia. Patients with impaired renal function, particularly if the patient is on RAAS inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]. The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently. Renal function should be assessed periodically.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade alone or, in some cases, in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there also are potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert the levels that may be dangerous or life threatening.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^115uaRV3]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

Should I Be Concerned About Serum Potassium Levels Following Initiation of a RASi or Finerenone?

RASis can be associated with hyperkalemia, which can be managed by a reduction in potassium intake, as well as prescribing diuretics, sodium bicarbonate, or potassium binders to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the RASi dose or withdrawing treatment, which should only occur if mitigation strategies are ineffective. A meta-analysis comprising seven studies demonstrated an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events with RASi discontinuation in individuals with CKD, suggesting that if the clinical situation is appropriate, RASi treatment should be continued for maximum benefit.

Those treated with finerenone should have a serum potassium concentration ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at initiation, and monitoring should take place 1 month after starting. If levels rise to > 5.5 mmol/L, finerenone should be stopped, with adjustments made to diet or the addition of diuretics and/or potassium binders. Treatment may resume when potassium levels are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L.

Considering the risk of hyperkalemia is increased with MRAs and RASis, implementing the pillar approach would be advantageous over the stepwise approach, as the addition of an SGLT2i to these therapies may decrease the occurrence of hyperkalemia events. Indeed, in CONFIDENCE, the incidence of hyperkalemia was lower with finerenone and empagliflozin combination therapy than finerenone alone, indicating another advantage of simultaneous administration of these drugs. Patient-and-physician-shared decision-making should be at the center of hyperkalemia management.

Should I Expect a Reduction in an Individual's UACR Following Initiation of Appropriate Treatments?

Early changes (i.e. 6 months) in UACR have been previously accepted as a valid surrogate outcome for kidney endpoints. Moreover, patients may be more likely to adhere to medications if they experience an improvement in UACR with the addition of medications.

UACR is highly variable between measurements and is impacted by numerous other factors (for example, glycemic and blood pressure control, diet, and physical activity); therefore, the lack of decline after initiating medication does not necessarily indicate treatment failure and thus treatment should continue. If UACR continues to climb or the eGFR falls significantly, despite using of all the treatment strategies, consider referral to a nephrologist to determine if another etiology may be present or if intensification of therapy is warranted.

8 HYPERKALEMIA MANAGEMENT: FOCUS ON NEW TREATMENTS

The treatment of chronic hyperkalemia can be difficult and may be life‐threatening if left untreated. Potassium binders such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate is mainly used in patients with CKD and hyperkalemia. This substance is only suitable for short‐term treatment since its use is associated with hypernatremia, volume overload and gastrointestinal complications. A suggested management of chronic hyperkalemia in HF patients is presented in Figure 1. However, their use is associated with adverse effects, their efficacy is ascertain and their effects are transient. In this regard, the introduction of patiromer, acting at the level of the gastrointestinal tract, in particular in the colon lumen, is relevant, 20, 21, 23, 24 may decrease serum potassium levels and enable treatment with RAASi and MRAs in significantly higher doses. Patiromer for oral suspension is a non‐absorbed, sodium‐free potassium binding polymer that exchanges calcium for potassium in the gastrointestinal tract. Patiromer beads are insoluble, have an average particle size of ≈100 μm and so are too large to be absorbed, excreted ≈24 to 48 h after intake and bind potassium predominantly in the lumen of the colon and this increases fecal potassium excretion, reducing levels of free potassium. 20, 21, 23, 24 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by patiromer in large clinical trials was in the range 0.45 to 1 mmol/L. 52

Zirconium cyclosilicate (SCZ, former ZS‐9) — an inorganic cation that allows a thermodynamically favorable catching of potassium ions‐ represent another significant pharmacologic advancements in the treatment of hyperkalemia. More specifically SCZ is an oral, nonabsorbed, high‐capacity cation‐binding compound that selectively exchanges K + for hydrogen and sodium ions throughout the gastrointestinal tract and has rapid onset of action. A single treatment with SCZ may reduce serum K + levels at 1 h after the initial dose, results in a continued and sustained reduction in serum K + levels for up to 48 h after the initial dose and has a favorable safety profile. 53 The mean reduction of serum potassium levels by SCZ in large clinical trials was in the range 0.3 to 1.1 mmol/L. 52

Potassium disorders are common in patients with kidney disease, particularly in patients with tubular disorders and low glomerular filtration rate. A multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinicians met in October 2018 to identify evidence and address controversies in potassium management. The issues discussed encompassed our latest understanding of the regulation of tubular potassium excretion in health and disease; the relationship of potassium intake to cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, with increasing evidence showing beneficial associations with plant-based diet and data to suggest a paradigm shift from the idea of dietary restriction toward fostering patterns of eating that are associated with better outcomes; the paucity of data on the effect of dietary modification in restoring abnormal serum potassium to the normal range; a novel diagnostic algorithm for hypokalemia that takes into account the ascendency of the clinical context in determining cause, aligning the educational strategy with a practical approach to diagnosis; and therapeutic approaches in managing hyperkalemia when chronic and in the emergency or hospital ward. In sum, we provide here our conference deliberations on potassium homeostasis in health and disease, guidance for evaluation and management of dyskalemias in the context of kidney diseases, and research priorities in each of the above areas.

Definitions of hyperkalemia

Definitions of hyperkalemia vary by geographic region. In Europe, mild hyperkalemia is defined as serum potassium 5.0–5.4 mEq/L, moderate as 5.5–5.9 mEq/L, and severe as ≥ 6.0 mEq/L. The American Heart Association uses cutoffs of 5–6 mEq/L (mild), 6–7 mEq/L (moderate), and > 7 mEq/L (severe). However, in this review, we refer to the standard potassium values specified in the guidelines published by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare entitled "Classification criteria for the seriousness of adverse drug reactions of medical agents", wherein serum potassium values of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L and < 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 2 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and values of ≥ 6.0 mEq/L are classified as Grade 3 ADRs. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), Japanese nephrology guidelines recommend maintaining serum potassium between 4.0 and 5.5 mEq/L to avoid hypo- or hyperkalemia. Of note, mild to moderate hyperkalemia generally cannot be diagnosed from electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; a study in hospitalized patients indicated that the first ECG changes occurred at serum potassium levels above 7.2 mEq/L, a level that already indicates severe hyperkalemia.

Study End Points

The primary end point was the mean absolute reduction in serum potassium level from baseline at 3 distinct time intervals after patiromer administration: 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. These time intervals were prespecified to facilitate analysis in the absence of a standardized, institutional hyperkalemia protocol. Reduction of serum potassium levels was also assessed using relative (percentage) reduction owing to the hypothesized mechanism of more prominent lowering with higher baseline elevation. Outcomes were compared across prespecified subgroups based on care setting, patiromer dose, and baseline hyperkalemia severity stratified as mild (potassium level, 5.1–5.5 mEq/L), moderate (potassium level, 5.6–6.4 mEq/L), or severe (potassium level, ≥ 6.5 mEq/L). Subsequent use of any potassium binder was captured as well as standard-of-care hyperkalemia control measures (eg, calcium, albuterol, regular insulin coadministered with dextrose, and dialysis). Time to a second potassium binder dose and time to insulin dose were assessed. Incidence of hypokalemia, defined as a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L, and incidence of hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL or less (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.4114), at 24 hours were recorded. Potassium laboratory test orders and their performance times after the initial patiromer administration were evaluated at intervals of 0 to 6 hours, greater than 6 to 12 hours, and greater than 12 to 24 hours. The time to the earliest recheck and the presence of repeated laboratory tests in each time interval were evaluated to provide insight on potassium monitoring patterns in real-world clinical practice without a treatment protocol.

### Potassium chloride oral (Potassium chloride) [^112AewMC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration and Monitoring

Monitoring

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the potassium chloride oral solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Daily dose ranges from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses; limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24-hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### Severe hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization: predictors of mortality [^111cd3TY]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Potassium (K +) is a ubiquitous cation contained mostly within the intracellular fluid; only about 2% of total body K + is found in the extracellular fluid. In healthy humans, serum K + levels are tightly controlled within the narrow range of 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L, thus retaining a normal ratio between the intracellular and extracellular compartments. This homeostasis plays a critical role in maintaining cellular resting membrane potential and neuromuscular function and is essential for normal activity of muscles, nerves, and the heart. Hyperkalemia, resulting from an imbalance in K + homeostasis, is defined as a serum K + level of greater than 5.0 mEq/L and is further classified as mild, moderate, or severe. It has been reported that drug therapy and impaired renal function are the main factors predisposing to the development of hyperkalemia.

Severe hyperkalemia (K + of at least 6.5 mEq/L) is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder that has been reported to occur in 1% to 10% of all hospitalized patients, a higher percentage than that seen in outpatients. It is associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, including peaked T waves, shortened QT intervals, prolonged PR intervals, reduction in the amplitude of P waves, and 'sine-wave' ventricular rhythms with wide QRS complexes. Severe hyperkalemia eventually causes fatal arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or asystole, leading to cardiac arrest. Severe hyperkalemia is a medical emergency and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality; it therefore requires hospitalization, ECG monitoring, and immediate treatment.

To promptly and effectively treat severe hyperkalemia, it is important to know the risk factors, the clinical manifestations, the therapeutic approaches, and the factors that predict both mortality and improvement in this disorder. Although most of these factors are well documented, reliable predictors of clinical outcomes such as in-hospital mortality have not been established. We therefore designed this study to identify common factors predisposing to severe hyperkalemia and to analyze the relationship between serum K + levels and clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, we attempted to determine the association between in-hospital mortality and multiple clinical factors in patients with severe hyperkalemia.

Hyperkalemia in CKD — practice points emphasize awareness of variability in potassium measurement and local formulary constraints, note no recommendations for timing to recheck potassium or for managing hyperkalemia, and provide dietary guidance. In CKD G3–G5 with emergent hyperkalemia, implement an individualized approach including dietary and pharmacologic interventions with assessment and education through a renal dietitian or an accredited nutrition provider. Provide advice to limit the intake of foods rich in bioavailable potassium (e.g., processed foods) for people with CKD G3–G5 who experience hyperkalemia or when it is an emerging issue and for individuals with kidney failure receiving dialysis when intakes of potassium are variable, and consider dietary and pharmacologic strategies during disease periods in which hyperkalemia risk may be a concern.

### Patiromer in patients with kidney disease and hyperkalemia receiving RAAS inhibitors [^115rvucP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia increases the risk of death and limits the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in high-risk patients. We assessed the safety and efficacy of patiromer, a nonabsorbed potassium binder, in a multicenter, prospective trial.

Methods

Patients with chronic kidney disease who were receiving RAAS inhibitors and who had serum potassium levels of 5.1 to less than 6.5 mmol per liter received patiromer (at an initial dose of 4.2 g or 8.4 g twice a day) for 4 weeks (initial treatment phase); the primary efficacy end point was the mean change in the serum potassium level from baseline to week 4. Eligible patients at the end of week 4 (those with a baseline potassium level of 5.5 to < 6.5 mmol per liter in whom the level decreased to 3.8 to < 5.1 mmol per liter) entered an 8-week randomized withdrawal phase in which they were randomly assigned to continue patiromer or switch to placebo; the primary efficacy end point was the between-group difference in the median change in the serum potassium level over the first 4 weeks of that phase.

Results

In the initial treatment phase, among 237 patients receiving patiromer who had at least one potassium measurement at a scheduled visit after day 3, the mean (± SE) change in the serum potassium level was -1.01 ± 0.03 mmol per liter (P < 0.001). At week 4, 76% (95% confidence interval, 70 to 81) of the patients had reached the target potassium level (3.8 to < 5.1 mmol per liter). Subsequently, 107 patients were randomly assigned to patiromer (55 patients) or placebo (52 patients) for the randomized withdrawal phase. The median increase in the potassium level from baseline of that phase was greater with placebo than with patiromer (P < 0.001); a recurrence of hyperkalemia (potassium level, ≥ 5.5 mmol per liter) occurred in 60% of the patients in the placebo group as compared with 15% in the patiromer group through week 8 (P < 0.001). Mild-to-moderate constipation was the most common adverse event (in 11% of the patients); hypokalemia occurred in 3%.

Conclusions

In patients with chronic kidney disease who were receiving RAAS inhibitors and who had hyperkalemia, patiromer treatment was associated with a decrease in serum potassium levels and, as compared with placebo, a reduction in the recurrence of hyperkalemia.

### Hyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis: should you treat? [^117QSbyY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe hyperkalemia is a common and life-threatening problem presenting to the emergency department. Rapid correction of the electrolyte abnormality is essential but doing so can be detrimental in circumstances under which delaying treatment for confirmation is required. Our case exemplifies one of those scenarios: pseudohyperkalemia in the setting of severe leukocytosis.

Case

An elderly woman with long-standing but untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with a left hip fracture. She was found to have a potassium level of 8.4 mEq/L without symptoms of hyperkalemia, renal disease, or EKG findings. Her white blood cell count was 444 K/uL. Despite a potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia, correction was deferred pending confirmation by venous whole blood, which revealed a normal potassium level.

Discussion

Pseudohyperkalemia can occur in the setting of severe leukocytosis. It is important for emergency physicians to recognize this phenomenon and avoid iatrogenic hypokalemia. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon and the methods for correct analysis are presented here.

### Management of hyperkalemia during treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor blockers: findings from esaxerenone [^113QmiQ7]. Hypertension Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Data for the time course of serum potassium levels during esaxerenone treatment are shown in Fig. 1. These study data indicate that increases in serum potassium levels occurred in the first 2 weeks after treatment initiation, without any additional increases at the time of esaxerenone dose escalation. There was no specific trend in the onset time of serum potassium elevation after 2 weeks of esaxerenone administration. Based on these data, the esaxerenone labeling recommendations suggest that potassium levels should be measured before treatment, at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment initiation (or during any up- or down-titration), and regularly thereafter. Similarly, studies of eplerenone in patients with heart failure demonstrated that elevated potassium levels were detectable within the first 1–4 weeks after treatment initiation, and a study of spironolactone in patients with CKD also indicated that serum potassium increased within the first 4 weeks of treatment.

Notably, preserved drug efficacy at higher potassium levels remained true even in the TOPCAT (Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist) trial, which studied the safety and efficacy of spironolactone versus placebo in HF with preserved EF. Once again, incident hypokalemia (using a potassium level of either < 3.5 or < 4.0 mmol/L as cutoff) and hyperkalemia (using a cutoff ≥ 5.5 or ≥ 6.0 mmol/L) were associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality. Although there was no effect of MRA use on the primary composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF in the whole study population, the reduction in cardiovascular mortality seen in subjects in the Americas randomized to spironolactone endured after accounting for postrandomization variations in serum potassium. 18

Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly. For treatment of hypokalemia, monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal. Monitor potassium levels monthly to biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis.

The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis requires careful attention to acid-base balance, volume status, electrolytes, including magnesium, sodium, chloride, phosphate, and calcium, electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient. Correct volume status, acid-base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate.

Administration

Dilute the contents of 1 pouch of potassium chloride for oral solution in at least 4 ounces of cold water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Take with meals or immediately after eating.

If serum potassium concentration is < 2.5 mEq/L, use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation.

2.2 Adult Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq. Give in 2 to 5 divided doses: limit doses to 40 mEq per dose. The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Typical dose is 20 mEq per day. Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels.

Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity. When alkalosis is present, normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit. The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain.

2.3 Pediatric Dosing

Treatment of hypokalemia:

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day in divided doses; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq/kg or 40 mEq, whichever is lower; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq. If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great, consider intravenous therapy.

Maintenance or Prophylaxis

Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old: Typical dose is 1 mEq/kg/day. Do not exceed 3 mEq/kg/day.

### An international Delphi consensus regarding best practice recommendations for hyperkalaemia across the cardiorenal spectrum [^1172XMC2]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyperkalaemia is a potentially life‐threatening medical condition of elevated blood potassium levels; 3.5–5.0 mEq/L is considered the normokalaemic range in adults, while instances of hyperkalaemia > 5.5 mEq/L are more clearly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. There is no universally accepted definition for hyperkalaemia severity. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend using a lower cut‐off for mild (> 5.0 mEq/L), moderate (> 5.5 mEq/L), or severe (> 6.0 mEq/L) hyperkalaemia, for closer monitoring of patients who may be at risk of hyperkalaemic complications. Other guidelines, such as those endorsed by the UK Renal Association (UKRA), utilise a more stringent outcome‐associated definition (mild: > 5.5 mEq/L, moderate: > 6.0 mEq/L, and severe: > 6.5 mEq/L). Most individuals with hyperkalaemia (particularly those with mild hyperkalaemia) are asymptomatic but when symptoms do occur, they tend to be non‐specific. Untreated, severe hyperkalaemia can result in life‐threatening cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, paralysis, and mortality.

Future Directions

We propose that if normokalemia with serum potassium ≥ 5.0 mEq/L can be achieved with diet and drug modifications, treatment with optimal and maximal RAASi dosing should be continued. Compelling modeling data from Evans and colleagues demonstrate that the treatment of hyperkalemia that allows for continued RAASi use leads to longer life expectancy, delayed progression to end‐stage renal disease, quality‐adjusted life year gains, and cost savings in CKD populations. 11

The available data do not yet provide conclusive evidence of the potential impact on maintaining normokalemia with potassium binders to allow for RAASi use. We need further clinical studies of patients with CHF and advanced CKD taking chronic RAASi in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability with long‐term use of potassium binders for the maintenance of normokalemia.

5.6	Hyperkalemia or Drugs that Increase Serum Potassium

Treatment with tolvaptan is associated with an acute reduction of the extracellular fluid volume which could result in increased serum potassium. Serum potassium levels should be monitored after initiation of tolvaptan treatment in patients with a serum potassium > 5 mEq/L as well as those who are receiving drugs known to increase serum potassium levels.

5.7 Acute Urinary Retention with Outflow Obstruction

Patients with partial obstruction of urinary outflow, for example, patients with prostatic hypertrophy or impairment of micturition, have an increased risk of developing acute retention. Do not administer tolvaptan in patients with uncorrected urinary outflow obstruction.

Monitoring

In the general patient population, potassium levels are often elevated. Approximately 6.8% of the Japanese population is estimated to have hyperkalemia (defined as at least two serum potassium readings ≥ 5.1 mEq/L) based on the results of a medical database analysis. Similarly, a Swedish study examining 364,955 patients who accessed healthcare over a 3-year period revealed a 7% incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as potassium > 5 mEq/L) with a 35.7% rate of recurrence.

Regular monitoring allows drug dosages to be adjusted based on serum potassium levels. A long-term potassium monitoring study in patients with heart failure suggested that maintenance of serum potassium levels within the normal range should be considered a therapeutic target, allowing clinicians to modify treatment and mitigate risks to improve clinical outcomes for patients. In patients with diabetes being treated with an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or spironolactone, compared with no monitoring, regular monitoring of serum potassium has been shown to decrease the risk of hyperkalemia-related adverse events (adjusted relative risk 0.5, 95% CI 0.37–0.66). According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, the suggested frequency of serum potassium monitoring after initiation of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is as follows: every 4–12 weeks for serum potassium ≤ 4.5 mEq/L, every 2–4 weeks for 4.6–5 mEq/L, and more frequently than every 2 weeks for > 5 mEq/L. The American Heart Association states that potassium levels and renal function should typically be checked on days 3 and 7 after initiating therapy with aldosterone antagonists and then at least monthly for the first 3 months. However, the frequency of serum potassium measurement is not described in the guidelines published by the Japanese Society of Nephrology or Japanese societies related to CVD.

To avoid the risk of false positive findings, serum potassium levels need to be measured carefully. Causes of false positives include hemolysis, delay in sample processing, long-term cold storage, and contamination of blood samples with antiseptics or potassium salts from blood collection tubes. Careful collection techniques and proper sample handling and storage are therefore essential.

Additional suggestions for clinicians intending to prescribe RAASis include pretreatment GFR and baseline serum potassium determination (to identify or exclude high-risk patients), dosage titration, and discontinuation of potassium supplements or concomitant maintenance treatment with loop or thiazide diuretics.

### Utilization of potassium binders for the management of hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease: a position statement by US nephrologists [^113fXfCY]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Two potassium (K +) binders-patiromer sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-are recommended by international guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. There is, however, no universally accepted best practice for how to appropriately utilize K + binders in the long-term clinical management of CKD. A panel of eight US-based nephrologists convened in October 2022 to develop a consensus statement regarding utilizing K + binders in clinical practice to help manage patients with nonemergent, persistent/recurrent hyperkalemia in CKD. Consensus was reached on the following topics: (1) identifying risk factors for hyperkalemia; (2) serum K + monitoring before and during K + binder use; (3) utilizing K + binders in patients receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and dialysis; and (4) when to initiate K + binders and their duration of use. These consensus statements for the use of K + binders may assist the nephrology community in optimizing management of hyperkalemia in patients across the spectrum of CKD.

### Novel bloodless potassium determination using a signal-processed single-lead ECG [^115QGZSX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood potassium levels are tightly regulated homeostatically and are critical for normal physiological cellular function. 1, 2 Fluctuations in potassium values are found in many disease states and can expose patients to life‐threatening arrhythmias. 3, 4, 5 Compelling evidence shows that in patients with renal or cardiac disease, even modest potassium changes may lead to morbidity, hospitalization, and death. 6 Moreover, evidence‐based therapies used to treat these conditions, including adrenergic blockade, potassium‐sparing diuretics, and renin–angiotensin antagonism, result in hyper‐ or hypokalemia. After the potassium‐sparing diuretic spironolactone was shown to lower heart failure mortality in a randomized prospective trial, hospitalization for hyperkalemia tripled and mortality doubled. 7 As the prevalence of these diseases and their risk factors (hypertension and diabetes) rise, and as the population continues to age, increasing numbers of patients will be at risk of hyper‐ and hypokalemia. 8, 9

### Acute treatment of hyperkalemia… [^117LTsys]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best acute treatment of an elevated serum potassium level. Evidence-Based Answer According to disease-oriented evidence, insulin and intravenous glucose, inhaled albuterol, and dialysis are the best treatment options; the first two may be given in combination. Bicarbonate or resins are not recommended for routine use, particularly without one of the more effective agents listed above. Practice Pointers Acute treatment of hyperkalemia falls into the still considerable "widely used but little studied" category of medical interventions. No study has reported outcomes that matter to patients, such as the likelihood of death or cardiac arrhythmias. The available literature focuses largely on the ability of interventions to lower serum potassium levels acutely. The Cochrane review by Mahoney and colleagues applies to patients with a significantly elevated potassium level.

Each patient acts as his or her own control, so it is possible to have a much smaller sample size and still obtain statistically significant results. Only four studies used blinding, and only four concealed allocation to treatment groups adequately. Most of the patients studied had acute or chronic renal failure and were receiving hemodialysis. Nebulized or inhaled albuterol proved effective; a dose of 20 mg was more effective than 10 mg in lowering potassium levels, and both doses were better than placebo. Intravenous albuterol and levalbuterol were no more effective than inhaled albuterol. The combination of insulin with intravenous glucose was effective, as was dialysis. In one study, the combination of insulin, glucose, and inhaled albuterol was more effective than insulin and glucose alone. Although potassium-binding polystyrene resins such as Kayexalate are widely used, only one study evaluated their effectiveness in the acute setting, and they proved ineffective.

Adding bicarbonate to insulin and glucose was helpful in one study but not in another. A review of the National Guideline Clearinghouse Website did not identify any practice guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia. Recommendations from textbooks vary considerably. For example, Griffith's 5-Minute Clinical Consult 2005 1 recommends dextrose and insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and polystyrene resins but does not mention inhaled beta agonists.

2–4 When hypokalemia is suspected, administer 1 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate in an intravenous bolus to decrease the risk of torsades de pointes because it is quicker than intravenous potassium and is analogous to administering calcium gluconate in the setting of hyperkalemia. For hyperkalemia, use 5 units of intravenous insulin because this is equally effective as 10 units, with a lower hypoglycemia risk. 5 For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and without metabolic acidosis, use lactated ringers instead of normal saline to avoid further transcellular shifts from hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis, consider the addition of isotonic bicarbonate solution. When contemplating between diuresis or dialysis for hyperkalemia, consider the "nephron bomb, " which includes: ○ Loop diuretic, ○ Thiazide diuretic. ○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6. The literature on emergent management of hypokalemia is limited. During our review, we found no recommendations for an analogous hyperkalemia management technique to stabilize the cardiac membrane. Rather, electrolytes are aggressively corrected, and magnesium sulfate is administered as part of the comprehensive treatment of torsades de pointes, but not prevention.

2, 3 In treating hyperkalemia, 5 units of intravenous insulin are as effective as 10 units with a lower risk of hypoglycemia, but only for patients with renal insufficiency; this recommendation may not be generalizable to all patients with hyperkalemia. The most recent reviews support 10 units of intravenous insulin with 50 mL of dextrose. Although the described strategy of maximum dosing of three diuretics and fludrocortisone is aligned with the importance of kaliuresis in emergent hyperkalemia, the supporting article does not provide references for the specific recommendations. Fludrocortisone should be used with caution in patients with heart failure and is associated with significant long-term effects.
