## Question

What protocol should be followed for a vitamin D level of 23?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what protocol to follow for a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 23 ng/mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret 23 ng/mL within current guideline frameworks. Then, I should verify assay reliability and whether repeat testing is needed. Next, I will consider risk factors that alter dosing needs. After that, I will select an initial repletion regimen, define monitoring, and plan maintenance therapy. Finally, I need to integrate special populations, updated guideline shifts, and safety considerations, and close with a concise, practical bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the interpretation of 23 ng/mL. By the 2011 Endocrine Society (ES) guideline, 21–29 ng/mL is vitamin D insufficiency and < 20 ng/mL is deficiency, so 23 ng/mL would be classified as insufficiency, with many bone-focused guidelines historically targeting > 30 ng/mL, especially in at-risk populations [^115TEChd] [^111oBqLc]. Wait, I should verify whether those thresholds remain endorsed, because the ES 2024 "epistemic humility" communication no longer supports fixed sufficiency/insufficiency cut points like ≥ 30 ng/mL, emphasizing uncertainty in outcome-linked thresholds, although many expert groups still pragmatically work in the 20–30 ng/mL range for skeletal health decisions [^1113S3oR] [^114xwr92]. I need to ensure the measurement is accurate; if the result is unexpected or will change management, I should recheck 25(OH)D using a reliable, standardized assay given known inter-assay variability and standardization challenges [^1123HSa4] [^113Vi78J] [^114xwr92].

> Next, I should review risk factors that would push me toward higher doses because they increase vitamin D requirement. Let me consider obesity, malabsorption syndromes, and medications that induce vitamin D catabolism; ES 2011 suggests adults with obesity or on anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, antifungals, or antiretrovirals often need roughly 2–3 times more vitamin D to achieve comparable 25(OH)D levels [^111TsKkR] [^115rP1Fz]. Hold on, I should verify the dosing-weight signal; contemporary expert consensus also highlights BMI and body weight as major modifiers of dose–response and supports higher weight-adjusted dosing for individuals with obesity due to lower achieved levels on standard doses [^112JLweK].

> I will now examine initial repletion for an adult without high-dose–requiring risk factors and a level of 23 ng/mL. Given this is insufficiency rather than overt deficiency, a pragmatic approach is daily cholecalciferol 1,500–2,000 IU with the option to use 2,000–4,000 IU/day for 8–12 weeks, aiming to move into a generally acceptable range for bone health while acknowledging threshold uncertainty; I should not exceed 4,000 IU/day without supervision per ES guidance, and I can use D2 or D3, though D3 may show greater potency in some regimens [^114Hfpqn] [^113cP2er] [^111cYEcX] [^112565fW]. Wait, let me verify the D2 vs D3 nuance; randomized data suggest intermittent D3 regimens can outperform D2 counterparts for raising total 25(OH)D, though daily D2 sometimes outperforms daily D3, so consistency and adherence are key whichever form is used [^112565fW] [^114hqviD].

> For adults with higher requirements due to obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications, I should confirm that higher-dose repletion is indicated. ES 2011 recommends 6,000 IU/day or 50,000 IU weekly for about 8 weeks to achieve > 30 ng/mL, followed by maintenance escalation above standard doses as needed; this "2–3× higher" approach in high-need states helps overcome adipose sequestration and/or reduced absorption [^113cP2er] [^115rP1Fz] [^111TsKkR]. Let me reconsider duration; most protocols use 8 weeks, then reassess response and down-titrate to a maintenance plan based on the new level and ongoing risk factors [^116Tw7ci].

> I should double-check monitoring timing and labs. Rechecking 25(OH)D after 8–12 weeks of repletion is appropriate to document response, with concurrent serum calcium monitoring to detect hypercalcemia, especially with higher-dose regimens or in conditions with extrarenal calcitriol production that predispose to hypercalcemia [^116Tw7ci] [^113YzgpM]. Hold on, I should verify the need for routine serial testing; for low-risk patients on maintenance doses up to about 2,000 IU/day, routine repeat 25(OH)D checks are generally unnecessary, but targeted retesting is sensible if poor adherence is suspected, symptoms evolve, or risk factors change [^113cP2er].

> Once target range is achieved, I need to ensure an appropriate maintenance dose. Standard maintenance is 1,500–2,000 IU/day of cholecalciferol, with higher maintenance needs of 3,000–6,000 IU/day in persistent high-requirement states such as obesity or malabsorption, acknowledging that optimal maintenance should be individualized and that intermittent monthly options, such as 50,000 IU every 2–4 weeks, can be effective alternatives if adherence favors less frequent dosing [^116Tw7ci] [^115rP1Fz] [^112565fW]. Let me verify safety of intermittent dosing; monthly D3 strategies have been shown to safely raise levels, though extremely high bolus dosing has been associated with more falls in some contexts, so moderation in bolus size and interval is prudent [^112UvMeq] [^117Va2Uq].

> I need to check special populations and screening choices. In pregnancy, ensure at least 600 IU/day, with many requiring 1,500–2,000 IU/day to maintain levels, and ES 2024 supports considering empiric supplementation for potential maternal–fetal benefits while data evolve [^1149M8tu] [^117GUmKc]. In children, typical deficiency regimens use 2,000 IU/day or 50,000 IU weekly for 6 weeks, then 600–1,000 IU/day maintenance, with dose reductions for lesser insufficiency and adjustments for obesity or interacting medications per ES pediatric guidance [^111X74a6] [^111dG7rW]. Next, I should review screening; routine screening of asymptomatic adults is not supported by USPSTF, and ES 2024 also advises against routine screening in adults with obesity absent specific indications, so once a low level is identified, treat, but avoid population screening without clear clinical reason [^112a2CfF] [^112vxbMP].

> But wait, what about safety, upper limits, and when to avoid pharmacologic vitamin D forms. I should confirm that for insufficiency and deficiency, we use nutritional D2/D3 rather than active vitamin D analogs unless there is a specific indication like hypoparathyroidism or advanced CKD, because active forms carry higher hypercalcemia risk and have different monitoring requirements [^112rZ77J] [^11475KCH]. I need to ensure we respect tolerable upper limits; in general adults should not exceed 4,000 IU/day without supervision, recognizing that higher temporary doses may be required for repletion under medical oversight, and that toxicity is rare but serious, often from overdosing or mislabeled products, underscoring the importance of licensed, quality-controlled supplements and calcium surveillance during high-dose therapy [^111cYEcX] [^114jjzc7] [^116Tw7ci].

> For long-term reassessment, I should verify that routine repeat 25(OH)D testing is not needed for stable, low-risk patients on modest maintenance, but I will retest if risk factors change, new medications are added, or symptoms suggest relapse; in patients on potent antiresorptives or with specific bone health indications, ensuring adequate vitamin D status remains part of best practice alongside individualized intake planning [^113cP2er] [^1125PW8f] [^116c6rbJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, given ES 2024 de-emphasizes rigid thresholds, I should frame the goal as achieving and maintaining a level consistent with bone health objectives and patient context rather than a single universal cut point, while acknowledging many clinicians still pragmatically aim for at least the low 20s to 30 ng/mL range in bone-focused care [^1113S3oR] [^114xwr92].

> Bottom line: For an adult with 25(OH)D of 23 ng/mL and no high-dose–requiring risk factors, start cholecalciferol about 2,000 IU/day (up to 4,000 IU/day if needed) for 8–12 weeks, recheck 25(OH)D and calcium, then maintain 1,500–2,000 IU/day long term, increasing doses or using weekly/monthly regimens if obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications are present; anchor decisions to patient-specific bone health goals while recognizing evolving guidance on "optimal" thresholds and limiting routine testing in low-risk maintenance settings [^111cYEcX] [^116Tw7ci] [^115rP1Fz] [^113cP2er] [^1113S3oR].

A vitamin D level of 23 ng/mL indicates **insufficiency** [^115TEChd] and should be managed with **1,500–2,000 IU/day** of vitamin D3 [^114Hfpqn], along with 1,000–1,200 mg/day of calcium from diet or supplements. Recheck 25(OH)D in **3 months** [^113cP2er] and adjust the dose to maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL [^114Hfpqn]; use higher doses (3,000–6,000 IU/day) [^115rP1Fz] in the presence of obesity, malabsorption [^115rP1Fz], or interacting medications [^111TsKkR]. Monitor calcium and renal function during high-dose or long-term therapy, and **avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without supervision** [^111cYEcX].

## Clinical significance of vitamin D insufficiency

Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures [^111oBqLc], and musculoskeletal symptoms [^114Lxtxc]; correcting insufficiency **improves bone health** [^113UqxEs] and reduces fracture risk [^111J52a5].

---

## Recommended supplementation protocol

### General adult population

For the general adult population, **daily supplementation** with 1,500–2,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) [^114Hfpqn] is recommended to achieve and maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL [^111oBqLc]. **Calcium intake** of 1,000–1,200 mg/day from diet or supplements supports bone health and calcium homeostasis.

---

### Special populations requiring higher doses

Certain populations require **higher doses** due to reduced absorption or increased metabolism.

| **Population** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) | 3,000–6,000 IU/day [^115rP1Fz] [^112JLweK] |
| Malabsorption syndromes (e.g. celiac, IBD, bariatric surgery) | 3,000–6,000 IU/day [^115rP1Fz] [^116p1oAq] |
| Medications affecting vitamin D metabolism (e.g. anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids) | 3,000–6,000 IU/day [^111TsKkR] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Re-evaluation**: Check serum 25(OH)D after 3 months of supplementation to assess response and adherence [^113cP2er].
- **Maintenance**: Once ≥ 30 ng/mL is achieved, continue 1,500–2,000 IU/day [^114Hfpqn] and recheck every 6–12 months.
- **Safety monitoring**: Monitor serum calcium and renal function if high-dose or long-term therapy is used [^113YzgpM].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

Vitamin D supplementation is generally safe; however, **excessive intake can cause hypercalcemia**, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment [^114jjzc7]; avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without medical supervision [^111cYEcX].

---

## Clinical outcomes of correcting vitamin D insufficiency

Correcting insufficiency improves bone mineral density [^111oBqLc], **reduces fracture risk** [^111J52a5], and may lower fall risk, especially in older adults and those with osteoporosis [^113UqxEs].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Supplementation | 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 [^114Hfpqn] |
| Calcium intake | 1,000–1,200 mg/day [^111oBqLc] |
| Monitoring | - Recheck 25(OH)D in 3 months [^113cP2er] <br/> - Maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL [^114Hfpqn] |
| Special populations | Higher doses (3,000–6,000 IU/day) for obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications [^115rP1Fz] |
| Safety | - Avoid > 4,000 IU/day without supervision [^111cYEcX] <br/> - Monitor calcium and renal function |

---

A vitamin D level of 23 ng/mL indicates insufficiency; **treat with 1,500–2,000 IU/day** of vitamin D3, ensure adequate calcium, recheck in 3 months, and adjust to maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL. Use higher doses for obesity, malabsorption, or interacting medications, and monitor for hypercalcemia and renal effects.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, particularly concerning vitamin D requirements, the ES 2011 guidelines recommend advising an intake of at least 600 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 19–50 years to maximize bone health and muscle function. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether 600 IU/day is adequate to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. It is recognized that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to consistently raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to above 30 ng/mL.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^115WpQzu]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

The interpretation of the results of this study may be limited by factors such as its sample size, a 15% follow-up loss, and lower compliance with daily regimens compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens. Additionally, capsule content is lower than label claims, and capsule formulation is based on the weight equipotency of D2 and D3. The rate of follow-up loss was similar across the groups, and the characteristics of participants who completed the study were similar to those of the entire cohort. The incompliance rate was 1 to 1.6% in the daily groups, and the discrepancy between capsule content and label claim was similar across the capsules; thus, these factors would not be expected to affect the main findings of the study.

Although the incompliance rate was low, it was measured by capsule count, which may not be reliable. Thus, the lower dose–response observed with daily D3 treatment compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 treatments could be explained at least in part by incompliance. However, such an explanation is not likely given our observation that the dose–response was higher with daily D2 treatment compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2 treatments and the fact that assignment to daily D2 or D3 treatment was random and blinded.

The lower capsule content implies that the observed increments in D and 25(OH)D levels may have been up to 10% higher. Furthermore, the fact that the molecular weight of D2 is about 3% higher compared to D3 indicates that our study may have underestimated the response to D2 treatment. Nevertheless, such a difference would not be expected to change the conclusions of the study.

### Calcitriol [^1165vUWT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The recommended initial dosage of calcitriol for hypoparathyroidism is 0.25 mcg/day given in the morning. If a satisfactory response in the biochemical parameters and clinical manifestations of the disease is not observed, the dose may be increased at 2- to 4-week intervals. During the dosage titration period, serum calcium levels should be obtained at least twice weekly. If hypercalcemia is noted, calcitriol should be immediately discontinued until normocalcemia ensues. Careful consideration should also be given to lowering dietary calcium intake. Serum calcium, phosphorus, and 24-hour urinary calcium should be determined periodically.

Most adult patients and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older have responded to dosages ranging from 0.5 mcg to 2 mcg daily. Pediatric patients in the 1 to 5-year age group with hypoparathyroidism have usually been given 0.25 mcg to 0.75 mcg daily. The number of treated patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism younger than 6 years of age is too small to make dosage recommendations.

Malabsorption is occasionally noted in patients with hypoparathyroidism; hence, larger doses of calcitriol may be needed.

For predialysis patients, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 0.25 mcg/day in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older. This dosage may be increased if necessary to 0.5 mcg/day.

For pediatric patients less than 3 years of age, the recommended initial dosage of calcitriol is 10 to 15 ng/kg/day.

### From vitamin D to hormone D: Fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system essential for good health [^111Mq8q3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

New knowledge of the biological and clinical importance of the steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and its receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has resulted in significant contributions to good bone health. However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases. Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health.

Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D(3), as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least nine-fold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid). Research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) initiates the physiologic responses of 36 or more cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in 10 or more extrarenal organs.

This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, highlighting its potential contributions to good health in five physiological arenas where investigators have documented new biological actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D(3) intake, as defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations, should be reevaluated.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^114hqviD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable due to its worldwide deficiency. Controversy continues regarding the relative potency of ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3), as well as the role of dosing schedule and sex in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) levels, which is the best indicator of D status.

- **Methods**: We randomized 279 adults to receive daily doses of D2, D3, a combination of D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly doses of D2 or D3; or 4-weekly doses of D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over 140 days). The randomization sequence was stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex. This sequence was concealed from study coordinators and participants, who were then blinded to the content of the capsules. Serum levels of D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 were determined blindly on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, and every 2 weeks thereafter using high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Data from 269 participants were available for analysis. The primary endpoint was the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

- **Results**: The mean (SD) age of participants was 33.0 (8.5) years, 41% were male, and 85% completed follow-up. The baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L, which increased by 3.3 (11.6) nmol/L in the placebo group and by 28.6 (16.3) nmol/L in the active-treatment groups. The AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher in the active-treatment groups compared to placebo (p < 0.001). The 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in the daily group than in the 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. The 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in the daily group compared to the 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In the D2-treated groups, there was a 16.4 nmol/L increase.

### Paricalcitol versus cinacalcet plus low-dose vitamin D for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving haemodialysis: Study design and baseline characteristics of the IMPACT SHPT study [^113RQm12]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). High credibility.

For each study site, the protocol was approved by an Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee. The study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki. All study participants provided written informed consent before undergoing any study-related procedures.

Enrolment has been completed. After an initial screening period, eligible participants underwent a 4-week washout period during which they discontinued prior VDR activator and cinacalcet therapy and were subsequently re-evaluated for eligibility. A stratified randomization scheme was used. Random assignment at a ratio of 1:1 to paricalcitol or cinacalcet occurred within each of two strata defined by the mode of paricalcitol administration (oral or intravenous). The randomization schedule was generated by the Clinical Statistics Department at Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL) before the start of the study. Treatment group assignment occurred at the Day 1 visit and was implemented through an interactive voice response system.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for an extended period, regardless of whether the dosage is administered daily or intermittently (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly). This is due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination, attributed to prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day.

Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in cases of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D levels below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These patients include institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, those in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals using certain concomitant medications (e.g. anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (e.g. denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Calcifediol is superior to cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D status in postmenopausal women: a randomized trial [^111JdkGm]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). High credibility.

There is a strong consensus that 25(OH)D levels below 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml) reflect severe vitamin D deficiency. However, there is no consensus regarding the threshold necessary to achieve optimal levels. Some societies recommend 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml), while others suggest 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml).

There are several options for treating vitamin D deficiency: cholecalciferol (D3), ergocalciferol (D2), or calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol). Despite its benefits, few supplementation guidelines include calcifediol, as it is not widely available globally.

Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels in individuals supplemented with vitamin D is generally not necessary in the general population according to guidelines. However, it is advised for high-risk subgroups and specific conditions. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is one such condition, as it requires that antiresorptive and anabolic treatments be accompanied by vitamin D and calcium supplements. The standard recommended dosage of vitamin D for this population is 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).

In Spain, calcifediol has been available as a prescription drug and has been widely used for over 40 years. The efficacy of calcifediol oral solution has been demonstrated in various population groups and studies. These small-scale trials indicate that calcifediol is more potent and faster-acting than cholecalciferol in raising 25(OH)D levels.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of calcifediol in the correction and maintenance of 25(OH)D levels in postmenopausal women.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113YzgpM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vitamin D deficiency, particularly in relation to vitamin D level monitoring, the Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend considering serial monitoring of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and calcium levels during treatment with vitamin D. This is to prevent hypercalcemia in patients with extrarenal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

### Study protocol: a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus SUNNY trial [^114fke7F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

The main purpose of this study is to measure the effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control and health-related quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is widespread interest in the potential causal role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and progression of T2DM. We hope this study will provide new insights into this causality. Until now, conflicting results are seen in observational studies and the few clinical trials performed, which could not confirm a causal association. Factors contributing to the lack of effect found in these studies include short trial duration, relatively low doses of vitamin D supplementation, whether or not combined with calcium supplements, and heterogeneous study populations.

This trial has several strengths. The study sample size allows us to perform a subgroup analysis of vitamin D deficient patients. Considering that only in vitamin D deficient patients will an effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycaemic control be observed, we chose to recruit double the number of participants as calculated with the power estimation, hypothesizing that 50% of the included patients will be vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH) D < 50 nmol/l). Additionally, the relatively high dose chosen for intervention and the duration of the trial are strengths of our study. The dose of vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU per month, daily equivalent ~1667 IU) is based on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine and on the study conducted by van Groningen et al. In this latter study, conducted in the Netherlands, it was demonstrated that…

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

At the time of writing, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D₃ and 25(OH)D₂, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status. Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

- **Figure 2 overview**: The figure shows the metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient statuses, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results.

### Vitamin D insufficiency and epistemic humility: An Endocrine Society guideline communication [^1113S3oR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

A long-held precept is that vitamin D supplementation primarily, if not exclusively, benefits individuals with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at baseline. However, the most appropriate 25(OH)D threshold to distinguish unacceptably low vs reliably adequate concentrations remains controversial. Such threshold proposals have largely been based on observational studies, which provide less robust evidence compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

Since the Endocrine Society's first vitamin D-related guideline was published in 2011, several large vitamin D-related RCTs have been published, and a newly commissioned guideline development panel (GDP) prioritized four clinical questions related to the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in generally healthy individuals with 25(OH)D levels below a threshold. The GDP determined that available clinical trial evidence does not permit the establishment of 25(OH)D thresholds that specifically predict meaningful benefit with vitamin D supplementation. The panel noted important limitations in the available evidence, and the panel's overall certainty in the available evidence was very low.

Nonetheless, based on the GDP's analyses and judgments, the Endocrine Society no longer endorses its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "sufficiency" (i.e. at least 30 ng/mL [75 nmol/L]) or its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "insufficiency" (i.e.g.reater than 20 ng/mL [50 nmol/L] but lower than 30 ng/mL [75 nmol/L]). The Endocrine Society's rationale for such is the subject of this guideline communication.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, vitamin D toxicity (VDT) is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level less than 20 ng/mL. Populations living at higher latitudes (above 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.

### Correction of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients - VITdAL@ICU study protocol of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial [^117TzyaK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). High credibility.

For the general population, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a daily allowance for adults of 600 to 800 IU, while the Endocrine Society Guideline recommends 1,500–2,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day for the at-risk population. Upper daily limits for adults are 4,000 (IOM)–10,000 (Endocrine Society) IU per day. Guidelines for parenteral nutrition recommend 200 IU per day, and typical enteral nutrition formulas contain 200–300 IU of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol per 1000 ml. Available over-the-counter multivitamin preparations commonly contain 200 IU of vitamin D2 or D3. Currently, there is no intravenous vitamin D-monopreparation available, although high-dose intramuscular preparations may be an option for selected patients.

In summary, vitamin D plays a pivotal role in calcium homeostasis and is, based on knowledge, associated with disease severity and mortality in critically ill patients. Moreover, vitamin D exhibits a number of pleiotropic effects that are of special interest to the ICU patient. However, it is unclear whether a low vitamin D status is causally linked to adverse outcomes or merely an epiphenomenon reflecting poor health status. In contrast to previous clinical trials that failed to show a benefit for correcting hormonal insufficiencies in critical illness (e.g. administration of growth hormone or steroids), one must bear in mind that vitamin D not only acts on an endocrine level but also an autocrine level. This allows for tissue-specific control of 1,25(OH)2D regulation and action.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, the OC 2023 guidelines recommend advising daily supplementation of a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU in adults aged over 50 years. This is in addition to consuming vitamin D-rich foods to achieve the recommended dietary allowance, which is 600 IU per day for individuals aged 51–70 years and 800 IU per day for individuals aged over 70 years, given that it is difficult to achieve this level of intake since few foods contain vitamin D.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays has limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data, which still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a discussion regarding the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation, derived from an international expert panel focusing on controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation, is needed. This discussion aims to aid the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future studies with more rigorous methodologies, better exploring any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and providing reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency, with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

The Task Force was composed of a chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and email communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations. It was posted on The Endocrine Society website for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated necessary changes.

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular purposes.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency include symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes.

To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^1147pFqd]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency has been extensively related to the occurrence of skeletal disorders, such as rickets and osteomalacia. It can also be negatively implicated in osteopenia and osteoporosis, which must be mandatorily managed with vitamin D supplements. More recently, the interest in the putative extraskeletal effects of vitamin D has resulted in several clinical trials addressing vitamin D's influence on cancer and cardiovascular (CV) risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality.

The null results of some of these RCTs — especially the megatrials — hampered the enthusiasm around these topics. However, these trials were progressively revised, and their null results were mainly related to the enrollment of vitamin D–replete adults, in whom benefits would be unlikely, and the inhomogeneous methodologies in vitamin D supplementation with different forms, metabolites, and doses. Indeed, subsequent secondary analyses have progressively shown that vitamin D might be useful in reducing cancer incidence and mortality in the long term, in reducing autoimmune diseases and CV events (in particular central arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation) occurrence, and in the development of diabetes from prediabetes forms.

Nonetheless, these RCTs and the following meta-analyses were not powerful enough to evaluate these crucial subgroups, and further studies with better methodological conduct are warranted. Regarding the different forms and metabolites used for vitamin D supplementation, oral administration is the preferred route, and parenteral administration.

### A systematic review supporting the Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines on vitamin D [^117Va2Uq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Low vitamin D status is common and is associated with various common medical conditions. This review's objective is to support the development of the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline on vitamin D for the prevention of disease.

To achieve this, we searched multiple databases for studies addressing 14 clinical questions prioritized by the guideline panel. Among these, 10 questions evaluated the effect of vitamin D versus no vitamin D in the general population throughout different life stages, including pregnancy and adults with prediabetes. One question assessed dosing, and three questions focused on screening with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Electronic searches resulted in 37,007 citations, from which we included 151 studies. In children and adolescents, low-certainty evidence suggested a reduction in respiratory tract infections with empiric vitamin D. There was no significant effect on select outcomes in healthy adults aged 19 to 74 years, with varying certainty of evidence. However, there was a very small reduction in mortality among adults older than 75 years, supported by high-certainty evidence. In pregnant women, low-certainty evidence suggested possible benefits on various maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. In adults with prediabetes, moderate-certainty evidence indicated a reduction in the rate of progression to diabetes. Administration of high-dose intermittent vitamin D may increase falls compared to lower-dose daily dosing.

### Vitamin D supplementation and bone health in adults with diabetic nephropathy: The protocol for a randomized controlled trial [^111baPVm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). High credibility.

Vitamin D is a nutrient of concern for individuals with diabetes and nephropathy, particularly for those living in northern climates with limited sunlight exposure. Dietary restriction of vitamin D-rich food sources (e.g. dairy products) is a common issue due to concerns around phosphorus, potassium, and carbohydrate content. Avoidance of sunlight is also common due to instructions for concomitant medications. Vitamin D supplementation is required in this population, yet the most effective dose and most efficient dosing strategy remain unknown. Low adherence rates to routine vitamin D supplementation is an inherent challenge; therefore, developing alternative approaches, such as alterations in dosing frequency (monthly versus daily), is an important consideration.

Previous studies have been limited by small sample size, short intervention duration, or retrospective design. This study prospectively investigates the impact of two different oral vitamin D3 supplementation dosing strategies (2,000 IU/d vs. 40,000 IU/m) for 6 months on markers of vitamin D status and bone health in a large group of adults with diabetes and nephropathy.

Measurement of markers for dynamic expression of bone turnover enables evaluation of changes over time versus assessment of static changes in bone physiology via DXA, which is an added strength. Markers of collagenous bone resorption (e.g. serum NTx), bone formation (e.g. serum BAP and OC), and the bone-kidney axis/mineral homeostasis (e.g. plasma FGF-23) will allow for exploration of dynamic bone remodeling.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^113UqxEs]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and meta-analyses published at the time of writing do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries.

Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline, in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D-deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academy of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (i.e. rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio may differ.

### Update in women's health for the general internist [^115w1t3Y]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D and fractures: Prevention of nonvertebral fractures with oral vitamin D and dose dependency

- **What was known**: Vitamin D deficiency is common in older adults, homebound individuals, and women admitted with hip fracture. The association between vitamin D levels and fracture risk has been inconsistent, although a recent well-done case-control study showed that women with lower serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels had a higher fracture risk than women with higher levels, and there was a dose-response effect. Although women are frequently treated for vitamin D deficiency, it has not been known whether vitamin D supplementation prevents non-vertebral and hip fractures.

- **What this study adds**: This well-done meta-analysis included twelve studies that evaluated vitamin D supplementation and reported at least one fracture. Studies had to be double-blind with at least one year of follow-up and data on adherence. Participants took either cholecalciferol (D3) or ergocalciferol (D2). Vitamin D doses > 400 IU per day reduced nonvertebral and hip fractures, but lower doses did not. The overall reduction was relatively small (RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.96) for nonvertebral fractures. The addition of calcium did not enhance the effect of vitamin D. In addition, the anti-fracture efficacy was higher with higher achieved 25-OH vitamin D levels.

- **How should I change my practice**: Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation have typically targeted the goal of achieving a particular 25-OH-vitamin D level, rather than a clinical outcome.

### Measuring 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a clinical environment: challenges and needs [^113Vi78J]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

The number of assessments of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] for diagnostic purposes has increased significantly during the past 5 years. Over the years, techniques for quantifying 25(OH)D have increased and evolved. Some changes have been for the better and some have not. Most methods appear to provide valid results as long as the operator of the given technique is properly trained and motivated. In addition, any laboratory that assesses circulating 25(OH)D for clinical diagnosis needs to participate in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme. Finally, research has shown that circulating 25(OH)D is extremely stable in stored serum or plasma samples; this characteristic makes accurate, long-term epidemiologic studies of circulating 25(OH)D possible. In this article, I provide an overview of the techniques available for measuring 25(OH)D, compare these techniques with one another, and assess their clinical utility. I also briefly discuss the stability of 25(OH)D in biological media and present an overview of the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme.

### Controversies in vitamin D: Summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that, along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed:

- **Vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D**: Discussion of the current methodologies and criteria used for determining vitamin D deficiency.

- **Skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D**: Exploration of vitamin D's effects beyond its traditional role in bone health.

- **Therapeutics of vitamin D**: Analyzing the potential treatments and interventions involving vitamin D supplementation.

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference. Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics — which this report summarizes — much more work remains to be done so that our understanding can be further enriched.

### Vitamin D supplementation: Guidelines and evidence for subclinical deficiency [^116p1oAq]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

To summarize recommendations from the 2011 US Institute of Medicine report on vitamin D and the new guideline from the US Endocrine Society, emphasis is placed on treating and preventing vitamin D deficiency, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and those who have undergone prior gastric bypass.

The US Institute of Medicine recommends a dietary allowance of vitamin D at 400 IU per day for children younger than 1 year, 600 IU per day for children 1 year of age and older, and adults up to 70 years, and 800 IU per day for older adults. It concluded that a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level of 20 ng/ml or more will meet the requirements of 97.5% of the population.

In contrast, the US Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline suggests that 400–1000 IU per day may be needed for children less than 1 year, 600–1000 IU per day for children 1 year of age and older, and 1500–2000 IU per day for adults aged 19 years or more to maintain 25(OH)D levels above the optimal 30 ng/ml. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, even in a quiescent state, and those with gastric bypass may experience malabsorption of vitamin D, necessitating higher vitamin D intake to sustain their levels.

The differences in recommendations between the US Institute of Medicine and the US Endocrine Society's Practice Guideline reflect varying goals and views on evidence. Significant gaps remain in the literature, and further studies are needed to assess the impact of vitamin D treatment on outcomes at different 25(OH)D levels.

### Treatment with 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ every other week and effect on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂, 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃, and total 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a clinical setting [^115J9jnE]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

To examine the effect of 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ supplementation in a clinical setting on serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂ (25[OH]D₂), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (25[OH]D₃), a retrospective cohort study was performed in an urban tertiary referral hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Patients who had been prescribed 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ repletion and maintenance programs were identified through a search of our electronic medical record. Baseline and follow-up total serum 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D₂, and 25(OH)D₃ levels were compared.

We examined the medical records of 48 patients who had been prescribed 50,000 IU vitamin D₂ in our clinic. The mean ± standard deviation baseline total 25(OH)D was 31.0 ± 10.6 ng/mL and rose to 48.3 ± 13.4 ng/mL after treatment (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D₂ increased from 4.2 ± 4.3 ng/mL to 34.6 ± 12.3 ng/mL after treatment (p < 0.001), for an average of 158 days (range, 35–735 days). Serum 25(OH)D₃ decreased from 26.8 ± 10.8 ng/mL to 13.7 ± 7.9 ng/mL (p < 0.001).

Fifty thousand IU vitamin D₂ repletion and maintenance therapy substantially increases total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D₂ despite a decrease in serum 25(OH)D₃. This treatment program is an appropriate and effective strategy to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency.

### Calcitriol [^112rZ77J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Calcitriol injection is intended for intravenous use only. The optimal dose must be carefully determined for each patient, as the effectiveness of calcitriol injection therapy is predicated on adequate and appropriate daily calcium intake. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calcium in adults is 800 mg. Physicians should prescribe a calcium supplement or instruct patients on proper dietary measures to ensure adequate calcium intake.

The recommended initial dose of calcitriol injection varies depending on the severity of hypocalcemia and/or secondary hyperparathyroidism. It ranges from 1 mcg (0.02 mcg/kg) to 2 mcg, administered intravenously three times weekly, approximately every other day. Initial doses can range from 0.5 mcg to 4 mcg, three times weekly. If a satisfactory response is not observed, the dose may be increased by 0.5 to 1 mcg at intervals of two to four weeks. During this titration period, it is crucial to monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels at least twice weekly.

If hypercalcemia or a serum calcium times phosphate product greater than 70 is observed, the drug should be immediately discontinued until these parameters normalize. The calcitriol injection can then be reinitiated at a lower dose. Doses may need to be reduced as parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels decrease in response to therapy. Incremental dosing must be individualized and take into account PTH, serum calcium, and phosphorus levels.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^112JLweK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Generally, there is a lack of consensus about the recommended vitamin D supplementation regimen, including doses, administration schedule, and treatment duration. Such heterogeneity can be explained, at least partly, by the scarcity of comparative pharmacokinetics studies for different dosing schedules. Moreover, different underlying conditions, such as obesity, might reduce the effect of vitamin D supplementation. Growing evidence suggests that the treatment schedule itself, whether bolus or frequent administration, may affect the effectiveness of the treatment and clinical outcomes differently, with recent studies and a few meta-analyses showing more promising results with frequent administration schedules on skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes.

In this perspective, vitamin D supplementation guidelines should be specific to age group, body weight, ethnicity (skin type), and latitude of residence. For example, differences in serum 25(OH)D by BMI and absolute body weight have been reported. Vitamin D dose per kilogram of body weight per day could explain a 34.5% variation in circulating 25(OH)D in multivariable regression analyses of data pooled from several studies, leading to pronounced differences across BMI categories. Obese and overweight individuals tend to have serum 25(OH)D levels that are, on average, around 20 nmol/L lower and 8 nmol/L lower than those of normal-weight individuals, requiring 2.6 and 1.47 times higher supplementation, respectively. This is somewhat consistent with ES guidelines suggesting that the vitamin D dosage for obese people is "three times" greater.

- **Primary outcome variables**: Serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are primary outcome variables. Serum 25(OH)D is considered the most reliable measure of vitamin D status as it accounts for cutaneous and dietary sources of vitamin D. A mean increase in serum 25(OH)D of 25–50 nmol/L was chosen as a conservative target because 1,000 IU/d has been shown to increase serum 25(OH)D by 25 nmol/L in renal patients. 1,25(OH)2D was measured to determine the concentration of active vitamin D in participants and to explore the relationship of active vitamin D with 25(OH)D levels and bone health. Vitamin D levels were measured by validated, specific, and sensitive methodologies used by the provincial laboratory system. The ratio of 1,25(OH)2D (product) to 25(OH)D (precursor) was calculated as a surrogate measure of 1α-hydroxylase activity (product to precursor ratio).

- **Bone health**: Bone health was assessed by measurement of BMD and plasma/serum levels of bone turnover.

### Correlation of serum vitamin D levels with serum interleukin-23 levels in patients of ulcerative colitis [^115gULZB]. Human immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition resulting from an abnormal immune response to gut microbiota, leading to cytokine dysregulation, including elevated interleukin-23 (IL-23) levels. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D (VD) plays a crucial role in immune modulation; however, its correlation with IL-23 in UC is not well addressed. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between serum VD and IL-23 levels in UC patients.

We included forty-four UC patients and forty-four healthy controls. VD insufficiency was more common in UC patients (n = 14) compared to controls (n = 5). Significant increases in IL-23 levels were observed from remission (46.6 ± 4.3 pg/mL) to severe stages (218.5 ± 62.41 pg/mL), while VD levels did not show a similar trend. IL-23 levels also rose significantly with disease extent, from proctitis to pancolitis. A significant negative correlation was found between VD and IL-23 levels (r = -0.3175; P = 0.035). IL-23 and pulse rate were significant predictors of UC in our cohort.

Our findings highlight VD insufficiency as prevalent in UC patients, with VD levels negatively correlating with IL-23 levels, which increase with disease severity and extent. Further understanding of the interplay between VD and IL-23 will help design therapeutic interventions to modulate immune response and disease progression.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116Tw7ci]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The Endocrine Society's 2011 guidelines recommend considering vitamin D supplementation for managing vitamin D deficiency. Specifically, they suggest initiating 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 once weekly for 8 weeks or its equivalent of 6,000 IU of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 daily in all adult patients with vitamin D deficiency. This aims to achieve a serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL. Following this, maintenance therapy of 1,500–2,000 IU daily is advised.

### Effectiveness and safety of a high-dose weekly vitamin D (20,000 IU) protocol in older adults living in residential care [^113VxGQF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

The study aims to report 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations, an indicator of vitamin D status, in older adults living in residential care one year after implementing a protocol of weekly 20,000 IU of vitamin D.

- **Design**: The study was cross-sectional in design.

- **Setting**: The research was conducted across five residential care facilities in British Columbia, Canada.

- **Participants**: The study involved residents aged 65 and older from five facilities, totaling 236 participants.

- **Measurements**: Participants provided blood samples, and demographic and health information was extracted from medical records.

- **Results**: The mean 25OHD level was 102 nmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) = 98–106 nmol/L). Three percent of residents had a 25OHD concentration of less than 40 nmol/L. Hypercalcemia, a potential consequence of excessive vitamin D intake, was present in 14% of participants, although 25OHD levels did not significantly differ between those with and without hypercalcemia (108 vs 101 nmol/L; p = 0.17).

- **Conclusion**: Twelve months into implementing a 20,000-IU per week vitamin D protocol for older adults in residential care, high mean 25OHD concentrations were observed, with no evidence of inadequate vitamin D status. Given the absence of demonstrated benefits of high 25OHD concentrations for the residential care population, lower dosages of vitamin D, less than 20,000 IU per week, are recommended.

### A randomized comparison of intramuscular high-dose versus oral maintenance vitamin D to prevent severe exacerbations in deficient/insufficient asthmatic children [^113KfeDE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

With new guideline committee members, the Endocrine Society abruptly and drastically lowered the blood concentration defining deficiency, and it may change again in the future. The data provided in Table III allow physicians and families to estimate the degree of possible benefit from baseline blood concentration, irrespective of guideline committee membership.

- **Children with an unplanned ED visit for asthma**: Because injected vitamin D treatment was unmasked, it is interesting to ask whether injections per se reliably lead to reduced unplanned ED visits for asthma. Table III includes participants in the concurrently enrolled preschool children aged 2 to 4 years, providing detailed results for the four treatment groups stratified by study period and quartile of baseline 25(OH)D concentration. For the preschoolers and their parents/guardians, blinded randomization to injections (receiving injected IM + Oral) versus Oral-Only did not reduce unplanned ED visits for exacerbations during 0 to 3 months (58% vs 56%) nor during 0 to 12 months (87% vs 85%).

### Natpara (parathyroid hormone) [^116kCnCk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

At randomization, active forms of vitamin D were reduced by 50%, and patients were randomized to receive Natpara 50 mcg daily or a placebo. This was followed by a 12-week Natpara titration phase and a 12-week Natpara dose maintenance phase. During the titration phase, Natpara was increased by 25 mcg increments every four weeks, up to a maximum of 100 mcg. Titration was indicated for patients who could not achieve independence from active vitamin D and could not reduce oral calcium to 500 mg or less per day. At the end of the treatment, 56% of subjects randomized to Natpara were receiving 100 mcg per day, 26% were receiving 75 mcg per day, and 18% were receiving 50 mcg per day. Doses of co-administered active forms of vitamin D and calcium were adjusted (reduced or increased) to maintain albumin-corrected serum calcium within a desired target range throughout the trial in both arms.

For the efficacy analysis, subjects that fulfilled three components of a three-part response criterion were considered responders. A responder was defined as an individual who had: at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of active vitamin D, at least a 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of oral calcium supplementation, and an albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration between 7.5 mg/dL and 10.6 mg/dL.

At the end of treatment, significantly more subjects treated with Natpara [46/84 (54.8%)] compared to placebo [1/40 (2.5%)] met the response criterion (p-value < 0.001). Forty-two percent (35/84) of subjects randomized to Natpara were independent of such supplementation.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^112565fW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

The primary aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled, and partially-blinded study on 269 healthy adults, with a mean 25(OH)D level of 39.8 (11.9) nmol/L, was to evaluate the relative efficacy of equi-unit D2 and D3 oral supplements. These were administered daily, every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks over a period of 20 weeks to assess their effectiveness in raising 25(OH)D levels.

Predetermined secondary aims included comparing the levels of D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3. The primary outcome measure was the adjusted area-under-the-curve between days 0 and 140 (AUC 140).

The main results were as follows:

- **Long-term regimens**: Over the 20-week period, the D3 regimen administered every 2 weeks, followed by the D3 regimen every 4 weeks, and the D2 daily regimen were superior in raising 25(OH)D levels. Conversely, in the early weeks of treatment, the every 4 weeks regimen followed by the every 2 weeks regimen proved superior to all daily regimens.
- **D3 and D2 regimen comparison**: The D3 regimens administered every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks were consistently superior to the corresponding D2 regimens. However, the D2 daily regimen consistently proved superior to the D3 daily regimen.
- **25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels**: The 25(OH)D2 level was significantly higher in participants receiving the daily D2 regimen compared to those in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2-treated groups. In contrast, the 25(OH)D3 level was lower in participants receiving the daily regimen compared to those in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3-treated groups.
- **Inverse relation with baseline levels**: The increase in 25(OH)D level showed an inverse relationship with baseline levels. Its inverse relationship with BMI appeared to be D-type and time-dependent, primarily observable shortly after D2 treatment.
- **Impact of D2 regimens**: Daily, 2-weekly, and 4-weekly D2 regimens were associated with a similar and significant decrease in 25(OH)D3 levels. This decrease correlated with an increase in 25(OH)D2 levels and baseline 25(OH)D levels in participants with measurable baseline readings.

The study provides nuanced insights into how different regimens and intervals of vitamin D supplementation impact 25(OH)D level, considering factors such as baseline vitamin D levels and BMI.

The "supplementation of vitamin D and reproductive outcome" (SUNDRO) study [^116jrQwG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

The study has been designed according to the CONSORT methodology. The present trial is aimed at determining the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in improving cumulative clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF.

- **Aim 1**: To determine the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in improving cumulative clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF.
- **Aim 2**: To investigate whether vitamin D supplementation might improve clinical and embryological variables such as the number of cancelled cycles, the number of available oocytes, the number of good quality embryos, units of FSH administered per retrieved oocyte, and the implantation rate of transferred embryos.
- **Aim 3**: To investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on oocyte and endometrium quality at a molecular level through a comparative analysis between treated and untreated patients based on the analysis of cumulus cells, follicular, and endometrial fluids.

This is a multicenter randomized superiority double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel groups and allocation 1:1. Two Italian academic infertility units will be involved: IRCCS Fondazione Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, and IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.

Inclusion criteria for women will be as follows: indication to IVF, age 18–39 years, less than 3 previous IVF attempts, and body mass index (BMI) 18–25 kg/m². Exclusion criteria will be as follows: patients with anti-mullerian hormone serum level < 0.5 ng/ml.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: Variability, knowledge gaps, and the concept of a desirable range [^114rfqdw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide, but proportions vary widely between regions depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and the accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% of variations in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%.

Organizations and societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them. However, their applicability across age groups and populations is still debated. This article and the accompanying online supporting information highlight sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties, and knowledge gaps, as well as analytical problems facing 25OHD assays. Efficacy and safety data remain key factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels.

We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40 ng/mL (50 to 100 nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20 ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60 ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while considering season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation. We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards.

### Randomized controlled trial of vitamin d supplementation in older people to optimize bone health [^112UvMeq]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

We conclude that there was no difference in ΔBMD between the three dosages of vitamin D, which suggests no effect of the intervention or that all doses may have attenuated the anticipated decrease in BMD over 12 months. Monthly dosing with oral vitamin D3 is a safe and effective strategy to increase plasma 25(OH)D > 25 nmol/L. This is achieved with all three doses in the majority of people and aligns with the recommendation by the SACN. The lack of a dose effect on adverse outcomes is reassuring.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

- **Objective**: To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) e…

### Evaluation of vitamin D repletion regimens to correct vitamin D status in adults [^116d6EtC]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of commonly prescribed regimens for the treatment of vitamin D insufficiency, a retrospective analysis was performed involving 306 consecutive patients. These patients were prescribed ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) for correcting vitamin D insufficiency at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center from February 2003 to May 2006. The serum levels of parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), and calcium were compared before and after treatment with ergocalciferol. Patients without a 25-OHD determination (n = 41) were excluded from the analysis. Serum 25-OHD levels were used to define vitamin D status: deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency were marked as < 20 ng/mL, 20–29 ng/mL, and ≥ 30 ng/mL, respectively.

- **Results**: We identified 36 distinct prescribing regimens. The three most common regimens were:
	1. Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU once weekly for 4 weeks followed by 50,000 IU once monthly for 5 months (n = 48).
	2. Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU once monthly for 6 months (n = 80).
	3. Ergocalciferol 50,000 IU three times weekly for 6 weeks (n = 27).

	- Each of these treatments significantly increased serum 25-OHD levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, regimens containing at least 600,000 IU of ergocalciferol administered over a mean of 60 ± 40 days achieved sufficiency in 64% of cases, without causing vitamin D toxicity.

In conclusion, regimens with at least 600,000 IU of ergocalciferol appear to be the most effective in achieving vitamin D sufficiency. The guidelines for vitamin D treatment should consider these findings for optimal patient outcomes.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on psoriasis severity in patients with lower-range serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: A randomized clinical trial [^113i61wJ]. JAMA Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The study "Vitamin D in Psoriasis" was published by Marita Jenssen and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA Dermatology. This study is related to the disease psoriasis. The trial question was: What is the effect of vitamin D supplementation on psoriasis severity in patients with lower-range serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels? The study design was a single-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT).

The population consisted of 122 patients (46 female, 76 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with active plaque psoriasis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 24 ng/mL. The key exclusion criteria included nut allergy, primary hyperparathyroidism, granulomatous diseases, pregnancy, and clinical signs of proximal myopathy.

The interventions were as follows:

- **Vitamin D group (n = 60)**: Received cholecalciferol oral capsules (100,000 IU loading dose, followed by 20,000 IU per week for 4 months).
- **Placebo group (n = 62)**: Received matching placebo oral capsules for 4 months.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the reduction in psoriasis area severity index score (0.34 points vs. 0.41 points; AD -0.11 points, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.23).
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in the reduction in self-administered psoriasis area severity index (0.5 vs. -0.25; AD 0.6, 95% CI -0.55 to 1.76). Additionally, no significant difference was found in the improvement in the dermatology life quality index (-0.59 vs. 0.1; AD -0.86, 95% CI -1.9 to 0.19).

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, *Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management*, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients who have, or are at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency, its assessment, and treatment, leading to inconsistent clinical practice.

This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses, and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment**: Before specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate.

- **Musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency**. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned.

It sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required. Loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent.

For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) is recommended.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^117VCote]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of evaluating noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international guidelines are yet to reach a consensus.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^113uxCYa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Interestingly, in the D2/D3 group, the 25(OH)D2 level increased to about one-third to one-half the levels observed in the three D2 treated groups (Fig. 4a). However, 25(OH)D3 did not increase (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, in the three D2 treated groups, the 25(OH)D3 level progressively and consistently decreased over the course of the study (Fig. 4c), declining from a mean of 39.2 nmol/L at day 0 to 33.0, 31.6, 28.6, and 22.9 on days 7, 14, 28, and 140, respectively.

To further explore the effect of D2 treatment on the 25(OH)D3 level, we examined the correlation between changes (day 140 minus day 0) in 25(OH)D3 level and 25(OH)D2 level in the three D2 treated groups. As shown in Fig. 5a, there was a significant negative correlation (r = −0.48, p < 0.001). However, the change in 25(OH)D3 level also correlated negatively with the day zero 25(OH)D3 level (r = −0.58, p < 0.001) and with day 140 25(OH)D levels (r = −0.32, p = 0.003).

Of note, in one participant who started with measurable 25(OH)D2 level and received D3 bi-weekly, the 25(OH)D2 level decreased by 16.4 nmol/L between days 0 and 140 (Fig. 5b). In comparison, the mean decrease in 25(OH)D3 level in the three D2 treated groups was 16.4 nmol/L (CI, 14.0 to 18.7, p < 0.001), suggesting that D3 treatment may also induce a decline in 25(OH)D2 level of the same magnitude.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111TsKkR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, the 2011 Endocrine Society guidelines recommend advising at least 2–3 times more vitamin D intake for adults with obesity or those on anticonvulsant medications, corticosteroids, antifungals such as ketoconazole, and medications for AIDS to satisfy their body's vitamin D requirement.
