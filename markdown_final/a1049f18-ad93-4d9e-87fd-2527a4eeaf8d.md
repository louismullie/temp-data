## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the heterophile antibody test is negative in a 20-year-old with features of infectious mononucleosis and positive EBV-specific serologies, and to choose the best explanation among the provided options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical picture and whether it fits primary EBV infection. Then, I should verify the laboratory pattern and how it maps onto EBV serologic kinetics. Next, I will review heterophile test performance characteristics and timing. After that, I need to evaluate each answer choice against the evidence. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely explanation and confirm it aligns with guideline-based reasoning.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome matches infectious mononucleosis. The patient is a young adult with fever, sore throat, malaise, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar enlargement, and splenomegaly, which is the classic triad plus lymphocytosis and atypical lymphocytes on CBC, strongly supporting IM due to EBV in this age group [^113CvRbf].

> I need to check the laboratory pattern against EBV serology. Positive VCA IgM and IgG with absent EBNA IgG is the expected profile for acute primary EBV infection, because EBNA IgG typically appears 6–12 weeks after onset and persists for life, whereas VCA IgM appears early and VCA IgG develops within weeks and persists, which fits this presentation at day 7 of illness.

> Now, I should review heterophile test performance and timing. Wait, let me verify the sensitivity estimates. The heterophile antibody test has about 87% sensitivity overall in adolescents and young adults, but it can be falsely negative early in illness, with a roughly 25% false-negative rate in the first week that declines to about 5–10% by week 2 and about 5% by week 3, which explains a negative result at day 7 despite true EBV infection [^114u2m3D].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should examine each option carefully. Option A claims low specificity, but that would imply false positives, not false negatives, so that does not fit a negative heterophile in proven EBV infection; in fact, heterophile has high specificity but imperfect sensitivity, especially early, so A is incorrect [^114u2m3D]. Option B proposes a false negative, which aligns with the known early-window false negatives and the patient's timeline, so this is plausible and consistent with guidelines recommending EBV-specific serology when heterophile is negative but suspicion remains high. Option C suggests concurrent hepatitis A, but the serology for HAV is explicitly negative, so this is a distractor and incorrect. Option D suggests CMV, but again, CMV serology is negative and the EBV-specific pattern is diagnostic of primary EBV, making CMV unlikely here.

> Let me synthesize and double-check the conclusion. The most likely reason for the negative heterophile test in this 20-year-old with classic IM and positive EBV-specific serologies is a false-negative result due to testing too early in the course of illness, when heterophile antibodies have not yet risen to detectable levels, which is a recognized limitation prompting use of EBV-specific serology in this scenario.

> Final answer: B. False negative [^1146nq6c].

---

The most likely reason for the negative heterophile antibody test in this patient with confirmed acute EBV infection is a **false-negative result** [^1146nq6c] due to testing too early in the illness course [^114x2qXT], as heterophile antibodies typically appear 6–10 days after symptom onset and can be delayed or absent in up to 10% of cases [^1146nq6c]. The patient's EBV-specific serology (VCA IgM and IgG positive) confirms acute infection, and the negative heterophile test does not exclude EBV in this context [^1146nq6c].

---

## Clinical presentation and laboratory findings

The patient presents with **classic infectious mononucleosis symptoms** — fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly — accompanied by laboratory findings of lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes and elevated liver enzymes, all consistent with acute EBV infection [^114x2qXT]. EBV-specific serology (VCA IgM and IgG positive) **confirms acute infection**, whereas the heterophile antibody test is negative.

---

## Heterophile antibody test: clinical utility and limitations

The heterophile antibody test (Monospot) is a rapid screening assay for infectious mononucleosis, with **sensitivity around 85–90% and specificity around 90–95%** in adults and adolescents [^114x2qXT] [^114u2m3D]. However, it has notable limitations:

- **False-negative results**: Occur in approximately 10% of cases, particularly early in the illness (within the first week) or in young children [^1146nq6c] [^114x2qXT].
- **False-positive results**: Can occur in other conditions such as CMV, HIV, lymphoma, or autoimmune diseases [^114xau6H] [^1141Mom9] [^114u2m3D].

---

## Timing and kinetics of heterophile antibody production

Heterophile antibodies typically appear 6–10 days after symptom onset, peak at 2–3 weeks, and decline over several months [^1146nq6c]. Early testing (within the first week) may yield **false-negative results** because antibody levels have not yet reached detectable levels [^114x2qXT].

---

## Age-related factors influencing heterophile antibody test results

Age significantly affects heterophile antibody production. Young children (under 4 years) often have **false-negative results** due to an immature immune response, whereas adolescents and young adults (15–24 years) typically have higher sensitivity and specificity [^1146nq6c] [^1128Fygu]. This patient, aged 20, falls within the age group with the highest diagnostic accuracy for heterophile testing; however, false negatives can still occur, especially early in the illness [^114x2qXT].

---

## Alternative explanations for negative heterophile antibody test

While a false-negative result is the most likely explanation, **alternative considerations** include:

- **Early testing**: The test was performed before heterophile antibodies reached detectable levels [^1146nq6c] [^114x2qXT].
- **Individual variability**: Some patients may have a delayed or absent heterophile antibody response [^1146nq6c] [^115ZwGfW].
- **Laboratory assay variability**: Different commercial assays have varying sensitivities and specificities, potentially affecting results [^111K7utx].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the **limitations of heterophile antibody testing** and recommend confirmatory EBV-specific serology (VCA IgM, VCA IgG, EBNA) when heterophile results are negative but clinical suspicion for EBV remains high [^1146nq6c] [^1128Fygu]. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate management [^114x2qXT].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

The most likely reason for the negative heterophile antibody test in this patient is a **false-negative result** due to early testing or individual variability in antibody production [^1146nq6c]. The positive EBV-specific serology confirms acute infection, and the negative heterophile test does not exclude EBV. Clinicians should interpret heterophile results cautiously, consider the clinical context, and use confirmatory EBV-specific serology when indicated [^114x2qXT].

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1146nq6c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) — heterophile antibody kinetics and serologic diagnosis in immunocompetent mononucleosis are outlined as follows: Heterophile antibodies usually become detectable 6–10 days following symptom onset, increase through the second or third week of the illness, and thereafter gradually decline over a year or longer; false negative results occur in approximately 10% and are especially common in children younger than 4 years. When rapid Monospot or heterophile testing is negative, additional laboratory tests may be considered, and EBV-specific antibody testing for IgG- and IgM-class antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) is recommended. VCA IgM (with or without VCA IgG) with absent EBNA IgG suggests recent primary infection, whereas anti-EBNA IgG indicates infection that occurred at least 6–12 weeks prior; EBNA IgG generally develops 2–3 months after primary infection and is detectable for life. Over 90% of adults have IgG-class antibodies to VCA and EBNA, but approximately 5%–10% of infected patients fail to develop antibodies to EBNA. Nucleic acid amplification tests, either qualitative or quantitative, are not recommended for routine diagnosis of EBV-associated disease in the immunocompetent patient.

### Fever with atypical lymphocytosis: pearls and pitfalls in Epstein-Barr virus serology [^111dVUED]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The heterophile antibody (also known as the Monospot) test is a useful screening tool for infectious mononucleosis (IM) resulting from primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, up to 10% of patients with IM are heterophile negative. Heterophile-negative patients who have lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear should be further tested for EBV serologies, which include testing for specific IgM and IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigens, early antigens and EBV nuclear antigen proteins. A diagnostic dilemma arises when the patient has clinical and laboratory features of IM, but is both heterophile negative and seronegative for IM, as illustrated in this case presentation. To avoid missed diagnoses of IM, misdiagnosis of mononucleosis-like illnesses and unnecessary testing, knowledge of test characteristics and the evolving course of EBV serologies is important to assure and inform both the physician and the patient.

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus heterophile antibody tests in patients with primary human immunodeficiency virus infection [^114xau6H]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe three cases of primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients who had laboratory studies consistent with infectious mononucleosis.

Subjects

We describe 3 patients who presented with a viral syndrome, had a positive heterophile antibody test, and were diagnosed with primary HIV infection.

Results

The results of Epstein-Barr virus serology studies in each of these patients were consistent with chronic, but not acute, Epstein-Barr virus infection. HIV antibody tests were negative, and HIV RNA was > 500,000 copies/mL in each patient.

Conclusions

Clinicians should recognize that a positive heterophile antibody test in the setting of an acute viral illness does not exclude the diagnosis of primary HIV infection, although reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus infection cannot be ruled out. Patients presenting with nonspecific viral syndromes should be assessed for HIV risk behaviors and tested for primary HIV infection when appropriate.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)–specific serology — viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM appears early and typically disappears at the 4- to 6-week mark, VCA IgG peaks 2 to 4 weeks after onset and persists for life, and Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies generally appear 2 to 4 months after onset and also persist; IgM and IgG antibodies to EBV VCA have a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 94%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 16 vs 9.7–28 for heterophile tests and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.03 vs 0.14–0.18 for heterophile antibody tests; tests such as EBV DNA amplification in lymphocytes and monitoring viral load via PCR are not routinely used in clinical practice.

### Evidence-based approach for interpretation of Epstein-Barr virus serological patterns [^115tnMWo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is based on clinical symptoms and serological markers, including the following: immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA), heterophile antibodies, and IgG antibodies to the EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1). The use of all five markers results in 32 possible serological patterns. As a result, interpretation of EBV serologies remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to use a large population of patients to develop evidence-based tools for interpreting EBV results. This study utilized 1,846 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. Chart review was performed for more than 800 patients, and diagnoses were assigned based on physician-ordered testing, clinical presentation, and patient history. Testing for all five EBV antibodies was performed separately on all serum samples using the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 system. Presumed EBV diagnosis (based on previous publications) was compared to EBV diagnosis based on a medical record review for each serological pattern. Interestingly, of the 32 possible serological patterns, only 12 occurred in ≥ 10 patients. The remaining 20 patterns were uninterpretable because they occurred with such infrequency. Two easy-to-use tables were created to interpret EBV serological patterns based on whether three (EBV VCA IgG, IgM, and heterophile) or five markers are utilized. The use of these two tables allows for interpretation of > 95% of BioPlex serological results. This is the first evidence-based study of its kind for EBV serology.

### Febrile palpebral edema [^115ZwGfW]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which one of the following tests is expected to be found with the diagnosis of the presented case?
A. Negative heterophile antibodies
B. Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-viral capsid antigen (VCA) − IgG-VCA + anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) − antiearly antigen (anti-EA) −
C. IgM-VCA + IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA − anti-EA +
D. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA − anti-EBNA − anti-EA −
E. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA + anti-EA −

Answers:

A. Negative heterophile antibodies – Incorrect. Heterophile antibodies may be sufficient in case of positivity with a typical clinical picture of EBV infection. Otherwise, anti-VCA and anti-EBNA are required for the diagnosis. Moreover, young children aged < 4 years may not develop a positive heterophile antibody response during EBV primoinfection.
B. Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-viral capsid antigen (VCA) − IgG-VCA + anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) − antiearly antigen (anti-EA) − – Incorrect. This serologic profile is consistent with a convalescent infection.
C. IgM-VCA + IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA − anti-EA + – Correct. This serologic profile is consistent with a EBV primoinfection. Anti-EA antibodies are the markers of acute infection, appearing in early disease. IgM anti-VCA are also usually found at the onset of the disease but studies report the existence of false positive results, especially with cytomegalovirus infections.
D. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA − anti-EBNA − anti-EA − – Incorrect. This serologic profile is not consistent with an EBV infection.
E. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA + anti-EA − – Incorrect. This serologic profile is consistent with a remote past infection. IgG anti-VCA may be either negative or positive during the early infection but shows life-long persistance. On the other hand, anti-EBNA antibodies usually appear weeks after the infection onset. The presence of IgG anti-VCA and anti-EBNA in acute illness rules out a primary EBV infection.

### Prevalence of primary versus reactivated Epstein-Barr virus infection in patients with VCA IgG-, VCA IgM-and EBNA-1-antibodies and suspected infectious mononucleosis [^115vnZgn]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, IgG- and IgM-antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and IgG-antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) can occur simultaneously both in late primary infection and during subclinical viral reactivation in immunocompetent persons, and the differential diagnosis is of importance.

Objectives

To study the prevalence of primary infection and serological reactivation in patients with suspected primary EBV infection and with all three parameters present.

Study Design

Fifty serum samples from 43 consecutive patients referred for suspected infectious mononucleosis and positive for VCA IgG-, VCA IgM- and EBNA-1-antibodies by EIA, were tested for IgG-antibody avidity with an EBV IgG immunoblot. Sera were also tested for heterophile antibodies (HA). To verify the presence of IgM-antibodies an EBV IgM immunoblot was performed when high-avidity IgG-antibodies were found.

Results and Conclusions

Of 43 patients with suspected primary EBV infection and VCA IgG-, VCA IgM- and EBNA-1-antibodies present, only 18 patients (42%) had a late primary infection. Twenty-one patients (49%) had high-avidity IgG-antibodies, indicating an IgM response due to reactivation, thus suggesting other causes for their symptoms. In 10 of these 21 patients the presence of IgM-antibodies was confirmed by immunoblot, indicating reactivation as a cause of IgM-antibodies in at least 23% of the 43 patients studied. Of 18 patients with primary infection, HA were detected in 16 (94%) of 17 patients tested. Only one (5%) of the patients with high-avidity antibodies had HA. Absence of HA in patients with this serological pattern is therefore a good indicator of reactivation, and conversely, the presence of HA is a good indicator of primary infection. In HA negative patients, avidity testing could be used for differential diagnosis.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^113krZsq]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific serology — timing and diagnostic accuracy: VCA IgM appears early in infection and disappears at the 4–6-week mark; antibody to early antigen is usually short-lived, peaking at 3–4 weeks after onset; VCA IgG peaks at 2–4 weeks and persists for life; and EBNA antibody generally appears only after 2–4 months and also persists for life. VCA IgM and IgG antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (sensitivity 97%, specificity 94%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 16.5 versus 9.7–28 for a positive heterophile test; when VCA IgM and IgG are negative, the negative likelihood ratio is 0.03 versus 0.14 to 0.18 for heterophile antibody tests. Because EBNA appears late and persists for life, its presence in the course of acute illness should lead one to consider diagnoses other than EBV.

### Investigation of primary human immunodeficiency virus infection in patients who test positive for heterophile antibody [^111fZpHB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

In light of a recent report of 3 false-positive results of Epstein-Barr virus heterophile tests caused by HIV infection, we sought to assess the frequency of this occurrence. One hundred thirty-two positive heterophile antibody-tested serum samples were obtained from 2 tertiary care facilities in Boston to assess for HIV, and all tested negative for HIV plasma RNA. This study shows that false-positive results of heterophile tests are not frequently associated with primary HIV infection.

### Infectious mononucleosis: rapid evidence review [^114x2qXT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis is a viral syndrome characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. It is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often affects adolescents and young adults 15 to 24 years of age. Primary transmission is through close personal contact with a person who is infected, particularly their saliva. Cost-effective, efficient initial laboratory testing for acute infectious mononucleosis includes complete blood count with differential (to assess for greater than 40% lymphocytes and greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes) and a rapid heterophile antibody test. The heterophile antibody test has a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 91% but can have a false-negative result in children younger than five years and in adults during the first week of illness. The presence of elevated liver enzymes increases clinical suspicion for infectious mononucleosis in the setting of a negative heterophile antibody test result. Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen-antibody testing is more sensitive and specific but more expensive and takes longer to process than the rapid heterophile antibody test. Treatment of infectious mononucleosis is supportive; routine use of antivirals and corticosteroids is not recommended. Current guidelines recommend that patients with infectious mononucleosis not participate in athletic activity for three weeks from onset of symptoms. Shared decision-making should be used to determine the timing of return to activity. Immunosuppressed populations are at higher risk of severe disease and significant morbidity. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been linked to nine types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and some autoimmune diseases.

### False positivity of monospot test in an immunocompetent elderly woman with acute cytomegalovirus infection [^1141Mom9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old woman presented with altered mental status, septic picture, and influenza-like symptoms. Initial investigations revealed atypical lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and a positive monospot test result. Further investigation showed the Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antibody IgM/IgG and Epstein-Barr virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction to be negative; however, interestingly her cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM and IgG were positive, suggesting that her mononucleosis-like syndrome was due to acute CMV infection. Herein, we report the first case of a heterophile-positive mononucleosis syndrome caused by acute CMV infection in an elderly immunocompetent woman. This case conveys that monospot test can yield false-positive result in the setting of acute CMV infection.

### Comparison of seven heterophile antibody assays for laboratory diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis in pediatric patients [^111K7utx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Heterophile antibody assays have been used to aid the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Seven commercially available assays currently widely utilized in clinical laboratories were compared in this study. Variable performance characteristics and assay times are observed, and these pieces of data may assist clinical laboratories in assay selection and result interpretation.

### Common questions about infectious mononucleosis [^114sMgCX]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr is a ubiquitous virus that infects 95% of the world population at some point in life. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections are often asymptomatic, some patients present with the clinical syndrome of infectious mononucleosis (IM). The syndrome most commonly occurs between 15 and 24 years of age. It should be suspected in patients presenting with sore throat, fever, tonsillar enlargement, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, pharyngeal inflammation, and palatal petechiae. A heterophile antibody test is the best initial test for diagnosis of EBV infection, with 71% to 90% accuracy for diagnosing IM. However, the test has a 25% false-negative rate in the first week of illness. IM is unlikely if the lymphocyte count is less than 4,000 mm3. The presence of EBV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies confirms infection, but the test is more costly and results take longer than the heterophile antibody test. Symptomatic relief is the mainstay of treatment. Glucocorticoids and antivirals do not reduce the length or severity of illness. Splenic rupture is an uncommon complication of IM. Because physical activity within the first three weeks of illness may increase the risk of splenic rupture, athletic participation is not recommended during this time. Children are at the highest risk of airway obstruction, which is the most common cause of hospitalization from IM. Patients with immunosuppression are more likely to have fulminant EBV infection.

### Seroepidemiology of EBV and interpretation of the "isolated VCA igG" pattern [^114ssRMY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of VCA IgG in the absence of VCA IgM and EBNA-1 IgG antibodies makes classifying EBV infection more difficult as this serological picture can be seen in the case of past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, or acute infections with the early disappearance or delayed onset of VCA IgM. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of this pattern in 2,422 outpatients with suspected EBV infection examined in 2005–2006, and to interpret its significance by means of immunoblotting. One hundred and seventy-seven (7.3%) of the patients were VCA IgG-positive, VCA IgM-negative and EBNA-1 IgG-negative, 15 of whom (8.5%) presented with heterophile antibodies. Analysis by age class showed that the prevalence of isolated VCA IgG ranged from 4.5% in the subjects aged 1–10 years to 9% in those aged > 60 years. Immunoblotting allowed 18.9% of the cases to be classified as acute and 81.1% as past infections, the latter being observed in about 37% of the patients aged less than 10 years and in 100% of those aged > 30 years. Therefore, in our case series, the presence of isolated VCA IgG was associated usually with past infection, particularly among adults. In children aged less than 10 years, it was associated mainly with acute infection but as past infection may be present in about one-third of such children, this possibility should not be overlooked.

### How to use… the monospot and other heterophile antibody tests [^1128Fygu]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2017). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly prevalent virus, transmitted via saliva, which often causes asymptomatic infection in children but frequently results in infectious mononucleosis in adolescents. Heterophile antibody tests, including the Monospot test, are red cell or latex agglutination assays, which detect antired cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response occurring during EBV infection. Heterophile antibody tests are rapid, cheap and specific tests that can be performed from the onset of symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. In adolescents, heterophile antibody tests have high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of primary acute EBV infection. However, the tests have low sensitivity and low negative predictive value in young children and are not useful under the age of 4. Heterophile tests may be positive in other viral infections, autoimmune disease and haematological malignancies, but do not appear to be positive in primary bacterial infection. Virus-specific serology is required in children under the age of 4 or if an older child is heterophile negative. Virus-specific serology allows diagnosis and the pattern of positivity and negativity enables the clinician to stage the EBV infection. Virus-specific serology appears to have better sensitivity in young children, but there is cross-reaction with other herpesvirus infections, a longer turnaround time and it is more expensive to perform. Further research is needed to establish which children benefit from and hence require testing for heterophile antibodies, the cost-effectiveness of EBV investigations and whether heterophile titres have predictive value for the severity of infection and the likelihood of complications.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^114u2m3D]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) — heterophile test performance and repeat testing: Laboratory studies that support IM include lymphocytosis with typically greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes and a positive heterophile test. In patients older than age 16 years, the heterophile antibody latex agglutination test has a sensitivity and specificity of 87% (range 79%–95%) and 91% (range 82%–99%), respectively. False-positive results are rare but can occur in lymphoma, hepatitis, or autoimmune disease. The false-negative rate may be higher during the first week of illness (25%) and decreases with subsequent testing (5%–10% at week 2 and 5% at week 3), underscoring the usefulness of repeating this test if clinically indicated; alternatively, more specific EBV tests can be considered.

### Analysis of 4 cases of children with false-positive results of novel coronavirus-specific antibody [^117X39hB]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A male child, 14 months old, was admitted to the Department of cardiology for a chief complaint of "fever for 7 days, rash for 3 days, red eye for 2 days" and was clinically diagnosed with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. EDTA anticoagulated plasma samples were examined for 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG antibodies using reagents A and B, respectively. The results were both IgM (+) and IgG (-). Meanwhile, the child's coagulation function test showed a significantly elevated fibrinogen (FiB) concentration of 5.57 g/L. However, after the removal of FiB, the results were all IgM (-) and IgG (-). On July 8, 2020, the protein mass spectrometry result returned negative. After treatment, the patient's plasma sample was reexamined. Moreover, the results from both kits were IgM (-) and IgG (-). Also, the FiB level was 2.82 g/L on the same day. Our analysis believed an increased FiB level could cause false-positive results.

Case 3

A female child, 4 years and 1-month-old was diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis due to "fever, rash for 6 days, nasal congestion and snoring for 4 days" in the outpatient clinic. The patient's peripheral blood serum samples were tested for 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG antibodies using reagents A and B, respectively. Furthermore, the results were all IgM (+) and IgG (-). Moreover, the percentage of heterogeneous lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was 18%, EBV-DNA was positive, and EBV capsid antibody IgM was > 160 (positive), all of which led to the diagnosis of EB virus infection. The protein mass spectrometry result returned negative. After treatment, the patient's serum sample was reexamined, and the test results from both kits were IgM (-) and IgG (-). In our analysis, we believed the false-positive result could be caused by an elevated heterophile antibody (HA) level.

### False-positive serologies for acute hepatitis A and autoimmune hepatitis in a patient with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection [^1131JoXd]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acute hepatitis remains a diagnostic challenge, and numerous infectious, metabolic and autoimmune diseases need to be effectively excluded. We present a case of a young woman with malaise, fever, jaundice and deranged liver function tests. Testing for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) virus capsid antigen IgM/IgG was positive. Total IgG was elevated, along with positive serology for anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV)-IgM, antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and soluble liver antigen (SLA) leading to the differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis A and autoimmune hepatitis. No specific treatment was started and liver function gradually improved. At week 4, HAV IgG and IgM were negative. At month 4, ANA and SLA were negative and total IgG normalised; EBV nuclear antigen became positive. Testing for EBV is an investigation required at baseline in acute hepatitis and physicians should carefully evaluate serological results, including those for viral and autoimmune hepatitis that may be falsely positive in infectious mononucleosis.

We determined the presence of IgG and IgM antibody to viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM) and IgG antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during the acute illness and at 1, 2, 6, and 48 months in a prospective population-based case series of 95 persons with an acute illness serologically confirmed as Epstein-Barr virus infection. The acute illness was characterized by the presence of VCA-IgG and VCA-IgM (by ELISA) and by the absence of EBNA in most, but not all, patients. During follow-up, VCA-IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients, while the proportion with VCA-IgM declined and the number with detectable EBNA antibodies steadily increased. The primary differences between the 2 serologic test methods were the increased persistence of VCA-IgM during follow-up by ELISA and the earlier detection of EBNA by IFA. Clinicians should consider the illness stage and the laboratory technique to appropriately interpret serologic test results in suspected cases of mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.

### Unilateral multifocal choroiditis following EBV-positive mononucleosis responsive to immunosuppression: a case report [^116u2uAY]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Our patient's prior history of EBV- positive mononucleosis was established with the heterophile antibody test which is an agglutination assay that detects anti-red blood cell antibodies produced as part of a polyclonal antibody response occurring during EBV infection. Heterophile antibody tests are rapid, cheap and specific tests with a result that is interpreted as positive or negative (for agglutination) and can be performed from the onset of symptoms of infectious mononucleosis. A positive i.e. reactive heterophile test in a patient with symptoms suggestive of IM is diagnostic of EBV infection and further testing for specific antibodies to EBV is not considered essential.

The development of multifocal choroiditis may be one of the delayed sequelae of EBV infection. Chronic EBV infection has been conjectured to predispose to molecular mimicry and affect various major organ systems including the eye. Interestingly, our patient had a documented prior normal retinal examination and 20/20 vision. She noted a change in her vision after the development of EBV associated IM. The complete unilaterality of her findings may explain the slight delay in her recognition of the visual changes. The development of MFC following confirmed EBV positive IM provides a temporal association between the EBV infection and her symptoms. The development of EBV-associated mononucleosis suggests a plausible sequence of events in terms of EBV predisposing to or causing the multifocal choroiditis which has been conjectured previously.

Azathioprine is a steroid sparing immunosuppressant, mainly used in rheumatologic diseases. The patient had continuous improvement of her inflammatory lesions in the right eye after initiating azathioprine. The visual improvement was somewhat surprising, given the extent of associated fibrosis. The patient showed dramatic improvement in her retinal lesions over 8 months. It seems unlikely that this dramatic visual improvement over 8 months was unrelated to immunosuppression with azathioprine. She had 20/200 vision for a year with persistent active lesions before initiating azathioprine that completely subsided with vision improvement from 20/200 to 20/40 with immunosuppression. This course does not appear to follow the natural history of the disease, rather it suggests a response to intervention with immunosuppression. Long term visual prognosis in MFC may reasonably improve with continued immunosuppression, particularly in the event that persistent subclinical disease activity evolves into subretinal fibrosis and uveitis syndrome.

### Hematologic differences in heterophile-positive and heterophile-negative infectious mononucleosis [^113LEgas]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM) due to all causes is characterized by atypical lymphocytosis. We sought to compare hematologic parameters of infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (heterophile antibody (HA) positive) with mononucleosis due to other causes. Mono-Latex Slide Agglutination Test results and complete blood counts (CBC) of 147 patients with mononucleosis were retrospectively analyzed. Leukocyte count, absolute lymphocyte count, and presence of atypical lymphocytes in EBV-positive and EBV-negative groups were statistically compared. We analyzed 68 EBV-positive and 79 EBV-negative cases. EBV-positive patients were significantly younger than EBV-negative patients were. Mean total WBC count and mean absolute lymphocyte count were significantly higher in EBV-positive patients. Absolute lymphocytosis, absolute leukocytosis, and atypical lymphocytosis were also significantly more frequent in EBV-positive patients. Leukopenia was more frequently seen in EBV-negative patients.

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus IgM assays in primary HIV infection [^1149wXTr]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

We report three cases with misleading cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) results during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We determined the rate of positive anti-CMV IgM assays or anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in sera from a group of well-characterized subjects with primary HIV infection as 2.9% (1/35; 95%CI: 0.15–16.6%) for each infection. The rate of positive anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in subjects with positive hepatitis A virus IgM assays was 30% (6/20; 95%CI: 14.6–51.9%). Clinicians need to consider the limitations of IgM assays for diagnosis of herpesvirus infections, and consider testing for other infections with overlapping clinical manifestations.

### Clinical validity of serum antibodies to SARS-CoV-2: a case-control study [^112DopnS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical utility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies remains undefined.

Objective

To determine the clinical validity and utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Design

Case-control study.

Setting

First month of testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on nasopharyngeal swabs at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland (11 066 persons).

Participants

Of the 11 066 tested persons, 115 (1%) were hospitalized adults investigated for COVID-19. Clinical record review was performed to classify them into a COVID-19 case group (n = 60) or a non-COVID-19 control group (n = 55). The laboratory control groups comprised 513 persons not tested by NAAT: 160 healthy laboratory employees, 101 persons positive for IgG antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen, 215 positive for thyroperoxidase antibody, and 37 positive for rheumatoid factor.

Measurements

Serum IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

Sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay were 0.976 (95% CI, 0.928 to 0.995) and 0.988 (CI, 0.974 to 0.995), respectively, when performed 14 days or later after symptom onset, but sensitivity decreased at earlier time points. Immunoglobulin G developed rapidly and was sustained at high levels throughout follow-up (up to 58 days). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 predicted the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, which increased by 62% (CI, 48% to 81%; P < 0.001) for every 2-fold increase in IgG. Of 11 066 NAAT-tested patients, 457 were repeatedly NAAT-negative, and serum samples were obtained for 18 such patients (6 COVID-19 case patients and 12 non-COVID-19 control patients). Antibodies were present in 5 of 6 case patients and none of the 12 control patients (P = 0.001).

Limitations

The study was retrospective and performed at a single center; the sample was small; follow-up was limited; and selection bias may have occurred.

Conclusion

Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate infection when measured at least 14 days after symptom onset, are associated with clinical severity, and provide valuable diagnostic support in patients who test negative by NAAT but remain clinically suspicious for COVID-19.

### Clinical performance of different SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests [^114kGuXC]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Serum and plasma samples

We collected follow up serum or plasma samples (in the following simply stated as samples) from individuals with PCR‐diagnosed infections with SARS‐CoV‐2 (n = 33) at different time points (Table 1). Most of these individuals had a moderate to severe clinical course and required an in‐patient hospital stay in the intensive care unit. Additionally, follow up samples of recent PCR‐diagnosed infections with SARS‐CoV (three patients from the 2003 outbreak), HCoV‐OC43 (n = 4), HCoV‐HKU1 (n = 1), HCoV‐NL63 (n = 2), HCoV‐229E (n = 4) and recent serological/PCR‐diagnosed infections with acute Epstein Barr virus (EBV) (n = 4, three serologically EBV‐VCA‐IgM positive and one PCR‐ and serologically EBV‐VCA‐IgM positive) and acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 3) (all serologically IgM and PCR‐positive) were collected. The samples of individuals infected with endemic human coronavirus, CMV, and EBV were used to assess potential cross‐reactivity and the risk of potential false‐positive results.

2.2 Lateral flow assay

The FaStep (COVID‐19 IgG/IgM) rapid test cassettes (COV‐W32M, Assure Tech [Hangzhou] Co. Ltd, China) were used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. We have no details on the used antigen component. About 10 µL serum and two drops of sample buffer were applied to the sample well. Test results were visually evaluated after 10 minutes.

### Case report: a diagnostically challenging conjunctival mass caused by the Epstein-Barr virus [^115MYjb7]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The case we presented was challenging because lymphocytosis (a characteristic feature of IM) was not evident on the full blood count at initial presentation which was about two weeks after the onset of symptoms. Normally a relative or absolute increase in the number of lymphocytes (with a 15–25% increase in atypical cells) would be expected within the first 14 days. Due to the cross-reactivity of some of the antibodies, the Monospot test can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Its specificity is close to 100% (96–100%), however because about 10% of people do not produce heterophil antibodies it is less sensitive (70–92%). A clinical picture highly suggestive of IM in addition to a positive Monospot test can be used to exclude other causes of infectious mononucleosis such as: cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes symplex, Toxoplasma gondii and human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1).

Retrospectively, the elevated ALT presented a clue due to the characteristic elevation of liver transaminases in IM. As a difference, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels do not usually change in IM.

Young patients with suspicious lymphoid periocular lesions with a recent history of a febrile illness, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis and other presenting features of IM should be offered a full blood count and serological studies to check for recent EBV infection or reactivation. If the aetiology is viral and depending on the extent of the mass, surgical management can be offered, as in our case. Otherwise, acyclovir can be used because the EB virus is susceptible to it in the active phase. Moreover, there have been reports where spontaneous regression of a smaller nodule of similar origin was observed, which demonstrated that conservative treatment may also be an option.

### Epstein-barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon? [^114uC8oe]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods.

The International CIS study is a collaborative study across 33 centers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods for sample and data collection have previously been described. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity against EBNA1 was initially evaluated using commercially available ELISA (ETI-EBNA-G, Diasorin, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Samples with anti–EBNA1-IgG reactivity less than the manufacturer's cutoff value (CoV) (< 20 AU/mL) for the ETI-EBNA-G ELISA (screen-negative) were tested using well-validated in-house ELISAs based on multiepitope peptides of EBNA1 and virus capsid antigen (VCA) using previously described methods. The CoV for the in-house ELISA was the mean OD450 value of 4 truly EBNA1- and VCA-negative sera plus twice the SD (mean + 2 SD). OD450 values were normalized against the CoV, and values > 1.0 were considered positive. Samples demonstrating negative or borderline (0.8–1.2) results against both EBV antigens were investigated using an EBV-specific immunoblot.

### Association of serum Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 antibodies and intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis in early multiple sclerosis [^114bStUU]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. A characteristic feature of MS is an intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig)G. In 90 patients with clinically isolated syndromes/early relapsing-remitting MS, serum antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1, but not to EBV viral capsid antigen, rubella, or varicella zoster virus, were higher (p = 0.03) in those with than those without a calculated intrathecal IgG synthesis > 0% and correlated with the percentage (r = 0.27, p = 0.009) and concentration (r = 0.27, p = 0.012) of intrathecally produced IgG. These findings suggest a link between EBV infection and the events leading to intrathecal IgG synthesis in patients with MS.

### Epstein-barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon? [^112dfDbw]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion.

Only 1 of 1,047 patients (< 0.01%) was truly EBV-negative. Previous literature demonstrates a strong association between MS and EBV infection; in keeping with this, 41 patients (3.9%) showed no EBNA1-reactivity on initial screen. More detailed testing revealed a much higher rate of EBV seropositivity in CIS and MS patients than previously described.

There is significant antigenic diversity of anti–EBV-IgG responses in EBV carriers and patients with EBV-related disease. Serologic testing against multiple antigens is recommended to accurately define EBV status when examining the link between EBV infection and other diseases. In studies examining MS risk and EBV infection, the rate of EBV positivity in the population is highly dependent on the method used to determine EBV serostatus.

ELISA against 2 different EBV antigens provides a screening method; immunoblot on apparently seronegative samples increases sensitivity. The ETI-EBNA-G ELISA was validated for Food and Drug Administration's approval against a cell-based EBNA1-anticomplement immunofluorescence. The CoV for this ELISA is likely set relatively high, giving borderline values a negative interpretation. The in-house ELISA that we used utilizes the same peptide antigen, but was validated against purified EBNA1, increasing sensitivity and explaining the correlation between EBNA1 titers in the 2 ELISAs. Some EBNA1-IgG–negative sera are positive against other EBV antigens.

The fact that patients who were EBNA1-screen–negative were less likely to have OCBs provides an avenue for future research; there is likely a biological link between lower EBV immunoreactivity and OCB production. However, in our earlier study, while OCB predicted a second event, lower EBV reactivity did not — the relationship therefore is more complex than a simple linear or threshold effect. EBNA1-seropositivity occurs later than VCA seroconversion; low titers of anti–EBNA1-IgG may reflect recent EBV infection which has not yet triggered downstream biological events. It may be that patients who are EBNA1-screen–negative have a lower overall level of immune response, resulting in negative OCBs. However, the same relationship is not seen in the CMV-seronegative population, hinting at an EBV-specific link.

With only 1 of 1,047 patients in our large international cohort testing negative for EBV across multiple antigens and 2 platforms, it seems that while it is possible to be truly EBV seronegative and develop MS, this is extremely rare. It seems likely that this indicates a role for EBV in MS development, and further research is needed to examine this further.

### Comparison of elecsys and liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115w8NLR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Serological markers for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pretransplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician‐ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti‐VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti‐Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status. In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1). Concerning the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays showed similar performance. The interpretation of EBV serological profiles based on the clinical context may require serology follow up or further diagnostic approaches in challenging cases.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^113uwdWy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infection in the patient on immunosuppressive therapy — management in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) focuses on holding therapy during acute infectious mononucleosis with close monitoring and serologies. Once acute infectious mononucleosis is diagnosed, one strategy is to hold immunosuppressive therapy and follow for cytopenia and hyperferritinemia at least weekly, and physicians may choose to check antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) to VCA typically disappears within 4 to 6 weeks, IgG to VCA develops in the first few weeks and persists for life, and IgG to EBNA develops within 2 to 4 months and also persists for life; ideally, immunosuppression should be held until IgG VCA/EBNA is positive and the IgM to VCA is undetectable. Patients who develop cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia should be referred immediately for hospitalization and urgent evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with present strategies including plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, etoposide, or calcineurin inhibitors; alternatively, if clinically recovered and IBD symptoms recur, EBV polymerase chain reaction can be checked and, if the copy number is low, it is reasonable to resume IBD therapy.

Retrospective analysis of EBV seroprevalence in a large hospital population

We retrospectively analysed results of EBV serologies, which were performed for routine diagnostic purposes in 16 163 persons at Labor Berlin GmbH, Berlin, Germany, between January 2014 and December 2016. Sera were sent for EBV serological testing from persons treated as inpatients or outpatients at university hospitals (Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin) located in Berlin or community hospitals located in Berlin and Northern Germany. The 16 163 persons were included irrespective of diagnoses or the reason for ordering EBV serologies. For individuals tested more than once during the study period, only the results of the first EBV serology were considered. From all persons included in the analysis, results of serological tests for EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgG and VCA IgM had to be available. Notably, EBNA-1 IgG is a marker of past EBV infection, VCA IgG can be found in primary and past EBV infections, and VCA IgM is a marker of primary EBV infection. Testing for EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG and VCA IgM was performed by Liaison automated quantitative CLIA using undiluted sera. Thus, the same method (Liaison CLIA) was used for testing of patients with CIS/RRMS and patients of the hospital population, with sera of patients with CIS/RRMS being measured in dilution and sera of patients from the hospital population being measured without dilution. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, in undiluted sera, EBNA-1 IgG levels < 5 U/mL were considered negative, levels between 5 and 20 U/mL were considered equivocal and levels ≥ 20 U/mL were considered positive; VCA IgG levels < 20 U/mL were considered negative and VCA IgG levels ≥ 20 U/mL were considered positive; and VCA IgM levels < 20 U/mL were considered negative, levels between 20 and 40 U/mL were considered equivocal and VCA IgM levels ≥ 40 U/mL were considered positive. Persons with EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgG and VCA IgM below the respective cut-offs were considered EBV-seronegative. Persons in whom at least one of the three antibodies, EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG or VCA IgM, was above the respective cut-offs were considered EBV-seropositive. From the age of 5 years onwards, persons were grouped in 5-year age cohorts. To analyse the EBV seroprevalence in early life in more detail, newborns and infants below 5 years of age were grouped in smaller age cohorts.

3.2 Higher EBNA‐1 Antibody Levels in Patients With MS Than in Control Patient Groups

In a proportion of PwMS and control patients with other diseases, quantitative data on serum levels of EBNA‐1 and VCA antibodies were available. As shown in Figure 3A, serum levels of EBNA‐1 antibodies were clearly higher in PwMS than in each of the 10 control patient groups (p ≤ 0.01 for all pairwise comparisons). In contrast, serum levels of antibodies to VCA did not differ in PwMS and the control patient groups (Figure 3B).

### Epstein-Barr virus associated acute hepatitis with cross-reacting antibodies to other herpes viruses in immunocompetent patients: report of two cases [^116AubjS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2013). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis (IM) which is characterized by the triad of fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. Self-limited, mild liver function test abnormalities are seen in IM. Acute hepatitis in primary EBV infection is uncommon. Serum transaminases are elevated but are less than fivefold the normal levels in most cases and rarely exceed 10 times the normal levels in primary EBV infections especially in elderly. Laboratory diagnosis of acute EBV infection is by serological assays confirming the presence of EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM antibodies. Due to antigenic cross-reactivity with Herpes viruses, serological assays lack specificity; hence specific molecular diagnostic methods are required for confirmation of the etiology. The present report describes two cases of acute hepatitis caused by infection with EBV which had indistinguishable clinical features and biochemical markers from acute hepatitis caused by hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis viruses A-E. The diagnosis of infection by EBV was confirmed by detection of EBV DNA in blood of both the patients and EBV DNA in the liver tissue of one of the patients.

Laboratory testing

Serum samples from neurological cases were collected in the acute phase, before treatment start. All samples were obtained during routine diagnostic procedures and leftover material was stored at −80°C. Serological tests for cases and controls were performed on serum (patients) or plasma (controls) samples in a centralized laboratory (Interregional Blood Transfusion SRC, Bern, Switzerland) using the enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the WANTAI HEV‐IgG ELISA, and WANTAI HEV‐IgM ELISA (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ELISA results were presented as ratios of sample optical density (OD) divided by the cut‐off OD. For both IgM and IgG antibodies OD ratios > 1.1 indicated a positive result, whereas ratios < 0.9 were classified as negative. Borderline OD ratios (0.9–1.1) were classified as positive if diagnosis was supported by positive anti‐HEV IgG antibodies.

HEV RT‐PCR was performed in serum samples of cases and controls with anti‐HEV IgM+ results and/or with increased liver enzymes, using the RealStar kit (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For CMV testing, a recent infection was defined as IgM positivity with negative IgG or IgG with low avidity. For EBV testing, recent infection was defined as viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM and IgG positivity with negative EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG.

Statistical analysis

Cases were matched with controls on the basis of sex, age (± 5 years), canton of residency, and time of blood collection (± 6 months). Prior to analysis, data were checked for accuracy of matching. Continuous data (age, results of laboratory analyses) are presented descriptively as mean, standard deviation (SD), and median. Frequency data are presented as counts and percentages, and pairwise associations between variables were computed using contingency tables and carrying out chi‐square or Fisher's exact tests, as appropriate, using Cramer's V as a measure of association. Stata Version 17 (StataCorp LCC) was used for all statistical analyses.

Ethical aspects

The study was approved by all concerned local ethics committees (File no. CE 2932). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Blood donors signed the General Consent for research for blood donors of the Blood Transfusion Services of the SRC.

The viral encephalitis panel from CSF — which included human herpesviruses types 1, 2, 6, and 7; varicella-zoster virus; EBV; cytomegalovirus; human enterovirus; human adenovirus; parvovirus B19, and human parechovirus — was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which yielded a result positive for EBV DNA. The qualitative EBV viral load in both serum and CSF were within the limits of detection (210–10,000,000 IU/mL).

### Five patients with localized facial eruptions associated with gianotti-crosti syndrome caused by primary Epstein-Barr virus infection [^114t9N4M]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Five infants exhibited an exclusively facial rash associated with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome(GCS). On all patient cheeks, multiple erythematous papules were seen symmetrically. All patients tested positive for the immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody against the Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen, suggesting that a primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection caused localized facial rash, an alternative clinical picture of GCS.

Figure 1
Endoscopic image of the oesophagus revealing multiple, linear and circular, centimetre-long ulcerations of varying depths involving the entire length of the oesophagus (A). Representative biopsy (H&E) from the oesophageal mucosa (B) presenting with ulcerated surface and granulation tissue, but without granulomas or morphological signs of fungi or viral infection. Immunohistochemical staining for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (C) revealing several positive cells (brown) and with subsequent PCR analysis confirming presence of EBV with a quantitative detection of 13 virus particles/µL.

At follow-up 2 weeks after discharge, the patient was feeling well and with normal routine laboratory tests including normalisation of INR. He described that the symptoms of heartburn and epigastric pain had rapidly subsided following discharge with a total symptom duration of 8 days after which he had stopped taking any medicine. Due to a faecal calprotectin level of 285 µg/g, MRI was carried out to rule out Crohn's disease, and revealing normal appearance of the small and large bowel. The patient declined repeat gastroscopy or colonoscopy because he was feeling well. Virus serology detected borderline-positive EBV viral capsid antibodies (VCA) IgM, positive EBV VCA IgG, and positive nuclear antibodies (EBV nuclear antigen; EBNA) IgG. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus were IgG positive and IgM negative, and testings for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and HIV were negative. Thus, serological testings raised suspicion of primary infection with EBV as underlying cause. The biopsies were re-evaluated and found to be positive for EBV by specific EBV immunohistochemical staining (figure 1c). PCR confirmed infection with EBV with a quantitative detection of 13 virus particles/µL. Immunohistochemical stainings for CMV and HSV were negative.

Repeat serology 5 months after discharge showed similar results including borderline-positive EBV VCA IgM and positive EBV VCA IgG and EBNA IgG. However, complete seroconversion had occurred at retesting 9 months after presentation with negative EBV VCA IgM and positive EBV VCA IgG and EBNA IgG, thus confirming that the underlying cause of severe ulcerative oesophagitis had been primary EBV infection.

IDSA serologic testing — limited potential uses and test types: The panel identified very few clinical scenarios in which serologic testing may be useful, including assisting in the diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) and using a negative spike antibody test to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy or to prioritize monoclonal therapies when supplies are limited. When antibody testing is done, the panel makes a weak recommendation for using SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies and against using IgM; IgA tests were not considered because of past poor performance and rare testing in clinical laboratories.

### Retrospective in silico analysis of routine laboratory data supports a specific association of Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis [^112GS3yn]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

We conducted a retrospective in silico analysis of routine laboratory data (RISAROLDA) to study the association of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

Patients with MS and 10 different inflammatory/neoplastic diseases were identified by ICD10 codes. Results of routine laboratory testing for antibodies to EBV, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus and cytomegalovirus were extracted using a digital tool.

Results

Among 10,669 patients with MS and 42,222 controls, EBV serologies were available from 492 (4.6%) patients with MS and 1918 (4.5%) controls. While all but three patients with an ICD10 diagnosis of MS were EBV seropositive, closer inspection of the three EBV seronegative patients revealed they were misdiagnosed with MS, resulting in a 100% EBV seroprevalence in the remaining 489 patients with MS. In contrast, EBV seroprevalences were lower in all other diseases (78.6%–97.8%). Serum antibodies to the Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen‐1, but not to the viral capsid antigen, were higher in patients with MS than in all other diseases. In patients with MS, seroprevalences of all other common viruses were lower than those of EBV, but the frequency of intrathecal production of antibodies to EBV was lower than that of other common viruses.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that the association of EBV and MS is specific for MS as compared to various other inflammatory/neoplastic diseases and that a negative EBV serology might be a marker for the absence of MS. RISAROLDA is a powerful approach for the screening of real‐world laboratory data.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^115tnwmD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 serologic testing — assay selection, timing, and indications are summarized as follows: Wherever possible, serologic assays with established high sensitivity and specificity (eg, ≥ 99.5%) should be employed. IgG, IgG/IgM, and total antibody tests appear to have better sensitivity and specificity than other immunoglobulin classes and perform best when used between 3 to 5 weeks after symptom onset; testing should not be done during the first 2 weeks of symptoms because antibody production is often not detectable until week 3 or later, and few data are available after 8 weeks of symptoms. IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibody assays are suggested over an IgM assay. The clinical indications for antibody testing to support a diagnosis of COVID-19 are limited, and the panel identified only 1 clinical situation in which antibody testing is recommended: to assist with the diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A negative spike antibody test may be a useful metric to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy or to prioritize administration of monoclonal therapies when supplies are limited. The current high seroprevalence of anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies reduces the value of antibody testing for epidemiologic purposes, and although higher antibody titers and presence of neutralizing antibodies correlate with reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a correlate of immune protection from infection has not been defined.

### Granulomatous hepatitis in a healthy adult after Bacillus calmette-Guérin injection into a plantar wart [^1117zgY3]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Viral laboratory tests were performed to check for acute hepatitis. The patient's blood tested negative for hepatitis A virus IgM, negative for hepatitis A virus IgG, negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, positive for hepatitis B surface antibody, negative for hepatitis C virus antibody, negative for cytomegalovirus IgM, positive for cytomegalovirus IgG, negative for Epstein–Barr virus capsid IgM, positive for Epstein–Barr virus capsid IgG, and negative for HIV. Blood culture tests yielded negative findings.

A computed tomography scan of the abdomen indicated acute hepatitis with a minimal amount of ascites in the pelvic cavity and a contracted gall bladder with an edematous wall. The patient claimed to have received a BCG vaccine immediately after birth and had a BCG vaccination scar on her left upper arm. The tuberculin test showed positive results with a 12 × 10 mm induration, but the interferon-gamma release assay yielded negative findings. A liver biopsy specimen was obtained and a culture test was performed to confirm hematogenous dissemination, and the histologic findings suggested granulomatous inflammation without caseous necrosis. However, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were not detected and eosinophil infiltration was observed in the surrounding tissues (Fig 1).

### EBV associated epiglottitis in an immunocompetent child [^1116GShw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the presence of stridor, suprasternal retraction, odynophagia, dysphagia, asymmetrical cervical lymphadenopathy, and bilateral and equally clear breath sounds, we suspected an upper airway obstruction. Common infections that can affect the airway include croup, bacterial tracheitis, retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscesses, infectious mononucleosis, and epiglottitis.

The patient's age, cough, stridor, and respiratory distress initially suggested croup as a diagnosis; however, the absence of a barking cough and the presence of odynophagia, and dysphagia contradicted this diagnosis. Furthermore, bacterial tracheitis was considered unlikely due to the lack of high fever, toxicity, purulent airway secretions, and the presence of dysphagia.

Retropharyngeal and peritonsillar abscesses were considered for the patient due to stridor, respiratory distress, cervical lymphadenopathy, and dysphagia. Although primary EBV infection is clinically silent in the majority of cases in infants and young children, the location of the lymphadenopathy, which was in the submandibular region, led to its inclusion in differential diagnoses. Moreover, based on the stridor, fever, hoarse voice, and dysphagia, epiglottitis was also an important differential diagnosis.

Laboratory and radiographic findings included a complete blood count test significant for a white blood cell count of 13,300 (with neutrophils at 83%) and a platelet count of 87,000". Atypical lymphocytes were noted on the peripheral smear (40% of total lymphocytes). Blood culture was negative, and EBV serology (IgM antibody against viral capsid antigen) confirmed acute infection with high titer. The diagnosis of epiglottitis in our patient was confirmed by the presence of an enlarged epiglottis (the 'thumb sign') on lateral neck radiography (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Lateral neck radiograph showing a markedly enlarged epiglottis (red arrow), commonly referred to as the "thumb sign"

The otolaryngology (ENT) team was consulted for the evaluation of a possible retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast of the neck revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and epiglottitis, but no retropharyngeal or peritonsillar abscess formation (Fig. 2).

### Anti-JC virus antibody levels in serum or plasma further define risk of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [^115bUQ1y]. Annals of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current analysis has extended our prior observations to show that in anti-JCV antibody–positive natalizumab-treated patients, higher levels of serum or plasma anti-JCV antibodies, as measured by anti-JCV antibody index, are associated with higher PML risk. Persistently higher antibody levels have previously been shown in subjects with increased viral burden to other viruses. Higher anti-BKV VP1 antibody levels have been reported in individuals with higher BKV replication and in those with virus reactivation from latency. Similarly, an association between MC polyomavirus load and capsid-specific MCV antibody titers in MC carcinoma patients, between Epstein–Barr virus load and antiviral capsid or anti-ZEBRA immunoglobulin G titer in Hodgkin lymphoma patients, and between anti–viral capsid antigen titers and viral load in human immunodeficiency virus–infected subjects has been demonstrated.–Furthermore, increased viral replication has been linked to the frequent emergence of polyomavirus variants with rearrangement of the archetype noncoding control region,–and human leukocyte antigen genotypes and host genetics have been implicated along with immune modulation in the resultant increase in viral burden.

### DNA ligase IV dificiency with elevated serum IgG levels suspected to have myelodysplastic syndrome: a case report [^111NebkG]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior to gamma globulin infusion, immunoglobulin test results revealed an elevated IgG level (18.7 g/L, 4.7–12.3), but normal IgA and IgM values. Upon re-checking 2 months later, IgG was still elevated (22.1 g/L, 4.7–12.3), whereas IgG4 protein quantification was normal (0.477 g/L，0.08–1.4). Lymphocyte immunophenotyping was performed twice, which showed that the counts of T lymphocytes and especially CD4 + T cells were significantly diminished (Table 1. The patient's immune function test results). The twice test was performed after corticosteroid treatment.

Table 1
The patient's immune function test results

The aetiology antibody testing included testing for rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, herpes simplex virus, human parvovirus B19, and Epstein-Barr virus. This patient was found to be positive for rubella virus antibody IgG and IgM and cytomegalovirus antibody CMV-IgG, whereas he was negative for the other viral IgG and IgM antibodies.

Based on the serological findings, rubella virus was diagnosed. We performed an ophthalmic fundus examination and found that rubella virus retinal vasculitis was visible in both eyes. The manifestations were as follows: no obvious opacity of the lens was observed, and the optic disc was clearly demarcated, orange in colour, without obvious bulge, and had a C/D ratio of approximately 0.3. The colour of retina was relatively dark; white punctate exudation foci were scattered at many places, and no obvious haemorrhage was observed. The retinal artery was small and slightly tonic, with a visible white sheath wrapping on the lateral side of some arteries and foveal reflex. The 30-cm red globe test was positive upon visual screening. Manifestations related to rubella virus infection of the patient included microcephaly, low body weight, and polydactyly, but his intellectual, behavioural, and motor development were normal.

### Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia associated with epstein barr virus infection as a severe late complication after kidney transplantation and successful treatment with rituximab: case report [^112Y5wYC]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) is an immune disease characterised by antibodies directed against autologous red blood cells (RBCs). Typically patients exhibit anaemia with reticulocytosis, spherocytes and polychromasia on the blood film with a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) which is the hallmark, in addition there is often increased unconjugated serum bilirubin and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The antibodies can be subdivided into "warm" or "cold" agglutinins depending on the thermal range of activity and the subsequent anaemia can be profound and life threatening leading to large transfusion requirements. The aetiology is unknown, categorised either as primary (idiopathic) or secondary when associated with malignancy (in particular chronic lymphocytic leukaemia), connective tissue and inflammatory diseases, infections (both viral and mycoplasma associated with a cold AIHA), or drugs (e.g. purine analogues and alkylating agents). Alloantibody can also lead to haemolysis post haematopoietic stem cell transplant, solid organ transplant (i.e. passenger B lymphocyte syndrome), pregnancy and after transfusion.

Epstein-Barr virus is one of the eight human herpes viruses, and common in humans. In the United States, by the age of 40 as many as 95% of adults have been infected with EBV. Infants (after maternal antibody protection has disappeared) and children have asymptomatic or mild disease. In adolescence or young adults, EBV causes infectious mononucleosis in up to 50%. Symptoms of infectious mononucleosis are commonly fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy and are almost never fatal. EBV then establishes a lifelong dormant infection in B cells. It is a carcinogenic virus associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. After transplantation EBV disease can present with varied manifestations, including nonspecific febrile illness, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, mimicking other viral infections, and most seriously post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). It remains unclear why EBV causes autoimmune disease. IgM antibodies to autoantigens are normally present in the plasma at low non-pathologic titre. It has been suggested that the B-cell clones that normally produce these autoantibodies are altered to produce IgG antibodies in high and pathogenic levels in AIHA. Alternatively, defective control of IgG auto reactivity by autologous IgM or altered T-cell function has been proposed.

AIHA after solid organ transplantation has been reported infrequently and usually occurs early in the course. In this report, we describe a severe and late presentation in the context of donor associated EBV viraemia, the treatment and use of novel therapy.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: serologic testing [^116XHxPK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody types and kinetics — diagnostic considerations note that there are 2 general types of antibodies, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and nonneutralizing (binding) antibodies, and commercially available anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests can measure single immunoglobulin classes (IgM, IgG, or IgA) or total antibody and differentiate nAbs from binding antibodies. IgM antibodies are typically produced first after infection and are used as a measure of recent infection, whereas IgG antibodies generally develop later than IgM antibodies and remain elevated for months to years after infection. Although IgM antibodies can be detected within the first 2 weeks of symptoms in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection appears unusual in that IgM and IgG more commonly rise together, more than 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

Detection of Epstein-Barr Virus-Specific Immunoglobulin G Antibodies

Immunoglobulin G antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) were detected in plasma using a commercial ELISA kit (Diagnostic Automation, Woodland Hills, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay to Detect Immunoglobulin G Specific to Vaccine Antigens

In an in-house ELISA, tetanus toxoid (TT) or diphtheria toxoid (DT) (both National Institute for Biological Standards and Control [NIBSC] were tested, Potters bar, UK) (Supplementary Methods 1E). Optical density was measured (without acid stopping the reaction) after 10 minutes using an ELISA plate reader (Biotek, Cheshire, UK) set at 405 nm and SoftMax Pro software.

Multiplexed Opsonophagocytosis Killing Assay and Serotype-Specific Immunoglobulin G

Immunoglobulin G serum concentrations specific for the 13 pneumococcal vaccine serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6 A, 6B, 7F, 9 V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were measured using an ELISA (described in Supplementary Methods 1F).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis and graphical presentation were performed using Prism 7/8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and Python (Python Software Foundation) was used to calculate summary statistics. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous and Fisher's exact tests or χ 2 for discrete variables. The ELISpot data were reported as subtracted 2× background. Serotype-specific opsonophagocytic indexes (OPIs) were reported using geometric means and 95% confidence intervals. The OPIs were classified as being positive or negative based on the current recommended cutoff value of < 8 (negative) and ≥ 8 (positive). Results are reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) as stated.

### Antibody responses to recombinant Epstein-Barr virus antigens in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients: complementary test of ZEBRA protein and early antigens p54 and p138 [^111FeCnZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Serological tests based on the antibodies directed against the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EA) and viral capsid antigen (VCA), which have been recognized as tumor markers for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), are routinely used to help in the diagnosis of this malignancy. The detection of these antibodies reveals very low titers, found only in a small proportion of young compared with older NPC patients. This is a problem for the diagnosis of NPC, especially among Maghrebians, among whom young people are also affected, and emphasizes the necessity to search for more reliable markers. The present study reports results of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA responses of NPC patients to recombinant EA antigens p54 (BMRF1) and p138 (BALF2), VCA complex antigens p18 (BFRF3) and p23 (BLRF2), and EBNA antigen p72 (BKRF1). Our results show that IgA-EA-p54 and -p138 (IgA-EA-p54+138) antibodies have a diagnostic value for detection of NPC (70%), compared with IgA-VCA-p18+23 and IgA-EBNA-p72, which have limited diagnostic value, especially in young patients. It is also noteworthy that IgA-EA-p54+138 can detect a high percentage (64%) of NPC cases negative by immunofluorescence. These results, however, clearly show that a single test cannot achieve the objective of detecting all NPC patients, and it seems advisable to combine different tests for the diagnosis of NPC. The combination of IgG-ZEBRA with IgA-EA-p54+138 improved the sensitivity of detection of NPC to 95% in the overall NPC population. The use of IgA-EA-p54+138 in combination with IgG-ZEBRA will facilitate detailed studies on the pattern of antibody response, which may result in the development of useful serological markers to guide the treatment of NPC.

### Transient elevation of triiodothyronine caused by triiodothyronine autoantibody associated with acute epstein-barr-virus infection [^113TvKpm]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

A unique 16-year old female patient presented after acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with severe primary hypothyroidism. Her thyroid test results were thyrotropin level (TSH) of 198 mU/L (normal, 0.4–4 mU/L), free thyroxine [FT(4)], 2.5 pmol/L (normal, 10–25 pmol/L), total triiodothyronine (TT(3)) > 19.5 nmol/L (normal, 1.3–2.7 nmol/L), and free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), 0.77 pmol/L (normal, 3.3–6.3 pmol/L). She had high titers of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies. In vitro triiodothyronine (T(3))-binding measured by radioimmunoprecipitation was 86% (normal, up to 8.5%) and thyroxine (T(4))-binding 8.2% (normal, 6.4%). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) absorption, achieved by protein-G Sepharose beads, decreased TT(3) toward normal. Levothyroxine treatment normalized the low baseline FT(4) and FT(3) values, and suppressed TSH to normal. However, TT(3) remained highly elevated and returned to normal after 20 months, while T(3)binding gradually decreased. Thus, her severe hypothyroidism was masked by this unusual phenomenon. Thirty-four patients with EBV infection (15 with acute disease and 19 with previous infection) were tested for thyroid hormone levels. EBV antibodies (early antigen immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG and anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen [EBNA] IgG) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In 15 patients with acute EBV the mean TT(3) level was 2.47 ± 0.39 nmol/L (5 had TT(3) values above normal) compared to a mean TT(3) of 1.70 ± 0.53 nmol/L in 19 subjects with previous infection (p < 0.0005; only 1 had a TT(3) result above normal), with no differences in FT(4) and TSH concentrations between the two groups. Acute EBV infection may be associated with transient mild to severe TT(3) elevation as a result of assay interference by anti-T(3) autoantibodies.

The Patient

We report a 41-year-old patient in France with isolated episodes of ≈1-month duration of fatigue since the end of September 2005. Analysis of a serum sample obtained from the patient on day 1 of consultation (October 21, 2005) showed markedly increased liver enzyme levels (aspartate aminotransferase 393 IU/L, alanine aminotranferase 1,211 IU/L), although no associated cholestatic biochemical symptoms were present. The patient lived alone in an urban area, had not traveled abroad for at least 1 year, drank alcoholic beverages only occasionally, and had not recently received any intravenous injections or taken any drugs. Test results were negative for serologic markers of hepatitis A, B, and C, and tests for Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus detected immunoglobulin G (IgG) for previous infections. Antibodies to HEV were detected in his serum sample by using an enzyme immunoassay (HEV ELISA; Genelabs Diagnostics, St Ingbert, Germany). A positive result (optical density/cutoff value > 1) was obtained for HEV-specific IgM (absorbance 8.9); HEV-specific IgG was not detected (optical density/cutoff value < 1).

Serum samples were tested for antibodies against a panel of pathogens, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, S. paratyphi A and B, Epstein-Barr virus, Brucella spp. Coxiella burnetti, hantavirus, Rickettsia (spotted fever and scrub typhus groups), West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Leptospira spp. All serologic test results were negative except for the test result for hantavirus. To corroborate hospital laboratory diagnostics, serum samples were also tested in a private laboratory in Germany by using Western blot assay (recomBlot Bunyavirus immunoglobulin [Ig]G/IgM; Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany) and immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay (Progen, Heidelberg, Germany). Results from the Western blot assay were negative for Puumala IgG and positive for Hantaan IgG and Dobrava IgM. The IFA result for Hantaan antibodies was positive at a reciprocal titer > 2,048. The Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 in Egypt conducted a hantavirus IgM ELISA (Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) on paired serum samples (acute-phase sample positive:negative ratio = 8.42; convalescent phase = 7.815, cut-off 1.10). Results of blood and Leptospira spp. cultures were negative. A renal biospy specimen obtained 10 days after disease onset showed acute tubular necrosis with mild-grade arteriolosclerosis (Figure).

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^116FPSyT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis — serologic testing strategy and interpretation emphasize enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and cautious reading of isolated IgM. Serologic tests for anticoccidioidal antibodies are generally available in the United States and nearly all infections are identified by their use; EIAs for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) are commercially available, and past studies suggested that EIA tests are approximately twice as sensitive in detecting early infection as standard immunodiffusion-based IDTP or IDCF tests. For this reason, most patients entering a healthcare system should be screened by EIA, though sensitivities and specificities vary by test kit brand and laboratory. Most sera that are positive by either IDTP or IDCF will also be positive by EIAs, but EIA-positive sera are not always confirmed by the standard tests, and a positive EIA IgM test when it is the only positive serologic result is the least compelling diagnostic evidence and may be a false-positive finding. Repeated testing for anticoccidioidal antibodies over subsequent weeks often resolves discrepancies and improves diagnostic certainty. Any positive serologic result is usually associated with a recent or active infection and, in most patients, these tests return to negative as the infection resolves, yet an important limitation is that tests may be negative and even persistently negative despite an early coccidioidal infection being present.

### Antibody responses to Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) and expression of LMP1 in juvenile Hodgkin's disease [^1179iASX]. Journal of Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

A large group of juvenile Hodgkin's disease patients (n = 242, mean age 11.7 years, 75% [n = 181] seropositive) was evaluated for anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody responses and the presence of EBV-encoded EBER-RNA and latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1)-protein expression in the tumor. The molecular diversity of anti-EBV antibody responses in Hodgkin's disease patients with EBV-positive and-negative tumors was studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot. Using purified recombinant LMP1 protein as antigen, the presence of antibodies to LMP1 was related to expression of LMP1 in the tumor cells and specific EBV-serological patterns. Antibodies to LMP1 were detected in 30% of the EBV-seropositive Hodgkin's disease patients. The presence of antibodies to LMP1 was not associated with a distinct anti-EBV antibody diversity profile (ELISA), but a significantly higher percentage of patients with antibodies to LMP1 had antibodies to ZEBRA and viral capsid antigen (VCA)-p18 (Immunoblot). Significantly more patients with an EBV-positive tumor had detectable antibody responses to LMP1, but the presence of antibodies to LMP1 did not reflect the expression of LMP1 protein in the tumor cells. Interestingly, all patients with the strongest antibody responses to LMP1 had EBV-negative tumors, suggesting immunological selection in vivo.

Case 1

The patient was a 30-year-old woman who was admitted to our institution due to a 3-week history of intermittent vaginal bleeding. She had a medical history of hypertension for 2 years and regular menses (gravida 0 para 0). On admission, her blood pressure was 149/86 mmHg, her heart rate was 125 beats/min, and her temperature was 38.1 °C. A physical examination revealed moderate pitting edema in both lower limbs. A routine blood test performed in a nearby hospital 4 days before admission showed leukocytosis, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia (Table 1). Laboratory investigations in our hospital revealed the following: C-reactive protein (CRP): > 200 mg/L; hyperplastic anemia (41 g/L); blood urea nitrogen: 39.21 mmol/L; creatinine: 624 μmol/L (7.06 mg/dL); hypoalbuminemia (25.4 g/L); alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 332 U/L; gamma glutamyltransferase: 501 U/L; uric acid: 968 μmol/L; transaminase: normal; fibrinogen: 750 mg/dL; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT): 70.3 s; plasma correcting test: 37.3 s of immediate APTT and 48.5 s of incubated APTT; autoantibodies [antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, anticardiolipin antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, etc.]: negative; immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, and IgM): normal; β2 microglobulin: > 8 mg/L (1.00–3.00); M protein: negative; complement 3 and 4: decreased; direct antiglobulin test (DAT): 3+; and procalcitonin: 43.63 ng/ml. Broken red blood cells were not observed on the blood smear. The blood culture, G/GM test and viral detection (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B-19, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, HIV, etc.) test were negative. The urinary sediment examination showed the following: urinary protein: 1+; occult blood: 2+, and hematuria: 56/μl. The 24-h urinary protein level was not checked because of oliguria. Ultrasound scans of the urinary and gynecological systems were normal. Plain computed tomography revealed a small amount of polyserositis and lymphadenopathy in multiple nodes but no evidence of malignant solid tumors or signs of infection. Bone marrow aspiration showed bone marrow hyperplasia, and immunohistochemistry was normal. 18 FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed that glucose analog 2-(18 F)fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose activity was increased in the mediastinal, paraaortic, bilateral neck, bilateral axillary, and bilateral inguinal lymph nodes (SUVmax: 5.2). The largest node measured approximately 2.7 cmx1.2 cm, and hepatosplenomegaly with increased FDG activity was observed in the spleen (SUVmax: 5.2).

Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in young children is usually a self-limiting condition, but in adolescents, it can cause clinical symptoms typical of infectious mononucleosis (IM) with fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and fatigue. Nodular changes in the lungs are rare and raise suspicion of other conditions, including autoimmune diseases.

Objectives: We present a case of a patient with EBV infection and nodular changes in the lungs, the differential diagnosis, and the outcome.

Methods: A 13-year-old boy was admitted to the Clinical Hospital Center Sestre Milosrdnice, Department of Pediatrics with a cough, sore throat, and fatigue without fever. Anemia, lymphocytosis with reactive lymphocytes, slightly elevated inflammatory parameters, and elevated liver enzymes were observed. Clinical findings included a hyperemic pharynx, tonsils covered with fibrin, normal auscultation, and palpatory mild spleen enlargement. A chest radiogram showed two lung nodules in the right lung, and azithromycin was introduced. Despite antimicrobial therapy, repeated laboratory findings showed elevated inflammatory parameters, transaminases, and lymphocytosis. Due to persistent changes in the lungs, a CT scan of the chest was performed, which showed 5 nodular lesions in addition to mild splenomegaly.

Results: Differential diagnoses of our patient with nonspecific symptoms and nodular changes in the lungs included various infections and other conditions like neoplasms and autoimmune diseases. Malignant disease was ruled out by a hematological workup. Due to the positive finding of extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) patient was screened for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, SLE and Sjögren syndrome and all results came up negative. In the meantime. An acute EBV infection was confirmed by a serological test, and in consultation with an infectious disease specialist, symptomatic treatment and regular follow-up by a hemato-oncologist and a rheumatologist were agreed. CT performed after 6 months showed complete regression of the changes with normal laboratory findings including immunological panel and clinical status.

Conclusion: Multiple pulmonary lung lesions as part of EBV infection in immunocompetent patients are extremely rare. The probable pathophysiological mechanism is an immune-mediated reaction, the therapeutic approach is conservative, but monitoring is necessary due to the documented link between EBV infection and autoimmune disease development, SLE being one of them.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to immunoassays, BCSH 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain an antigen assay of high sensitivity in non-expert laboratories. Measure only the IgG class. Report actual optical density, degree of inhibition by high dose heparin, and the cut-off point for a positive test rather than simply the test as positive or negative.

### Umbilicated papules in an immunocompetent patient [^113tBsVh]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is the best test to diagnose this condition?
A. Patch testing
B. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M/IgG serologic assay
C. Viral culture
D. Biopsy with histopathology
E. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

Answers:

A. Patch testing – Incorrect. Patch testing is the diagnostic criterion standard for allergic contact dermatitis, not EH.PCR would be better for identifying the viral DNA in EH.
B. IgM/IgG serologic assay – Incorrect. Serologic assays for IgG and IgM antibodies to HSV identify only exposure to HSV infection and are not useful diagnostically. Serologic assay is the test of choice when no lesions are active and HSV infection status needs to be determined. PCR is the diagnostic test of choice during an active infection.
C. Viral culture – Incorrect. Although viral culture is highly available, is highly specific, can identify active HSV infection, and can indicate type of HSV, it takes several days to receive test results, and the test has high false negative rates. Because EH is potentially life threatening, a more rapid diagnostic test would be the better choice.
D. Biopsy with histopathology – Incorrect. Multinucleate giant cells on histopathology are characteristic of EH (Fig 2), but this is not required. This is not the best diagnostic test for EH because it is time consuming and nonspecific.
E. PCR – Correct. PCR for HSV viral DNA is the best answer choice for confirming the diagnosis of EH in terms of sensitivity (> 95%, vs 50%-75% with viral culture), efficiency, and cost effectiveness.PCR allows for diagnostic results within a few hours, permitting the necessary immediate management of EH.HSV-1 PCR result was positive from a swab of this patient's lesions.

(B) These areas are EBV/EBER negative (om ×25). (B, D, F) Reactive areas contain EBV + B cells (EBER; B, om ×25; and inset B′, om ×400) and polyclonal plasma cells (D, om ×400; F, om ×400).

Figure 2.
Histopathology of an EMP infiltrating the tonsil (patient 3). (A-B) An interfollicular expansion of CD20 – (original magnification [om] ×25) (A) and IgA + plasma cells (om ×25) (B) is seen. CD20 highlights B-cell follicles, which are in part attenuated. (C-D) Interfollicular areas contain sheets of mature plasma cells (hematoxylin and eosin; C, om ×100; D, om ×400). (E-F) The plasma cells are monotypic and express κ (om ×400) (E) but remain negative for λ light chain (om ×400) (F).

Plasma cells expressed either light chain κ (6/13) or λ (7/13). Heavy chains expressed by the plasma cells were mostly IgA (11/13) and, less frequently, IgG (2/13). Patient 9 presented with multifocal bilateral involvement of the tonsils, predominately composed of IgG λ + plasma cells. Interestingly, in this patient, a separated minor area with IgA λ + plasma cells was detectable. The amyloid observed in one was identified as κ light chain amyloid, the same light chain as expressed by the EMP (patient 7; Figure 1). EBV/EBER was negative in all cases tested (12/12). One of 2 EMP with positive serology for EBV-IgM displayed peritumoral EBV + cells, whereas the plasma cells themselves were EBER negative (patient 6; Figure 3). EMP did not express CD56 (0/10) or cyclin D1 (0/12). Ki67 was low to moderate (5%-40%). In 3 EMPs, small foci with higher proliferation were observed and were associated with CD20 reactivity in plasma cells.

### Human immunoglobulin g (Asceniv) [^11469jSd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Transmissible Infectious Agents

Because ASCENIV is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.

All infections suspected by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to ADMA Biologics at (1–800–458–4244). Before prescribing ASCENIV, the physician should discuss the risks and benefits of its use with the patient (see Patient Counseling Information [17]).

5.9 Monitoring Laboratory Tests

Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients at increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of ASCENIV and at appropriate intervals thereafter.
Because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis with IGIV treatment, consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies.
If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after an infusion of ASCENIV, perform appropriate laboratory testing for confirmation.
If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient's serum.

5.10 Interference with Laboratory Tests

After infusion of immunoglobulin, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g. A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') test.

### Presumed toxoplasmic central retinal artery occlusion and multifocal retinitis with perivascular sheathing [^113zuFEe]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Case report

The patient was an 83-year-old Japanese man who had been suffering from visual loss and a history of floaters in the left eye from 3 weeks before. He was diagnosed with iritis with mild vitreous haze in the left eye and was initially treated with dexamethasone sodium phosphate eye drops. He was referred to our hospital for increased vitreous haze with the presence of retinal white exudates. He was immunocompetent and had no underlying systemic diseases.

On presentation, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.9 OD and 0.2 OS. There was a left relative afferent pupillary defect. The patient had 1+ cell and 1+ flare in the anterior chamber and 3+ cells with trace haze in the vitreous of the left eye. Funduscopic examination of the left eye showed a swollen optic disc and sheathing of the retinal artery with a dense vitreous haze and a white retinal lesion. The right eye appeared normal. Serum anti-toxoplasma antibodies were positive in a latex agglutination assay (1:640) and toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies were positive in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (176 IU/mL). Other serologic test results, including those for anti-toxoplasma IgM antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and viral antibodies such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and Cytomegalovirus, were within normal limits. Testing of viral DNA in the anterior chamber gave negative results for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) diagnostic testing in suspected end-organ disease — CMV viremia can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen assays, or culture and is usually, but not invariably, present in end-organ disease, and viremia detected by these assays can be present in disease-free patients with low CD4 cell counts. Blood tests to detect CMV by antigen detection, culture, or PCR are not recommended for diagnosis of CMV end-organ disease because of their poor positive predictive value, and a negative serum or plasma PCR assay also does not rule out CMV end-organ disease. In CMV retinitis, CMV DNA can be detected in the vitreous in around 80% of cases but in only 70% in the blood, and CMV PCR can be particularly useful in assessing CSF or vitreous or aqueous humor specimens; a positive result is highly suggestive that CMV is the cause of end-organ disease, although PCR assays are not standardized and sensitivity, specificity, and interassay comparability are not clearly delineated. Presence of serum antibodies to CMV is not diagnostically useful, although a negative immunoglobulin G antibody level indicates that CMV is unlikely to be the cause of the disease process. CMV retinitis usually is diagnosed based on characteristic retinal changes seen through a dilated pupil during an ophthalmoscopic examination performed by an experienced ophthalmologist, and diagnosis in that setting has a 95% positive predictive value.

### Incidence of serum antibody titers against varicella zoster virus in Japanese patients with herpes zoster [^114VjjJ6]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster is an internal reactivation of varicella zoster virus following establishment of latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia during primary infection, which presents as chickenpox. Therefore, serologically, herpes zoster patients already have anti-varicella zoster virus immunoglobulin G at the onset of disease. Hence, positive serum antibody does not confirm the diagnosis of herpes zoster. We retrospectively investigated the incidence of varicella zoster virus-specific complement fixation in 865 zoster patients at initial presentation to a dermatology clinic. As a result, 66% of patients showed negative complement fixation, with patient numbers decreasing as titer increased. Paired complement fixation tests conducted within a short period showed a marked elevation in titer, and complement fixation titer gradually decreased after a year. Furthermore, incidence showed no correlation with patient age. These observations indicate that the complement fixation titer at first visit is mainly influenced by the duration from onset to presentation at clinic. Our findings indicate that a positive complement fixation result by single-point testing confirms at least recent onset of herpes zoster, while paired tests can confirm disease when primary tests are negative.

Coccidioidomycosis serologic testing — EIA screening and confirmatory assays: Most commonly, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is based on a positive coccidioidal serological test and a compatible clinical syndrome. For suspected active disease, screening with an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is recommended to detect the possibility of active disease, but these tests are very sensitive and occasionally associated with false positive results, particularly for IgM; if either EIA test is positive, antibody assays by immunodiffusion (ID) and by complement fixation (CF) should be obtained to confirm the result and be used for further follow-up (AI). Repeat testing every 1 to 2 weeks should be considered if the patient is ill and the diagnosis has not been established, and patients with past coccidioidal infection and without disease activity usually revert to negative serological tests over 1 to 2 years. A lateral flow assay has become available, but it is far less sensitive than EIA, and CF has been particularly useful in cerebrospinal fluid.

### Lymphadenopathy at the crossroad between immunodeficiency and autoinflammation: an intriguing challenge [^117Q81Y4]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathies can be part of the clinical spectrum of several primary immunodeficiencies, including diseases with immune dysregulation and autoinflammatory disorders, as the clinical expression of benign polyclonal lymphoproliferation, granulomatous disease or lymphoid malignancy. Lymphadenopathy poses a significant diagnostic dilemma when it represents the first sign of a disorder of the immune system, leading to a consequently delayed diagnosis. Additionally, the finding of lymphadenopathy in a patient with diagnosed immunodeficiency raises the question of the differential diagnosis between benign lymphoproliferation and malignancies. Lymphadenopathies are evidenced in 15–20% of the patients with common variable immunodeficiency, while in other antibody deficiencies the prevalence is lower. They are also evidenced in different combined immunodeficiency disorders, including Omenn syndrome, which presents in the first months of life. Interestingly, in the activated phosphoinositide 3‐kinase delta syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)‐related lymphoproliferative disorders and regulatory T cell disorders, lymphadenopathy is one of the leading signs of the entire clinical picture. Among autoinflammatory diseases, the highest prevalence of lymphadenopathies is observed in patients with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) and hyper‐immunoglobulin (Ig)D syndrome. The mechanisms underlying lymphoproliferation in the different disorders of the immune system are multiple and not completely elucidated. The advances in genetic techniques provide the opportunity of identifying new monogenic disorders, allowing genotype–phenotype correlations to be made and to provide adequate follow‐up and treatment in the single diseases. In this work, we provide an overview of the most relevant immune disorders associated with lymphadenopathy, focusing on their diagnostic and prognostic implications.

### Neuroinvasion by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [^1135BnkG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old, previously healthy man had fever, pain in the extremities, nasal discharge, and cough with nonpurulent sputum. He sought clinical care 1 week after onset of illness because of his deteriorating general state, including a headache and paresthesias in both hands. Bilateral basal pneumonia was diagnosed and treated with clarithromycin. During the ensuing 4 days, a rapidly ascending polyradiculoneuropathy resulted in tetraparesis, followed by facial palsy, ophthalmoplegia, and then paralysis of all cranial nerves. The initially fully alert patient became comatose, and assisted respiration was necessary.

On day 9 of the patient's illness, an ELISA (Genzyme Diagnostics Virotech, Rüsselsheim, Germany) was performed on serum samples and showed a Mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody titer of 28.2 Virotech-units/mL (VE) (cut-off 9.0–11.0) and an IgM antibody titer of 20.9 VE (cut-off 9.0–11.0). A PCR for M. pneumoniae was positive in tracheobronchial secretions on day 12, and complement fixation test (antigen purchased from Virion CH-8803 Rüschlikon, Zürich, Switzerland) showed M. pneumoniae antibody titers of 1,280 (serum) and 4 (cerebrospinal fluid) on day 16.

Serologic tests for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, measles virus, mumps virus, spring-summer encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella spp. Legionella spp. Treponema pallidum, and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. No herpes simplex virus 1 or 2 was detected by PCR in cerebrospinal fluid, and PCR results were also negative for Chlamydia pneumoniae in tracheobronchial secretions.

On day 8, cerebrospinal fluid examinations showed a total cell count of 43/mm 3 (89% granulocytes and 11% mononuclear cells), total protein 1.3 g/L, and glucose 4.3 mmol/L. On day 15, when the patient was comatose, a total cell count of 794/mm 3 (84% granulocytes and 16% mononuclear cells), total protein 4.6 g/L, and glucose 1.5 mmol/L. Blood values showed leucocytosis with neutrophilia and mild thrombocytosis of 480 g/L.

Sequencing

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples with a QIAamp kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genotyping of the RNF213 p.R4810K variant was determined by Sanger sequencing as described previously. Patients with p.R4810K heterozygous G/A or homozygous A/A variant were defined as RNF213 variant carriers. Patients with wild‐type homozygotes (G/G) were considered as noncarriers.

Measurement of Infectious Virus Antibodies andScore Calculation

Infectious disease serologies against 6 pathogens in baseline blood samples were evaluated using enzyme‐linked immunoassay. Antibody titers and positive/negative status were measured for 7 antibodies: herpes simplex virus‐1, herpes simplex virus‐2, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, rubella virus, Epstein‐Barr virus capsid antigen, and Epstein‐Barr nuclear antigen. Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG titers were assessed for all antibodies, whereas the IgG titers were included for analysis according to the previous study. The clinical information of participants was blinded to the technologists. The degrees of 7 antibodies were categorized into 3 grades, grade 0 (below the lower limit or negative status), grade 1 (positive status), and grade 2 (over the upper limit). The IB score was calculated by summing each grade of 7 antibodies (score of 0–6). The IB score was dichotomized based on its ability to predict severe Willis narrowing score (WNS) outcomes (see below). To determine and validate the cutoff value for the IB score, we performed a 5‐fold cross‐validation. The data set was randomly divided into 5 subsets, and each subset was used as a validation set, whereas the remaining 4 subsets served as the training set. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis was conducted in each iteration to identify the optimal cutoff value, balancing sensitivity and specificity. The final cutoff value was determined as the average of the cutoffs from all iterations, ensuring stability and robustness. The optimal cutoff point, defined as the value that maximized both sensitivity and specificity, was identified at 4.999 (Figure S1). Based on this cutoff, patients were categorized into a low IB score group (score of 0–4) and a high IB score group (score of 5–6).

Coccidioidomycosis serology and antigen assays — systemic disease: Serologic assays by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA), immunodiffusion, or complement fixation (CF) detect immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG); the presence of IgM-specific coccidioidal antibody suggests active or recent infection, whereas IgG-specific antibodies appear later and persist for 6 to 8 months. A commercial EIA appears to be more sensitive than tube precipitation, CF, and immunodiffusion, although concern remains about specificity, and CF appears to be a more specific assay. Cross-reactivity can occur with blastomycosis and histoplasmosis, and patients with coccidioidomycosis have shown positive Histoplasma antigen results; in a study of 19 patients, 11 patients (58%) had a positive Histoplasma urine antigen assay, with antigenuria detected in 79% in acute disease, leading to the statement that this assay should not be used for diagnosis of Coccidioides infection. Antigen testing for coccidioidomycosis is now available, but its sensitivity appears to be lower than EIA.

The diagnostic criteria for acute HEV infection were detection of,
serum anti-HEV immunoglobulin M and anti-HEV immunoglobulin G both reactive and/or
HEV RNA+ documented in serum and/or feces by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction

Subjects with false-positive serologic results (low HEV IgM positivity, not confirmed by a repeated serologic test after 1 month) or with any other concomitant acute infections or vaccinations and patients with any other causes of acute hepatitis were excluded.

Clinical data

Demographic (age and sex) and clinical data (immunosuppression status, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and bilirubin levels) were collected. All patients were screened for neurologic symptoms and/or signs by the treating physician and referred for neurologic evaluation at the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, Lugano, on suspicion of neurologic involvement. Such patients underwent a full neurologic examination and had a series of investigations to exclude concomitant infections (hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Treponema pallidum) and additional tests as clinically appropriate (antinuclear antibodies [ANA], antidouble strand DNA antibodies, extractable nuclear antigen antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies screening, antiganglioside antibodies tests, lumbar puncture, brachial plexus, brain and spinal MRI, and electrodiagnostic studies) and were all followed up for at least 6 months thereafter.

NA was defined by van Eijk et al.and GBS according to NINDS criteria. Myalgia was defined as pain in the muscles present at rest, neither preceded by trauma or physical exercise nor triggered by medication, with a minimal intensity of 5/10 on the visual analogue scale, independent of the creatinine kinase (CK) level.

### Diagnostic yield of anti-neuronal antibody testing in patients suspected of an infectious encephalitis [^116sVSPa]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In our study of patients who presented in an acute setting with a suspected encephalitis, expanded antibody testing did not yield additional anti‐neuronal antibodies in patients for whom no clear infectious or alternative diagnosis could be made during the disease episode. Our findings indicate that current clinical practice in participating centers effectively evaluates AIE episodes within the acute presentation of suspected CNS infection or inflammatory disease. In the acute setting, clinical diagnostic criteria for possible AIE can assist in determining whether to proceed to anti‐neuronal antibody testing.

Our data show that antibody‐positive AIE was identified correctly in all cases using the possible AIE criteria. Although this might seem to imply that antibody testing is only recommended when a patient meets the possible AIE criteria, there is a major caveat. The sensitivity of the possible AIE criteria is largely dependent on the cohort of investigation. In patients in a hospital setting with an acute presentation, as in the I‐PACE study, we show it is high, but in situations beyond the acute setting, such as cognitive, psychiatric, or epileptic cohorts, it was shown to be only moderate. On the other hand, no autoantibodies were detected in nearly a third of the patients who met the criteria for possible AIE. A prior study reported a specificity for possible AIE of only 25%–30% and concluded that these criteria are insufficient for making a diagnosis but are useful as entry criteria for antibody testing. The complex presentations of AIE may pose challenges for accurate diagnosis, leading to inappropriate use of diagnostic criteria for AIE. Our study also emphasizes the challenges of diagnosing seronegative AIE and the importance of carefully applying its criteria.

In line with the existing literature, patients with an antibody‐positive (definite) AIE in this study did not have fever and had lower levels of serum inflammatory markers (CRP, leukocytes) compared to the complete cohort suspected of a CNS infectious or inflammatory disease. Similarly, compared to episodes lacking a diagnosis but meeting the possible AIE criteria, the same pattern was revealed. This may suggest a higher likelihood of having infectious encephalitis with an unknown cause rather than AIE of unknown cause. Atypical of AIE in the antibody‐positive patients were the high percentage of episodes with pleocytosis and poor outcomes. In general, the clinical characteristics — the low frequency of seizures and aphasia, and the abovementioned serological findings — of the included cohort, including those of the definite AIE diagnoses, suggest a selection bias toward infectious pathology instead of autoimmune causes.

### Immune globulin intravenous (human) 10% (Bivigam) [^114VPH5M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Transmissible Infectious Agents

Because BIVIGAM is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g., viruses, and theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent.

No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have been associated with the use of BIVIGAM. All infections suspected by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to ADMA Biologics at 1–800–458–4244. Before prescribing BIVIGAM, the physician should discuss the risks and benefits of its use with the patient (see Patient Counseling Information [17.6]).

5.9	Monitoring Laboratory Tests

Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, before the initial infusion of BIVIGAM and at appropriate intervals thereafter.
Because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis with IGIV treatment, consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies.
If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after an infusion of BIVIGAM, perform appropriate laboratory testing for confirmation.
If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient's serum.

5.10	Interference with Laboratory Tests

After infusion of immunoglobulin, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient's blood may yield positive serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens (e.g. A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs') test.

The Study

Forty-four patients were recruited for a prospective study of fever of intermediate duration (i.e. fever without focal symptoms lasting 7–28 days). Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected for all patients. Chest radiographs and blood and urine cultures were taken. Antibodies against R. typhi were tested by direct immunofluorescence test (bioMérieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France) in the Canary Islands. Among the 44 patients, 24 showed a positive serologic result. Antibodies against other agents (Coxiella burnetii, R. conorii, Leptospira spp. Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and hepatitis B virus) were also tested; all were negative.

To search for evidence of infection with R. felis, all serologic results were confirmed by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) in France, as previously described. Systematic testing of SFG rickettsia antigens present in Europe and Africa was performed in parallel. The MIF procedure was followed by the use of Western blot and cross-adsorption studies. An immunofluorescence assay was considered positive if immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers were > 1:64 or if IgM titers were > 1:32. When cross-reactions were noted between the rickettsial antigens, the analysis comprised 3 steps. First, a rickettsial antigen was considered to represent the agent of infection when IgG or IgM antibody titers against this antigen were > 2 serial dilutions higher than titers of IgG or IgM antibody against other rickettsial antigens. Second, when the difference in titers between R. felis and other antigens was < 2 dilutions, Western blot assays were performed. A rickettsial antigen was considered the agent of infection when sera reacted only against the specific protein of this antigen. Expected molecular masses of the specific proteins were ≈125 kDa for R. typhi and 31 kDa for R. felis. Finally, when Western blot assays were not diagnostic, cross-adsorption studies were performed, as previously described. Specific diagnosis criteria after cross-adsorptions studies included a Western blot assay that showed exclusive reactivity with specific proteins of a sole agent. If reactivity with the 2 tested agents was still observed, diagnosis of an indeterminate rickettsial disease was made. With this strategy, patients were classified by 3 types: R. felis infection, R. typhi infection, and indeterminate rickettsial disease.

Case Presentation

A six year and eleven month old girl of non-consanguineous Caucasian parents first presented with a two week history of fever, weight loss, arthralgia and maculopapular rash. She was born at term via Caesarean section with no neonatal concerns. Her medical history was fairly unremarkable, with mild eczema and croup and normal growth. There was no family history of autoimmune conditions. She was up-to-date with her immunizations. She was initially diagnosed with tonsillitis which was positive for Streptococcus on a throat swab. She remained unwell despite recurrent courses of antibiotics over a 6 week period. A comprehensive viral surveillance including Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV and Hepatitis B using PCR on blood was negative on admission. She attended her local hospital due to persisting symptoms. She had no clinical features of arthritis or bowel disease. Serum inflammatory markers were prominent including C-Reactive Protein 135 mg/l (0–10 mg/l), thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 64 × 10 9 /l (150–300 × 10 9 /l), raised alanine transaminase (ALT), 1038 IU/l (10–35 IU/l), raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 8775 IU/L (420–750 IU/l), hyperferritinaemia, 71,378 μg/l (23–76 μg/l), hypofibrinogenaemia, 1 g/l (1.5–4.0 g/l). Her haemoglobin (Hb) and white cell count (WCC) were 80 g/L (115–155 g/l) and 5.1 × 10 9 /l (4.5–13.51 × 10 9 /l) respectively. She was referred for further investigation; her bone marrow biopsy showed occasional haemophagocytosis; flow cytometry perforin expression was present, there was normal granule release (CD107a) on activation of CD8 and NK cells and her CD56 + ve cells were normal (82.4%) compared to ﻿the control (71.5%). A basic auto-immune screen was negative (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)). A presumed diagnosis of secondary HLH was made as she fulfilled HLH criteria without any genetic cause with normal granule release. She was treated with dexamethasone (8 weeks), etoposide (12 weeks), cyclosporine A (weaned from 7 months) as per HLH 2004 protocol. She made a good recovery, her biochemical markers normalised (ferritin 42 μg/l, CRP < 5 mg/l, ALT 26 IU/ml, platelets 260 x 10 9 /l, Hb 120 g/l) and she remained well for 20 months.
