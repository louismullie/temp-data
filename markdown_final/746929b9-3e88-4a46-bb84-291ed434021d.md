Tetanus vaccine time for injection ￼

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when tetanus-containing vaccines should be administered across ages and circumstances, including routine schedules, catch-up, wound management, pregnancy, and special populations, with explicit attention to intervals and product selection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the vaccine formulations and their approved ages. Then, I should verify the routine pediatric schedule and minimum intervals. Next, I will review adolescent and adult catch-up strategies and decennial boosters. After that, I need to examine wound management algorithms and TIG use. Then, I will confirm pregnancy-specific recommendations and cocooning. Finally, I should consider special populations, inadvertent dosing, and practical administration details, and close with a concise summary algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the vaccine products and age indications so I don't misstate anything. DTaP is for children under 7 years, Tdap is for persons aged 10 years and older (Boostrix ≥ 10 years; Adacel 10–64 years, though ACIP accepts either product for adults ≥ 65 years), and Td is for persons aged 7 years and older; all are 0.5 mL intramuscular injections, preferably in the deltoid, and can be coadministered with other vaccines at different anatomical sites [^115egYFi] [^111zAads] [^115eiH3G].

> Now, I should verify the routine pediatric schedule. Children should receive a 5-dose DTaP series at 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months, and 4–6 years; the first dose can be given as early as 6 weeks, the fourth dose should be at least 6 months after the third and not before 12 months, and the fifth dose is not needed if the fourth dose is given at age ≥ 4 years; minimum intervals between doses are 4 weeks, and the series should not be restarted if delayed [^111X51pW] [^114rxSYR] [^114HPdom].

> Hold on, I should verify catch-up for children aged 7–10 years who are behind. If they have not completed the DTaP series, give a single Tdap dose as the first catch-up dose, then complete the remaining tetanus/diphtheria doses with Td; if Tdap is given at ages 7–10 years, they still need the routine adolescent Tdap at 11–12 years, but if Tdap is given at age ≥ 10 years, it can count as the adolescent dose, which I need to keep straight to avoid duplicating doses [^112bXegh] [^1122knPc].

> Next, I will review adolescents and adults. Adolescents should receive a single Tdap at age 11–12 years; if missed, give it as soon as feasible. Adults aged ≥ 19 years who have never received Tdap should get one dose regardless of interval since last Td, and thereafter boost with Td or Tdap every 10 years; importantly, ACIP now allows either Td or Tdap for decennial boosters and for catch-up doses after the first Tdap, which gives flexibility at the point of care [^111yCps5] [^1121mYfn] [^113tJ4D3].

> Wait, let me verify the catch-up series for persons aged ≥ 7 years with no documented tetanus/diphtheria vaccination. The preferred approach is 3 doses: Tdap first, then Td or Tdap after ≥ 4 weeks, then Td or Tdap 6–12 months later; if Tdap was already received, subsequent doses can be Td or Tdap, and the series should not be restarted regardless of elapsed time, which avoids unnecessary extra doses [^112bXegh] [^116opNkd].

> I will now examine wound management, since timing here is often misunderstood. For clean and minor wounds, give a tetanus-containing vaccine if more than 10 years have elapsed since the last dose; for all other wounds, give a tetanus-containing vaccine if more than 5 years have elapsed; if a tetanus-containing vaccine is indicated for someone aged ≥ 11 years who has never had Tdap or whose Tdap status is unknown, prefer Tdap; if Tdap has been given previously, either Td or Tdap is acceptable; for pregnant patients who need a tetanus booster for wound management, use Tdap; and if the patient is unvaccinated or has an unknown history, consider TIG in addition to vaccine for dirty wounds, with TIG and vaccine at separate sites [^114iWLww] [^113utri2] [^111foBBw] [^117MWiqD] [^113ofiLX].

> But wait, what if the wound is contaminated and the patient is immunocompromised? I should confirm that persons with HIV or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should receive TIG regardless of prior vaccination history, which is a critical nuance to prevent missed prophylaxis [^113ofiLX].

> Next, I should review pregnancy-specific recommendations. Tdap should be administered during each pregnancy at 27–36 weeks' gestation, preferably earlier in that window to maximize transplacental antibody transfer; if Tdap is not given during pregnancy, give it immediately postpartum; if a pregnant patient needs a tetanus booster for wound care, use Tdap; and if a pregnant patient has never received any tetanus-containing vaccine, give a 3-dose primary series with Tdap replacing one Td dose, ideally timed in the third trimester for optimal neonatal protection [^113nVCuV] [^114DNUbZ] [^117MWiqD] [^1156Ccfj].

> I need to ensure cocooning is addressed. Close contacts of infants, including partners, family, and caregivers who have not received Tdap, should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before infant contact to reduce the risk of pertussis transmission to the newborn, which is a practical and effective adjunct to maternal vaccination [^114nJBDE].

> Let me consider special populations. For persons with HIV, the schedule is the same as for immunocompetent individuals, but I should remember that antibody responses to tetanus and diphtheria may be attenuated with low CD4 counts, so maintaining up-to-date vaccination is essential; for adults with cancer, prioritize giving Tdap if never received because treatment may accelerate waning; for persons aged ≥ 65 years, either Tdap product is acceptable and considered valid even if off-label for one product, so do not miss opportunities to vaccinate [^1156nw4i] [^116cSaP1] [^111zAads].

> Hold on, I should verify inadvertent administration rules so I don't create confusion. If DTaP is inadvertently given to a person aged ≥ 7 years, it counts as a valid Tdap dose and no correction is needed; if Tdap is given to children aged 2–6 years, it is not valid for DTaP and a replacement DTaP dose should be given as soon as feasible, with the series resumed appropriately; if Tdap is given at age 7–10 years as catch-up, the routine adolescent Tdap at 11–12 years is still indicated, unless Tdap was given at age ≥ 10 years, in which case it can satisfy the adolescent dose requirement [^115ioMRq] [^114BnbM7] [^1122knPc].

> I should double-check administration details. All tetanus-containing vaccines are administered as a 0.5 mL intramuscular injection, preferably into the deltoid, and can be coadministered with other vaccines at different anatomical sites; observe patients for syncope for about 15 minutes after vaccination, especially adolescents and young adults, to prevent falls and injuries [^111zAads] [^114rxSYR].

> Let me reconsider the overarching algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Primary pediatric series with DTaP at 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months, and 4–6 years; adolescent Tdap at 11–12 years; adults get one Tdap if never received, then Td or Tdap every 10 years; for catch-up aged ≥ 7 years, use Tdap first then Td or Tdap to complete a 3-dose series; for wounds, give a tetanus-containing vaccine if > 10 years for clean/minor or > 5 years for other wounds, prefer Tdap when indicated for those never vaccinated or unknown, and add TIG when indicated for unvaccinated or high-risk contaminated wounds; in pregnancy, give Tdap each time at 27–36 weeks, or postpartum if missed, and ensure close contacts are vaccinated at least 2 weeks before infant contact [^111yCps5] [^113ofiLX] [^114iWLww] [^113nVCuV] [^114nJBDE].

The tetanus vaccine is given as an **intramuscular injection** [^111zAads] into the deltoid muscle for adults and adolescents, or the anterolateral thigh for infants and young children. Routine **booster doses** are recommended every 10 years [^111yCps5] for all adults, and Tdap is recommended during each pregnancy [^113nVCuV] between 27–36 weeks gestation. For wound management, administer a tetanus-containing vaccine if more than 5 years have elapsed since the last dose [^114iWLww], and use Tdap if the patient has never received it or if the history is unknown [^113utri2]. The vaccine should be stored at 2–8°C and protected from freezing.

## Recommended timing for tetanus vaccination

### Routine vaccination schedule

- **Infants and children**: DTaP at 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months, and 4–6 years [^111X51pW].
- **Adolescents**: Tdap at 11–12 years [^115cKh9o].
- **Adults**: Td or Tdap booster every 10 years [^111yCps5]; Tdap once if never received [^111Sb5Xe].
- **Pregnant women**: Tdap during each pregnancy, ideally 27–36 weeks [^113nVCuV] [^114DNUbZ].

---

### Wound management

For wound management, **clean, minor wounds** require a tetanus-containing vaccine if more than 10 years have elapsed since the last dose, whereas **dirty, major wounds** require a tetanus-containing vaccine if more than 5 years have elapsed [^113ofiLX]; Tdap is preferred if the patient has never received it or if the history is unknown [^113utri2].

---

## Injection site and administration technique

- **Injection site**: Intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle for adults and adolescents; anterolateral thigh for infants and young children [^111zAads].
- **Administration technique**: Use a 22–25 gauge needle, 1–1.5 inches for adults, 5/8–1 inch for infants and children, depending on age and body mass.
- **Storage**: Store at 2–8°C; do not freeze.

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Tdap is safe and recommended during each pregnancy [^113nVCuV] [^116FsJHq].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Follow standard schedule; consider TIG for contaminated wounds [^113ofiLX].
- **Adverse reactions**: Local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) are common; severe reactions are rare [^notfound].

## Tetanus vaccination timing

| **Situation** | **Timing** |
|-|-|
| Routine childhood vaccination | DTaP at 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months, 4–6 years [^111X51pW] |
| Adolescent booster | Tdap at 11–12 years [^115cKh9o] |
| Adult booster | Td or Tdap every 10 years [^111yCps5] |
| Pregnancy | Tdap at 27–36 weeks gestation [^113nVCuV] |
| Clean, minor wound | Vaccine if > 10 years since last dose |
| Dirty, major wound | Vaccine if > 5 years since last dose [^114iWLww] |

---

The tetanus vaccine is administered intramuscularly [^111zAads] with timing based on age, wound risk, and pregnancy status; **booster every 10 years** [^111yCps5] ensures ongoing protection.

Recommendations for Vaccination for Pertussis, Tetanus, and Diphtheria

All persons are recommended to receive routine pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccination. Vaccine type, product, number of doses and booster dose recommendations are based on age and pregnancy status (Tables 4 and 5). Recommendations for off-label use of Tdap vaccines were made after thorough review of available data on the risks for and benefits of Tdap vaccination, and include the following persons: pregnant women, children aged 7–10 years, and persons aged ≥ 65 years (for one Tdap product) (,–). At the time these recommendations were made, ACIP determined that although data were limited, the benefits of off-label Tdap vaccination in preventing pertussis and decreasing pertussis-related morbidity and mortality outweigh the risks of an adverse event.

General Recommendations

Persons Aged 2 Months–6 Years

The routine pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccination schedule for persons aged 2 months–6 years is comprised of five doses of vaccine containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and pertussis antigens (DTaP), administered at ages 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months and 4–6 years.

Three (primary) doses should be administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months.
The fourth (first booster) dose should be administered to children aged 15–18 months to maintain adequate immunity during preschool years.
The fifth (second booster) dose should be administered to children aged 4–6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years of schooling.

Guidance for Use

The first DTaP dose can be administered as early as age 6 weeks.

The fourth DTaP dose should be administered at least 6 months after the third DTaP dose and should not be administered to a child aged < 12 months.

A fifth DTaP dose is not necessary if the fourth DTaP dose in the series is administered at age ≥ 4 years.

Persons Aged 11–18 Years

Persons aged 11–18 years should receive a single dose of Tdap, preferably at a preventive care visit at ages 11–12 years. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of Td should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Catch-Up Immunization Recommendations

Persons aged 7–18 years. If persons aged 7–18 years have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria, these persons should receive a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines, which includes at least 1 Tdap dose. The preferred schedule is 1 dose of Tdap, followed by 1 dose of either Td or Tdap ≥ 4 weeks afterward, and 1 dose of either Td or Tdap 6–12 months later. Persons aged 7–18 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series; if additional tetanus toxoid–containing doses are required, either Td or Tdap may be used. The vaccination series does not need to be restarted for those with incomplete DTaP history, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. The catch-up schedule and minimum intervals between doses are available at.

Persons aged ≥ 19 years. If persons aged ≥ 19 years have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria, these persons should receive a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines, which includes at least 1 Tdap dose. The preferred schedule is 1 dose of Tdap, followed by 1 dose of either Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks afterward, and 1 dose of either Td or Tdap 6–12 months later. Persons aged ≥ 19 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series; if additional tetanus toxoid–containing doses are required, either Td or Tdap may be used.

Prevention of Neonatal and Obstetric Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated > 10 years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk for neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unvaccinated woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; at least 1 of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to published guidance. If > 1 dose is needed, either Td or Tdap may be used. The 3-dose primary series should be completed at the recommended intervals.

Special Situations

Accelerated Schedule for Infants and Children Aged < 7 Years

For an infant or child aged < 7 years, circumstances such as travel, potential loss to follow-up or increased risk of exposure to pertussis might warrant an accelerated schedule to provide protection as early as possible. An accelerated schedule can be started as soon as the infant is aged 6 weeks, with the second and third DTaP doses administered no earlier than 4 weeks after each preceding dose. The fourth DTaP dose should not be administered before the infant is aged 12 months and should be separated from the third dose by at least 6 months. The fifth DTaP dose should not be administered before the child is aged 4 years. When considering an accelerated schedule, providers also should consider the timing of other recommended vaccines and well-child visits.

History of Pertussis

Persons who have a history of pertussis should receive a pertussis-containing vaccine (i.e. DTaP or Tdap) according to the routine recommendation. Although pertussis disease is likely to confer natural immunity against pertussis, the immune response might be suboptimal against subsequent pertussis disease and the duration of protection induced by an infection does not provide long-term immunity.

Persons Who Have Recovered from Tetanus or Diphtheria

Tetanus or diphtheria infection do not necessarily confer immunity against re-infection; therefore, active vaccination should be initiated at the time of recovery from the illness according to the schedule. Persons who have completed the primary tetanus vaccination series should receive a booster dose as soon as feasible during convalescence. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and should begin the 3-dose tetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccination series.

Vaccine Administration

A summary of dose schedules is provided (Tables 4 and 5).

All health care personnel administering vaccinations should be aware of the potential for syncope after vaccination, especially among adolescents and young adults, and should take appropriate measures to prevent potential injuries. Providers should strongly consider observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated. If syncope occurs, the vaccine recipient should be observed until symptoms resolve.

Persons with Incomplete or Unknown Vaccine History

Persons Aged 2 Months–6 Years

For persons aged < 7 years not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine, the catch-up schedule and minimum intervals between doses are available at. The vaccine series does not need to be restarted regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses for those with incomplete DTaP vaccine history.

Because of concern about adverse reactions, the total number of doses of vaccines containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (e.g. DTaP, DT, and DTP) received should not exceed 6 doses before the seventh birthday. Only documented doses count toward the maximum of 6 doses.

Persons Aged 7–18 Years

Persons aged 7–18 years not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive a single dose of Tdap as one (preferably the first) dose of the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. The vaccine series does not need to be restarted, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses for those with incomplete DTaP vaccine history. The catch-up schedule and minimum intervals between doses are available at.

For persons aged 7–10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose should be administered at age 11–12 years.

Persons Aged > 18 Years

Persons aged > 18 years who have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria should receive a series of three vaccinations containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, which includes 1 dose of Tdap. The preferred schedule is a single dose of Tdap, followed by a dose of Td at least 4 weeks after Tdap and another dose of Td 6 to 12 months later. However, the single dose of Tdap can substitute for any of the Td doses in the 3-dose primary series.

Persons aged > 18 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap (preferably the first) in the catch-up series; if additional tetanus toxoid–containing doses are needed, use Td vaccine. Alternatively, in situations in which a person aged > 18 years probably received vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria but cannot produce documentation, vaccine providers may consider serologic testing for antibodies to tetanus and diphtheria toxin to avoid unnecessary vaccination. If tetanus and diphtheria antitoxin levels are each > 0.01 IU/mL, previous vaccination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccine is presumed, and a single dose of Tdap is indicated.

Introduction

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults. After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines.

General Recommendations

Persons aged 11–18 years. These persons should receive a single dose of Tdap, preferably at a preventive care visit at age 11–12 years. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, 1 booster dose of either Td or Tdap should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Persons aged ≥ 19 years. Regardless of the interval since their last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine, persons aged ≥ 19 years who have never received a dose of Tdap should receive 1 dose of Tdap. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of either Td or Tdap should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Pregnant women. No change has been made to the recommendations for routine Tdap immunization during pregnancy. Pregnant women should receive 1 dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of their history of receiving the vaccine. Tdap should be administered at 27–36 weeks' gestation, preferably during the earlier part of this period, although it may be administered at any time during pregnancy.

Background

Two Tdap vaccines are licensed for use in the United States. Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline) is approved for a single dose in persons aged ≥ 10 years; Adacel (Sanofi Pasteur) is approved for persons aged 10–64 years. Since 2005, a single booster dose of Tdap has been recommended for children and adolescents aged 11–18 years and adults aged 19–64 years to increase protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Booster doses of Td have been recommended every 10 years (decennial vaccination) to ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria. These recommendations were expanded to include a single dose of Tdap for adults aged ≥ 65 years in 2012 (although only one Tdap product is approved for use in persons aged ≥ 65 years, either vaccine administered to a person aged ≥ 65 years is considered valid). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy to prevent pertussis in infants too young for routine vaccination (off-label use *). If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for wound management, Td has been recommended for nonpregnant persons aged ≥ 7 years who had previously received Tdap. For pregnant women, Tdap is recommended in this setting. For previously unvaccinated persons aged ≥ 7 years, a 3-dose catch-up immunization schedule included only 1 dose of Tdap, preferably as the first dose in the series (off-label use in children aged 7–9 years), and 2 subsequent Td doses at specified intervals. No further doses of Tdap were routinely recommended, with two exceptions: pregnant women should receive Tdap during each pregnancy (off-label use), and children aged 7–10 years who received Tdap as part of the catch-up schedule were recommended to receive the routine adolescent Tdap booster dose at age 11–12 years. In 2010, ACIP evaluated the safety of administering Tdap at intervals < 5 years after Td administration and recommended that the dose of Tdap, when indicated, should not be delayed and should be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine.

### Vaccines for women age 50 and older [^116EVodp]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Tetanus-Diphtheria (Td) Toxoid Boosters

Tetanus toxoid and diphtheria toxoid are excellent immunogens. The primary vaccination series in childhood provides high-level protection and induces long-lasting immunologic memory, as evidenced by an anamnestic antibody response to Td after intervals of > 30 years. High levels of primary vaccination and appropriate wound care (including Td boosters) are the cornerstones of tetanus prevention in the United States. The current recommendation that all adults in the United States receive Td boosters every 10 years has been poorly implemented, as evidenced by serosurveys showing that most adults > 50 years of age lack protective levels of antibodies to either tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, or both. Despite this high level of serosusceptibility, tetanus (≈30 cases/y) and diphtheria (0–3 cases/y) are rare diseases and almost always occur in persons who never completed the full schedule of childhood vaccinations. Cost and benefit studies favor a policy of a single mid-life Td booster for persons who have completed the full pediatric series, and several advisory groups have recommended a booster at 50 years of age as an alternative to the current standard of decennial boosters. Consideration of reducing the frequency of Td boosters will be complicated by the proposed addition of the acellular pertussis vaccine to the adult Td formulation, as it is more costly and induces a shorter duration of antibody response than Td.

Tdap

Two vaccines are licensed for the pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria vaccination booster dose for adolescents and adults (Table 5). The dose of Tdap is 0.5 mL, administered intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid muscle. Tdap may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines at a different anatomical site.

Interval between Td and Tdap. ACIP recommends that for pertussis vaccination, when indicated, Tdap should be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine. ACIP concluded that, while longer intervals between Td and Tdap vaccination could decrease the occurrence of local reactions, the benefits of protection against pertussis outweigh the potential risk for adverse events. For persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccine history, the interval between doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines should follow the catch-up series schedule.

Tdap products in adults aged ≥ 65 years. Providers should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate persons aged ≥ 65 years with Tdap. When feasible, Boostrix (approved for use in persons aged ≥ 10 years) should be used for adults aged ≥ 65 years instead of Adacel (approved for use in persons aged 10–64 years); however, ACIP concluded that either vaccine administered to a person aged ≥ 65 years is immunogenic and would provide protection. A dose of either Tdap product is considered valid; therefore, providers may administer the Tdap vaccine they have available.

Td

For tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed vaccines, there are two licensed vaccines (Table 5). The dose of Td is 0.5 mL, administered intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid muscle.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2014 [^111sxozB]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) annually reviews and updates the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older. This schedule provides a brief summary of ACIP recommendations for the use of vaccines routinely recommended for adults in the form of two figures, footnotes for each vaccine, and a table that includes primary contraindications and precautions.

In October 2013, ACIP approved the Recommended Immunization Schedule for Adults Aged 19 Years or Older for 2014. This schedule was also reviewed and approved by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American College of Nurse-Midwives. The primary updates for the 2014 schedule include adding Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine to the figures and updating information in the footnote about persons for whom Hib vaccine is recommended; adding information to the influenza vaccine footnote and contraindications table regarding the newly licensed recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) and information about the use of RIV and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) among persons with egg allergies; moving the footnote for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recommendations before the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) recommendations because PCV13 should be administered first among persons for whom both vaccines are recommended; and clarifying information about the timing of the second and third doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, use of meningococcal vaccines among adults, and recommendations for tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) and tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccines.

Rationale for Recommendations

In 2013, ACIP did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap; the rationale was described in previously published guidance. In 2019, ACIP again concluded that in light of the higher cost of Tdap relative to Td and uncertainty about the impact that receipt of multiple Tdap doses would have on pertussis control and transmission, there continues to be insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend that Tdap replace Td. However, given the reassuring safety profile and evidence of widespread use of Tdap in place of Td, to allow providers more flexibility, either Tdap or Td was recommended for use in situations when previously only Td was recommended. ACIP recommends that either Td or Tdap be used for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and for additional required doses in the catch-up immunization schedule if a person has received at least 1 Tdap dose.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111xXt2t]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

This report compiles and summarizes all recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding prevention and control of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis in the United States. As a comprehensive summary of previously published recommendations, this report does not contain any new recommendations and replaces all previously published reports and policy notes; it is intended for use by clinicians and public health providers as a resource. ACIP recommends routine vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Infants and young children are recommended to receive a 5-dose series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines, with one adolescent booster dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. Adults who have never received Tdap also are recommended to receive a booster dose of Tdap. Women are recommended to receive a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, which should be administered from 27 through 36 weeks' gestation, regardless of previous receipt of Tdap. After receipt of Tdap, adolescents and adults are recommended to receive a booster tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine every 10 years to assure ongoing protection against tetanus and diphtheria.

CDC Guidance

Catch-up immunization. For persons aged 7–9 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap dose should be administered at age 11–12 years. If a Tdap dose is administered at age ≥ 10 years, the Tdap dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (children, 7–18 years), CDC 2018 guidelines recommend to administer five doses of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis, administered at ages 2, 4, 6, 15–18 months, and 4–6 years for routine pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccination for children aged 2 months to 6 years:

- three primary doses at ages 2, 4, and 6 months

- the first booster dose at 15–18 months to maintain adequate immunity during preschool years

- the second booster dose at 4–6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years of schooling.

Immunogenicity and Effectiveness

Although no randomized controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of diphtheria toxoid in preventing disease has ever been conducted, strong evidence from observational studies supports the effectiveness of vaccination. The effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid is high, although not 100%. After receiving 3 doses of diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines, virtually all infants develop diphtheria antitoxin titers > 0.01 IU/mL. Although some DTaP products produce lower geometric mean titers than those observed after vaccination with DTP, these differences are not thought likely to be clinically significant. For primary vaccination of adults aged ≥ 19 years, data suggest that virtually all adults develop diphtheria antitoxin titers > 0.01 IU/mL after receiving 3 doses of diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines. A diphtheria antitoxin level of 0.01 to 0.09 IU/mL provides some degree of protection, whereas levels ≥ 0.1 IU/mL are considered protective and levels > 1.0 IU/mL are associated with long-lasting protection. Although no level of circulating diphtheria antitoxin confers absolute protection, most reports indicate that C. diphtheriae infection in previously vaccinated persons is milder and less likely to be fatal. The failure of the vaccine to protect all persons exposed to C. diphtheriae highlights the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and herd immunity to prevent or limit transmission and outbreaks, as evidenced by the disappearance of diphtheria cases in industrialized countries with established vaccination programs.

Although various schedules used worldwide for primary vaccination (3 doses during infancy or 4 doses by age 15 months) appear to provide adequate protection from diphtheria in the early years of life, a booster dose is needed at age 4–6 years to maintain protection throughout the school-age years. The massive epidemic in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the 1990s strongly suggests that sustaining high vaccination coverage with a primary series of diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine among infants and administering booster doses at school entry and throughout life are important for maintaining population immunity. In developed countries where diphtheria is well controlled, there is little to no opportunity for exposure and natural boosting of immunity from infection after childhood. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that persons living in areas of low endemicity or areas where disease is not endemic should receive booster doses of combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids approximately 10 years after completing the primary series and subsequently every 10 years throughout life.

* Events or conditions listed as precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and risks for administering a specific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should be considered. If the risk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vaccine should not be administered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the risk, the vaccine should be administered. Whether and when to administer DTaP to children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

† Further vaccination with any of the three components of DTaP should be deferred because of uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be responsible.

§ Because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, persons who experience anaphylactic reactions should be referred to an allergist to determine whether they have a specific allergy to tetanus toxoid and can be desensitized to tetanus toxoid.

¶ In such cases, DT vaccine should be administered for the remaining doses in the vaccination schedule to ensure protection against diphtheria and tetanus.

 This contraindication is for the pertussis component, and these persons should receive Td instead of Tdap.

For the purposes of this report, DTaP and Tdap are used as general terms for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines, and DT and Td are used for diphtheria and tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines. Any of the vaccine formulations licensed in the United States can be used in an age-appropriate manner to implement these vaccination recommendations. Both DTP and monovalent tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines are discussed for historical purposes and no longer are manufactured or available in the United States.

ACIP recommendations for vaccination for pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria and guidance for use are described elsewhere in this report (see Recommendations for Use of Pertussis, Tetanus, and Diphtheria Vaccines) (Table 1). Details regarding contraindications, precautions, and special circumstances are described elsewhere in this report (see Recommendations for Use of Pertussis, Tetanus, and Diphtheria Vaccines) (Tables 2 and 3). In 2013, after review of available data, ACIP did not support a universal recommendation for a second dose of Tdap for the general population (see No Additional Doses of Tdap For the General Population). In 2014 and 2015, ACIP did not support a second dose of Tdap for health care personnel or close contacts of infants.

Strategy for Pertussis, Tetanus, and Diphtheria Control

Routine DTaP, Tdap, and Td Vaccination

In the United States, reported tetanus and diphtheria cases are rare. Although vaccine coverage is high among infants, children, and adolescents, serologic and survey data indicate that adults are undervaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria and that coverage declines with increasing age. Maintaining seroprotection against tetanus and diphtheria through adherence to the ACIP-recommended schedule of booster doses of vaccine is important for adults of all ages.

In contrast to tetanus and diphtheria, the incidence of reported pertussis in the United States has been increasing despite high infant and childhood coverage with DTaP vaccines and increasing Tdap coverage among adolescents. Although vaccine-induced protection provided by acellular pertussis vaccines wanes over time, vaccination remains the best protection available against pertussis. ACIP recognizes that not all cases of pertussis can be prevented. However, sustaining vaccine coverage in young children (DTaP) and adolescents (Tdap) with the available licensed vaccines and achieving high Tdap coverage among adults, especially pregnant women, presents the best available means of preventing pertussis.

Preventing Pertussis in Young Infants Through Maternal Tdap Vaccination

Because young infants continue to be at greatest risk for hospitalization and death due to pertussis, ACIP has made efforts to optimize the vaccination program strategies for preventing pertussis in those too young to be vaccinated. Very young infants are dependent in part on passively acquired maternal antibodies, which are thought to protect infants from infection and to modify the severity of diverse infectious diseases in infants for varying periods of time. Before the ACIP recommendation to vaccinate pregnant women, several studies provided evidence supporting the existence of efficient transplacental transfer of pertussis antibodies. These studies indicated that newborn infants whose mothers received Tdap before or during pregnancy had higher concentrations of pertussis antibodies at birth compared with those of unvaccinated mothers.

The strategy of preventing pertussis in newborns through the vaccination of women with Tdap during pregnancy from 27 through 36 weeks' gestation is 80%–91% effective (CDC, unpublished data, 2016). One study found that, among infants infected with pertussis, those born to mothers vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy had less severe pertussis than those born to unvaccinated mothers; maternal vaccination was 58% effective in preventing hospitalization among infants infected with pertussis.

In 2013, ACIP reviewed the most recent safety and immunogenicity data available at that time to inform their recommendations regarding a second routine dose of Tdap. ACIP concluded that a second dose of Tdap would be safe and immunogenic at 5- or 10-year intervals. However, antipertussis antibodies decline rapidly after the first year (,–), and vaccine effectiveness studies indicated that pertussis protection begins to wane within 2–4 years after receipt of a single Tdap dose. This likely limits the impact of a second dose of Tdap on the overall burden of pertussis in the United States. In addition, Tdap vaccines have an uncertain role in prevention of transmission and in herd protection. ACIP concluded that the data did not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap, given the likely limited public health impact.

In January 2019, FDA approved Adacel for a second Tdap dose if administered ≥ 8 years after the first Tdap dose and for use for tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous receipt of any tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. In light of the new indication for a second dose of Adacel and evidence of Tdap being used frequently in place of Td, ACIP reassessed current Tdap recommendations. In October 2019, ACIP recommended that either Tdap or Td vaccines could be used in situations where only Td vaccine had been recommended previously. This report provides recommendations for the use of Td or Tdap for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management, and catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history.

No Additional Doses of Tdap for the General Population

With the exception of pregnant women, only a single booster dose of Tdap is recommended for persons aged ≥ 11 years. Both available Tdap products are approved for use as a single booster dose. Tdap provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, but protection from pertussis infection begins to decline within 2 to 4 years after receipt of Tdap (29).

Clinical trials support that a second dose of Tdap is safe and immunogenic at a 5- or 10-year interval. Immunogenicity studies show that diphtheria and tetanus antibody levels persisted for five to 10 years after receipt of Tdap (,–). However, antipertussis antibodies decline rapidly after the first year, suggesting that protection wanes, which would likely limit the impact of a second dose of Tdap on the overall burden of pertussis in the United States (,–). Antibody decay and, therefore, clinical protection following additional doses of Tdap are likely similar to what is observed following the first dose of Tdap.

ACIP recognizes the increasing burden of pertussis in the United States and the need for an effective strategy to reduce this burden. A decision analysis model evaluating the epidemiologic and economic impact of a routine program of additional doses of Tdap administered at either a 5- or 10-year interval to persons who received their first Tdap at age 11 years suggested that the reduction in pertussis disease burden attributable to the routine use of a second dose of Tdap would be limited. In the model, the proportion of cases preventable compared with the recommendation, ranged from 3% to 5%. ACIP concluded that the data do not support a general recommendation for a routine second dose of Tdap, and that the public health impact of routinely recommending a second dose of Tdap would be limited.

Methods

Beginning in September 2018, the ACIP Pertussis Vaccines Work Group participated in monthly telephone conferences to review Tdap vaccination recommendations. A search of clinical trials published during January 2013–June 2019 that examined Tdap vaccination in adolescents and adults who had previously received Tdap was performed, so the work group could review data that had not previously been reviewed by ACIP. Because of limited data on the use of > 1 Tdap dose in the catch-up immunization schedule, the work group also considered published and unpublished safety data on receipt of > 1 Tdap dose within a 12-month period in both pregnant women and nonpregnant adolescents and adults. Data from public sector orders (CDC, unpublished data, 2019), commercial insurance claims (Truven Health Analytics, unpublished data, 2019), and a published study from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) were analyzed to assess stakeholders' values attributed to perceived benefits and harms, acceptability, and implementation considerations regarding use of Tdap in place of Td.

Summaries of evidence, including the evidence to recommendations framework and assessment of programmatic considerations, were presented to ACIP at the October 2018, June 2019, and October 2019 meetings. Proposed recommendations were presented to the committee at the October 2019 meeting, and, after a public comment period, were approved by the voting members as follows: either Td or Tdap should be allowed for use in situations where only Td is currently recommended for the decennial Td booster, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and catch-up vaccination, including in pregnant women (14 voted in favor, and none opposed).

Prevention of Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus

Pregnant women who have completed the childhood immunization schedule and were last vaccinated more than ten years previously should receive a booster dose of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine to prevent neonatal tetanus. The risk of neonatal tetanus is minimal if a previously unimmunized woman has received at least 2 properly spaced doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine during pregnancy; one of the doses administered during pregnancy should be Tdap, administered according to the current guidance. She should complete the 3-dose primary series at the recommended intervals.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management

ACIP has recommended administering tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) when indicated as part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus (Table 6). A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated as part of wound management if more than five years has passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous vaccination with Tdap, Td should be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated and Td is unavailable, Tdap may be administered.

ACIP Recommendations for Pregnant Women

ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. Health-care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving Tdap.

Guidance for Use

To maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant, optimal timing for Tdap administration is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation although Tdap may be given at any time during pregnancy. For women not previously vaccinated with Tdap, if Tdap is not administered during pregnancy, Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum.

Special Situations

Pregnant women due for tetanus booster

If a tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is indicated during pregnancy (i.e. > 10 years since previous Td), then Tdap should be administered. Optimal timing is between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Wound management for pregnant women

As part of standard wound management to prevent tetanus, a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine might be recommended for wound management in a pregnant woman if ≥ 5 years have elapsed since the previous Td booster. If a Td booster is recommended for a pregnant woman, health-care providers should administer Tdap.

Pregnant women with unknown or incomplete tetanus vaccination

To ensure protection against maternal and neonatal tetanus, pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus should receive three vaccinations containing tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids. The recommended schedule is 0, 4 weeks, and 6 through 12 months. Tdap should replace 1 dose of Td, preferably between 27 and 36 weeks gestation to maximize the maternal antibody response and passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Cocooning

ACIP recommends that adolescents and adults (e.g. parents, siblings, grandparents, child-care providers, and health-care personnel) who have or anticipate having close contact with an infant aged < 12 months should receive a single dose of Tdap to protect against pertussis if they have not received Tdap previously. Guidance will be forthcoming on revaccination of persons who anticipate close contact with an infant, including postpartum women who previously have received Tdap.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111s2EK3]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Since the promulgation of the ACIP Tdap recommendations in 2005, several studies have identified barriers to and programmatic gaps in the implementation of the recommendations for adolescents and adults. Barriers to implementation included confusion around guidance language concerning the timing of administration of Tdap after the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose and obstacles to vaccinating health care personnel. Programmatic gaps at the time of the 2005 recommendations included lack of a Tdap vaccine licensed for children aged 7–10 years and for adults aged ≥ 65 years. In 2011 and 2012, ACIP recommended a dose of Tdap for these age groups and clarified the language concerning the timing of Tdap vaccination and the vaccination of health care personnel.

Compared with older children and adults, infants aged < 12 months have substantially higher rates of pertussis (Figure 2) and the largest burden of pertussis-related deaths. The majority of pertussis-related hospitalizations and deaths occur in infants aged ≤ 2 months who are too young to be vaccinated. The desire to protect the youngest infants from pertussis morbidity and mortality prompted ACIP in 2011 to recommend a dose of Tdap be administered to women during pregnancy, but only for pregnant women who had never received Tdap. Because antibody levels wane substantially after vaccination, ACIP concluded that a single dose of Tdap during one pregnancy would not provide protection for infants who were the product of subsequent pregnancies. In 2012, the recommendation was revised; ACIP recommends the use of Tdap during each pregnancy.

Inadvertent Administration

DTaP

DTaP is not indicated for persons aged ≥ 7 years. If DTaP is administered inadvertently to a fully vaccinated child aged 7–10 years, this dose should be counted as the adolescent Tdap dose. If DTaP is administered inadvertently to an undervaccinated child aged 7–10 years, this dose should count as the Tdap dose of the catch-up series and the child should receive an adolescent booster dose of Tdap. If DTaP is administered inadvertently to a person aged ≥ 11 years, this dose should count as the Tdap dose, and the person should not receive an additional dose of Tdap.

Tdap

Persons aged 2 months–6 years. If Tdap is administered inadvertently instead of DTaP as any one of the first 3 doses of the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination series, the Tdap dose should not be counted as valid, and a replacement dose of DTaP should be administered. The replacement dose of DTaP can be administered as soon as feasible at any interval after the inadvertent Tdap dose. The remaining doses of the DTaP series should be administered on the routine schedule, with at least a four-week interval between the replacement dose of DTaP and the next dose of DTaP. The adolescent Tdap dose should be administered as recommended when this child is aged 11–12 years.

If Tdap is administered inadvertently as the fourth or the fifth dose in the tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination series, the Tdap dose should be counted as valid and does not need to be repeated; the child who received Tdap as a fourth dose should complete the pediatric DTaP schedule. The adolescent Tdap dose should be administered as recommended when this child is aged 11–12 years.

Children aged 7–10 years who are fully vaccinated. If Tdap is administered inadvertently, the Tdap dose should not be counted as valid. The adolescent Tdap dose should be administered as recommended when this child is aged 11–12 years.

Persons Aged ≥ 19 Years

Persons aged ≥ 19 years who previously have not received a dose of Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap in place of a decennial Td booster dose. The dose of Tdap, when indicated, should not be delayed and should be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine. To ensure continued protection against tetanus and diphtheria, booster doses of Td should be administered every 10 years throughout life.

Pregnant Women

ACIP recommends that providers of prenatal care implement a Tdap immunization program for all pregnant women. Health care personnel should administer a dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, irrespective of the patient's prior history of receiving the vaccine.

Guidance for Use

Tdap should be administered between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation, although it may be administered at any time during pregnancy. Available data suggest that vaccinating earlier in the 27–36 week time period will maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant.

Tdap may be simultaneously administered with an inactivated influenza vaccine to pregnant women.

If a woman did not receive Tdap during her current pregnancy and did not receive a prior dose of Tdap ever (i.e. during adolescence, adulthood, or a previous pregnancy), then Tdap should be administered immediately postpartum. If a woman did not receive Tdap during her current pregnancy but did receive a prior dose of Tdap, then she should not receive a dose of Tdap postpartum.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^112o323B]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is added by this report?

During January 2008–March 2014 in California, a total of 21 tetanus patients were reported. All were hospitalized, including 19 in intensive care units; five (24%) died. Of 16 patients with an acute injury prior to illness, only nine had sought medical care, and only two of the nine received appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. In addition, some patients with tetanus were not administered the recommended dosage of tetanus immune globulin.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Routine vaccination of patients every 10 years is important to prevent tetanus, particularly in settings where patients do not seek medical care following an injury, where no injury is evident to the patient, or where appropriate postexposure prophylaxis is not provided following an injury. Efforts to educate health care providers might lead to better tetanus postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds and better use of therapeutic tetanus immune globulin for patients with tetanus.

Off-Label Use of Vaccine

Off-label indications based on age and pregnancy status have not changed (Table). New off-label indications for Adacel would include any additional routine or catch-up Td dose beyond a second dose administered ≥ 8 years after an initial Tdap dose, if not given for wound prophylaxis within the specified guidance. Any additional doses of Boostrix administered beyond the single licensed dose are considered off-label. The work group did not find any reason to distinguish between these two products in making its recommendations.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1156nw4i]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination — immunogenicity, products, and safety in people with HIV: Antibody response to tetanus and diphtheria vaccination varies by CD4 count. For individuals with advanced HIV and a low CD4 count, immunologic response is attenuated for both tetanus and diphtheria when compared to HIV-uninfected controls. For people with CD4 count > 300 cells/mm3, antibody response to tetanus vaccination is similar to the general population, whereas response to diphtheria remains diminished. Limited data exist on the efficacy of pertussis vaccination in this population. Two Tdap vaccines for individuals aged ≥ 10 years are available in the United States (Adacel and Boostrix). Both vaccines are inactivated and considered safe to administer at any CD4 count. People with HIV should receive vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis on the same schedule as individuals without HIV. All adults not previously vaccinated should receive a single dose of Tdap, followed by a Td or Tdap booster every 10 years.

### Meningococcal vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2020 [^111E6SRE]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

MenACWY Vaccines

ACIP recommends a single dose of MenACWY at age 11 or 12 years followed by a booster dose administered at age 16 years (Table 2). Children who received MenACWY at age 10 years do not need an additional dose at age 11–12 years but should receive the booster dose at age 16 years. Children who received MenACWY before age 10 years and with no ongoing risk for meningococcal disease for which boosters are recommended should still receive MenACWY according to the recommended adolescent schedule, with the first dose at age 11–12 years and a booster dose at age 16 years. For example, a healthy child who received MenACWY at age 9 years because of short-term travel to a country where meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic and who is not otherwise at increased risk should receive the MenACWY at age 11–12 years according to the recommended ACIP adolescent vaccination schedule. Children who received MenACWY before age 10 years and for whom boosters are recommended because of an ongoing increased risk for meningococcal disease (e.g. those with complement deficiency, HIV infection, or asplenia) should follow the booster schedule for persons at increased risk.

Adolescents who receive their first dose at age 13–15 years should receive a booster dose at age 16–18 years; the booster dose can be administered at any time, as long as a minimum interval of 8 weeks between doses is maintained. Adolescents who receive a first dose after their 16th birthday do not need a booster dose unless they become at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Persons aged 19–21 years who have not received a dose after their 16th birthday can receive a single MenACWY dose as part of catch-up vaccination. MenACWY vaccines are interchangeable; the same vaccine product is recommended, but not required, for all doses. MenACWY vaccines can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines indicated for this age group, but at a different anatomic site, if feasible. MenACWY-TT, which is conjugated to tetanus toxoid, is only licensed for the prevention of meningococcal disease; use of this vaccine does not replace doses or affect the dosing intervals of routinely recommended tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines in any age group.

For pregnant women with HIV, administer one dose of Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably between 27 weeks and 36 weeks gestation (AIII). For adolescents and adults with HIV who have not received the primary vaccination series for tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis, administer one dose of Tdap followed by one dose of Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks after Tdap, and another dose of Td or Tdap 6 months to 12 months after the last Td or Tdap. Tdap can be substituted for any Td dose and is always preferred as the first dose (AIII).

Introduction

This report compiles and summarizes all previously published recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding prevention and control of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria in the United States, specifically after the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccines, and does not contain any new recommendations. A timeline of ACIP recommendations for DTaP and Tdap during 1991–2015 is available at. This report describes the process undertaken and the rationale used in support of these recommendations and is intended for use by clinicians and public health providers as a resource.

From the late 1940s through the 1990s, vaccination against pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus with a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine was recommended for infants and young children. Receipt of DTP was commonly associated with local adverse events (e.g. redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and less commonly with serious adverse events. Because of safety concerns about the whole-cell pertussis component of DTP, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines were developed and subsequently replaced doses of DTP in the 1990s. Since 1997, infants and young children have been recommended to receive a 5-dose series of DTaP. In 2005, ACIP recommended that adolescents and adults receive a single dose of a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. After receipt of Tdap, adolescents and adults are recommended to receive a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. In 2012, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, ACIP recommended a dose of Tdap for women during each pregnancy.

Changes to the previous schedules † include the following:

Several new references were added, including the 2014 adult immunization schedule for vaccination recommendations for persons aged ≥ 19 years. Recommendations for persons who have been vaccinated before the minimum age/interval between doses of vaccine in a series also were added.
Figure 1, "Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons Aged 0 through 18 Years": – Legend for the meningococcal conjugate vaccine row updated to reflect recommendation for use of MenACWY–CRM vaccine as early as age 2 months. – Pages 4 through 6 contain combined footnotes for each vaccine related to routine vaccination, catch-up vaccination, § and vaccination of persons with high-risk medical conditions or under special circumstances.
Standardized formatting used for footnotes for each vaccine to reflect the number of vaccine doses in a particular series. – Meningococcal conjugate vaccine footnotes updated to reflect recent recommendations for use of MCV4-CRM in high-risk persons aged 2 months and older. – Footnotes organized to reflect vaccine recommendations for each high-risk condition. – Influenza vaccine footnotes updated to provide guidance for dosing for children aged 6 months through 8 years for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. – Pneumococcal vaccine footnotes updated to provide guidance for vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions. – Hepatitis A vaccine footnotes updated to provide guidance for unvaccinated persons who are at increased risk for infection.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger-United States, 2017 [^116B5Dtg]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Figure 3. A new figure, "Figure 3. Vaccines that might be indicated for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger based on medical indications", has been added. The purpose of this figure is to do the following:

Demonstrate most children with medical conditions can (and should) be vaccinated according to the routine child/adolescent immunization schedule.
Indicate when a medical condition is a precaution or contraindication to vaccination.
Indicate when additional doses of vaccines may be necessary because of a child's or adolescent's medical condition. Providers should consult the relevant footnotes for additional information.

Footnotes. Changes to the footnotes for the figures are as follows:

The Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) footnote was revised to reflect that the birth dose of HepB should be administered within 24 hours of birth.
The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) footnote was revised to more clearly present recommendations following an inadvertently early administered fourth dose of DTaP.
Within the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) footnote, Comvax was removed from the routine vaccination portion of footnote. This vaccine has been removed from the market, and all available doses have expired. Additionally, Hiberix has been added to the list of vaccines that may be used for the primary vaccination series.
Within the pneumococcal vaccine footnote, references to 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) have been removed. All healthy children who might have received PCV7 as part of a primary series have now aged out of the recommendation for pneumococcal vaccine.
The influenza vaccine footnote has been updated to indicate that LAIV should not be used during the 2016–2017 influenza season.
The meningococcal vaccines footnote has been updated to include recommendations for meningococcal vaccination of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to reflect recommendations for the use of a 2-dose Trumenba (meningococcal B vaccine) schedule.
The tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) footnote for vaccination of pregnant adolescents between gestational weeks 27–36 has been updated to reflect a preference for vaccination earlier during this period. Currently available data suggest that vaccinating earlier in the 27 through 36–week period will maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant.
The footnote for HPV vaccine has been updated to include the new 2-dose schedule for persons initiating the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years. In addition, bivalent HPV vaccine has been removed from the schedule. This vaccine has been removed from the U.S. market, and all available vaccine doses have expired.

### Randomized controlled trial of the safety and immunogenicity of revaccination with tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in adults 10 years after a previous dose [^1174wFL8]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Although this study is, to our knowledge, the largest clinical trial of revaccination with Tdap to date, it had several limitations. Participants recruited in the United States were those who had participated previously in a Tdap vaccine clinical trial and therefore might not be representative of the general population. This limitation was somewhat offset by our recruitment in Canada, where participants who had previously received the same brand of Tdap vaccine as part of the routine immunization schedule were recruited from the general population. Most important is that this study evaluated only repeat Tdap vaccination after an interval of approximately 10 years. At the time the study was designed and the interval selected, antibody persistence data and results of modeling studies had suggested that 10 years would be the optimal interval for Tdap boosters. Studies of recent pertussis outbreaks among Tdap-vaccinated adolescents suggest more rapid waning of protection. Although data exist to support the safety and tolerability of tetanus-, diphtheria-, and pertussis-containing vaccines administered at an interval as short as 1 month, data from direct evaluations of Tdap revaccination at intervals less than 4 to 5 years are not yet available.

The results of this study provide additional data to support the use of booster doses of Tdap to maintain protection against pertussis in adults. Although the results provide reassurance about the safety and tolerability of and immunogenicity conferred by repeat Tdap booster doses, advisory committees still need to determine the optimal interval for booster doses by using data provided by routine pertussis surveillance and outbreak evaluations. Although the results of economic analyses have suggested that adult immunization with Tdap vaccine is cost-effective, those models have assumed an approximate duration of protection of 10 years. The cost-effectiveness of booster strategies with an interval of 3 to 4 years is not clear; more important is that the logistical ability to deliver such a program is questionable. In the United States, people who received their first Tdap vaccine dose as an adolescent are now approaching the age at which they are recommended to receive a decennial Td vaccine booster. Some providers might find it convenient or necessary (eg, because of the availability of vaccine or during an outbreak) to give such a booster as Tdap. Data from our trial would support this decision.

Data on the use of > 1 Tdap dose in the catch-up immunization schedule are limited. One double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 460 adults aged ≥ 40 years who had not received a diphtheria or tetanus vaccination for ≥ 20 years or who had an unknown vaccination history. Subjects were randomized to receive either 3 doses of a Tdap formulation; 1 Tdap-inactivated polio vaccine combination dose, which is not licensed in the United States, followed by 2 Td doses; or 3 Td doses at 0, 1, and 6 months. There was no significant difference in adverse events for subjects receiving 3 Tdap doses, compared with those receiving 3 Td doses, and no significant differences in diphtheria and tetanus seroprotection rates among the three groups. An analysis of data collected as part of a published VSD retrospective study identified 13,599 persons who had received an initial dose of Tdap and then received another Td-containing vaccine within 12 months of the previous Tdap dose, either a second Tdap (11,687, 86%) or Td (1,912, 16%). There was no elevated risk for medical visits for adverse events among those who received a subsequent dose of Tdap compared with those who received Td (CDC/VSD, unpublished data, 2019). Among 34,804 reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following receipt of Tdap in nonpregnant and pregnant persons of all ages during January 1, 1990–June 30, 2019, 88 (0.3%) persons had received multiple Tdap doses spaced ≤ 12 months apart. Among this small group of reports, 21 (24%) were associated with adverse events, the most frequent of which was injection site reactions (8, 38%) (CDC, unpublished data, 2019).

Inadvertent Administration

Persons aged ≥ 7 years. DTaP is not indicated for persons aged ≥ 7 years. If DTaP is administered inadvertently to a fully vaccinated † child aged 7–9 years, an adolescent Tdap dose should be administered at age 11–12 years. If DTaP is administered inadvertently to an undervaccinated child aged 7–9 years, this dose should count as the Tdap dose of the catch-up series, and the child should receive an adolescent Tdap dose at age 11–12 years. If DTaP is administered inadvertently to a person aged ≥ 10 years, this dose should count as the adolescent Tdap dose routinely administered at age 11–12 years.

Fully vaccinated children aged 7–10 years. If a fully vaccinated child aged 7–9 years receives Tdap, the Tdap dose should not be counted as valid. The adolescent Tdap dose should be administered as recommended when this child is aged 11–12 years. The preferred age at administration for the adolescent Tdap dose is 11–12 years. However, if Tdap is administered at age 10 years, the Tdap dose may count as the adolescent Tdap dose.

### Randomized controlled trial of the safety and immunogenicity of revaccination with tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in adults 10 years after a previous dose [^1154nEQS]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Pertussis vaccine has been a cornerstone of pediatric vaccination schedules for nearly 8 decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all children receive a primary series of pertussis vaccine during infancy and booster doses depending on local epidemiology and resources. Although various immunization schedules are used, in North America, children receive pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months of age and a preschool dose at 4 to 6 years of age. An adolescent booster dose with a reduced-antigen formulation of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) is given routinely in a number of jurisdictions. In North America, adults who have never received a Tdap vaccine are recommended to receive a single dose in place of the decennial tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster.

On the basis of antibody-persistence data and modeling studies, protection after the adolescent or adult dose of Tdap vaccine was predicted to persist for up to 10 years. However, results of studies of pertussis outbreaks among adolescents suggested that the effectiveness of Tdap vaccine may wane more rapidly. Several studies reported the safety and immunogenicity of a repeat dose of Tdap vaccine given after an interval of 5 or 10 years, which led to regulatory approval in Canada for repeated Tdap dosing in adults. We performed a large clinical trial to compare the tolerability and immunogenicity of a repeat dose of Tdap vaccine to that of Td vaccine in adults previously immunized with Tdap vaccine to support regulatory approval of a repeat dose of Tdap in the United States.

Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) has a minimum age of 7 years. Children aged 7 years through 10 years who are not fully immunized against pertussis should receive a dose of Tdap after their seventh birthday, and if Tdap is administered at age 7 years through 10 years, another dose of Tdap should be administered between 11 years and 12 years of age. Individuals aged 11 years through 18 years who have not received Tdap should receive a dose of the vaccine followed by a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine (either Tdap or tetanus, diphtheria [Td]) booster every 10 years thereafter. Administer one dose of Tdap vaccine to pregnant girls and women during each pregnancy (during 27 through 36 weeks gestation and preferred at 27 through 31 weeks gestation) regardless of the time since prior Tdap or Td vaccination.

Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap/Td) — For adults and adolescents with HIV, administer one dose 0.5 mL IM Tdap (Adacel or Boostrix), followed by one dose of Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks after Tdap and another dose of Td or Tdap 6 months to 12 months later, then give Td or Tdap every 10 years (AII). For those who did not receive Tdap at age 11 years or older, give one dose 0.5 mL IM Tdap (Adacel or Boostrix), then Td or Tdap every 10 years (AII), and if indicated, give Tdap regardless of when the last dose of Td was given. In pregnancy, give Tdap preferably in early part of gestational weeks 27–36 (AIII) and one dose of Tdap is indicated for each pregnancy, with boosters to give Td or Tdap every 10 years after Tdap. Additional notes: ideally, dose should be given at least 14 days prior to delivery, and Tdap can be substituted for any Td dose and is always preferred as the first dose.

Changes in the 2020 Adult Immunization Schedule

Changes in the 2020 adult immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 19 years include new or revised recommendations for hepatitis A vaccine (HepA); human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV); influenza vaccine; serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB); pneumococcal vaccine; and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Following are the changes to the cover page, Table 1, Table 2, and Notes.

Cover page

Trademark symbols (®) were added to all vaccine trade names.
PedvaxHIB was added to the table of trade names for Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.
The footnote on the cover page has been edited and now reads "Do not restart or add doses to vaccine series if there are extended intervals between doses".

### Vaccination of adults with cancer: ASCO guideline [^115dFeh9]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — recommended immunizations for adults with cancer specify the following schedules: Influenza for all ages is given annually; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for adults 60 years and older is given once; COVID-19 for all ages follows the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) schedule for immunocompromised; tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) or tetanus and diphtheria (Td) for 19 years and older is one dose of Tdap followed by Td or Tdap booster every 10 years; hepatitis B for adults 20 years and older uses high antigen (40 μg) administered as a three-dose Recombivax HB series (0, 1, 6 months) or a four-dose Engerix-B series (0, 1, 2, 6 months); recombinant zoster vaccine for 19 years and older is two doses at least 4 weeks apart; pneumococcal vaccine for 19 years and older is one dose PCV15 followed by pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) 8 weeks later or one dose PCV20, with the note that patients who previously received PCV13 only can receive one dose of PCV 20 after an interval of 1 year; and human papillomavirus (HPV) indicates 19–26 years: eligible and 27–45 years: shared decision making, with a three-dose schedule of 0, 1–2, 6-months. Administration guidance states coadministration of two or more of the recommended nonlive vaccines is acceptable and, when given on separate days, there is no recommended waiting period, but PCV-15 and PPSV-23 should be separated by at least 8 weeks, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is administered as a nasal spray, cannot be given to patients with cancer.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years – United States, 2015 [^116hsSjJ]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Changes to the previous schedules † include the following:

Figure 1, "Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons Aged 0 through 18 Years" was modified to highlight the recommendations for influenza vaccination for children 1) for live attenuated influenza vaccine, which may only be administered beginning at age 2 years, and 2) for children aged 6 months through 8 years, who need 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the first year vaccinated, and in subsequent years only require 1 dose of vaccine. Therefore, the gold bar for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) 1 or 2 doses extends from 2 through 8 years (midpoint of column for 7–10 years) and a new gold bar (1 dose) extends from 9 to 18 years to reflect these changes.
A purple bar was added for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for children aged 6–11 months, denoting the recommendation to vaccinate such children if they will travel or live abroad.
Pages 4 through 6 contain combined footnotes for each vaccine related to routine vaccination, catch-up vaccination, § and vaccination of persons with high-risk medical conditions or special circumstances.
Standardized formatting is used for footnotes for each vaccine to reflect the number of vaccine doses in a particular series.
The diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine footnote has language added stating if the fourth dose DTaP vaccine was administered 4 months or more after the third dose, at an appropriate age, it can be counted as a valid dose, and need not be repeated after the recommended 6-month interval between doses 3 and 4.
The meningococcal conjugate vaccine footnote was revised to more clearly present recommendations for use of MenACWY-CRM, MenACWY-D, and Hib-MenCY-TT in children aged 2 months and older with anatomic or functional asplenia, or with persistent complement deficiencies.
The influenza vaccine footnote was updated to reflect revised contraindications for LAIV: LAIV should not be administered to some persons, including 1) persons who have experienced severe allergic reactions to LAIV, any of its components, or to a previous dose of any other influenza vaccine; 2) children aged 2 through 17 years receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products; 3) persons who are allergic to eggs; 4) pregnant women; 5) immunosuppressed persons; 6) children aged 2 through 4 years with asthma or who had wheezing in the past 12 months; and 7) persons who have taken influenza antiviral medications in the previous 48 hours. All other contraindications and precautions to use of LAIV are available at.
The pneumococcal vaccine footnote was updated to provide clearer guidance for vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions: – Administer 1 dose of PCV13 if any incomplete schedule of 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) was received previously. – Administer 2 doses of PCV13 at least 8 weeks apart if unvaccinated or any incomplete schedule of fewer than 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) was received previously.
Figure 2, Catch-Up Immunization Schedule: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap), and varicella vaccine catch-up schedules were updated to provide more clarity. Minimum ages were noted as "not-applicable" for children aged 7 years and older for hepatitis A and B, polio, meningococcal, MMR, and varicella vaccines.

### Higher tetanus toxoid immunity 2 years after PsA-TT introduction in Mali [^114m9og4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that 3 doses of a TT-containing vaccine be administered in the first year of life as part of routine immunization programs with 2 booster doses of TT-containing vaccines given during childhood followed by vaccination of pregnant women to prevent neonatal tetanus. Meeting the Global Vaccine Action Plan's (GVAP) target of 90% coverage nationally and > 80% coverage with at least 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine in every district by 2015 remains a challenge for many low- and middle-income countries. By 2013, an estimated 66% of countries achieved the former target, and by 2012, 30% achieved the latter target worldwide. Evidence suggests that 3 doses of TT-containing vaccine in the first year of life provides 3–5 years of protection, a booster dose between 4 and 7 years of age protects through adolescence, and another booster in adolescence protects through adulthood for 20–30 years. However, vaccination schedules and vaccination coverage vary by country. In Mali, national immunization includes administration of pentavalent diphtheria, TT, pertussis, H. influenzae, and hepatitis B vaccine at 6, 10, and 14 weeks, with additional TT vaccination during pregnancy. Mali does not administer adolescent TT boosters as part of its routine immunization program. WHO-UNICEF estimates that in 2010, 82% of 12- to 23-month-olds in Mali received at least 1 dose of TT-containing vaccine, and 76% received all 3 recommended Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) doses.

Tetanus remains an ongoing challenge in some low- and middle-income countries, and an estimated 58 000 neonatal deaths due to tetanus occurred worldwide in 2010. Several countries located in the African meningitis belt, including Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Chad had not eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus as of mid-2014; only 11% of countries in the African region achieved both of the GVAP coverage goals by 2012. Enhanced protection against tetanus might be achieved as a result of vaccination with PsA-TT. To determine whether PsA-TT boosts tetanus immunity, we assessed the impact of the PsA-TT in Mali on population-level TT immunity by quantifying TT-specific IgG levels before and 2 years after the December 2010 PsA-TT mass vaccination campaign.

### Adverse reactions to vaccines practice parameter 2012 update [^113RwPMt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines and Tdap — About 5% of immunizations cause large local swelling at the injection site. The recommended interval between doses of Td had been 10 years, but a recent study showed the rate of Tdap injection-site reactions was the same in patients who had received Td less than 2 years previously or more than 2 years previously, and another study found no higher rates when a Tdap-containing vaccine was administered 1 month after a Td-containing vaccine or placebo. With the pertussis disease burden continuing to be substantial, it is now recommended that Tdap be given to all adolescents and adults (including those ≥ 65 years of age), regardless of the interval since the last Td.

### Noninfluenza vaccination coverage among adults-United States, 2011 [^1133gDyS]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Vaccinations are recommended throughout life to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequelae. Adult vaccination coverage, however, remains low for most routinely recommended vaccines and well below Healthy People 2020 targets. * In October 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved the adult immunization schedule for 2013. Apart from influenza vaccination, which is now recommended for all adults, other vaccines recommended for adults target different populations based on age, certain medical conditions, behavioral risk factors (e.g. injection drug use), occupation, travel, and other indications. To assess adult (aged ≥ 19 years) vaccination coverage for select vaccines, CDC analyzed data from the 2011 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis for pneumococcal vaccine, tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines (including tetanus and diphtheria toxoid [Td] with acellular pertussis vaccine [Tdap]), and hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster (shingles), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, by selected characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, † and vaccination target criteria). Influenza vaccination coverage estimates for the 2011–12 influenza season have been published separately. Compared with 2010, the data indicate modest increases in Tdap vaccination among persons aged 19–64 years and HPV vaccination among women, but only little improvement in coverage for the other vaccines among adults in the United States. Coverage for tetanus vaccination (with any tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine) during the past 10 years was unchanged. Substantial increases in vaccination coverage are needed to reduce the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases among adults. The Community Preventive Services Task Force and other authorities have recommended that health-care providers incorporate vaccination needs assessment, recommendation, and offer of vaccination into routine clinical practice for adult patients.

Notes

Edits have been made throughout the Notes section to harmonize language between the child/adolescent immunization schedule and the adult immunization schedule, where possible.
A new subsection entitled "Shared Clinical Decision-Making" was added for each vaccine that includes this new ACIP recommendation (e.g. for HPV, PCV13, and MenB).
Hepatitis A: The note was revised to include minor changes to the chronic liver disease definition, minor changes for the pregnancy indication, addition of the recommendation for vaccination in settings of exposure, and removal of clotting factor disorders as an indication for vaccination.
Hepatitis B: The note was revised to include minor changes to the chronic liver disease definition and minor changes for the pregnancy indication.
Human papillomavirus: The note was revised to indicate that HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≤ 26 years. A shared clinical decision-making subsection was added for persons aged 27–45 years.
Influenza: The note was updated to include a bulleted list indicating when live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) should not be used and minor edits to the guidance for persons with a history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Measles, mumps, and rubella: The note was revised to clarify recommendations for health care personnel, with a separate bullet for personnel born in 1957 or later with no evidence of immunity and for health care personnel born before 1957 with no evidence of immunity.
Meningococcal: The note was revised to include the use of the complement inhibitor ravulizumab as an indication for MenB administration in these patients. A shared clinical decision-making subsection was added that includes a bullet for adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years who are not at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Under the "Special situations" section, the recommendation to administer a booster dose of MenB 1 year after the primary series and to revaccinate every 2–3 years if the risk remains was added.
Pneumococcal: The note has been updated to reflect the updated recommendations for vaccination of immunocompetent (defined as adults without an immunocompromising condition, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implants) adults aged ≥ 65 years. One dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) is still recommended. Shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding administration of PCV13 to immunocompetent persons aged ≥ 65 years.
Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis: The note has been updated to indicate that Td or Tdap may be used in situations where only Td vaccine was indicated for the decennial tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis booster vaccination, tetanus prophylaxis for wound management, and catch-up vaccination.
Varicella: The note has been updated to indicate that vaccination may be considered for persons with HIV infection without evidence of varicella immunity who have CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/ μ L.

### Clinical progress note: pertussis [^1127QkUm]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

PERTUSSIS VACCINE AND RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE

Outbreaks of pertussis were initially described in the 16th century with the bacteria isolated in 1906. While the combined whole‐cell pertussis and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTP) vaccine was licensed in 1914 and became available for routine infant immunization in 1948, the acellular pertussis and diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (DTaP) vaccine was developed in 1992 and associated with less adverse events, replacing doses of the whole‐cell DTP vaccine in the United States in 1997. Today, all pertussis vaccines in the United States are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. The Tdap vaccine, formulated for adolescents and adults, contains reduced quantities of diphtheria toxoid and some pertussis antigens compared with DTaP.

The vaccine schedule approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends five doses of pertussis‐containing vaccines for children before 6 years of age. The first dose of DTaP is recommended at 2 months of age, followed by two additional doses, each separated by 2 months. Public health authorities may recommend immunization as early as 6 weeks of age with intervals as short as 4 weeks between the second and third doses during a community pertussis outbreak. The fourth dose is recommended at 15 through 18 months, and the fifth dose is advised at 4 through 6 years. The DTaP vaccine is available in combination with other recommended vaccines for the primary vaccination series. A booster dose is recommended for adolescents 11 years and older with Tdap. In the event of a pertussis infection, no interval between disease and immunization is needed, and the age‐appropriate doses should be given to complete the immunization series on schedule as the duration of immunity from infection remains uncertain. Tdap is also recommended during each pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks of gestation to maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant along with immunizing all close contacts in hopes of protecting young infants from pertussis, a strategy known as cocooning.

### Current recommendations for vaccines for patients planning pregnancy: a committee opinion [^114s56R9]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Summary — vaccination for individuals planning pregnancy outlines that vaccination in individuals of reproductive age before or during pregnancy confers resistance to intrauterine infections and provides the newborn with passive immunity to neonatal infections, and immunization schedules are best completed before beginning treatment for infertility because some vaccinations should not be administered during pregnancy. Rubella, measles, and varicella immunity should be documented before pregnancy; if nonimmune, the vaccine should be administered, and pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for individuals who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy because COVID-19 infection increases the risk of complications during pregnancy. The influenza and tetanus-diphtheria immunizations should be completed before pregnancy but can be administered during pregnancy, the inactivated influenza vaccine can be given anytime during pregnancy, and Tdap should be given preferably during the third trimester or late second trimester. Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and meningococcal vaccinations may be indicated in some circumstances during pregnancy when benefits exceed risks, and live attenuated vaccines, including MMR, varicella, and live attenuated influenza vaccines, are contraindicated during pregnancy.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^113utri2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (wound management), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to prefer a dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine when a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine is indicated in individuals aged ≥ 11 years who have not previously received tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis or whose tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis history is unknown.

§ Persons with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunization.

¶ Yes, if > 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

 Yes, if ≥ 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

Persons who have completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series and have received a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine < 5 years earlier are protected against tetanus and do not require a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine or TIG as part of wound management. An attempt should be made to determine whether a patient has completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. Persons who have not completed the primary series might require tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 6). When both TIG and a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine are indicated, the products should be administered using separate syringes at different anatomical sites. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunizations.

Persons with a history of an Arthus reaction following a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine until > 10 years after the most recent dose; this interval is recommended regardless of the wound condition (e.g. even if contaminated or severe). In all circumstances, the decision to administer TIG should be based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus (Table 6).

Postlicensure Tdap Effectiveness

Following the 2005 Tdap recommendation for adolescents and adults, postlicensure pertussis vaccine effectiveness estimates for Tdap in settings with similar vaccines and recommendation schedules have ranged from 66% to 78% among adolescents who received both DTP and DTaP as children. Among adolescents who received only DTaP as children, in a matched case-control study, the overall estimated vaccine effectiveness of Tdap against pertussis was 63.9% (95% CI = 50%–74%) (29). Initial vaccine effectiveness against pertussis within one year of Tdap vaccination was 73% (95% CI = 60%–82%), but after 2–4 years, postvaccination vaccine effectiveness decreased to 34% (95% CI = -0.03%–58%) (29). Another study that calculated Tdap vaccine effectiveness among adolescents found that, within the first year after vaccination, effectiveness was 68.8% (95% CI = 59.7%–75.9%); by ≥ 4 years after vaccination, vaccine effectiveness was 8.9% (95% CI = -30.6%–36.4%). As observed with DTaP, Tdap vaccine effectiveness declines substantially with increasing time since vaccination (29). Although there are no studies estimating Tdap vaccine effectiveness in persons who received only DTP as infants, reported rates of pertussis have been observed to be significantly lower among children who had started their vaccination series with DTP than among those who had started with DTaP.

Immunization

Childhood immunization

While global PCV use has rapidly increased with approximately 142 countries introducing it as of 2018, uptake of childhood immunization in LMICs is still sub-optimal. In 2017, PCV-13 coverage globally was estimated at 44%, with estimates for LMICs, specifically Eastern and Southern Africa at 75%, West and Central Africa at 60%, Middle East and North Africa at 40%, Latin America at 77%, South Asia at 23%, and East Asia and Pacific at 15%. Considerable socio-economic inequalities in coverage of the Diptheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccine (DTP3), which is used as a proxy for other vaccines administered at 14 weeks including Hib and PCV, have been identified in LMIC settings. In 2017, DTP3 coverage was estimated at 72% in the WHO African region, falling short of the WHO recommended goal of > 90%. The Global Pertussis Initiative recommends that countries using whole cell pertussis continue to use it to improve primary and toddler booster vaccination coverage. Significant delays exist between scheduled administration age and actual vaccination date, especially for measles vaccine where < 40% are administered on schedule.

### Mortality reduction benefits and intussusception risks of rotavirus vaccination in 135 low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis of current and alternative schedules [^115Bzzam]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Added value of this study

This analysis, based on updated evidence, provides continued reassurance about the highly positive benefit–risk profile of infant rotavirus vaccines. It provides modelled estimates of the number of rotavirus gastroenteritis and intussusception deaths for a range of different rotavirus vaccination schedules and scenarios. These results can be scrutinised at the national level and used to inform decision making in low-income and middle-income countries.

Implications of all the available evidence

This analysis supports the WHO recommendations to include rotavirus vaccination in national immunisation programmes and to remove age restrictions in countries where the mortality reduction benefits of late vaccination greatly exceed the risks. Schedules that involve giving the first dose with BCG and the second dose with diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis 1 could further increase effect and reduce risks, but more studies are required to assess their safety. There is a need for improved estimates of the proportion of children with timely access to intussusception treatment.

The scale of benefits and risks due to rotavirus vaccination will depend on the choice of vaccination schedule. For programmatic and economic reasons, rotavirus vaccines are currently co-administered with diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP)-containing vaccines in the first 6 months of life. More than half the countries in the world have introduced rotavirus vaccines. Countries either give two doses with DTP1 and DTP2, or three doses with DTP1, DTP2, and DTP3 as per current WHO recommendations. Randomised controlled trials using these schedules have shown high and durable rotavirus vaccine efficacy in high-income countries but lower and less durable efficacy in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). These trials have stimulated interest in the potential value of a neonatal dose given at the same time as BCG, a booster dose given with the first dose of measles vaccine (Meas1), or both. A neonatal dose has the potential to prevent disease that occurs very early in life and has been shown to be highly efficacious in Indonesia when administered as part of a three-dose schedule. A booster dose has the potential to mitigate the effects of waning rotavirus vaccine protection and has been shown to be non-interfering and immune-boosting in trials. The optimal number and timing of doses (concurrent with different combinations of BCG, DTP1, DTP2, DTP3, and Meas1) will depend on several factors, including the balance of benefits to risks.

Changes in the 2024 Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule

Changes to the recommendations for vaccines and related agents in the 2024 immunization schedule for children and adolescents aged ≤ 18 years include new or updated recommendations for influenza vaccine, pneumococcal vaccines, respiratory syncytial virus monoclonal antibody (RSV-mAb), respiratory syncytial virus vaccines (RSV), COVID-19 vaccines, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), Mpox vaccine (Mpox), and meningococcal serogroups A, B, C, W, Y vaccine (MenACWY-TT/MenB-FHbp). Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid adsorbed vaccine (DT), 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), bivalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, and meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-D, Menactra) were deleted from all sections of the schedule, because these products are no longer distributed or recommended for use in children and adolescents in the United States.

Other changes include clarification of the recommendations for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib), human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB), and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Substantial revisions were made to Table 3, which outlines the immunization schedule by medical indication. The definitions for the legend colors were revised to better highlight additional vaccination recommendations for each medical condition and to harmonize with the adult immunization schedule. Finally, a new addendum section was added, which will list new and updated ACIP recommendations that occur before the next annual update to the child and adolescent immunization schedule.

### Timing of monovalent vaccine administration in infants receiving DTaP-based combination vaccines in the United States [^115Qg1AZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

One potential explanation for this finding is that the recommended timing of Hib doses (2, 4 and, if Hib-tetanus toxoid conjugate is used, 6 months of age) is the same as DTaP-HepB-IPV. The same is true for PCV, the schedule for which matches both pentavalent DTaP-based vaccines. On the other hand, the recommended HepB schedule calls for doses at birth, 1–2 months and 6–18 months of age. While the second and third doses of HepB can potentially align with the DTaP-IPV/Hib schedule, in that HepB (dose 2) at 2 and 6 months (dose 3) would be appropriate, these data suggest that HepB doses for a large number of infants are being separated from doses of DTaP-IPV/Hib. Administration of the third HepB dose was clustered around both 6 and 9 months of age and the proportion of children who received the third dose at 9 months increased over time. To our knowledge, this pattern has not been previously documented and merit further investigation. Infants on a DTaP-IPV/Hib schedule are eligible to receive HepB, PCV and RV at the 6-month visit. Perceived pain and crying due to multiple injections are a common reason for parental requests to delay vaccination. As the maximum age for the third RV dose is 8 months, as recommended by the ACIP, it is plausible that the third HepB dose is delayed to the 9-month visit to alleviate parental concerns, and this practice has grown over time. ACIP recommends administering all vaccines for which a person is eligible at the same visit to increase the likelihood of series completion by the appropriate age. Nearly 25% of infants in the United States follow an alternative vaccine schedule. The use of a hexavalent vaccine in the United States would result in 1–4 fewer injections in the childhood vaccination schedule (depending on the current schedule in use), potentially mitigating a key driver of requests for delays.

### Tetanus: recognition and management [^1156pidi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Over 90% of tetanus deaths occur in South/South East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, C. tetani is distributed worldwide, with 32–92 cases diagnosed each year in the European Union/European Economic Area; 17–33 in the United States; and 4–11 in the UK. Despite being notifiable, a study of hospital records from 2001–2014 suggested that cases in England were under-reported by 88%. There appears to be seasonality in Europe, with highest incidence in July, and a second peak in October. This likely reflects increased outdoor activity, which carries risks of skin breaks and wound contamination.

WHO has recommended universal childhood tetanus toxoid vaccination since 1974. Serial vaccination is key. This induces a potent IgG response; antibodies are transmitted transplacentally and vaccinating girls therefore prevents neonatal tetanus. Primary immunisation with a three-dose regimen provides near-total protection against clinical disease, maintained for at least 5 years. Children in Britain receive a primary course at 2, 3, and 4 months, with pre-school and teenage booster doses. This five-dose regimen is probably sufficient to confer lifelong immunity, though WHO recommends six, and global booster schedules vary.

As of 2022, 92% of children in the UK were fully vaccinated, similar to other high-income anglophone countries. However, there is no herd immunity, and with growing concerns about parental vaccine hesitancy, and interruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, inquiring about childhood vaccination status is crucial. Conflict and natural disasters can also affect vaccination coverage, even in countries with historically robust programmes.

Major risk factors for tetanus include advanced age, injecting drug use, and diabetes mellitus. Sporadic tetanus outbreaks in the UK have been linked to contaminated heroin. Older individuals are at particular risk; they are more likely to have been born before the rollout of universal childhood vaccination, and vaccine-induced antibody levels diminish with age. Cases are more frequent in men, reflecting unsafe circumcision practices, and lower vaccination rates due to WHO's maternal vaccination focus.

Methods

Periodically, ACIP reviews available information to inform the development or revision of its vaccine recommendations. In February 2009, the ACIP Pertussis Vaccines Work Group was formed to review and revise previously published vaccine recommendations for DTaP, DT, Td, TT, and Tdap because of 1) the availability of new licensed DTaP vaccine products since 1997; 2) multiple ACIP updates to the adolescent and adult Tdap recommendations; 3) new U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) age indications for both Tdap vaccine products; 4) the need to incorporate pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccine recommendations into a single document; 5) new data on Tdap coverage, impact, and vaccine effectiveness; and 6) the discontinuation of TT vaccine manufacturing and availability in the United States. The work group held teleconference meetings monthly from April 2009 through April 2015. In addition to ACIP members, the work group included participants from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the Association of Immunization Managers, CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, FDA, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the National Institute of Health, and other infectious disease experts. *

### Are maternal vaccines effective and safe for mothers and infants? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116FsJHq]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Maternal vaccination is the administration of vaccines to pregnant women to confer immune protection. It is a promising public health strategy to prevent infectious diseases in both mothers and their infants. Mothers are more susceptible to infections due to physiological and immunological adaptations during pregnancy. Infants are vulnerable to infections in the first months of life due to their immature immune system. Subsequently, vaccine-induced maternal pathogen-specific IgG antibodies, which transfer across the placenta, contribute to improving maternal and infant health.

Previous systematic reviews support the efficacy and safety of maternal inactivated influenza vaccination and maternal tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccination. Both maternal influenza and Tdap vaccination are, therefore, recommended for all pregnant women by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). On the other hand, the CDC does not recommend routine vaccination with live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), varicella vaccine and zoster vaccine. Some vaccines are recommended in specific circumstances only, such as meningococcal (ACWY and B), hepatitis A and B, polio, and tetanus and diphtheria (Td).

Interest in other maternal vaccinations has increased significantly over time. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the introduction and CDC recommendation of a third vaccine administered during pregnancy protecting pregnant women and their infants against COVID-19. The development of other maternal vaccines is ongoing. Maternal group B streptococcus (GBS) vaccine is in phase II trials, whereas maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine is in phase III trials.

With these upcoming maternal vaccines, providing a clear and complete overview helps implement research-based recommendations in national clinical and practice guidelines. To our knowledge, no systematic review and meta-analysis has yet addressed the efficacy and safety of all available maternal vaccinations. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy and safety of vaccines administered to pregnant women, compared with placebo or no intervention, in both mothers and infants.

### Noninfluenza vaccination coverage among adults-United States, 2012 [^1151oRyu]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Vaccinations are recommended throughout life to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequelae. Adult vaccination coverage, however, remains low for most routinely recommended vaccines and well below Healthy People 2020 targets. * In October 2013, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) approved the adult immunization schedule for 2014. With the exception of influenza vaccination, which is recommended for all adults each year, vaccinations recommended for adults target different populations based on age, health conditions, behavioral risk factors (e.g. injection drug use), occupation, travel, and other indications. To assess vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥ 19 years for selected vaccines, CDC analyzed data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis for pneumococcal, tetanus toxoid–containing (tetanus and diphtheria vaccine [Td] or tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis vaccine [Tdap]), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster (shingles), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines by selected characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, † and vaccination target criteria). Influenza vaccination coverage estimates for the 2012–13 influenza season have been published separately. Compared with 2011, only modest increases occurred in Tdap vaccination among adults aged 19–64 years, herpes zoster vaccination among adults aged ≥ 60 years, and HPV vaccination among women aged 19–26 years; coverage among adults in the United States for the other vaccines did not improve. Racial/ethnic gaps in coverage persisted for all six vaccines and widened for Tdap, herpes zoster, and HPV vaccination. Increases in vaccination coverage are needed to reduce the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases among adults. The Community Preventive Services Task Force and other authorities have recommended that health-care providers incorporate vaccination needs assessment, recommendation, and offer of vaccination into routine clinical practice for adult patients.

Interval of Tdap After Td

When Tdap was licensed in 2005, the safety of administering a dose of Tdap at intervals < 5 years after Td or pediatric DTP/DTaP had not been studied. Evaluations of the safety of administering Tdap at intervals < 5 years after Td, including as short as 18 months, suggest that the safety of much shorter intervals is acceptable. Two studies were conducted in adults who received a Tdap or combined Tdap-inactivated polio (Tdap-IPV) vaccine < 2 years following a previous Td-containing vaccine. Observed adverse events were limited to local reactions, including pain (68%–83%), erythema (20%–25%), and swelling (19%–38%). Although serious adverse events did not occur, the numbers of subjects in these studies were small and the potential for rare, but serious, adverse events cannot be excluded. ACIP concluded that although longer intervals between Td and Tdap vaccination could decrease the occurrence of local reactions, the benefits of protection against pertussis outweigh the potential risk for adverse events.

Persons Aged 7–10 Years

ACIP concluded that the overall safety of Tdap and the frequency of local reactions in persons aged 7–10 years who have not completed the childhood DTaP series likely would be similar to those observed in children who received 4 doses of DTaP. Although both Tdap products are approved for use in persons as young as age 10 years, no data have been published regarding the safety of Tdap in children aged 7–9 years who have never received pertussis-containing vaccines. Several studies assessing the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap or Tdap-IPV as the fifth dose of acellular pertussis vaccine in children aged 4–8 years were reviewed. No increase in the risk for severe local reactions or systemic adverse events was observed. The most commonly reported adverse events that occurred within 15 days after receipt of Tdap were pain (40%–56%), erythema (34%–53%), and swelling (24%–45%). Fewer local reactions were observed or reported among Tdap or Tdap-IPV recipients compared with those who received DTaP or DTaP-IPV, but the differences were not statistically significant. No differences were noted when children aged 4–6 and 7–8 years were compared with respect to the frequency of solicited or unsolicited adverse reactions following vaccination with Tdap-IPV.

Administration of Influenza Vaccines with Other Vaccines

In general, data regarding simultaneous or sequential administration for the many potential combinations of vaccines are limited. Therefore, following the ACIP General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization is prudent. IIVs and RIV4 may be administered concomitantly or sequentially with other inactivated vaccines or with live vaccines. Injectable vaccines that are given concomitantly should be administered at separate anatomical sites. LAIV4 may be administered simultaneously with other live or inactivated vaccines. However, following administration of a live vaccine (such as LAIV4), at least 4 weeks should pass before another live vaccine is administered.

Relatively limited data are available on the concomitant administration of influenza vaccines with other vaccines. In a study comparing the immunogenicity of IIV and live attenuated zoster vaccine given either concomitantly or separated by a 4-week interval to adults aged ≥ 50 years, antibody responses were similar for both schedules. In some studies, reduced responses have been noted to PCV13, tetanus antigens, and pertussis antigens when co-administered with IIV; in most instances the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Reassuring safety profiles have been noted for simultaneous administration of IIV with live attenuated zoster vaccine, PCV13, PPSV23 and Tdap among adults and of Tdap among pregnant women. Increased prevalence of injection site and/or systemic adverse reactions has been noted with concurrent administration in some of these studies, but these symptoms have generally been reported to be mild or moderate.

Among children, co-administration of IIV and PCV13 was associated with increased risk for fever on the day of vaccination and the day following (i.e. days 0–1 postvaccination) in children aged 6 through 23 months in a study conducted during the 2011–12 season. Increased risk for febrile seizures in this age group has been noted within days 0–1 following co-administration of IIV with PCV7, PCV13, or DTaP-containing vaccines during the 2006–07 through 2010–11 seasons, and with PCV13 during the 2014–15 season. While frightening to parents, most febrile seizures are brief and have a good prognosis. After considering risks and benefits, no changes in the recommendations for administration of these vaccines were made, and these vaccines may be given concomitantly. Surveillance of febrile seizures is ongoing through VAERS, and the VSD annual influenza vaccine safety surveillance includes monitoring for seizures following vaccination.

### Tdap vaccination coverage during pregnancy-selected sites, United States, 2006–2015 [^117RCwXK]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is recommended during the third trimester of each pregnancy to provide protection to newborns, who are at risk for pertussis-related morbidity and mortality. As part of its case-control surveillance study of medications and birth defects, the Birth Defects Study of the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University (the Birth Defects Study) has recorded data on vaccinations received during pregnancy since 2006. Among 5,606 mothers of infants without structural birth defects in this population (control group), < 1% had received Tdap vaccine before 2009. By 2012, the percentage of mothers of infants in the control group (control infants) who had received Tdap increased to approximately 9%, and then in 2013 and continuing through 2015, increased markedly, to 28% and 54%, respectively. As the prevalence of maternal Tdap vaccination increased, so did the proportion of pregnant women who received Tdap in the third trimester, as recommended (94%–100% from 2010 to 2015). The vast majority of Tdap vaccinations (96%) were received in a traditional health care setting (e.g. the office of the woman's obstetrician or primary care physician or her prenatal clinic). Increasing vaccination coverage during pregnancy could help reduce the impact of pertussis on infant morbidity and mortality.

Pertussis is a highly contagious disease, but mortality is highest among newborns: almost all pertussis-associated deaths occur within the first 2 months of life, when these infants are too young to receive primary pertussis vaccinations. To provide infants with indirect protection from pertussis, in 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended postpartum Tdap administration to mothers, but noted that the vaccine could be administered during pregnancy. * In June 2011, ACIP changed the preferred timing of Tdap administration to mothers, recommending that previously unvaccinated pregnant women should receive Tdap after 20 weeks' gestation. In October 2012, this recommendation was expanded to include all pregnant women during every pregnancy, with the optimal time for vaccination in the third trimester. A recent analysis reported 42% coverage with Tdap among pregnant women in 2013. To assess the impact of the ACIP recommendations, trends in Tdap coverage in pregnancy were examined, along with the settings in which women received their vaccinations, from 2006 through 2015, using data from the Birth Defects Study.

### Pregnancy and infection: using disease pathogenesis to inform vaccine strategy [^114qUZCU]. NPJ Vaccines (2018). Low credibility.

The half-life of maternal antibodies in infants also must be considered in vaccine development and administration. Maternal-derived IgG1 is reported to have a half-life of approximately 48 days in serum, and depending on serum antibody titers present at birth, this translates into protective immunity for approximately the first 3–9 months of life for most infant pathogens. The half-life of the antibody also dictates the vaccination schedules for infants, as the presence of maternal-derived antibody interferes with vaccine efficacy, and it is not until maternal-derived antibody has waned below a certain threshold that an infant can mount its own active vaccine response. The goal of the infant vaccine series is to time vaccination to coincide with the time that maternal-derived antibody drops below the threshold at which it can neutralize the vaccine antigen. Because the precise timing of these events is unpredictable, infant vaccination schedules are designed so that vaccines are administered in a series that spans the duration of this window, and minimize susceptibility to natural infection. In the United States, infant vaccines are recommended at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.

Bordetella pertussis is a vaccine-preventable respiratory pathogen of significant public health importance, and it is a major cause of mortality in infants lacking protective maternal immunity. Vaccination of women during pregnancy, however, significantly enhances the transfer of maternal antibody to the fetus, and these newborns are 11 times more likely to have protective antibody titers at birth compared with those born from women who were not vaccinated during pregnancy. Inactivated pertussis antigen is combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids in a single vaccine (Tdap), which the CDC ACIP recommends for all pregnant women, regardless of previous vaccine history. In contrast to vaccine formulations that contain killed whole B. pertussis organisms, the Tdap vaccine contains only select antigens and confers relatively weak and only transient protective immunity that declines after 1 year. Vaccination of women either prior to conception or during early pregnancy does not provide adequate neonatal protection against pertussis. Consequently, the CDC considers the third trimester to be the optimal time to administer the Tdap vaccine to pregnant women. Adverse events reported following Tdap vaccination are generally mild, and there are no reported risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes related to Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. Despite consistent evidence that supports the benefit and safety of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, coverage remains low, with an estimated 42% of pregnant women receiving the Tdap vaccine in the United States in 2013.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management Recommendations

A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for wound management when > 5 years have passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous Tdap vaccination, either Td or Tdap may be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. Complete information on tetanus prophylaxis and the use of tetanus immunoglobulin when indicated for wound management is available at.

Vaccines for Prevention of Pertussis, Tetanus, and Diphtheria

Vaccines of different compositions, formulations, and combinations are licensed and available in the United States for different age groups to prevent pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria (Tables 4 and 5). The indication and age for vaccination might differ by vaccine product and licensure. In certain situations, the off-label use of Tdap vaccine has been recommended, including the absence of a minimum interval between the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and receipt of Tdap, catch-up vaccination for those aged 7–10 years, and vaccination of women during each pregnancy.
