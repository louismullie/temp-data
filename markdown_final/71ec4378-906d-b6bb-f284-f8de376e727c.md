## Question

A 74-year-old man with a 6-year history of Parkinson's disease presents to clinic accompanied by his daughter. Over the past year, he has developed progressive memory loss, difficulty with attention, and increasing confusion, especially in the evenings. His daughter reports that he sometimes forgets familiar routes and has trouble following conversations. He is currently managed on levodopa/carbidopa for his motor symptoms, which are reasonably controlled. On cognitive assessment, he scores 20/30 on the MMSE, with deficits in recall and executive function. There are no features suggestive of delirium or major depression. You diagnose Parkinson's disease dementia.

According to current guidelines, what pharmacological treatments should be considered for this patient's dementia, and what is the role of memantine?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacological treatments should be considered for Parkinson's disease dementia in a 74-year-old man, and what role memantine should play in management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging the severity. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic therapy and its evidence base. Next, I will examine memantine's evidence and where it fits, including any combination therapy considerations. After that, I need to check dosing, titration, and safety, especially in PD. Finally, I will integrate nonpharmacologic care, monitoring, and when to consider switching or adding agents, anchoring to guidelines and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The vignette describes cognitive decline in attention, executive function, and memory with an MMSE of 20/30, which places him in the mild-to-moderate dementia range, and the temporal profile of motor symptoms preceding cognitive decline by more than a year supports Parkinson's disease dementia rather than dementia with Lewy bodies, with no delirium or major depression identified, which aligns with standard diagnostic frameworks and staging conventions [^113e8mSg] [^117BpBq9].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: multiple high-quality sources converge on cholinesterase inhibitors as the cornerstone for PDD, with rivastigmine having the most robust and consistent evidence and regulatory approval, while donepezil and galantamine are reasonable alternatives supported by guidelines and meta-analyses showing modest but clinically meaningful improvements in cognition, global status, and activities of daily living. I initially thought only rivastigmine was FDA-approved for PDD, but hold on, I should double-check — yes, rivastigmine is the only agent with explicit FDA labeling for PDD, yet guidelines endorse the class and do not restrict use to rivastigmine alone, reflecting similar mechanisms and comparable benefits across agents [^111ixap4] [^112WC6KR] [^115RXirv] [^114bHBV6].

> I will now examine memantine's role. Memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with modest global benefits in Lewy body dementias, but evidence for cognitive improvement in PDD is inconsistent and generally weaker than cholinesterase inhibitors. Meta-analytic data suggest small global improvements without clear cognitive gains in PDD, whereas benefits appear more pronounced in DLB, so I should be cautious not to overstate its effect in pure PDD. Guidelines position memantine as a second-line or adjunctive option, particularly when cholinesterase inhibitors are not tolerated or are ineffective, rather than as first-line monotherapy in PDD [^115CZase] [^1139PVjC] [^112FDy62] [^114Uzq35].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combination therapy. I need to check whether adding memantine to a cholinesterase inhibitor helps in PDD. The evidence base is limited and mixed; some reviews suggest potential additive benefit in global outcomes, but high-quality PDD-specific data are sparse, so if considered, it should be framed as a cautious, individualized trial with close monitoring for efficacy and tolerability, rather than a standard approach. In contrast, in Alzheimer's disease, combining memantine with a cholinesterase inhibitor has more consistent support and is guideline-endorsed in moderate-to-severe disease, which informs practice patterns but cannot be directly extrapolated to PDD without reservation [^114Uzq35] [^115qaVY6] [^113AKkw5].

> Let me think about dosing and titration, and I should confirm PD-specific safety. For rivastigmine, oral 3 mg twice daily with titration every 4 weeks to 6 mg twice daily, or transdermal patch starting at 4.6 mg/24 hours and increasing to 9.5 mg/24 hours after 4 weeks, are standard; the patch may reduce GI adverse effects and tremor exacerbation, which can occur with oral formulations. For donepezil, 5 mg daily with titration to 10 mg after 4–6 weeks is typical. For memantine, 5 mg daily with weekly 5 mg increments to 10 mg twice daily is standard, with dose adjustments for renal impairment. I should also remember that abrupt withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors can worsen cognition and function, so any discontinuation should be gradual and monitored [^111ixap4] [^113AKkw5] [^112vXXh6].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic and supportive care, because medication effects are modest. I need to ensure we address caregiver education, safety planning including driving and wandering, home modifications, and advance directives. Nonpharmacologic strategies such as cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and social engagement are recommended and may confer benefits, while management of comorbidities, sleep, mood, and autonomic symptoms is essential. I should also counsel that antipsychotics carry high risk in Lewy body dementias and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, with quetiapine or clozapine considered only if essential and at the lowest effective dose with close monitoring [^113e8mSg] [^1162Mix7] [^1112H83F].

> I should confirm a monitoring plan. Reassessing cognition, function, behavior, and caregiver burden every 3–6 months is reasonable, with explicit goals such as stabilization of decline, improvement in ADLs, and reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms. If there is no perceived benefit after an adequate trial (often 3–6 months at a therapeutic dose), I should consider switching to a different cholinesterase inhibitor or adding memantine, documenting rationale and expectations. If adverse effects emerge, particularly tremor worsening with rivastigmine, switching to donepezil or galantamine or using the rivastigmine patch may mitigate cholinergic GI effects and tremor exacerbation [^115RXirv] [^1157YwH3] [^112WC6KR].

> Putting this together, my prioritized recommendation is to initiate a cholinesterase inhibitor as first-line therapy, with rivastigmine preferred given the strongest evidence base and FDA indication, while acknowledging that donepezil or galantamine are acceptable alternatives. I should start low, titrate slowly, monitor for GI effects and tremor, and reassess efficacy in 3–6 months. If not tolerated or ineffective, I should consider switching within class or adding memantine as a cautious, second-line strategy with modest and variable benefits in PDD, and I will avoid antipsychotics unless absolutely necessary due to sensitivity risk. Throughout, I will integrate nonpharmacologic interventions and align decisions with patient and caregiver goals [^111ixap4] [^112WC6KR] [^112FDy62] [^1112H83F].

For a 74-year-old with Parkinson's disease dementia, **rivastigmine is first-line** [^115RXirv] because it is the only FDA-approved agent for PDD and improves cognition, behavior, and daily function [^111ixap4] [^112WC6KR]. Donepezil or galantamine are **reasonable alternatives** if rivastigmine is not tolerated [^115RXirv] [^112WC6KR]. Memantine is **second-line** [^112FDy62] or adjunctive when cholinesterase inhibitors are ineffective or poorly tolerated, offering modest global and behavioral benefits but less consistent cognitive gains [^115CZase] [^1139PVjC]. Start low, titrate slowly, and monitor for GI effects, tremor, and falls; consider switching agents if adverse effects occur [^1157YwH3].

## First-line pharmacological treatment: cholinesterase inhibitors

### Rivastigmine

- **FDA approval**: Only cholinesterase inhibitor approved for PDD [^111ixap4].
- **Efficacy**: Improves cognition, behavior, and daily function in PDD [^111ixap4] [^112WC6KR].
- **Formulations**: Oral capsules (3–12 mg/day) or transdermal patch (4.6–13.3 mg/24 h); patch may reduce GI side effects [^111ixap4] [^114nsPfG].
- **Adverse effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, tremor, and dizziness; monitor closely during titration [^113XnxtZ].

---

### Donepezil and galantamine

- **Evidence**: Donepezil and galantamine improve cognition and global status in PDD, though evidence is less robust than for rivastigmine [^112WC6KR] [^116F3umj].
- **Guideline support**: Recommended as alternatives if rivastigmine is not tolerated [^113zN19P] [^115RXirv].
- **Adverse effects**: Similar to rivastigmine; monitor for GI effects and tremor exacerbation [^112WC6KR].

---

## Second-line pharmacological treatment: memantine

### Evidence for memantine in PDD

- **Mechanism**: NMDA receptor antagonist reducing excitotoxicity [^111X9bzq].
- **Efficacy**: Modest global and behavioral benefits in PDD; cognitive effects are less consistent than with cholinesterase inhibitors [^115CZase] [^1139PVjC].
- **Guideline support**: Consider when cholinesterase inhibitors are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^112FDy62] [^114Uzq35].

---

### Clinical trials and meta-analyses

| **Study** | **Design** | **Population** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aarsland et al. (2009) | RCT | PDD/DLB | Improved global clinical status (CGIC) in memantine vs placebo [^116SXuSk] |
| Emre et al. (2010) | RCT | PDD/DLB | Improved global status in DLB; no significant cognitive benefit in PDD [^1139PVjC] |
| Wang et al. (2015) | Meta-analysis | PDD | Small global benefit; less consistent cognitive improvement vs ChEIs [^115CZase] |

---

### Safety and tolerability

Memantine is **generally well tolerated**; adverse effects include dizziness, headache, confusion, and constipation [^113AKkw5]. It does not significantly worsen motor symptoms, making it a reasonable alternative when cholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated [^115CZase].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **First-line**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine) for PDD [^115RXirv] [^113zN19P].
- **Second-line**: Memantine when cholinesterase inhibitors are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^112FDy62] [^114Uzq35].
- **Combination therapy**: Limited evidence; consider only if monotherapy is insufficient and benefits outweigh risks [^114Uzq35].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Initiation**: Start with rivastigmine 1.5 mg twice daily or donepezil 5 mg daily; titrate slowly to minimize adverse effects [^111ixap4] [^113AKkw5].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess cognition, behavior, and function every 3–6 months; adjust dose or switch agents if adverse effects occur [^notfound].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Consider memantine 5 mg daily, titrating to 10 mg twice daily, if cholinesterase inhibitors are inadequate or not tolerated [^113AKkw5].
- **Nonpharmacologic care**: Integrate caregiver education, safety planning, and cognitive/physical exercise to optimize outcomes [^113e8mSg] [^1162Mix7].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Role** | **Evidence level** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rivastigmine | First-line | High | Strongly recommended |
| Donepezil | Alternative | Moderate | Recommended |
| Galantamine | Alternative | Moderate | Recommended |
| Memantine | Second-line | Moderate | Consider if ChEIs ineffective |

---

Rivastigmine is **first-line** for PDD; donepezil or galantamine are alternatives if rivastigmine is not tolerated. Memantine is a **second-line** or adjunctive option with modest benefits, especially when cholinesterase inhibitors are ineffective or poorly tolerated.

### Parkinson disease… [^115U11L5]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Parkinson disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with significant morbidity and mortality. Approximately 60, 000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson disease each year in the United States; it is the 14th leading cause of death, with most patients dying from complications of the disease. 1 Most patients consult with their primary care physician about Parkinson disease symptoms before seeking care from a specialist. Primary care physicians are often the most accessible to patients and caregivers coping with this disease. Pathophysiology Parkinson disease is characterized by a progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the basal ganglia, particularly in the substantia nigra, 2 and development of Lewy bodies in the dopaminergic neurons. Lewy bodies are the pathologic feature of Parkinson disease.

3 However, Lewy bodies are nonspecific for Parkinson disease and are found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases; therefore, Parkinson disease represents a disease syndrome with different clinical subtypes.
4. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Parkinson disease is clinical, and key features include bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The most common presenting symptom in Parkinson disease is a unilateral resting tremor, often localized to the distal muscles of the hand, causing a pill-rolling motion. Some patients note an internal tremulousness sensation before the manifestation of the pill-rolling tremor. 5 Rigidity usually starts on the side of the body affected by the tremor and can affect gait, contribute to muscle pain, and impair posture. Cogwheel rigidity, in which affected muscles ratchet or alternate rapidly between rigidity and relaxation when moved passively, is the most common type in Parkinson disease.

A small number of patients with Parkinson disease present with lead pipe rigidity, in which affected muscles stay rigid throughout the passive motion. The main diagnostic signs of Parkinson disease are motor symptoms; however, nonmotor symptoms are also common and debilitating. Nonmotor symptoms that often present before motor symptoms include rapid eye movement sleep disorder, depression, constipation, fatigue, and olfactory dysfunction. A large survey of patients with Parkinson disease found that almost all patients reported nonmotor symptoms, with psychiatric symptoms occurring most often. 6 Associated nonmotor symptoms that can occur later in the disease can include autonomic dysfunction such as orthostatic hypotension and urinary dysfunction, which can impact quality-of-life and level-of-care issues for patients. Some nonmotor symptoms such as dementia and psychosis occur with advanced Parkinson disease but are notably debilitating.

### The treatment of cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease [^116rbM5r]. Brain Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment and dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) are common and often have devastating effects upon the patient and their family. Early cognitive impairment in PD is frequent, and the functional impact may be underestimated. Optimal management will rely upon better identification of the predominant symptoms and greater knowledge of their pathophysiological basis. The management of dementia in PD (PD-D) also has to consider the significant neuropsychiatric burden that frequently accompanies the cognitive decline, as well as fluctuations in attention. Atypical anti-psychotics have a limited role at present in treating PD-D, although new drugs are under development. The mainstay of drug management for people with PD-D is cholinesterase inhibitors, although recent trials have suggested that the N-methyl-D aspartate antagonist memantine may also have some benefit. Disease modification remains the ultimate goal for preventing the inexorable decline in PD-D, although effective interventions are still some way off. Limited benefit may, however, be possible through exercise programmes and so-called "medical foods", although randomised trials are required to confirm largely anecdotal observations.

### Memantine in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with lewy bodies: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial [^116SXuSk]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are common forms of dementia that substantially affect quality of life. Currently, the only treatment licensed for PDD is rivastigmine, and there are no licensed treatments for DLB. We aimed to test the safety and efficacy of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine in patients with PDD or DLB.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, 24-week, randomised controlled study of memantine (20 mg per day) versus placebo at four psychiatric and neurological outpatient clinics in Norway, Sweden, and the UK during 2005–08. Patients were included if they fulfilled the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD) and developed dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM IV) criteria at least 1 year after the onset of motor symptoms (PDD) or met the revised consensus operationalised criteria for DLB. Patients were assigned to a computer-generated randomisation list. All physicians who had contact with patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was clinical global impression of change (CGIC), which ranged from 1 to 7 points, and a low score means a better outcome. Analysis was by intention to treat based on the last observation carried forward. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN89624516.

Findings

72 patients with PDD or DLB were randomly assigned and started treatment: 34 with memantine and 38 with placebo. 56 (78%) completed the study. All withdrawals were owing to adverse events, but the proportion of withdrawals was similar in both groups. At week 24 the patients in the memantine group had better CGIC scores than those taking placebo (mean difference 0.7, 95% CI 0.04–1.39; p = 0.03). With the exception of improved speed on attentional tasks in the memantine group (a quick test of cognition [AQT] form: difference 12.4, 95% CI 6.0–30.9; p = 0.004), there were no significant differences between the groups in secondary outcome measures.

Interpretation

Patients with DLB or PDD might benefit from treatment with memantine, which was well tolerated. Large-scale studies are now required to confirm our preliminary findings.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^1135589J]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Search methods

We performed a systematic literature search on Medline (PubMed search engine), Cochrane Library and Embase (Ovid search engine) databases for articles published between January 1996 and October 2024 (full search strategy provided in online supplemental table 1). Ongoing studies were searched on ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (see online supplemental table 2).

Study selection

Two of the authors (IC and LS) independently screened titles and abstracts by means of the predefined eligibility criteria described. Disagreement during the selection process was resolved by discussion or, whenever necessary, with a third reviewer (FN). Studies reported as abstracts or in conference proceedings were excluded.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two authors (IC and LS) independently extracted data from the included studies on a standardised form and assessed study quality by means of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This tool assesses the risk of internal bias under a series of domains, such as selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting bias. For each domain, each report was assessed as being at low, high or unclear risk of bias.

Extracted data were: first author's name and publication year, type of treatment, type of randomisation, type of blinding, duration of the treatment, clinical diagnosis, data regarding efficacy and safety outcomes, sample size, characteristics of patients (age, disease duration, PD severity, Movement Disorder Society- Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and cognition assessment), type of outcome and outcome measures.

Results are presented narratively, without meta-analysis.

### Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease: diagnosis, biomarkers, and treatment [^11726gGf]. The Lancet: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Dementia is one of the most common and important aspects of Parkinson's disease and has consequences for patients and caregivers, and has health-related costs. Mild cognitive impairment is also common and frequently progresses to dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dementia associated with Parkinson's disease are only partly known and no mechanism-based treatments are available. Both dysmetabolism of α-synuclein and amyloid-protein and cholinergic deficits contribute to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, and preliminary findings show that imaging and neurophysiological and peripheral biomarkers could be useful in diagnosis and prognosis. Rivastigmine is the only licensed treatment for dementia in Parkinson's disease, but emerging evidence suggests that memantine might also be useful. Whether these or other treatments can delay the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia in Parkinson's disease is a key research question.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^1124vNnB]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily characterised by parkinsonism due to nigro-striatal dopaminergic denervation. While therapeutic strategies have traditionally focused on compensating for dopaminergic deficit, growing evidence reveals an involvement of cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways in the pathogenesis of the motor and non-motor manifestations of the disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChIs) and memantine (glutamate receptor antagonist) in patients affected by PD without dementia on motor (gait, balance) and non-motor (cognitive, behavioural, sleep and autonomic) symptoms usually poorly responsive to levodopa.

Methods

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. The search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase databases for articles published between January 1996 and October 2024, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results are presented narratively.

Results

12 RCTs were included in this review, with 10 (774 patients) focusing on ChIs and 2 (65 patients) on memantine. Some studies highlighted the beneficial effects of ChI on mild cognitive impairment and suggested potential improvements in apathy and gait disturbances. However, the findings regarding the impact of ChI and memantine on other non-motor symptoms were inconsistent.

Conclusions

Available RCTs suggest that ChIs may have a valuable role in managing cognitive impairment, apathy and gait disorders in PD patients without dementia. However, due to the lack of strong evidence, a cautious and individualised approach is advisable when considering these treatments. Cite Now

### Randomized controlled trial of memantine in dementia associated with Parkinson's disease [^1116VeZC]. Movement Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of memantine, a glutamatergic modulator, in patients suffering from dementia associated with Parkinson's disease (PDD), an increasingly common complication of PD. This was a 22-week trial of 25 participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PDD who were randomized to either placebo or 20 mg/day of memantine. Memantine was well tolerated by participants at 20 mg/day dosing. No participant was withdrawn due to memantine-related adverse events. Six weeks after drug withdrawal, a significantly greater proportion (P = 0.04) of memantine-treated participants deteriorated globally compared with those treated with placebo. These findings suggest that continued treatment with memantine may be needed to maintain global level of functioning over time. Based on the findings of this pilot study, memantine is safe and very well-tolerated in PDD.

### Memantine for patients with Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with lewy bodies: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1139PVjC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have suggested that patients with Lewy-body-related dementias might benefit from treatment with the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine, but further data are needed. Therefore, the efficacy and safety of memantine were investigated in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

Methods

Patients (≥ 50 years of age) with mild to moderate PDD or DLB were recruited from 30 specialist centres in Austria, France, Germany, the UK, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. They were randomly assigned to placebo or memantine (20 mg per day) according to a computer-generated list. Patients and all physicians who had contact with them were masked to treatment assignment. No primary endpoint was defined. Safety analyses were done for all patients who took at least one dose of memantine or placebo, and efficacy analyses were done for all patients who had at least one valid postbaseline assessment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00855686.

Findings

Of the 199 patients randomly assigned to treatment, 34 with DLB and 62 with PDD were given memantine, and 41 with DLB and 58 with PDD were given placebo. 159 (80%) patients completed the study: 80 in the memantine group and 79 in the placebo group. 93 patients treated with memantine and 97 patients treated with placebo were included in the efficacy analysis. At week 24, patients with DLB who received memantine showed greater improvement according to Alzheimer's disease cooperative study (ADCS)-clinical global impression of change scores than did those who received placebo (mean change from baseline 3.3 vs 3.9, respectively, difference -0.6 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.1]; p = 0.023). No significant differences were noted between the two treatments in patients with PDD (3.6 with memantine vs 3.8 with placebo, -0.1 [-0.6 to 0.3]; p = 0.576) or in the total population (3.5 with memantine vs 3.8 with placebo, -0.3 [-0.7 to 0.1]; p = 0.120). Neuropsychiatric-inventory scores showed significantly greater improvement in the memantine group than in the placebo group (-4.3 vs 1.7, respectively, -5.9 [-11.6 to -0.2]; p = 0.041) in patients with DLB, but not in those with PDD (-1.6 vs -0.1, respectively, -1.4 [-5.9 to 3.0]; p = 0.522) or in the total patient population (-2.6 vs 0.4, respectively, -2.9 [-6.3 to 0.5]; p = 0.092). In most of the cognitive test scores, ADCS-activities of daily living, and Zarit caregiver burden scores, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in any of the study populations. The incidence of adverse events and number of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar in the two groups. The most common serious adverse events were stroke (n = 3 in memantine group), falls (n = 2 in memantine group; n = 1 in placebo group), and worsening of dementia (n = 2 in memantine group).

Interpretation

Memantine seems to improve global clinical status and behavioural symptoms of patients with mild to moderate DLB, and might be an option for treatment of these patients.

### Advances in the treatment of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease [^114ktwsc]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a frequent complication, with significant interindividual variability in clinical symptoms, severity, timing, and neural substrates. Recent studies have focused not only on understanding PD dementia, but also mild cognitive impairment in PD, which may represent a prodromal stage for dementia. In recent years, there have been important advances regarding clinical characterizations, definitions, associated biomarkers, and risk factors for both mild cognitive impairment in PD and PD dementia. However, there is a paucity of effective therapies for cognitive impairment in PD, whether for mild symptoms or for moderate to severe dementia. At present, only rivastigmine is U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for PD dementia, an indication received nearly a decade ago. Given the frequency of PD cognitive impairment and its substantial impact on both patients and families, the lack of available and effective treatments represents a striking gap in the field, especially when compared to the large number of available therapies for PD motor symptoms and complications. Improved symptomatic therapies, as well as potential disease-modifying agents, for PD cognitive impairment are needed. Most therapeutic trials for PD dementia and mild cognitive impairment in PD have focused on drugs developed for and tested in Alzheimer's disease, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine, though recent and ongoing trials examine the effects of pharmacological agents affecting other neurotransmitters, as well as nonpharmacological therapies, including mental and physical exercise and neurostimulation. This review summarizes the design and outcomes of trials for PD cognitive impairment published since 2013 and highlights future therapeutic research opportunities and challenges.

Methods

This review was developed and reported in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (guidelines. The review protocol has been previously published on the PROSPERO database (CRD42020190764).

We considered RCTs and crossover trials published in the English language, on adult patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to clinical diagnostic criteria. We excluded studies including patients with DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), where ChIs and memantine have already been approved for the management of neurocognitive and behavioural symptoms. We considered as interventions ChIs (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and memantine administered at any dosage and for any length of treatment, in addition to the standard medications used for managing PD, and compared with placebo. We considered studies reporting at least one of the following efficacy outcomes: cognitive performances, neuropsychiatric symptoms, gait or balance disturbances, sleep problems and autonomic dysfunctions. Other motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and dyskinesia were excluded. Any adverse event (AE) of ChIs and memantine reported in the included studies was considered a safety outcome.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^112NoWYP]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusion and future perspectives

Our review retrieved 10 RCTs on ChIs providing conflicting evidence on their potential efficacy in preserving cognitive function, apathy and gait performance in PD patients regardless of the presence of dementia. The limited number of studies, the small overall number of patients included and the heterogeneity of outcome measures adopted prevent drawing clear conclusions on their benefit, considering that ChIs use is associated with potential undesirable, although mainly mild, effects. Evidence on the effect of treatment with ChIs on outcomes associated with cognitive impairment, such as instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs) and caregiver burden, is lacking.

Although data on early cholinergic dysfunction in PD, associated with cognitive deficits and gait disorders, provides a strong rationale for using ChIs at a pre-dementia stage, available evidence does not allow recommending their use in clinical practice. Adequately powered studies with consistent, clinically meaningful outcome measures are warranted to enhance the reliability of future findings. In addition, the potential effects of memantine on both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD represent an important area for further research.

### Quality improvement in dementia care: dementia management quality measurement set 2018 implementation update [^113zzTZd]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Dementia Management Quality Measurement Set — pharmacologic treatment of dementia: This measure specifies that discussion with patients or their caregivers should occur regarding options for guideline-appropriate pharmacologic treatment and nonpharmacologic behavioral and lifestyle modifications. Recent data in the 2018 review reaffirm this measure. The use of cholinesterase inhibitors in AD and in dementia with Lewy bodies/PD dementia continues to be supported, and a recent consensus statement supported the use of memantine as well. Nonpharmacologic and lifestyle interventions continue to show supportive evidence in the management of dementia of all types, particularly in the context of vascular-related dementia, where there is less evidence in support of pharmacologic interventions.

### Approach to cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease [^1162Mix7]. Neurotherapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Cognitive dysfunction is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and predicts poor clinical outcomes. It is associated primarily with pathologic involvement of basal forebrain cholinergic and prefrontal dopaminergic systems. Impairments in executive functions, attention, and visuospatial abilities are its hallmark features with eventual involvement of memory and other domains. Subtle symptoms in the premotor and early phases of PD progress to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which may be present at the time of diagnosis. Eventually, a large majority of PD patients develop dementia with advancing age and longer disease duration, which is usually accompanied by immobility, hallucinations/psychosis, and dysautonomia. Dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation help motor dysfunction, but may have potential cognitive side effects. Central acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and possibly memantine, provide modest and temporary symptomatic relief for dementia, although there is no evidence-based treatment for MCI. There is no proven disease-modifying treatment for cognitive impairment in PD. The symptomatic and disease-modifying role of physical exercise, cognitive training, and neuromodulation on cognitive impairment in PD is under investigation. Multidisciplinary approaches to cognitive impairment with effective treatment of comorbidities, proper rehabilitation, and maintenance of good support systems in addition to pharmaceutical treatment may improve the quality of life of the patients and caregivers.

### Dementia prevention and treatment: a narrative review [^116N2dV8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Dementia affects 10% of those 65 years or older and 35% of those 90 years or older, often with profound cognitive, behavioral, and functional consequences. As the baby boomers and subsequent generations age, effective preventive and treatment strategies will assume increasing importance.

Observations

Preventive measures are aimed at modifiable risk factors, many of which have been identified. To date, no randomized clinical trial data conclusively confirm that interventions of any kind can prevent dementia. Nevertheless, addressing risk factors may have other health benefits and should be considered. Alzheimer disease can be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and antiamyloid immunomodulators, with the last modestly slowing cognitive and functional decline in people with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine may benefit persons with other types of dementia, including dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson disease dementia, vascular dementia, and dementia due to traumatic brain injury. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia are best treated with nonpharmacologic management, including identifying and mitigating the underlying causes and individually tailored behavioral approaches. Psychotropic medications have minimal evidence of efficacy for treating these symptoms and are associated with increased mortality and clinically meaningful risks of falls and cognitive decline. Several emerging prevention and treatment strategies hold promise to improve dementia care in the future.

Conclusions and Relevance

Although current prevention and treatment approaches to dementia have been less than optimally successful, substantial investments in dementia research will undoubtedly provide new answers to reducing the burden of dementia worldwide.

Pharmacological treatments for Parkinson's disease dementia

Evidence for AChEI treatment has been updated. Data from a meta-analysis confirmed the positive treatment effects of rivastigmine and donepezil on PDD patients' global cognitive state, memory, and speech. However, there is stronger evidence for rivastigmine in meta-analyses. First, meta-analyses did not consistently report positive effects of donepezil on cognitive tests, and positive effects of donepezil on ADL functioning has not been demonstrated yet. In this guideline, we rate positive changes in cognition ("pathophysiological validity") and ADL functions ("ecological validity") higher than a change in the "Clinical Global Impression of Change", as this is dichotomized in meta-analyses ("improvement" versus "stable or worsening") and thus loses some of its statistical significance. Both, changes in cognition (better effectiveness) and positive ADL functions favors rivastigmine. Improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms have been verified with rivastigmine but not donepezil. Otherwise, it has been shown that treatment with donepezil compared with a placebo leads to improvements in ADL. The occurrence of side effects worsening PD symptoms and tremors has been reported with rivastigmine use but is less prominent with donepezil use. No effect for galantamine treatment has been identified.

Two meta-analyses reported only small improvements in cognitive function and global clinical impressions for memantine in people with PDD, but treatment effects were considerably higher in mixed cohorts with PDD and Lewy body dementia.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for AD dementia: co-prescription and withdrawal

Treatment for AD typically involves the use of one of the three AChEIs in its mild to moderate stage, and of memantine in its moderate to severe stage. Evidence suggests that adding memantine to an ongoing treatment with one AChEI can be more effective than maintaining the treatment with one AChEI alone in people with moderate to severe AD, improving functional abilities, global functions and behavioural symptoms.

Two RQs examined the co-prescription of AChEIs and memantine and the impact of discontinuing these treatments in people with AD. Ten studies (including two from the literature update) assessed the efficacy of the combined treatment with AChEIs and memantine, while four studies (including one from literature update) analysed the effects of treatment withdrawal.

The WG recommended considering memantine in addition to the AChEI in people in moderate AD already receiving an AChEI, and offering memantine in addition to the AChEI in people with severe AD who are already taking an AChEI. The WG also recommended against discontinuing AChEIs or memantine solely due to disease severity.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for Parkinson's disease dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies

Two RQs explored the comparative effectiveness of AChEIs and memantine in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and DLB. Overall, six studies focused on PDD (four on AChEIs and two on memantine), while four studies focused on DLB (three on AChEIs and one on memantine). Based on available evidence, the WG agreed to recommend offering AChEI in people with mild or moderate PDD and considering AChEIs in people with severe PDD. In case AChEIs are not tolerated or contraindicated, the use of memantine can be considered as an alternative.

The WG agreed to recommend offering donepezil or rivastigmine to people with mild to moderate DLB, and considering galantamine if donepezil and rivastigmine are not tolerated. The use of donepezil or rivastigmine, or memantine if AChEIs are not tolerated or are contraindicated, can be considered in people with severe DLB.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^113hn6vN]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of ChIs and memantine on levodopa-resistant symptoms in PD without dementia, including cognitive, neuropsychiatric, gait, sleep and autonomic disturbances, with the aim of identifying effective non-dopaminergic treatments.

ChIs are already recommended for treating PDD and DLB, reflecting their role in addressing the cholinergic deficits characteristic of these conditions. RCTs have demonstrated their efficacy in improving cognitive function and addressing behavioural disturbances, such as hallucinations and delusions, in both PDD and DLB.

The role of ChIs in mild cognitive deficits in PD without dementia, however, remains unclear.

In this review, we collected evidence from RCTs regarding this topic (table 1).

A body of evidence suggests that nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss in PD is paralleled by degeneration of important cholinergic pathways in the basal forebrain and brain stem that may in part explain cognitive impairment observed in people with PD. Neuroimaging studies using PET tracer targeting cholinergic terminals have shown a prominent loss of cerebral cholinergic markers in PDD, with detectable changes in cholinergic function even in early PD without dementia or isolated RBD.

In addition, alterations in the noradrenergic system have been reported, particularly involving the locus coeruleus (LC), which contributes to the regulation of arousal, attention, autonomic functions and the sleep–wake cycle, as well as the modulation of stress responses, mood and cognitive processes. Neuroimaging studies employing neuromelanin-sensitive MRI have demonstrated a reduction in LC signal intensity in patients with AD and PD. Furthermore, recent evidence highlighting early LC changes in individuals with mild cognitive impairment associated with Lewy body pathology may offer valuable insight for future treatments targeted at systems other than the cholinergic and glutamatergic ones.

Moreover, glutamatergic pathways mediated by NMDA receptors appear to contribute to both motor and non-motor symptoms in individuals with PD.

Nevertheless, the clinical effects of treatments targeting cholinergic dysfunction have not been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials. This may be partly due to methodological limitations, namely the lack of samples adequately sized to show small but clinically meaningful differences over follow-up periods proportionately long for a chronic condition as PD.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia: review [^113e8mSg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Worldwide, 47 million people live with dementia and, by 2050, the number is expected to increase to 131 million.

Observations

Dementia is an acquired loss of cognition in multiple cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect social or occupational function. In the United States, Alzheimer disease, one cause of dementia, affects 5.8 million people. Dementia is commonly associated with more than 1 neuropathology, usually Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular pathology. Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive decline and impairment in daily activities, with corroboration from a close friend or family member, in addition to a thorough mental status examination by a clinician to delineate impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as spatial orientation, executive function, and mood. Brief cognitive impairment screening questionnaires can assist in initiating and organizing the cognitive assessment. However, if the assessment is inconclusive (eg, symptoms present, but normal examination findings), neuropsychological testing can help determine whether dementia is present. Physical examination may help identify the etiology of dementia. For example, focal neurologic abnormalities suggest stroke. Brain neuroimaging may demonstrate structural changes including, but not limited to, focal atrophy, infarcts, and tumor, that may not be identified on physical examination. Additional evaluation with cerebrospinal fluid assays or genetic testing may be considered in atypical dementia cases, such as age of onset younger than 65 years, rapid symptom onset, and/or impairment in multiple cognitive domains but not episodic memory. For treatment, patients may benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches, including cognitively engaging activities such as reading, physical exercise such as walking, and socialization such as family gatherings. Pharmacologic approaches can provide modest symptomatic relief. For Alzheimer disease, this includes an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as donepezil for mild to severe dementia, and memantine (used alone or as an add-on therapy) for moderate to severe dementia. Rivastigmine can be used to treat symptomatic Parkinson disease dementia.

Conclusions and Relevance

Alzheimer disease currently affects 5.8 million persons in the United States and is a common cause of dementia, which is usually accompanied by other neuropathology, often cerebrovascular disease such as brain infarcts. Causes of dementia can be diagnosed by medical history, cognitive and physical examination, laboratory testing, and brain imaging. Management should include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches, although efficacy of available treatments remains limited.

### Clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs: a revised (third) consensus statement from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116cVY3B]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology coordinated a meeting of experts to review and revise its previous 2011 guidelines for clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs. As before, levels of evidence were rated using accepted standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A-D, with A having the strongest evidence base (from randomised controlled trials) and D the weakest (case studies or expert opinion). Current clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and both structural (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and functional (positron emission tomography and single photon emission computerised tomography) brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy in particular situations (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for cognition in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (A), memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (A) and combination therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine) may be beneficial (B). Drugs should not be stopped just because dementia severity increases (A). Until further evidence is available other drugs, including statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E, nutritional supplements and Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), though selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not cognitive) features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment of people with Lewy body dementias (both Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies), and memantine may be helpful (A). No drugs are clearly effective in vascular dementia, though cholinesterase inhibitors are beneficial in mixed dementia (B). Early evidence suggests multifactorial interventions may have potential to prevent or delay the onset of dementia (B). Though the consensus statement focuses on medication, psychological interventions can be effective in addition to pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel pharmacological approaches involving strategies to reduce amyloid and/or tau deposition in those with or at high risk of Alzheimer's disease are in progress. Though results of pivotal studies in early (prodromal/mild) Alzheimer's disease are awaited, results to date in more established (mild to moderate) Alzheimer's disease have been equivocal and no disease modifying agents are either licensed or can be currently recommended for clinical use.

The British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) coordinated a meeting of experts to review and revise its first (2006) Guidelines for clinical practice with anti-dementia drugs. As before, levels of evidence were rated using accepted standards which were then translated into grades of recommendation A to D, with A having the strongest evidence base (from randomized controlled trials) and D the weakest (case studies or expert opinion). Current clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (A) and memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease (A).

Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), though selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not cognitive) features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment of people with Lewy body dementias (Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)), especially for neuropsychiatric symptoms (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can produce cognitive improvements in DLB (A). There is no clear evidence that any intervention can prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Although the consensus statement focuses on medication, psychological interventions can be effective in addition to pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel pharmacological approaches involving strategies to reduce amyloid and/or tau deposition are in progress. Although results of pivotal studies are awaited, results to date have been equivocal and no disease-modifying agents are either licensed or can be currently recommended for clinical use.

### Memantine for the treatment of dementia: a review on its current and future applications [^116UuL5R]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Since Parkinson's disease (PD) dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies have some pathological and biochemical similarities to AD, MEM have been proposed that could provide an improvement in these brain disorders (Table 1). Thus, the clinical trial NCT00855686 evaluated the efficacy and safety of MEM (20 mg per day over 6 months) in patients with mild to moderate PD dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In this study, patients were stratified according to diagnosis and randomly assigned to MEM or placebo in a double blind, parallel-group study. The main conclusion of this study was that the incidence of adverse events of patients treated with MEM was low and similar to the placebo group. The authors suggest that MEM could be a suitable strategy for mild to moderate DLB.

As a note of interest, and as it can be seen in Table 1, MEM has been evaluated as a potential therapy for other diseases such as PD. This is because MEM is an organic molecule of an aminoadamantane class similar to amantadine, which produces moderate symptomatic benefits in PD, related to tremor, tardive dyskinesia, chorea, and dementia. However, the potential benefits of this drug are not mediated through the potentiation of dopamine effects, so further studies are necessary. Serafini and colleagues evidenced that the glutamatergic system could be involved in the pathology and treatment of depression via the modulation of post-synaptic ionotropic receptors including the NMDAR. Thus, MEM has been reported that in association with sertraline, a selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, it shows a suitable efficacy profile in patients with major depression. Likewise, previous preclinical reported data demonstrated that the association of MEM with antidepressant drugs, such as fluoxetine and venlafaxine enhances the antidepressant effect of classical therapies. MEM associated with galantamine was investigated in the treatment of cognitive deficits in with schizophrenia. Others clinical trial evaluated, a part of MEM, additional non-pharmacological strategies for example the Environmental Ecological Therapy in AD.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^115pPvxx]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is clinically defined by the presence of parkinsonism, characterised by bradykinesia along with tremor or rigidity, primarily caused by nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. Current symptomatic treatments focus on replacing the dopaminergic deficit; however, they provide only partial relief for some motor and non-motor manifestations, such as cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms and gait disturbances. Some symptoms poorly respond to levodopa, while others may initially improve but later show motor fluctuations and reduced efficacy.

This suboptimal efficacy underscores the importance of exploring additional neurotransmitter systems implicated in the pathophysiology of PD beyond the dopaminergic system.

Neuropathological studies and neuroimaging studies, starting with Braak's seminal research, have identified early cholinergic alterations in individuals with PD. Degeneration in the basal forebrain structures, such as the nucleus basalis of Meynert, medial septum and diagonal band, occurs in parallel with nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss. Moreover, pathology affecting cholinergic pontine-medullary nuclei, including the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), laterodorsal tegmental nuclei and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, is often detectable before the onset of motor symptoms. Cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration, which leads to cortical cholinergic denervation, has significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms. At present, enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission remains a key approach in the symptomatic treatment of cognitive and behavioural symptoms in the mild to moderate stages of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

### Treatments of parkinson disease… [^112npxU1]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 DAVID E. PLEASUREMD Parkinson disease is a progressive degenerative neurological disorder characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, and postural instability. 1 In the later stages, approximately 25% or more of patients develop cognitive compromise. The cardinal pathological features of PD are degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and their axons, which project principally to the caudate and putamen, and the presence of eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions, Lewy bodies. 2, 3 Although the. loss of neurons is most conspicuous in the substantia nigra pars compacta, neuronal loss and/or Lewy bodies are found in other brain regions, 2 which suggests that treatments that target only the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, though they may substantially benefit patients, are unlikely to completely resolve the deficits of PD.

The neurologist or movement disorders specialist caring for patients with Parkinson disease often is confronted with the following questions: Is there a treatment that slows the progression of PD. Which medication should be used first in the treatment of PD. What should be done for patients who have begun to have motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia. What is the role of surgery in the treatment of PD, and which surgical treatment is best. What can be done for patients with cognitive compromise and/or hallucinations. Are new treatments on the horizon for PD. In this article, I provide a synthesis of the available information regarding each of these questions. Authors of other studies have also reported a significant wash-in effect, and because of this confounding symptomatic effect of selegiline, a neuroprotective effect has not been unequivocally demonstrated. Fahn's study should allay concerns that use of levodopa accelerates clinical decline in patients with PD.

No drug has been shown unequivocally to slow the progression of PD. Introduction of levodopa revolutionized treatment of PD. 3 Unfortunately, one third to one half of patients treated with levodopa develop motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia within 5 years after beginning treatment. 5, 6. Side effects of amantadine can include peripheral edema, livedo reticularis, rash, and confusion. Anticholinergic drugs have their most substantial benefit in reduction of tremor and modest benefit in bradykinesia and rigidity, but peripheral and central side effects, particularly memory impairment and confusion, limit their use typically to younger patients with prominent tremor. A number of conclusions can be drawn from these 2 studies. First, treatment with a dopaminergic agonist or levodopa ameliorated the symptoms of PD to a level that the patient and investigator considered satisfactory.

Second, both dopaminergic agonists and levodopa were typically well tolerated, but side effects, such as nausea or hallucinations, were not uncommon and were generally more common with the agonists than with levodopa. Because no treatment has been proved to slow the progression of PD, there is no compelling reason to begin using this medication until the patient's disability warrants it. Levels of disability that warrant medication vary among patients with PD; for example, the level of acceptable slowness may differ between patients with PD who are working and those who are retired. Although selegiline, amantadine, and anticholinergic drugs can ameliorate the disability in early PD, the benefit is typically modest, and most patients soon need treatment with levodopa or a dopaminergic agonist.

### Withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine or both, in people with dementia [^112vXXh6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a progressive syndrome characterised by deterioration in memory, thinking and behaviour, and by impaired ability to perform daily activities. Two classes of drug - cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine - are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes in other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on: cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalisation, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life and carer-related outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialised Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, with continuation of the same drug or drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed citations and full-text articles for inclusion, extracted data from included trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Where trials were sufficiently similar, we pooled data for outcomes in the short term (up to 2 months after randomisation), medium term (3–11 months) and long term (12 months or more). We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included six trials investigating cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal, and one trial investigating withdrawal of either donepezil or memantine. No trials assessed withdrawal of memantine only. Drugs were withdrawn abruptly in five trials and stepwise in two trials. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, with severities ranging from mild to very severe, and were taking cholinesterase inhibitors without known adverse effects at baseline. The included trials randomised 759 participants to treatment groups relevant to this review. Study duration ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months. There were too few included studies to allow planned subgroup analyses. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition or reporting bias. Compared to continuing cholinesterase inhibitors, discontinuing treatment may be associated with worse cognitive function in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.64 to -0.21; 4 studies; low certainty), but the effect in the medium term is very uncertain (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.87 to 0.07; 3 studies; very low certainty). In a sensitivity analysis omitting data from a study which only included participants who had shown a relatively poor prior response to donepezil, inconsistency was reduced and we found that cognitive function may be worse in the discontinuation group in the medium term (SMD -0.62; 95% CI -0.94 to -0.31). Data from one longer-term study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor is probably associated with worse cognitive function at 12 months (mean difference (MD) -2.09 Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) points, 95% CI -3.43 to -0.75; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may make little or no difference to functional status in the short term (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.54 to 0.04; 2 studies; low certainty), and its effect in the medium term is uncertain (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.01; 2 studies; very low certainty). After 12 months, discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor probably results in greater functional impairment than continuing treatment (MD -3.38 Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) points, 95% CI -6.67 to -0.10; one study; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may be associated with a worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms over the short term and medium term, although we cannot exclude a minimal effect (SMD - 0.48, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.13; 2 studies; low certainty; and SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.08; 3 studies; low certainty, respectively). Data from one study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor may result in little to no change in neuropsychiatric status at 12 months (MD -0.87 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) points; 95% CI -8.42 to 6.68; moderate certainty). We found no clear evidence of an effect of discontinuation on dropout due to lack of medication efficacy or deterioration in overall medical condition (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.76; 4 studies; low certainty), on number of adverse events (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; 4 studies; low certainty) or serious adverse events (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; 4 studies; low certainty), and on mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.55; 5 studies; low certainty). Institutionalisation was reported in one trial, but it was not possible to extract data for the groups relevant to this review.

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in worse cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional status than continuing treatment, although this is supported by limited evidence, almost all of low or very low certainty. As all participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, our findings are not transferable to other dementia types. We were unable to determine whether the effects of discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors differed with baseline dementia severity. There is currently no evidence to guide decisions about discontinuing memantine. There is a need for further well-designed RCTs, across a range of dementia severities and settings. We are aware of two ongoing registered trials. In making decisions about discontinuing these drugs, clinicians should exercise caution, considering the evidence from existing trials along with other factors important to patients and their carers.

### Parkinson disease neuropathology… [^116mbUgY]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

We identified 13 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD who experienced dementia at least 4 years after parkinsonism onset and subsequently underwent postmortem examination. Despite levodopa therapy, 9 patients later became severely impaired and nonambulatory, requiring total or near-total care; this included 4 patients treated with 1200 mg/d or more of levodopa, which was consistent with loss of the levodopa response. These 13 patients were compared with 9 patients clinically diagnosed as having PD, but without dementia, who had undergone autopsies. Results. Dementia may complicate PD after years of an otherwise typical course. This problem may overshadow the motor aspects of parkinsonism and become the primary source of disability. In PD, dementia is not a presenting feature, but is common later in the disease course. The frequency of dementia among patients from clinic-hospital cohorts ranges from 6% to 29%.

1–7 However, this range likely underestimates the problem. Patients with dementia are less likely to be referred to or followed up in PD clinics. In community-based studies, prevalence figures are a little higher, ranging from 12% to 41%, but these numbers too may underestimate the magnitude of this problem. By definition, prevalence studies ascertain cases at a single point in time. Dementia may lead to nursing home placement and earlier death; these patients will not be counted in subsequent prevalence analyses. Among PD patients who do not initially experience dementia, the yearly incidence of dementia ranges from 2. 6% to
9. 5%. Thus, if PD patients live long enough, the risk is substantial. One series estimated that the cumulative risk of dementia among PD patients by the age of 85 years was more than 65%.
14.

Early dementia may have an entirely different pathologic basis than dementia developing several years after the onset of levodopa-responsive PD. In fact, dementia developing concurrently with parkinsonism plus other characteristic features is now recognized to typically represent dementia with Lewy bodies. 41, 42 Clinical parkinsonism may also complicate AD, in which case the dementia is prominent early in the disease course. 43–47. We were interested in a specific subset of patients whom we commonly see in our PD clinics — those with typical early PD who later experience dementia. We anticipated that the neuropathologic basis for this dementia should be apparent and may be fairly uniform if we restricted our PD patients to those in whom parkinsonism preceded dementia by at least 4 years and the histologic techniques included α-synuclein immunohistochemical analysis.

From the Mayo Health Sciences Research Database, we identified all patients undergoing autopsy between 1976 and 1997 with diagnoses in life of PD and dementia. All clinical histories were reviewed to identify those who met the following criteria: clinical picture of idiopathic PD without features that suggest another parkinsonian disorder; an initially favorable response to levodopa therapy, if administered; and dementia developing at least 4 years after PD motor symptom onset. Initially, we selected 5 years as the minimum criterion interval between PD motor symptom onset and dementia; however, because of the small number of patients, we reduced this to 4 years. Parkinsonism onset was dated from the time the initial symptoms were experienced by the patient. Onset of dementia corresponded to the date when cognitive impairment was first noted. P <. 05 was considered statistically significant.

### Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: a report from a multidisciplinary symposium on unmet needs and future directions to maintain cognitive health [^1179UzcB]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Current/future research

At present, there is only one Food Drug Administration-approved medication for PDD in the United States, that is, the cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, which was approved in 2006. Evidence-based reviews in PD recommend rivastigmine as "efficacious" for the treatment of PDD, with an acceptable safety risk without need for specialized monitoring. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil (despite a large randomized controlled trial)and galantamine, and memantine were rated as having "insufficient evidence" in the treatment of PDD, though they had acceptable safety risk profiles without need for specialized monitoring. Other agents, particularly focused on the serotonin system, are currently under study for PD dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors, and stimulant-like medications have been studied in PD-MCI, but trials have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of uniform definitions, use of different outcome measures, and negative results. Given the overall lack of pharmacological therapies for PD cognitive impairment, non-pharmacological therapies are of great interest. Studies of non-pharmacological therapies such as physical exercise cognitive training, and neuromodulation in PD cognitive dysfunction are growing, though more rigorous study is needed. Recently, the American Academy of Neurology updated the 2001 practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of MCI; while this publication focused on MCI in AD, many of these recommendations may extend to MCI in PD.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^112iNAPL]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

Study selection and characteristics

Initially, 1651 articles were identified by the search of which 245 were excluded after deduplication across bibliographic databases, 1232 after title/abstract screening and 134 after full text screening (figure 1). 12 records, 10 focused on ChIs and 2 on memantine, were included in the review (online supplemental table 3).

Figure 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram for systematic reviews including searches of databases and registers. PD, Parkinson's disease.

Additionally, 43 ongoing trials were identified and screened. Among the 15 eligible trials, 12 had published results, while the remaining were either ongoing or not yet recruiting, with no available preliminary results (see online supplemental table 5).

We decided a priori not to perform a meta-analysis, expecting heterogeneity in methods and outcome measures, that in fact were observed in the retrieved studies.

Efficacy outcome

Of the 12 studies included in this review, 10 investigated the effectiveness of ChIs on symptoms unresponsive to levodopa in PD patients without dementia. Studies evaluating rivastigmine included both patch (4.6 mg or 9.5 mg daily) and capsule (6 mg two times per day) formulations, with treatment durations ranging from 3 to 96 weeks. Sample size varied from 10 to 65 participants. Four studies assessed the efficacy of donepezil (5 mg or 10 mg daily) over treatment periods ranging from 6 to 208 weeks, with sample sizes of 20–103 participants. Additionally, one RCT evaluated the efficacy of galantamine (24 mg daily) over 16 weeks in 38 patients, focusing on cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Only two RCTs investigated the effectiveness of memantine (20 mg daily) on levodopa non-responsive symptoms in PD patients, with a primary focus on neuropsychiatric symptoms and gait disturbances.

Evidence from the studies included in this review is presented in table 1 and detailed extensively in online supplemental tables 4a–4c.

Systematic reviews reported limited evidence wherein acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine slightly improved the global impression; however, only AChEIs enhanced the cognitive function. Among the AChEIs, only rivastigmine is considered to be "efficacious and clinically useful", whereas donepezil and galantamine are considered to be "possibly useful" because of insufficient evidence. For memantine, practice implications have been investigational with insufficient evidence. However, in addition to evidence, approval indication from the Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the ease of use, or adverse events would have influenced the actual treatment by clinicians in the real world. The rivastigmine patch, for example, has a broader treatment spectrum with approval to treat mild to severe dementia, whereas rivastigmine capsules have been approved to treat only mild to moderate dementia. Donepezil is taken once a day; however, rivastigmine is taken twice a day. Patches, in general, require far more care and assistance from caregivers than oral medications. It is well known that the adverse event rates increase proportionately with drug dosage. In AD, 6–12 mg/day dosage of rivastigmine was superior to placebo, while 1–4 mg/day was not, which suggests that there may be a greater risk of adverse events to reach an effective dose. These factors, together, must be taken into account when considering the treatment of PD with dementia (PD + D) patients in real-world practice. The goal of the present study was to investigate the incidence of dementia in patients with PD and to describe the dementia treatment patterns in Korea.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^115Xy2c1]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Dopaminergic and cholinergic denervation are thought to play an important role in PD‐related apathy. 129, 130 Indeed, rivastigmine has been shown to improve apathy in PD and is "possibly useful", 21 whereas the evidence is weaker for dopaminergic therapies. 23, 131 On the other hand, for apathy occurring in the context of STN DBS and postoperative withdrawal of PD medications, dopamine agonists can be considered, 22, 132 and piribedil is "possibly useful" for this indication.

A total of 2 large, randomized controlled cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) studies in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have been published, 1 positive study for rivastigmine and the other an equivocal study for donepezil. 2, 14 Although statistically significant, the effects of ChEIs in PD are clinically modest. 133 Although rivastigmine is "clinically useful" for the treatment of PDD, the other ChEIs are "possibly useful". ChEI treatment appears to be overall well tolerated in PD, outside of nausea and worsening tremor in some patients. On the other hand, the use of memantine is "investigational". Regarding management of PD‐MCI or cognitive impairment short of dementia, the evidence is much more limited, for both PD and MCI in the general population with insufficient efficacy evidence for rasagiline and rivastigmine 7, 33, 36, 134 and an unclear role of DBS surgery. 135, 136 There is preliminary evidence that physical 137 and cognitive exercise 138 may be beneficial for cognition in PD, limiting anticholinergic medication use 139 and treating psychiatric conditions might help with cognition long term, and comorbid vascular diseases (eg, hypertension and diabetes) may prevent or limit vascular disease‐associated cognitive decline.

### Efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, and dementia with lewy bodies: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^115CZase]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently, several large randomised controlled trials about the treatments of cognitive impairment or dementia due to Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD or PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were completed. Here, we systematically reviewed the studies (including the recent reports) to provide updated evidence for the treatments of CIND-PD, PDD and DLB.

Methods

We searched Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialised Register, Pubmed, Embase, and other sources for eligible trials. We selected global impression and cognitive function as primary efficacy outcomes, and dropouts and adverse events as safety outcomes. Furthermore, Meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were used here.

Results

Ten trials were included in this study. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine produced small global efficacy on clinicians' global impression of change (CGIC), from a weighted mean difference of -0.40 (95% CI -0.77 to -0.03) to -0.65 (95% CI -1.28 to -0.01); however, cholinesterase inhibitors but not memantine significantly improved cognition on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), from 1.04 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.65) to 2.57 (95% CI 0.90 to 4.23). Additionally, both of them had good safety outcomes, although rivastigmine showed an increased risk on adverse events than placebo (risk ratio, RR 1.19, TSA adjusted 95% CI 1.04 to 1.36), these events were usually mild or moderate, and the risk disappeared on serious adverse events.

Conclusions

Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine slightly improve global impression; however, only cholinesterase inhibitors enhance cognitive function. Besides, all the drugs have good safety outcomes. But the limited trials precluded the generalisation of these outcomes.

### Patterns of dementia treatment in older adults with Parkinson's disease using nationwide medical claims data [^114nsPfG]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

During the observational period, approximately 66% of PD + D patients were treated with the anti-dementia drugs; this was substantially higher in Korea than in the U.S. (27.2%). However, a simple comparison is not appropriate due to different medical systems and backgrounds. We confirmed that several clinicians in Korea actively considered using anti-dementia medications to treat PD + D patients. Notably, in terms of prescription patterns, we found that donepezil was used to a greater extent than rivastigmine, despite greater clinical evidence with rivastigmine. This result contradicted a previous report that showed that rivastigmine was the most frequently used drug for PD + D patients in Korea; this, however, may be explained by the smaller sample sizes and by the fact that the study participants were enrolled from only 12 university hospitals. This was in concordance with another study that found that donepezil was the most commonly prescribed medication, followed by memantine and rivastigmine. Plausible reasons are that donepezil has a broader spectrum of treatment (mild to severe dementia), can be taken once a day, and has a simpler titration schedule such that reaching a target dose is relatively easy. We found that the proportion of rivastigmine patch use during the entire observational period, or in just one drug prescription, was higher than that for capsule use. We could conjecture that patches have fewer gastrointestinal adverse events and a broader approval spectrum for treating mild to severe dementia; are easier to titrate (i.e. 5, 10, and 15 at least every 4 weeks in patches versus 3, 6, 9, and 12 at least every 2 weeks in capsules, if tolerant); and are simpler to use (once versus twice a day) than rivastigmine capsules. These factors together help to reach a target dose. Memantine has been prescribed for treating PD + D patients, despite the slight lack of evidence that memantine improves cognitive function more than AChEIs in PD + D patients. Memantine has a lower gastrointestinal adverse event profile than AChEIs and a good safety profile for treating dementia in PD. According to the most recent meta-analysis, memantine and AChEIs influence the global cognitive function, attention, processing speed, executive functions, memory, and language. In terms of adverse events, only the rivastigmine group experienced more adverse events than the placebo group; donepezil and memantine, however, did not produce any substantial adverse events. Given this evidence, memantine may be an alternative option for treating PD + D patients who experience adverse events with AChEIs.

Cholinesterase inhibitors for cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias include donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, which are FDA approved for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, with donepezil also approved for severe Alzheimer's disease; these medications have similar rates of adverse effects and have been shown to lead to modest benefits in a substantial minority of patients (i.e., 30%–40% in clinical trials). These medications should be offered to patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease after a thorough discussion of risks and benefits [I], may be helpful for severe Alzheimer's disease [II], and should be considered for mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease [II] with only rivastigmine FDA approved for this indication but no reason to believe benefit is specific to it. Cholinesterase inhibitors can be considered for dementia with Lewy bodies [II], while for mild cognitive impairment and vascular dementia efficacy and safety are uncertain and no specific recommendation can be made at this time, although these medications may be beneficial for some patients.

### NMDA antagonists for treating the non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease [^1155RzbC]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cognitive dysfunction

Neurocognitive dysfunction and dementia can occur in up to 40% of PD patients, with dementia onset being more associated with disease progression. Similar to Alzheimer's dementia, it is suggested that impaired cholinergic pathways are the cause of PD dementia, however, this may be related to aberrant glutamate activity. In addition to improvements in motor symptoms, there is preliminary evidence that NMDA antagonists may be effective at treating PD psychiatric symptoms. In most studies, NMDA antagonists significantly improved cognition as the primary outcome (n = 4). Drug discontinuation and washout with memantine caused significant global deterioration in cognition and overall neuropsychiatric symptoms, which may be indicative of the effectiveness during the dosing period (n = 2). The exceptions were two memantine studies that showed moderate improvement in cognition, but were not statistically significant when compared to placebo. The utility of memantine may be specific for cognition and plays a minimal role for other psychiatric symptoms. For example, a single study showed significant improvements with the MMSE measure, but not with NPI or UPDRS, measuring changes in neuropsychiatric and global PD symptoms, respectively. A systematic review and analysis compared memantine to cholinesterase inhibitors in treating PD dementia and found that both drugs significantly improved global impression; however, cholinesterase inhibitors were more effective at enhancing cognitive function than memantine. Although less commonly used in PD dementia, amantadine showed promise in enhancing cognition, especially in improving the visual-cognitive processing and visual discrimination. The therapeutic effect of longitudinal use of amantadine was suggested in an 8-year study, revealing that amantadine delayed the onset of PD dementia by ~ 3.2 years and attenuated dementia severity in a dose-response manner. While other NMDA antagonists, such as d-cycloserine improved cognitive scores, the disadvantage is it has only been shown in PD animal models. In summary, there is potential for NMDA antagonists not only in treating LIDs, but also in attenuating dementia.

In a 48-week open-label active treatment extension (3–12 mg/day) that included 334 subjects from the prior study, cognitive and functional benefits appeared to continue over time, and patients initially on placebo who then received rivastigmine showed improvements similar to those who received rivastigmine initially.

Memantine (Ebixa — Lundbeck Ltd), an oral medicine, is available in the UK for treating "patients with moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease". It differs from other licensed dementia medicines in that it is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. The company has claimed that, with memantine therapy, "improvements in activities of daily living help patients to maintain a degree of independence and be easier to care for, potentially avoiding the need for nursing home care". We assess the efficacy of memantine for dementia and discuss its place in the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease.

### Medical management of advanced dementia [^114XU8Th]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

A cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still far off, and clinicians face the burden of caring for patients at all stages of dementia for the foreseeable future. Those with advanced disease suffer neurological symptoms and signs that include incontinence; problems with gait and mobility; marked cognitive, language, and functional impairment; and in about 90% of patients, significant behavior problems. Dementia precludes the ability to initiate meaningful activities or social interactions. Whether patients are resident in the community or living in a nursing home, this composite reflects a highly complex medical and neuropsychiatric management challenge. Predictable medical conditions also must be addressed (i.e., those that accompany dementia, such as parkinsonism, and those that are prevalent in any aging population, such as hypertension). Clinicians can better address these problems with awareness of current treatment options. Placebo-controlled trials of some psychotropic agents have shown modest favorable effects on behavior problems. Use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) to treat cognitive impairment and secondary behavioral symptoms derives primarily from results of placebo-controlled clinical trials. Trials in patients with moderate to severe AD, outpatients as well as nursing home residents, show overall effects similar to those seen in outpatients with milder dementia. Treatment with AChEIs may delay institutional placement. Memantine has shown benefit in trials in moderate to severe dementia, although it is not yet approved in the United States. Emerging data have expanded physicians' ability to use pharmacotherapy in patients with advanced dementia. Physicians need to enact the principle that something can be done for our afflicted parents and grandparents.

### Systematic review of pharmacological interventions for people with lewy body dementia [^113GwBhF]. Aging & Mental Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia, and it causes earlier mortality and more morbidity than Alzheimer's disease. Reviewing current evidence on its pharmacological management is essential for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines, and for improving the quality of its clinical care. Hence, we systematically reviewed all studies that investigated the efficacy of any medication for managing various symptoms of LBD.

Method

We identified eligible studies by searching 15 databases comprehensively. We completed quality assessment, extracted relevant data, and performed GRADE assessment of available evidence. We conducted meta-analyses when appropriate (PROSPERO:CRD42020182166).

Results

We screened 18,884 papers and included 135 studies. Our meta-analyses confirmed level-1 evidence for Donepezil's efficacy of managing cognitive symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (SMD = 0.63; p < 0.001) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) (SMD = 0.43; p < 0.01), and managing hallucinations in DLB (SMD = -0.52; p = 0.02). Rivastigmine and Memantine have level-2 evidence for managing cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of DLB. Olanzapine and Yokukansan have similar evidence for managing DLB neuropsychiatric symptoms. Level-2 evidence support the efficacy of Rivastigmine and Galantamine for managing cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PDD.

Conclusion

We list evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological management of DLB and PDD, and propose specific clinical guidelines for improving their clinical management.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^112pvvtm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Treatments for cognitive and functional losses in dementia prioritize symptomatic benefit: Because there is no cure for most cases of dementia, the primary goal of medication treatment for cognitive symptoms in dementia is to delay the progression of symptoms, with the hope that this delay will translate into a preservation of functional ability, maintaining the patient for as long as possible at a particular level of symptom severity; however, no medication treatment has been shown to delay the progression of neurodegeneration. The only FDA-approved medications for dementia or cognitive impairment are the cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), memantine, and the combination of ergoloid mesylates (approved for nonspecific cognitive decline). In addition, other drugs, including vitamin E, ginkgo biloba, and selegiline (approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and in patch form for the treatment of depression), are occasionally used for this purpose in selected patients, although they are not generally recommended, because their efficacy and safety are uncertain. Several other medications that had been proposed for the treatment or prevention of cognitive decline, including NSAIDs, statin medications, and estrogen supplementation (with conjugated equine estrogens), have shown a lack of efficacy and safety in placebo-controlled trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease and therefore are not recommended, and participation in clinical trials is another option available to patients with dementia.

### Efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on symptoms not responsive to levodopa in patients affected by Parkinson's disease without dementia: a systematic review [^114mKFvg]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

RCTs investigating the effects of ChIs on gait and balance disturbances in PD have yielded inconclusive results.

The discrepancies among study findings may be attributed to limitations of the available studies, such as differences in study design, patient characteristics and relatively small sample size, rather than to a true absence of effect.

Overall, there is considerable evidence of cholinergic system alterations in PD patients with gait and balance disturbances. These changes may primarily result from dysfunction in cholinergic locomotor regions, such as PPN, or disruptions in the basal forebrain, which could impair compensatory mechanisms, particularly in patients with attentional and executive function deficits. Research consistently shows differences in cholinergic innervation between patients with FOG and those without, as well as between fallers and non-fallers. This suggests a shared cholinergic pathology underlying both FOG and postural instability, which, in selected patients may improve with ChIs treatment. A large clinical trial (NCT04226248) is currently underway and is expected to provide further insights into the effects of ChIs on gait disturbances and falls.

A single RCT focused on the effect of ChIs on sleep disorders, specifically on RBD, reported estimates in favour of rivastigmine patch on the frequency of RBD episodes and sleep quality. Lack of data from adequately powered studies on people with PD does not allow drawing conclusions on the role of ChIs for the management of sleep disturbances.

The cholinergic system also plays a key role in regulating the sleep–wake cycle, beyond the noradrenergic system. The posterior midbrain, specifically the PPN and the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, is part of the reticular activating system, which is active during wakefulness and REM sleep. In contrast, the absence of cholinergic tone is associated with the slow waves characteristic of NREM sleep. However, data supporting the efficacy of ChIs in treating AD, PDD or DLB remains limited, hindering the ability to extrapolate information regarding the efficacy of ChIs in PD patients without dementia.

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for types of dementia other than Alzheimer's disease

The objective of the systematic review for this RQ was to identify all RCTs investigating the comparative efficacy of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for cognitive enhancement in dementia types other than.

Overall, 16 RCTs and one open-label study were included in the literature review. Nine studies enrolled people with VaD, three studies enrolled people with FTD, three studies enrolled people with cognitive impairment caused by multiple sclerosis and one study enrolled people with Huntington disease. Based on available evidence, the WG agreed to recommend only considering AChEIs or memantine in people with VaD if they have suspected comorbid AD, PDD or DLB, and not to offer them in people with FTD or cognitive impairment caused by multiple sclerosis.

### Effective pharmacologic management of Alzheimer's disease [^116dLEqC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

In order to assist physicians in the effective pharmacologic management of this challenging population, evidence-based pharmacologic treatment algorithms for the different stages of Alzheimer's disease have been developed. Evidence-based guidelines outlining pharmacotherapeutic strategies can be systematically implemented to optimize outcomes for patients in different stages of Alzheimer's disease. The first step toward the best possible long-term management is early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, thereby facilitating early initiation of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment, which may stabilize/reduce the rate of symptomatic cognitive and functional decline. Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy with rivastigmine, donepezil, or galantamine is endorsed as standard first-line therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-antagonist, memantine, may be used as monotherapy or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor for patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease, and as monotherapy for patients with severe Alzheimer's disease. During treatment, cognitive and functional status should be monitored over 6-month intervals, and pharmacologic therapy should ideally be continued until there are no meaningful social interactions and quality of life has irreversibly deteriorated.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^113AKkw5]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

APA practice guideline — memantine for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia: Memantine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Given randomized controlled trial evidence, memantine should be considered for treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease and can be prescribed whether or not a cholinesterase inhibitor is used; there is modest evidence that the combination of memantine and donepezil is better than donepezil alone, but there is no evidence that this combination is better than memantine alone, and there are not yet data to argue for or against its use beyond 6 months. In mild Alzheimer's disease, evidence suggests a small clinical benefit over placebo though not conclusive and clinicians may consider using it, whereas for vascular dementia the evidence does not support use. Reported adverse events are infrequent and mild (confusion, dizziness, headache, sedation, agitation, falls, constipation) and dropout rates have generally been the same as placebo. Dosing is described as starting at 5 mg once daily, increasing by 5 mg/day every week until a target dosage of 10 mg b.i.d.; one study demonstrated efficacy at 10 mg/day, dosages above 20 mg/day have not been studied, and lower dosages (e.g., 10 mg/day) should be considered in patients with compromised renal function.

Regarding medical management for Alzheimer's disease, more specifically with respect to memantine, EAN/EFNS/ENS 2015 guidelines recommend to consider memantine in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, taking into account expected therapeutic benefits and potential safety issues. Benefits on cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms are apparent, some non-cognitive symptoms - agitation, delusions - may respond better than others.

### Memantine for the treatment of dementia: a review on its current and future applications [^111G9ub2]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Annweiler and colleagues reported that the association of MEM plus vitamin D supplements had a statistically and clinically significant effect on the gain of global cognition improvement over AD symptoms. Likewise, the authors demonstrated that the combination was more effective than taking either substance alone. Interestingly, it has been reported that vitamin D shows neuroprotective effects such as antioxidant action, inhibiting the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase, regulating the activity of γ -glutamyl transpeptidase, increasing the synthesis of nerve growth factor, showing anti-inflammatory properties and also attenuating Aβ 1–42 accumulation. Therefore, the authors suggest that this association could act by a synergic effect increasing the neuroprotective action of MEM and, overall, providing a more complete protection in patients exposed to glutamatergic excitotoxicity. In addition, a new recent clinical trial (NCT01409694) named Alzheimer's disease Input of Vitamin D with mEmantine Assay (AD-IDEA) is being analyzed; however, no data have been reported from this study about the efficacy of the association improving cognitive function. Recently the same group reported in a clinical trial that MEM cognitive improvement depended on the plasmatic levels of vitamin D.

Interestingly MEM has been evaluated in the treatment of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Lindquist and colleagues reported a familial case of a patient with FTD, an adult neurodegenerative disorder with dementia and behavioral disturbances treated with MEM with a maintenance dosage of 10 mg twice a day. The authors suggest that, in this specific case of a patient with pathogenic mutation (R406W) in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene, MEM treatment could stabilize the progression of symptoms of disease. However, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial (NCT00545974) evaluated the efficacy of MEM in mild-to-moderate FTD and the main conclusion of this study was that MEM treatment do not ameliorate these dementia symptoms (Table 1).

APA practice guideline — Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia are defined by whether Parkinson's disease precedes cognitive impairment by more than 1 year (Parkinson's disease dementia) or whether cognitive impairment is the dominant symptom (dementia with Lewy bodies), and whether these entities are one condition or distinct ones remains unresolved. Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive neurological condition characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability with onset typically in middle to late life. In one large longitudinal study, dementia developed in nearly 80% of patients followed for 8 years. The dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has an insidious onset and slow progression with cognitive and motor slowing, executive dysfunction, and impairments in memory retrieval and flexibility; Parkinson's disease is important to psychiatrists because of the high prevalence of associated depression and the frequent occurrence of psychotic symptoms such as visual hallucinations during pharmacological treatment of the primary motor deficit.

### Treatment combinations for Alzheimer's disease: current and future pharmacotherapy options [^114FczrE]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

TYPES OF COMBINATION THERAPIES

Combination trials are distinct from add-on trials; the latter are the type typically used for new therapies in AD whereas, in combination therapy trials, two drugs are tested alone, in combination, and in comparison with placebo, usually in a 2×2 trial design. With add-on therapy, a new agent is compared with placebo in patients who are already receiving treatment with a background therapy. Most trials for new therapeutic agents in AD are conducted in patients already receiving cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, or both and are thus new types of add-on treatment. The benefit of combination trials versus add-on trials is that the combination design allows investigators to analyze the effects of each therapy alone and in concert with others, distinguishing the individual and synergistic effects of the trial therapies.

Treatment combinations can be characterized as pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic. Pharmacodynamic combinations are designed to exert multiple effects on disease biology; pharmacokinetic combinations affect a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination. Examples of pharmacokinetic combinations include levodopa plus a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor for treatment of Parkinson's disease and dextromethorphan plus quinidine for treatment of pseudobulbar affect. Pharmacokinetic combinations are not considered further in this review.

Pharmacodynamic combinations for treatment of AD can include symptomatic agents that address the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of AD without changing the underlying disease biology or disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that change disease course by addressing the underlying biology that leads to nerve cell death. Pharmacodynamic combinations allow the combination of ≥ 2 symptomatic agents, ≥ 2 DMTs, or complex combinations of symptomatic therapies and DMTs to treat AD. Current clinical add-on trials generally use standard-of-care agents (cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine) and a new DMT or symptomatic agent; additive effects of the multiple simultaneous therapies may be important for patient outcomes.

Memantine for Alzheimer's disease — trials ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months and enrolled moderate to severe dementia (MMSE 3 to 15) and mild to moderate dementia (MMSE 10 to 24). For mild Alzheimer's disease, two unpublished trials did not find benefit over placebo while one trial showed cognitive and functional improvement, and a meta-analysis showed a statistically significant but very small advantage; the FDA has not approved memantine for treatment of mild Alzheimer's disease. For moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, two published trials with 252 and 404 subjects found cognitive and functional improvement versus placebo, including one study in patients already taking donepezil; one unpublished study did not show benefit. A trial including 166 subjects with severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia showed greater cognitive and functional improvement with memantine than placebo, and there is evidence supporting the use of memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease with FDA approval for this use; data are not yet available to argue for or against use beyond 6 months.

### NMDA antagonists for treating the non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease [^114NPYyc]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Memantine

There were 11 human studies that described the neuropsychiatric symptoms with memantine treatment. All trials were conducted at 20 mg/day, unless noted otherwise.

The effect of memantine on cognition was assessed in five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and measured by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), or clinical dementia rating (CDR) scales. In a 24-week trial, the memantine group had a slight, yet significant improvement in cognition on the MMSE (p = 0.02). Overall, there was a greater improvement in the memantine group as 27% of patients experienced a moderate to substantial improvement and no placebo patients reported more than a slight improvement. However, there was an insignificant change in NPI scores. In a separate 24-week trial, 30 PD patients experienced improvements in cognition with medium to large effect sizes in information processing and recognition memory. In a 24-week trial with memantine, the NPI scores did not significantly differ in PD patients (p = 0.522). Although there were notable improvements in items such as apathy, anxiety, irritability, and depression, the improvements did not reach statistical significance when compared to placebo. Cognitive scores were insignificant for PD (p = 0.576). A placebo-controlled 24-week trial of memantine improved cognition among 32 PD patients, as evidenced by various scales, including the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive (0.002), the frontal assessment battery (p = 0.01), verbal fluency test (p = 0.01), and clock drawing test (p = 0.03). Notably, the improvement in NPI sub-sections included disinhibition (p = 0.006), irritability (p = 0.004), anxiety (p = 0.04), and hallucinations (p = 0.048) when compared to placebo. The most significant change was caused by the decreased disinhibition/impulsive behavior in four patients. The number of patients who improved was not specified among the other NPI sub-sections. There was no significant change or improvement with memantine at 12 weeks. When treatment was extended to 52 weeks, there were significant improvements and enhancement on cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms on all scales (p < 0.05).

### Implications and opportunities regarding biological frameworks in overt and prodromal dementia with lewy bodies [^11336jt9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with cognitive, motor, and other non‐motor symptoms leading to substantial disability, caregiver burden, and economic cost. No cure or disease‐modifying agent exists for DLB, and symptomatic treatments are only modestly beneficial and often not DLB‐specific. Debate remains as to whether DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), both Lewy body dementias, are the same, differing only by the relative timing of motor and cognitive symptom onset. This debate has impacted timely and accurate diagnosis, clinical management, and patient outcomes. Clinical trials also are affected, with some studies focusing on DLB or PDD groups individually, while others combine them in enrollment and outcome analyses, which does not account for distinct responses to interventions (e.g. memantine trial) and differences between DLB and PDD. The historic description of DLB as the Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its inclusion within the US National Institutes of Health AD and related dementias (ADRD) umbrella further increases confusion. Clinically, DLB has been likened to having AD and PD simultaneously given its cognitive and movement symptoms, even though not all people with DLB experience profound memory loss or parkinsonism. Biologically, DLB also may be "like AD and PD" given the frequent presence of alpha‐synuclein (α‐synuclein) Lewy pathology and AD copathology, though not in all cases. Therefore, DLB is often caught between AD and PD fields, clinically and biologically.

Implementation of pharmacological treatments in elderly patients with dementia states that low starting doses, small dose increases, and long intervals between dose increases are necessary, although some patients may ultimately need doses as high as would be appropriate for younger patients. Anticholinergic side effects may also lead to worsening cognitive impairment, confusion, or even delirium, orthostasis is common in elderly patients, and medications associated with central nervous system sedation may worsen cognition, increase the risk of falls, and put patients with sleep apnea at risk for additional respiratory depression; elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or dementia with Lewy bodies are especially susceptible to extrapyramidal side effects. For all these reasons, medications should be used with considerable care, and polypharmacy should be avoided whenever possible, and in nonemergency situations or when neuropsychiatric symptoms are not severe, nonpharmacological approaches should be attempted first to avoid the very significant morbidities associated with psychotropic medication use in elderly patients.

### Exacerbation of lewy bodies dementia due to memantine [^115vMQh1]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lewy body dementia (DLB) is common but frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease plus delirium or parkinsonism. DRUGS USED IN THIS DISORDER CAN CAUSE EXACERBATIONS: neuroleptic medication is relatively contraindicated because some patients show severe neuroleptic sensitivity, antiparkinsonian medication has the potential to exacerbate psychotic symptoms, and even cholinesterase inhibitors, while relatively safe, have provoked adverse responses in some DLB patients. There are few data available about the use of memantine in DLB.

Case Presentation

A 74-year-old man was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and parkinsonism. After memantine was started he developed severe fluctuations in awareness, visual hallucinations, agitation, and worsened parkinsonism. When he was evaluated thoroughly, the diagnosis was revised to Lewy body dementia, leading to changes in treatment that were associated with dramatic improvement in the patient's mental status.

Conclusions

In our patient, motor and cognitive symptoms worsened with memantine treatment; these resolved after memantine was discontinued.

### Patterns of dementia treatment in older adults with Parkinson's disease using nationwide medical claims data [^111K7EDP]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dementia is a common feature in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, data on dementia treatment patterns in patients with PD are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of dementia in individuals with PD and to describe the dementia treatment patterns in the Korean elderly population.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study using data obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Senior Cohort (NHIS-SC) database. The dataset comprised more than 500,000 health insurance beneficiaries from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2015. We estimated the incidence of patients newly diagnosed with dementia during this observational period, compared patient demographics, and analyzed the exposure to anticholinergic drugs among PD patients with (PD+D) and without (PD-D) dementia. Furthermore, the duration to dementia diagnosis and patterns of dementia treatment were evaluated.

Results

A cohort of 28,537 patients aged 60years or older who were diagnosed with PD by the NHIS was established. Within this cohort, 8620 patients were eligible study participants according to strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of these individuals, 3879 (45.0%) patients were newly diagnosed with dementia; the incidence of dementia in PD was 15.2 per 1000 person-years. The proportion of women was higher in the PD+D (64.6%) than the PD-D group (58.2%) (P < 0.001); furthermore, the use of anticholinergic medication was greater in PD+D (37.6%) than in PD-D (24.0%) patients. The incidence curves for dementia over time were the steepest during the first year and decreased every year thereafter. Approximately 60% of PD patients were diagnosed with dementia during the first 3years. Regarding the use of anti-dementia drugs, 2539 (65.5%) of 3879 PD+D were prescribed medication. During the observation period, 1799 (70.9%) patients were prescribed only one type of anti-dementia drug. In this monotherapy group, the most commonly prescribed medication was donepezil (1313[73.0%]), followed by rivastigmine (capsule and patch; 246[13.7%]), memantine (187[10.4%]), and galantamine (53[2.9%]).

Conclusions

In Korea, dementia was observed to occur relatively soon after the diagnosis of PD. Anti-dementia medication was prescribed to approximately 66% of PD+D patients, with the majority receiving donepezil as monotherapy.

### The differential diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease [^116F5fMB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Identifying patients at risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) remains challenging in clinical practice, even as scientific understanding of dementia advances generally. That said, successfully navigating the associated differential diagnosis in AD is essential, as various causes of cognitive impairment require different treatment strategies. In recent years, the armamentarium in AD has expanded with regulatory approval of a disease-modifying therapy-aducanumab-and may be shifting away from symptomatic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Concurrently, the role of biomarkers in AD is increasing, and these entities may soon play a greater role in determining patient eligibility for prophylactic interventions and the likelihood of disease progression. As the standard of care progresses, clinicians should educate patients and their care providers on the implications of these advances and reinforce lifestyle changes that can delay or prevent the onset of disease in those at risk of AD. In doing so, care providers can deliver the best care possible.

Parkinson's disease spectrum illnesses (including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) — management priorities include monitoring, psychosis risk, and selective pharmacotherapy. The cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and related illnesses requires a broad treatment approach that targets both cognitive and noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, and mild cognitive impairment may be partially ameliorated by dopaminergic agents prescribed for motor symptoms, so both cognitive and motor symptoms should be carefully monitored. Because dopaminergic agents predispose patients to visual hallucinations and other psychotic phenomena, especially in patients with dementia, these agents should be used with particular care, and the minimal dosage needed to control motor symptoms should be prescribed. Patients are vulnerable to delirium from medications and concomitant general medical conditions; therefore, development of these symptoms deserves thorough evaluation. Pharmacological and behavioral interventions have been shown to have beneficial effects for specific patients, but strong evidence guiding agent selection is lacking. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on cognition in dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia with Parkinson's disease with effects similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease. For noncognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies, if psychotic symptoms result in distress or danger, the judicious use of an antipsychotic agent, often at low doses, is indicated; although all antipsychotic agents can aggravate Parkinsonian motor disturbances and open-label data support second-generation antipsychotics, because antipsychotics can dramatically worsen dementia with Lewy bodies, they should be prescribed very cautiously. Depression is common in Parkinson's disease and may exacerbate functional impairment or be misinterpreted as dementia; data supporting psychotherapy or antidepressants are modest, but clinical experience supports their use.

Somatic pharmacotherapy considerations for elderly patients with dementia emphasize that medications are effective for some symptoms but must be used with caution in this patient population [I], that age-related pharmacokinetic changes may increase sensitivity and patients with dementia may be more likely to experience anticholinergic effects, orthostasis, sedation, and parkinsonism, and that symptoms of dementia may compromise adherence; consequently, low starting doses, small dose increases, long intervals between increments, and ensuring a system to enhance proper medication adherence may be needed [I].

### Long-term effects of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine on cognitive decline, cardiovascular events, and mortality in dementia with lewy bodies: an up to 10-year follow-up study [^111t7htL]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings, however, disagree with other trials/studies. For instance, a recent network meta‐analysis, which included eight randomized controlled trials, did not demonstrate any significant differences between the effects of various dosages of donepezil (3 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg), rivastigmine (not mentioned dose in the meta‐analysis), or memantine on MMSE changes compared to placebo. Subgroup analysis of the NACCUDS cohort showed that ChEI use did not exhibit significant cognitive benefits compared with nonusers in Lewy body disease, which also includes Parkinson's disease dementia, and may have a different response to ChEI treatment. The observed disparity between these reports and our study might be explained by differences in study design (clinical trial vs. cohort study), as well as variations in ages, genders distributions, diagnostic groups, patient comorbidities, and treatment strategies between our cohort and the subcohort from NACCUDS. However, we believe that these previous studies included insufficient number of patients with shorter follow‐up periods, which could have limited their power to detect treatment effects on cognitive performance.

The potential mechanism underlying the improvement of MMSE scores with ChEI treatment in DLB is associated with the cholinergic system. Previous studies demonstrated that DLB patients exhibit a pronounced impairment of the cholinergic system. Specifically, atrophy in the basal forebrain, particularly in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and its associated cholinergic projections, has been shown already in the prodromal stages of DLB. Furthermore, impairment of cholinergic system has been associated with cognitive functioning in individuals with prodromal DLB. Similarly, DLB patients' performance on the MMSE correlates with the degree of impairment in their cholinergic circuits, as assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation. Of note, associations between volume loss in the basal forebrain and cognitive impairments were repeatedly shown to be stronger in DLB compared to AD patients. This observation, coupled with higher gene expression levels of acetylcholinesterase in DLB as compared with AD patients, led to the hypothesis that treatment with ChEI would be more effective in slowing cognitive decline in DLB compared to AD. In fact, DLB patients without AD co‐pathology were more likely to benefit from ChEIsthan DLB patients with AD co‐pathology. These findings suggest that targeting the cholinergic system may hold greater promise in delaying cognitive decline in DLB, particularly in cases without AD co‐pathology.

Severely and profoundly impaired patients — late-stage dementia management emphasizes approved cognitive agents, targeted symptom control, nursing care, advance care planning, and hospice. Of the cholinesterase inhibitors, only donepezil has thus far been approved for use in late-stage disease; memantine, which has been approved for use in severe dementia, may provide modest benefits and has few adverse effects, and if the benefit of a medication is unclear, a brief medication-free trial may be used to assess whether continued treatment is worthwhile. Depression, if present, should be treated vigorously, and psychotic symptoms and agitation should be treated pharmacologically if they cause distress to the patient or significant danger or disruption to caregivers or to other residents of long-term-care facilities. It is important to ensure adequate nursing care, including measures to prevent bedsores and contractures, and the treatment team should help the family prepare for the patient's death with timely discussions about feeding-tube placement, treatment of infection, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and intubation. Hospice care is an underused resource for patients with end-stage dementia that provides physical support with an emphasis on attentive nursing care and relief of discomfort and emotional support for the family during the last months of life, and a physician must certify that the patient meets hospice criteria for admission for hospice benefits to be available.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors for Parkinson's disease dementia [^113XnxtZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The loss of cholinergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic innervations seen in Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) suggest a potential role for cholinesterase inhibitors. Concerns have been expressed about a theoretical worsening of Parkinson's disease related symptoms particularly movement symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and health economic data relating to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in PDD.

Search Strategy

The trials were identified from the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 19 April 2005 using the search term parkinson*This register contains records from major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly. Comprehensive searches of abstracts from major scientific meetings were performed. Pharmaceutical companies were approached for information regarding additional and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies assessing the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors in PDD. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were stated to limit bias.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (IM, CF) independently reviewed the quality of the studies utilising criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Medications were examined separately and as a group. The outcome measures assessed were in the following domains: neuropsychiatric features, cognition, global impression, daily living activities, quality of life, burden on caregiver, Parkinsonian related symptoms, treatment acceptability as determined by withdrawal from trials, safety as determined by the frequency of adverse events, institutionalisation, death and health economic factors.

Main Results

A detailed and systematic search of relevant databases identified one published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Emre 2004) involving 541 patients that compared rivastigmine with placebo. Rivastigmine produced statistically significant improvements in several outcome measures. On the primary cognitive measure, the ADAS-Cog, rivastigmine was associated with a 2.80 point ADAS-Cog improvement [WMD -2.80, 95% Cl -4.26 to -1.34, P = 0.0002] and a 2.50 point ADCS-ADL improvement [95% Cl 0.43 to 4.57, P = 0.02] relative to placebo. Clinically meaningful (moderate or marked) improvement occurred in 5.3% more patients on rivastigmine, and meaningful worsening occurred in 10.1% more patients on placebo. Tolerability appeared to be a significant issue. Significantly more patients on rivastigmine dropped out of the study due to adverse events [62/362 versus 14/179, OR 2.44, 95% Cl 1.32 to 4.48, P = 0.004]. Nausea [20/179 versus 105/362, OR 3.25, 95% Cl 1.94 to 5.45, P < 0.00001], tremor [7/179 versus 37/362, OR 2.80, 95% Cl 1.22 to 6.41, P = 0.01] and in particular vomiting [3/179 versus 60/362, OR 11.66, 95% Cl 3.60 to 37.72, P < 0.0001] were significantly more common with rivastigmine. However, significantly fewer patients died on rivastigmine than placebo [4/362 versus 7/179, OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.95, P = 0.04]

Authors' Conclusions

Rivastigmine appears to improve cognition and activities of daily living in patients with PDD. This results in clinically meaningful benefit in about 15% of cases. There is a need for more studies utilising pragmatic measures such as time to residential care facility and both patient and carer quality of life assessments. Future trials should involve other cholinesterase inhibitors, utilise tools to analyse the data that limit any bias and measure health economic factors. It is unlikely that relying solely on the last observation carried forward (LOCF) is sufficient. Publication of the observed case data in the largest trial would assist (Emre 2004). Adverse events were associated with the cholinergic activity of rivastigmine, but may limit patient acceptability as evidenced by the high drop out rate in the active arm.

Variables and analyses

All analyses were descriptive and involved the three key variables diagnosis, professional group, and ADD defined in Table 1. The three variables were described in relation to each other. Comparisons are based on the magnitude of differences without any statistical testing. Analyses were carried out both on patient level and diagnosis or prescription level.

Table 1.
Variables included in descriptive health claims data analysis of dementia. a

The quarter with the initial dementia diagnosis in a patient is called index quarter. Medication data was only available for filled prescriptions.

A patient may have received more than one diagnostic code of dementia and a prescription of more than one type of ADDs. For the purpose of investigating switches compared to the initial diagnosis or drug use, the diagnosis reported at most doctors' visits was called the main diagnosis for that patient and the most frequent ADD prescribed was defined as the main drug. If two diagnoses were reported with the same frequency, both diagnoses were simultaneously reported (double diagnosis); an analogous method was applied to ADDs (double medications).

In Germany, the S3 guidelines "Demenzen"give recommendations for the diagnostics and treatment of dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only diagnostic code of dementia with recommended ADD treatment, namely with cholinesterase-inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine. For vascular dementia (VaD) as well as two codes of other specific dementias (Morbus Parkinson, F02.3, and Lewy-body dementia, G31.82), an off-label use of ChEIs and/or memantine may be considered. Unspecified dementia (UD) was not explicitly described in the guidelines. Due to its unknown etiology, we refer to UD as a diagnostic code rather than a type of dementia; a type infers a known etiology like with AD, VaD, or other specific dementia.

All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.4.

### Efficacy of memantine on behavioral and psychological symptoms related to dementia: a systematic meta-analysis [^113MN1YF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The behavioral and psychological symptoms related to dementia (BPSD) are difficult to manage and are associated with adverse patient outcomes.

Objective

To systematically analyze the data on memantine in the treatment of BPSD.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Pharm-line, the Cochrane Centre Collaboration, www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.controlled-trials.com, and PsycINFO (1966-July 2007). We contacted manufacturers and scrutinized the reference sections of articles identified in our search for further references, including conference proceedings. Two researchers (IM and CF) independently reviewed all studies identified by the search strategy. We included 6 randomized, parallel-group, double-blind studies that rated BPSD with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) in our meta-analysis. Patients had probable Alzheimer's disease and received treatment with memantine for at least one month. Overall efficacy of memantine on the NPI was established with a t-test for the average difference between means across studies, using a random effects model.

Results

Five of the 6 studies identified had NPI outcome data. In these 5 studies, 868 patients were treated with memantine and 882 patients were treated with placebo. Patients on memantine improved by 1.99 on the NPI scale (95% Cl -0.08 to -3.91; p = 0.041) compared with the placebo group.

Conclusions

Initial data appear to indicate that memantine decreases NPI scores and may have a role in managing BPSD. However, there are a number of limitations with the current data; the effect size was relatively small, and whether memantine produces significant clinical benefit is not clear.

### Dementia with lewy bodies [^111BVPjc]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently associated with dementia. The pathogenesis of this dementia is complex, related to deficiency of several biogenic amines and cortical Lewy body deposition, as well as co-existent age-related brain changes, both of the Alzheimer type and vascular. However, degeneration of the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert may have an important contribution to the cognitive decline. The dementia of PD has a grave effect on the quality of life of the patients and their caregivers, as well as a negative effect on their survival. The treatment of dementia associated with PD with cholinesterase inhibitors produced gratifying (although limited) results. Future studies should define the exact role of these agents in the treatment of the dementia of PD. Another major problem presented by demented PD patients is the occurrence of delusions and hallucinations, which make the life of patients and caregivers miserable. Classical neuroleptics are of course contra-indicated in these patients but recent data increase concern about the safety of novel derivatives, leaving a void in the pharmacological armamentarium available when these manifestations appear.

### Parkinsonianlike signs and risk of incident Alzheimer disease in older persons… [^116RDwnd]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Parkinsonianlike signs are common in older persons, but little is known about how their severity or rate of progression is related to the development of Alzheimer disease or decline in cognition. Objective To examine the association of progression of parkinsonianlike signs with incident AD and cognitive decline. Main Outcome Measures Clinically diagnosed AD and change in global and specific measures of cognitive function. Results During an average of 4. 6 years of observation, 114 persons developed AD. The global UPDRS score increased in 79% of participants, who were divided into tertiles with the least, moderate, or most rapid progression. We examined the relationship of progression to disease risk in a proportional hazards model that controlled for baseline global UPDRS and demographic variables. Conclusion Progression of parkinsonianlike signs in old age is associated with decline in cognitive function and the development of AD.

PARKINSONIANLIKE SIGNS are common in older persons with and without Alzheimer disease. 1–5 Literature suggests that the presence of these signs may be associated with an increased risk of developing AD. 6 However, recent data suggest that parkinsonianlike signs in older persons are multidimensional 7 and often progressive. 5 Furthermore, the severity of parkinsonianlike signs assessed at one point in time is not strongly predictive of the rate at which the signs progress. 5 This suggests that understanding the relationship of these signs to AD will require information about how progression in different signs is related to the development of AD and its principal manifestation, cognitive decline. At baseline, participants had a uniform, structured clinical evaluation that was repeated annually with examiners blinded to previously collected data.

The evaluation, which has been previously described, 7, 9 included a medical history, neurologic examination, cognitive function testing, and review of brain scan when available. On the basis of this evaluation, a study physician classified persons with respect to AD and other common conditions of old age. During an average of 4. 6 years of follow-up, 114 persons developed AD. Five persons developed other forms of dementia, and they were excluded from analyses of incident AD. In an initial proportional hazards model that included terms for the potentially confounding effects of age, sex, and education, each additional point on the UPDRS at baseline was associated with a 4% increase in risk of AD. Because AD arises by minute degrees, separating normality from disease can be difficult.

Therefore, to ensure that our results were not due to imprecise clinical classification of disease, we examined the relationship of UPDRS scores to cognitive decline, a continuous outcome that reflects the progressive nature of the disease. To make use of all available data, the global measure of cognitive function was used in initial analyses. It ranged from −1. 69 to

1. 37 at baseline, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. Cognition declined an average of 0. 04 unit per year, but wide individual differences were observed. Those with higher global UPDRS scores at baseline tended to have lower global cognition at baseline and more rapid cognitive decline, but much heterogeneity was evident. By contrast, annual rates of change on the global UPDRS and cognitive measures, estimated from separate random effects models, were strongly correlated.

### Memantine for the treatment of dementia: a review on its current and future applications [^116h6ipD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology of severe prognosis, currently incurable, and highly prevalent in aged people. The first description of the disease was carried out in 1906 by a German psychiatrist and neurologist, Alois Alzheimer, when exploring the brain tissue of a patient, Auguste Deter, who had died from a mental illness unknown at that time. Today, it is the cause of 50–70% of dementia cases and, according to the Alzheimer's Association, 13% of people over 65 in developed countries suffer from AD, where it is the fifth cause of death in patients of this age group. If unchecked, global incidence will quadruple to 114 million by 2050 according to population growth projections by the World Health Organization (WHO). This would imply unsustainable economic burdens for all health systems, in addition to its social impact.

AD can be classified according to the age at which it begins to manifest, that is, if it has an early onset, developing before the age of 65 (3–5% prevalence), or if it occurs after the 65 years of age (95–97% prevalence). Additionally, the pathology may be of hereditary or sporadic origin, the latter being the most common (98% prevalence). Pathogenesis of late onset AD is very complex. Other than aging, which is the main factor involved in the development of the disease, it may be associated with dietary and environmental factors, including long term consumption of high caloric diets and sedentary lifestyles. Overall, it is the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors that lead to AD, together with the disruption of epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene dynamics and expression.

### Memantine for the treatment of dementia [^1152P19p]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of cholinesterase inhibitors to correct the cholinergic deficit in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. However, the treatment is only effective in about half of the patients for whom it is prescribed. Vascular dementia may respond, at least to some extent, to these drugs (T Erkinjuntti and colleagues, Lancet 2002; 359: 1283–90). In 2002, the Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products recommended that memantine-a drug that acts on the glutamatergic system rather than the cholinergic system-be approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderately severe to severe AD. Clinical trials have shown some effectiveness of memantine in the treatment of vascular dementia, although it has not been approved for use in this disorder.

Recent Developments

The results of a study of the effects of memantine on moderate to severe AD have recently been published (B Reisberg and colleagues, N Engl J Med 2003; 348: 1333–41). Reisberg and colleagues treated their patients for 28 weeks, assessed several outcome variables, and found that memantine reduced clinical deterioration without significant adverse effects. This study is important as memantine is the only treatment licensed for patients with more advanced AD. WHERE NEXT? Several questions about the use of memantine as a treatment for AD remain to be answered. How beneficial is memantine treatment in routine clinical practice compared with clinical trials? What is the best way to assess treatment effects? How long do the beneficial effects last? Does memantine have neuroprotective, rather than just symptomatic, effects? In addition, we need to know when to switch from cholinesterase inhibitors to memantine or when to co-prescribe memantine with cholinesterase inhibitors. The efficacy of memantine in vascular dementia also requires further investigation.

Dementia with Lewy bodies — clinical features, cautions, and frequency: Dementia with Lewy bodies has been recognized clinically only in the last 10–15 years and differs from Alzheimer's disease by earlier, more prominent visual hallucinations, early parkinsonian features (postural instability and falls), cognitive fluctuations lasting days to weeks, and a somewhat more rapid evolution. Patients are markedly sensitive to the extrapyramidal effects of antipsychotic medications, and these medications should be used only with the utmost caution. Lewy bodies may account for as many as 7%–26% of dementia cases, depending on the criteria used. The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are interrelated with an abundance of Lewy inclusion bodies in both subcortical and cortical regions; autopsy often reveals both dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease, creating controversy about their independence, and development of valid clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria is an area of active research.

Memantine and other pharmacologic options for cognitive symptoms indicate that memantine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist approved for moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease, may provide modest benefits and has few adverse effects; thus, it may be considered for such patients [I], with some evidence of benefit in mild Alzheimer's disease [III] and very limited evidence in vascular dementia [I]. Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is no longer recommended for treatment of cognitive symptoms of dementia because of limited evidence for efficacy and safety concerns [II], and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, statin medications, and estrogen supplementation (with conjugated equine estrogens) have shown a lack of efficacy and safety in placebo-controlled trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease and therefore are not recommended [I].

### Treatment of Alzheimer's disease: current status and new perspectives [^115PsEy7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most prevalent cause of dementia with ageing. Pharmacological treatment of AD is based on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which have beneficial effects on cognitive, functional, and behavioural symptoms of the disease, but their role in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Other pharmacological therapies are becoming available — including the recently approved drug memantine, an NMDA channel blocker indicated for advanced AD. Here, we review clinical features of the available cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) including their pharmacological properties, the evidence for switching from one agent to another, "head to head" studies, and the emerging evidence for the use of memantine in AD. New therapeutic approaches — including those more closely targeted to the pathogenesis of the disease — will also be reviewed. These potentially disease modifying treatments include amyloid-beta-peptide vaccination, secretase inhibitors, cholesterol-lowering drugs, metal chelators, and anti-inflammatory agents.

Fig. 2
Incidence of dementia in Parkinson's disease (PD) over time. The X-axis represents the quarter (Q) and year, and the Y-axis represents the number of people. The slope of the first year was the steepest, and decreased every year thereafter. Approximately 25% of patients were diagnosed with dementia within the first year; approximately 60% of patients were diagnosed within the first 3 years, and more than 80% of patients were diagnosed within the first 5 years. The higher the age group, the more rapid the diagnosis of dementia

Use of anti-dementia medication in PD

In PD + D patients, 2539 (65.5%) of 3879 individuals were prescribed anti-dementia drugs, while 1340 (34.5%) patients were not. The prescription patterns of anti-dementia medication are shown in Table 2. During the entire observational period, 1799 (70.9%) of 2539 individuals were prescribed only one anti-dementia medication (or monotherapy). The most commonly prescribed drug was donepezil (1951 patients, 65.2%), followed by rivastigmine (capsule and patch combined: 753 patients, 25.1%), memantine (563 patients, 18.8%), and galantamine (186 patients, 6.2%). The first medication prescribed was donepezil, followed by memantine, rivastigmine patch, rivastigmine capsule, and galantamine. When the number of patients who were first prescribed drugs was compared with that of patients on monotherapy throughout the entire observation period, donepezil (78.2%) had the highest prescription persistence rate; this was followed by memantine (61.1%), rivastigmine patch (57.5%), rivastigmine capsule (51.9%), and galantamine (40.5%). Of 2539 patients, 740 (29.1%) patients were prescribed more than two anti-dementia drugs during the observational period; however, only 26 patients (1.0%) started more than two drugs as the first drug chosen, implying that most patients who were prescribed more than two anti-dementia drugs were switched from one to a different anti-dementia drug, or combined later.

### Pharmacological management of psychosis in elderly patients with parkinsonism [^116N8Kno]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Parkinsonism is a characteristic feature of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and is commonly seen in Alzheimer's disease. Psychosis commonly appears during the course of these illnesses. Treatment of parkinsonism with antiparkinsonian medications constitutes an additional risk factor for the appearance or worsening of psychosis. Conversely, treatment of psychosis with antipsychotic drugs in patients with parkinsonism might worsen the underlying movement disorder, especially in the elderly. In this article, we review parkinsonian conditions in the elderly and offer guidelines to assess and manage comorbid psychosis. We focus on the pharmacologic management of psychosis with atypical antipsychotic medications and briefly review the role of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

We use data from the Swedish Registry on cognitive/dementia disorders (SveDem;). SveDem is a web‐based registry started in 2007 with the aim to characterize and follow all individuals with dementia from the time of the dementia diagnosis in Sweden. The variables selected for the current study include patient demographics, MMSE scores, type of dementia, and treatment at diagnosis date and annual follow‐ups. For this study, we integrated SveDem with additional data from the National Patient Registry, which includes diagnoses from specialist clinics and hospitals, the Prescribed Drug Registry (where all prescribed drugs are recorded since 2006), and the Total Population and Causes of Death Registry.

In Sweden, individuals with dementia undergo a comprehensive diagnostic assessment according to the national guidelines of dementia care published by the Swedish Board of Health and Welfareto ensure they receive appropriate treatment and care tailored to their specific dementia diagnosis. Diagnoses are classified according to International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10). Additionally, McKeith criteriawas used for DLB, including the assessment of core clinical features such as progressive cognitive decline, cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement, and parkinsonism. Additional supportive features, including sleep behavior disorder and abnormal dopamine transporter imaging, may further support the diagnosis. Achieving an accurate diagnosis often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, geriatricians, neuropsychologists, and other specialists.

There is no information on ethnicity in Sweden. Participants and their caregivers were informed verbally and in writing about SveDem and had the option to decline participation. However, the requirement of written consent for this study was waived due to the register data being pseudonymized before delivery to our research group. The regional ethics committee in Stockholm approved the study, which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Diagnostic procedures for Parkinson's disease dementia: recommendations from the movement disorder society task force [^117BpBq9]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

A preceding article described the clinical features of Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) and proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for "probable" and "possible" PD-D. The main focus of this article is to operationalize the diagnosis of PD-D and to propose practical guidelines based on a two level process depending upon the clinical scenario and the expertise of the evaluator involved in the assessment. Level I is aimed primarily at the clinician with no particular expertise in neuropsychological methods, but who requires a simple, pragmatic set of tests that are not excessively time-consuming. Level I can be used alone or in concert with Level II, which is more suitable when there is the need to specify the pattern and the severity on the dementia of PD-D for clinical monitoring, research studies or pharmacological trials. Level II tests can also be proposed when the diagnosis of PD-D remains uncertain or equivocal at the end of a Level I evaluation. Given the lack of evidence-based standards for some tests when applied in this clinical context, we have tried to make practical and unambiguous recommendations, based upon the available literature and the collective experience of the Task Force. We accept, however, that further validation of certain tests and modifications in the recommended cut off values will be required through future studies.

### Present algorithms and future treatments for Alzheimer's disease [^11791pZe]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Overall, in patients who show a progression of symptoms while on ChEI monotherapy, consideration should be given to either increasing the dose of their current therapy (if applicable), switching the patient to another ChEI, or adding memantine. Information regarding dosage increases is conflicting. According to the APA 2014 guidelines, there was insufficient evidence to show clinically meaningful advantages of administering higher doses of donepezil, although clinicians may consider this on a case-by-case basis provided that close monitoring is performed. However, higher doses of a rivastigmine patch may be associated with greater benefit than lower doses. A 24-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind study in patients with severe AD found superior effects on cognition and function at weeks 16 and 24 with the 13.3 mg/24 h rivastigmine patch compared with the 4.6 mg/24 h patch. AEs and discontinuations were similar between the groups. Similarly, patients who were switched to the 13.3 mg/24 h patch performed significantly better on functional outcomes compared with those who stayed on the lower 9.5 mg/24 h patch. Although randomized, placebo controlled trials of cholinesterase inhibitors have shown benefit in regards to cognition, behavior, and daily function, as well as a slower rate of decline compared with untreated patients, no studies to date of ChEIs or memantine have shown significant reductions in time to conversion to AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment. This finding is reflected in the recent AAN practice guidelines wherein they recommend that if a clinician chooses to use these agents in a patient with mild cognitive impairment then they must first discuss the lack of clinical efficacy evidence with their patients.

Decisions about duration of treatment and therapy discontinuation should be made with care and take into consideration patient needs, comorbidities, presence of AEs, adherence, and effectiveness. In mild to moderate disease, lack of efficacy or presence of AEs should prompt consideration of a switch in therapy. The presence of hallucinations and delusions before discontinuation of ChEIs may predict clinical deterioration. Discontinuation of ChEIs may also be associated with cognitive decline; however, antidementia drugs should be discontinued when patients with AD reach the terminal stage of the disease, at which time they usually become eligible for hospice. At this stage, consideration should be given to stopping most, if not all, nonpalliative therapies.

### Real-world use of symptomatic treatments in early Alzheimer's disease [^111R7Smp]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Data analysis

A formal narrative synthesis was planned based on the reporting guideline for Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) in systematic reviews. All included studies were summarized by country and grouped according to disease stage (MCI due to AD or mild AD dementia). A summary of study design, patient characteristics, treatment pattern, and risk of bias was presented. To capture treatment patterns, the range of treatment use was reported for 'any AChE inhibitor monotherapy' (donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine), memantine monotherapy, AChE inhibitor plus memantine combinations, other combined therapies, or no symptomatic treatment. To indicate the certainty of the evidence, the findings of the synthesis were reported alongside the risk of bias, number of studies, and the study size (or range). To summarize the best quality data, studies at high risk of bias were extracted (Supplementary Table 9 (Risk of bias assessment) and 10 (Study results)) but not considered further in the data ranges for analysis and synthesis. Studies that reported on drug dose only in populations receiving symptomatic treatment were reported separately as they were not directly comparable to treatment pattern data.

### Dementia in Parkinson's disease: cause and treatment [^115QHNZq]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dementia in Parkinson's disease is increasingly being recognized. A number of studies have recently appeared on the epidemiology, clinical features, pathological correlations and treatment of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of recent findings on dementia associated with Parkinson's disease, from February 2003 to the present.

Recent Findings

The cumulative prevalence of dementia in Parkinson's disease can be as high as 78%; dementia is especially prevalent in older patients. The profile of dementia seems to be different from that of Alzheimer's disease and similar to that of dementia with Lewy bodies. Clinicopathological correlation studies have suggested that dementia correlates best with Lewy bodies in certain limbic and cortical areas, but not all patients with sufficient Lewy bodies for a pathological diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies are demented. Cholinergic deficits in the cerebral cortex can be shown with in-vivo imaging studies, and seem to be more severe than in Alzheimer's disease. Several small studies with three different cholinesterase inhibitors suggest that these drugs can be effective in the treatment of PD dementia.

Summary

Dementia is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease. The prototype of dementia in Parkinson's disease is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. Neurochemically the most significant deficit seems to be cholinergic; dementia seems to correlate best with cortical and limbic Lewy bodies. Preliminary evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors may be effective in Parkinson's disease dementia, and the results of large-scale, randomized and controlled studies are awaited to confirm these findings.

### Memantine for the treatment of dementia: a review on its current and future applications [^111X9bzq]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence in the brain of extracellular amyloid-β protein (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), ionotropic glutamate receptor, are essential for processes like learning and memory. An excessive activation of NMDARs has been associated with neuronal loss. The discovery of extrasynaptic NMDARs provided a rational and physiological explanation between physiological and excitotoxic actions of glutamate. Memantine (MEM), an antagonist of extrasynaptic NMDAR, is currently used for the treatment of AD jointly with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. It has been demonstrated that MEM preferentially prevents the excessive continuous extrasynaptic NMDAR disease activation and therefore prevents neuronal cell death induced by excitotoxicity without disrupting physiological synaptic activity. The problem is that MEM has shown no clear positive effects in clinical applications while, in preclinical stages, had very promising results. The data in preclinical studies suggests that MEM has a positive impact on improving AD brain neuropathology, as well as in preventing Aβ production, aggregation, or downstream neurotoxic consequences, in part through the blockade of extrasynaptic NMDAR. Thus, the focus of this review is primarily to discuss the efficacy of MEM in preclinical models of AD, consider possible combinations of this drug with others, and then evaluate possible reasons for its lack of efficacy in clinical trials. Finally, applications in other pathologies are also considered.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia with lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease [^112WC6KR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Previous Cochrane reviews have considered the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in both Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The clinical features of DLB and PDD have much in common and are distinguished primarily on the basis of whether or not parkinsonism precedes dementia by more than a year. Patients with both conditions have particularly severe deficits in cortical levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Therefore, blocking its breakdown using cholinesterase inhibitors may lead to clinical improvement.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease falling short of dementia (CIND-PD) (considered as separate phenomena and also grouped together as Lewy body disease).

Search Methods

The trials were identified from a search of ALOIS, the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (on 30 August 2011) using the search terms Lewy, Parkinson, PDD, DLB, LBD. This register consists of records from major healthcare databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and many ongoing trial databases and is updated regularly. Reference lists of relevant studies were searched for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB, PDD and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (CIND-PD).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from published reports by one review author (MR). The data for each 'condition' (that is DLB, PDD or CIND-PD) were considered separately and, where possible, also pooled together. Statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager version 5.0.

Main Results

Six trials met the inclusion criteria for this review, in which a total of 1236 participants were randomised. Four of the trials were of a parallel group design and two cross-over trials were included. Four of the trials included participants with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with dementia (Aarsland 2002a; Dubois 2007; Emre 2004; Ravina 2005), of which Dubois 2007 remains unpublished. Leroi 2004 included patients with cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease (both with and without dementia). Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were included in only one of the trials (McKeith 2000). For global assessment, three trials comparing cholinesterase inhibitor treatment to placebo in PDD (Aarsland 2002a; Emre 2004; Ravina 2005) reported a difference in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) score of -0.38, favouring the cholinesterase inhibitors (95% CI -0.56 to -0.24, P < 0.0001). For cognitive function, a pooled estimate of the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on cognitive function measures was consistent with the presence of a therapeutic benefit (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.34, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.23, P < 0.00001). There was evidence of a positive effect of cholinesterase inhibitors on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in patients with PDD (WMD 1.09, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.73, P = 0.0008) and in the single PDD and CIND-PD trial (WMD 1.05, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.68, P = 0.01) but not in the single DLB trial. For behavioural disturbance, analysis of the pooled continuous data relating to behavioural disturbance rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.04, P = 0.01). For activities of daily living, combined data for the ADCS and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living rating scales favoured treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.02, P = 0.03). For safety and tolerability, those taking a cholinesterase inhibitor were more likely to experience an adverse event (318/452 versus 668/842; odds ratio (OR) 1.64, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.15, P = 0.0003) and to drop out (128/465 versus 45/279; OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.84, P = 0.0006). Adverse events were more common amongst those taking rivastigmine (357/421 versus 173/240; OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.53 to 3.38, P < 0.0001) but not those taking donepezil (311/421 versus 145/212; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.80, P = 0.25). Parkinsonian symptoms in particular tremor (64/739 versus 12/352; OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.09, P = 0.002), but not falls (P = 0.39), were reported more commonly in the treatment group but this did not have a significant impact on the UPDRS (total and motor) scores (P = 0.71). Fewer deaths occurred in the treatment group than in the placebo group (4/465 versus 9/279; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84, P = 0.03).

Authors' Conclusions

The currently available evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with PDD, with a positive impact on global assessment, cognitive function, behavioural disturbance and activities of daily living rating scales. The effect in DLB remains unclear. There is no current disaggregated evidence to support their use in CIND-PD.

Moderately impaired patients with Alzheimer's disease — safety, supervision, driving, supports, and symptom management should be addressed routinely. As patients become more impaired, they are likely to require more supervision to remain safe, and safety issues should be addressed as part of every evaluation. Families should be advised about the possibility of accidents due to forgetfulness, of difficulties coping with household emergencies, and of the possibility of wandering, and should be advised to determine whether the patient is handling finances appropriately and to consider taking over the paying of bills and other responsibilities. At this stage of the disease, nearly all patients should not drive, and families should be counseled to undertake measures to prevent patients from driving. A referral for some form of respite care may be helpful, and families should begin to consider and plan for additional support at home as well as discuss the patient's possible transfer to a long-term care facility. Treatment for cognitive symptoms should also be considered; for patients with Alzheimer's disease, currently available data suggest that the combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor plus memantine is more likely to delay symptom progression than a cholinesterase inhibitor alone during this stage of the illness. Delusions, hallucinations, agitation, and combativeness are prevalent, it may be helpful to reassure families that these symptoms are often treatable, and for patients in whom wandering is the only symptom, pharmacotherapy will rarely be indicated.

Mild cognitive impairment — cholinesterase inhibitors: There are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment at this time, and although clinical trials of cholinesterase inhibitors have enrolled narrower and better defined populations, even with these well-defined patients the evidence from clinical trials suggests the benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors is weak.

### Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Alzheimer's disease and other disorders associated with dementia: EFNS guideline [^112KzcWD]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this international guideline on dementia was to present a peer-reviewed evidence-based statement for the guidance of practice for clinical neurologists, geriatricians, psychiatrists, and other specialist physicians responsible for the care of patients with dementia. It covers major aspects of diagnostic evaluation and treatment, with particular emphasis on the type of patient often referred to the specialist physician. The main focus is Alzheimer's disease, but many of the recommendations apply to dementia disorders in general. The task force working group considered and classified evidence from original research reports, meta-analysis, and systematic reviews, published before January 2006. The evidence was classified and consensus recommendations graded according to the EFNS guidance. Where there was a lack of evidence, but clear consensus, good practice points were provided. The recommendations for clinical diagnosis, blood tests, neuroimaging, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, genetic testing, tissue biopsy, disclosure of diagnosis, treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and counselling and support for caregivers were all revised when compared with the previous EFNS guideline. New recommendations were added for the treatment of vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, for monitoring treatment, for treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia, and for legal issues. The specialist physician plays an important role together with primary care physicians in the multidisciplinary dementia teams, which have been established throughout Europe. This guideline may contribute to the definition of the role of the specialist physician in providing dementia health care.
