## Question

What are the most common symptoms of DKA in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology to anchor which symptoms are expected. Then, I should verify which pediatric studies actually quantify symptom frequencies. Next, I will synthesize a hierarchy of common symptoms and note age-related differences. After that, I should double-check for any conflicting data and reconcile them. Finally, I will contextualize the symptom pattern with diagnostic implications and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic basis so I don't jump to conclusions about symptoms that don't fit the mechanism. DKA arises from absolute or relative insulin deficiency with increased counterregulatory hormones, driving hyperglycemia, osmotic diuresis, dehydration, lipolysis, ketogenesis, and metabolic acidosis; clinically that translates to polyuria, polydipsia, volume depletion, gastrointestinal symptoms, and neurologic changes, which should shape the symptom profile I expect to see in children [^1c4044c1] [^27fa8cee].

> Next, I should review which pediatric sources actually quantify symptom frequencies. Wait, let me verify the most robust pediatric data. A large German registry of 2,121 children reported polyuria and polydipsia as the most frequent symptoms, with altered consciousness in 23.3% and coma in 10.9%, which aligns with the pathophysiology and the severity spectrum seen in children [^b4079421]. I should also confirm corroborating cohorts: Croatian data in 692 children similarly found polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss as the dominant features, reinforcing the primacy of these classic symptoms in pediatrics [^6922b36c]. Hold on, I should verify whether any high-quality reviews summarize pediatric frequencies; a contemporary review notes polyuria and polydipsia as most common, followed by weight loss, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnea, which matches the pediatric cohorts and the mechanistic expectation [^34c57fa9].

> I will now examine the hierarchy of symptoms and make sure I'm not overstating anything. Based on pediatric cohorts and reviews, the most common symptoms are polyuria and polydipsia, followed by weight loss, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnea, with enuresis or nocturia also frequent in younger children; altered mental status and Kussmaul respirations are important clinical signs of severity rather than universal early symptoms [^b4079421] [^6922b36c] [^34c57fa9] [^b9f54104]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought dyspnea might be among the top three, but I should correct that: while dyspnea is reported, it trails behind the classic triad of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss in frequency across pediatric series [^b4079421] [^6922b36c].

> Let me consider age-related differences so I don't overgeneralize. In children under 5 years, secondary enuresis and constipation are more prominent, and the very young deteriorate faster, so they may present with more advanced dehydration and neurologic compromise despite similar symptom types; this helps explain why DKA is more common and often more severe in toddlers and preschoolers [^5ba8255e] [^6850b52f]. I should double-check that this aligns with epidemiology: multiple studies confirm higher DKA rates in children under 5, especially under 2, which fits the clinical observation of faster progression and more non-specific early symptoms in this group [^c9db9b84] [^d4af9f82].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every symptom being universal. I need to check for conflicting data and reconcile it. Some systematic comparisons suggest that children with DKA at diagnosis may have more vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, weakness, anorexia, and altered mental status than those without DKA, which makes sense given greater metabolic derangement; however, these are relative differences and do not overturn the core hierarchy of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss as the most common overall symptoms in pediatric DKA presentations [^2c0fdf05]. I should confirm that these relative enrichments in DKA groups are consistent with clinical experience: yes, as acidosis and volume depletion worsen, gastrointestinal and respiratory compensatory signs become more prominent, which is reflected in these comparisons [^2c0fdf05].

> Next, I should review diagnostic implications so the symptom list is actionable. Polyuria and polydipsia with weight loss should trigger glucose and ketone testing; in ill-appearing children with vomiting, abdominal pain, tachypnea, or altered mental status, DKA must be considered urgently and confirmed with blood glucose, venous pH or bicarbonate, and ketones, because delays increase morbidity and the risk of cerebral edema [^2499c719] [^1c4044c1]. Let me verify that this aligns with pediatric guidance: contemporary pediatric standards emphasize early recognition of these features and immediate referral when DKA is suspected, which reinforces the clinical priority of identifying the classic symptom cluster promptly [^2499c719].

> Finally, I should acknowledge limitations so we don't overstate precision. Many pediatric symptom-frequency studies are retrospective and vary by region, era, and case definition, so exact percentages differ even though the rank order of symptoms is consistent; nonetheless, convergent data from large cohorts and reviews support polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss as the most common, with fatigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnea as frequent additional features, and enuresis or nocturia particularly relevant in younger children [^b4079421] [^6922b36c] [^34c57fa9]. I need to ensure I note that earlier, smaller series sometimes report different frequencies, but the directionality toward the classic triad remains stable across higher-quality pediatric datasets [^b4079421] [^6922b36c].

The most common symptoms of DKA in pediatric type 1 diabetes are **polyuria and polydipsia** (excessive urination and thirst), **weight loss**, and **fatigue** [^b4079421] [^6922b36c]. Nausea, vomiting, and **abdominal pain** are also frequent, often due to metabolic acidosis and dehydration [^34c57fa9] [^2c0fdf05]. Younger children may present with **secondary enuresis** and lethargy, and signs such as rapid, deep breathing (Kussmaul respirations), fruity-smelling breath, and altered mental status indicate progression to severe DKA [^b9f54104] [^ae4a9f65]. Early recognition of these symptoms is critical to prevent complications, including cerebral edema [^c1a0b088].

---

## Classic symptoms of DKA

The **classic symptoms** of DKA in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes include:

- **Polyuria and polydipsia**: Excessive urination and thirst are hallmark symptoms of hyperglycemia and are present in the majority of pediatric DKA cases [^b4079421] [^6922b36c].

- **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss is common due to insulin deficiency, leading to catabolism of fat and muscle tissue [^b4079421] [^6922b36c].

- **Fatigue and lethargy**: Children often present with generalized fatigue, weakness, and lethargy due to metabolic derangements and dehydration [^b4079421] [^6922b36c].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in pediatric DKA and are often due to **metabolic acidosis** and **dehydration**:

- **Nausea and vomiting**: Frequent symptoms, often leading to further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances [^34c57fa9] [^2c0fdf05].

- **Abdominal pain**: Commonly reported, sometimes severe enough to mimic acute abdomen, necessitating careful clinical evaluation [^34c57fa9] [^2c0fdf05].

---

## Respiratory symptoms

Respiratory symptoms are characteristic of metabolic acidosis and include **Kussmaul respirations** — rapid, deep breathing as a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis — and **fruity-smelling breath** due to acetone on the breath from ketone production [^b9f54104] [^ae4a9f65].

---

## Neurological symptoms

Neurological symptoms indicate severe DKA and require **immediate medical attention**:

- **Altered mental status**: Ranges from lethargy and confusion to coma in severe cases [^b9f54104] [^ae4a9f65].

- **Cerebral edema**: A rare but life-threatening complication, presenting with headache, altered consciousness, and papilledema [^c1a0b088] [^15cc918c].

---

## Age-specific symptoms

Younger children may present with **age-specific symptoms**, such as **secondary enuresis** — new-onset bedwetting or regression of toilet training, particularly in children under 5 years — and **irritability and lethargy**, with nonspecific symptoms including irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding [^5ba8255e] [^6850b52f].

### The evaluation and management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: a comprehensive review [^c8851e08]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, serious acute complication in children with diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can accompany new-onset type 1 insulin-dependent DM, or it can occur with established type 1 DM, during the increased demands of an acute illness or with decreased insulin delivery due to omitted doses or insulin pump failure. In addition, DKA episodes in children with type 2 DM are being reported with greater frequency. Although the diagnosis is usually straightforward in a known diabetes patient with expected findings, a sizable proportion of patients with new-onset DM present with DKA. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to acquaint clinicians with details regarding the pathophysiology, treatment caveats, and potential complications of DKA.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious condition that warrants immediate and aggressive intervention. Even with appropriate intervention, DKA is associated with significant morbidity and possible mortality in diabetic patients in the pediatric age group. With appreciation of its severity, proper understanding of the pathophysiology, and careful attention to the details of management and close monitoring, most cases will have a satisfactory outcome. Because treatment is costly and because the risk for morbidity remains even under the best of circumstances, prevention of DKA must be a major goal in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Involvement and close follow-up by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals with experience in dealing with diabetes in children and adolescents is the best way to avoid DKA.

Objective

To identify the factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cinahl and article reference lists.

Study Selection

Cohort studies including unselected groups of children and young adults presenting with new onset type 1 diabetes that distinguished between those who presented in diabetic ketoacidosis and those who did not and included a measurement of either pH or bicarbonate in the definition of diabetic ketoacidosis. There were no restrictions on language of publication.

Results

46 studies involving more than 24,000 children in 31 countries were included. Together they compared 23 different factors. Factors associated with increased risk were younger age (for < 2 years old v older, odds ratio 3.41 (95% confidence interval 2.54 to 4.59), for < 5 years v older, odds ratio 1.59 (1.38 to 1.84)), diagnostic error (odds ratio 3.35 (2.35 to 4.79)), ethnic minority, lack of health insurance in the US (odds ratio 3.20 (2.03 to 5.04)), lower body mass index, preceding infection (odds ratio 3.14 (0.94 to 10.47)), and delayed treatment (odds ratio 1.74 (1.10 to 2.77)). Protective factors were having a first degree relative with type 1 diabetes at the time of diagnosis (odds ratio 0.33 (0.08 to 1.26)), higher parental education (odds ratios 0.4 (0.20 to 0.79) and 0.64 (0.43 to 0.94) in two studies), and higher background incidence of type 1 diabetes (correlation coefficient -0.715). The mean duration of symptoms was similar between children presenting with or without diabetic ketoacidosis (16.5 days (standard error 6.2) and 17.1 days (6.0) respectively), and up to 38.8% (285/735) of children who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis had been seen at least once by a doctor before diagnosis.

Conclusions

Multiple factors affect the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis at the onset of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults, and there is potential time, scope, and opportunity to intervene between symptom onset and development of diabetic ketoacidosis for both parents and clinicians.

### Ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: frequency and clinical characteristics [^23399349]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), characterized by a biochemical triad of hyperglycaemia, ketonaemia (ketonuria) and acidaemia. 1 DKA is caused by a decrease in effective circulating insulin associated with elevations in counterregulatory hormones.

The likelihood of ketoacidosis occurring at the onset of diabetes varies considerably (between 15% and 67%) from one country to another. Studies have shown that in parts of the world where the prevalence of T1DM is low, symptoms of diabetes may be less familiar to medical practitioners, as a consequence more DKA occurs as the initial presentation of diabetes. The same is true where access to medical care is limited. Observational studies from African countries suggest that the frequency is high but the exact figures are scarce. However, the report of a few studies from Africa indicated that the frequency varied from 80% to 88%. The reason for DKA at onset of newly-diagnosed diabetes is multifactorial. The management of DKA, in itself, imposes a significant economic burden on the patient and his family, particularly in developing countries. DKA is the most frequent cause of diabetes-related death in children with the mortality rate ranging between 6% and 24% in developing countries.

Understanding factors associated with DKA has the potential of improving our knowledge of the disease, enhancing the development of patient, professional- and population-based interventions to reduce the proportion of children whose first presentation is DKA. The purpose of the present study was to determine the frequency of DKA at diagnosis of new cases of T1DM and to describe the clinical characteristics of ketoacidosis among these patients.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening metabolic complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Despite interventions to reduce the incidence of DKA, the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit for 2018/2019 showed that overall 20.9% of all newly diagnosed patients in the United Kingdom (UK) presented in DKA, although there is considerable regional variability.

DKA is characterised by uncontrolled hyperglycaemia, ketosis and subsequent metabolic acidosis. As highlighted in figure 1, the clinical picture can develop insidiously due to a variable constellation of non-specific systemic signs and symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, fatigue, vomiting and abdominal pain, ultimately leading to confusion, coma and death, if untreated. Due to the ambiguity of the presenting clinical features in the early stages, delays in diagnosis are common.

Globally, the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines are widely used for management of paediatric DKA. However, in the UK, it is guided by the integrated care pathways of either the British Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes (BSPED) or the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The BSPED guideline evolved from the NICE guideline in 2009 due to concerns over limited evidence that was used for its development. While there were a number of dual-serving board members, the input and additional evidence by the BSPED special interest group in DKA was thought to increase its safety. Both guidelines cover the diagnosis and management of type one and two diabetes in children and young people (CYP) aged under 18 years. Areas of particular benefit within a secondary care setting are centred on the requirements for fluid therapy, given the importance of resuscitation in preventing complications. Due to the difference in perceived risk of cerebral oedema (CO) due to rapid fluid administration, there was discordance between the NICE and BSPED 2015 guidelines.

### Factors associated with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of diabetes in children and young adults: a systematic review [^4864eaa1]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common endocrine diseases in children. Worldwide, an estimated 65 000 children under 15 years old develop the disease each year, and the global incidence in children continues to increase at a rate of 3% a year. The current incidence in the UK is around 26/100 000 per year.

Between 10% and 70% of these diagnosed children present in diabetic ketoacidosis, a metabolic derangement characterised by the triad of hyperglycaemia, acidosis, and ketonuria. The current criteria for diagnosis published by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes is blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, venous pH < 7.3 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L, and ketonaemia and ketonuria. It carries a substantial risk of life threatening complications such as cerebral oedema and is the commonest cause of diabetes related death in children. The longer term clinical course of type 1 diabetes also seems to be influenced by it: children with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis have poorer glycaemic control, less residual β cell function up to two years after diagnosis, and a lower frequency of remission.

It is unclear why some children present in diabetic ketoacidosis whereas others do not and whether the development of diabetic ketoacidosis is a consequence of delayed diagnosis and treatment or whether it reflects a particularly aggressive form of diabetes. Understanding which factors are associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis and the relative importance of delayed diagnosis and treatment is, therefore, important. This potentially informs both our understanding of the disease as well as the development of patient, professional, and population based interventions to reduce the proportion of children presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis. Several individual factors from individual studies have been quoted in guidelines and consensus statements. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of all factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults.

Implications for future research

While it seems intuitive that an earlier diagnosis of diabetes should lead to a decreased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, our review still leaves unanswered the major question of whether diabetic ketoacidosis is a consequence of delayed diagnosis and treatment or whether it reflects a more aggressive form of diabetes. Additionally, no studies addressed the reasons for delays in diagnosis or the relative contribution of individual, parental or physician factors. Further studies should explore the factors that influence help seeking behaviour among parents, and delineate the time course of clinical presentation of this disease. A better understanding of the patient pathway from symptom onset to diagnosis is needed to appropriately target interventions to decrease the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young adults.

### Factors associated with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of diabetes in children and young adults: a systematic review [^81c70478]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications for practising clinicians

This study has implications for clinicians in both primary and secondary care, as the vast majority of children who develop type 1 diabetes will have a consultation before diagnosis. Although type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed in primary care, a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires measurement of serum pH or bicarbonate and so typically requires referral to secondary care. Furthermore, many children present directly to hospital emergency or paediatric departments. As with other serious illnesses in children, differentiating the occasional child with a serious illness from the large number with minor undifferentiated illness is challenging. The relatively easy access to point of care tests for hyperglycaemia, ketonaemia, and glycosuria, however, means that diagnosis does not require access to specialist diagnostic services (such as imaging for suspected malignancy) but, instead, a high index of suspicion. Our findings suggest that clinicians should be particularly alert for diabetic ketoacidosis in children under 5 years old, those from ethnic minority groups, and those from families with low education level or socioeconomic status.

We found clear evidence that at least some children with diabetic ketoacidosis experienced diagnostic or treatment delays. Children presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis had symptoms for a mean of two weeks, up to a third had at least one medical consultation in the week before diagnosis, and misdiagnosis was associated with a threefold increase in diabetic ketoacidosis. However, the influence of delays at the physician level on risk of diabetic ketoacidosis was not consistent across studies, and we did not identify reasons for the diagnostic errors. High rates of misdiagnosis have also been found in children presenting with type 1 diabetes without diabetic ketoacidosis, with up to 86% of children not diagnosed at first encounter. In these studies, common diagnostic errors included misinterpreting symptoms (such as polyuria misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection), exclusively focusing on one or more symptoms (such as oral candidiasis), and not performing appropriate investigations (such as blood glucose or urine tests). Clinicians should therefore be aware of these difficulties in diagnosis and be particularly alert for diabetic ketoacidosis in those children at higher risk. Improving awareness among parents and clinicians about the early symptoms of diabetes through diabetes education programmes — such as the community intervention in Italy, which reduced the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis from 78% to 12.5% — could also decrease the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis.

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^83728cad]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of carbohydrate metabolism resulting in hyperglycaemia and is classified into clinical categories, or types, based on pathophysiology. Type 1 diabetes has traditionally been characterized by the clinical presentation of insulin‐dependent diabetes in childhood or adolescence, although it can present at any age. Individuals with type 1 diabetes typically have classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia upon initial presentation. These symptoms are often accompanied by ketosis and, particularly in paediatric cases, diabetic ketoacidosis. Most of these cases of type 1 diabetes represent a near‐absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmune‐mediated destruction of pancreatic β‐cells. However, type 1 diabetes also encompasses individuals with a less aggressive autoimmune attack who initially retain some β‐cell function, and individuals who have absolute insulin deficiency but no clinical evidence of autoimmunity (termed idiopathic type 1 diabetes). This classic phenotypic presentation has often been relied on for diagnosing and classifying type 1 diabetes. However, increasing insights into the variability of factors that influence susceptibility, progression, pathogenesis, and phenotypic characteristics of type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease, suggesting the need to reconsider the traditional clinical classification of this condition. This need is further highlighted by increasing efforts to develop practical screening methods to diagnose type 1 diabetes at pre‐symptomatic stages due to the recent approval of teplizumab treatment to delay the onset of symptomatic type 1 diabetes in these individuals.

### Preventing diabetic ketoacidosis [^065478df]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This article examines the factors associated with DKA in children with T1DM, both at first presentation and in recurrent cases. The challenge for future research is to find effective ways to improve primary care physician and general community awareness of T1DM to reduce DKA at presentation and develop practical, cost-effective programs to reduce recurrent DKA.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^1c4044c1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Characterisation of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a regional hospital study [^5a180bce]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

"Diabetes mellitus" is a complex metabolic disorder characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia due to defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The absence of insulin production or secretion is typically referred to as type 1 diabetes (T1D). The global incidence of T1D is reported to be 15 per 100,000 individuals, with predictive modelling indicating a rapid increase in these estimates over the next two decades. In 2016, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reported an annual incidence of type 1 diabetes of 10–13 cases per 100,000 people in Australia, which aligns with the worldwide incidence figures. While the incidence rates of T1D in Australia have remained stable between 2020 and 2021, notably, the highest rates are observed in inner regional areas.

Children with T1D typically present with weight loss, polydipsia and polyuria. They may also present in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at onset, a life-threatening manifestation of insulin deficiency with features of hyperglycaemia, acidosis and ketones in blood and urine. In countries with a high incidence of T1D, greater familiarity among medical practitioners with the condition results in a lower occurrence of DKA at the time of diagnosis. Routine childhood illnesses and missed insulin doses also result in DKA among patients known to have T1D. DKA is usually managed with fluids and insulin infusion with frequent monitoring of acid‒base and electrolytes. Cerebral oedema, a rare complication, primarily occurs in the early phase of DKA management and affects approximately 0.5% of cases. This complication can lead to neurological consequences and has a mortality rate as high as 40%. Delayed diagnosis is identified as a major risk factor associated with mortality. Therefore, prevention and timely identification of DKA and its appropriate management are crucial. However, this process is labour-intensive and can be particularly challenging in regional settings where human and infrastructural resources are often limited.

### Differentiating diabetes type in children and adolescents with ketosis or ketoacidosis at onset: a retrospective analysis of clinical and biochemical markers [^37f16814]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in childhood. According to the latest estimates, more than 1.2 million children and adolescents worldwide are living with diabetes, and the number of newly diagnosed cases each year is around 180,000. As guidelines recommended, the classification of diabetes in children and adolescents at diagnosis is typically based on their characteristics at presentation and genetic testing for the specific types. However, the increasing overlap in clinical features between type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has made accurate diagnosis challenging.

Diabetic ketosis (DK) and ketoacidosis (DKA) occur commonly at the onset of diabetes and have traditionally been regarded as hallmark features of T1DM, particularly among children and adolescents, with reported DKA frequencies ranging from 15 ~ 70%. However, recent studies indicate that obese adolescents presenting with clinical features suggestive of T2DM may also develop DK/DKA, with prevalence rates of 5%–25%. Notably, some individuals with diabetes experience near-normoglycemic remission, which can persist for months to years. This clinical presentation of diabetes, also referred to as type 1B or atypical diabetes, is now widely accepted as ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes. It has also been well described among Black populations and is increasingly recognized in other high-risk groups, including Chinese, Japanese, and Hispanic individuals.

### Diabetic ketosis vs ketoacidosis as initial presentation of pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus. associated features and rate of progression during the first two years after diagnosis [^7d524f5c]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Aims

In this study we described the clinical and laboratory features of children presented with diabetic ketosis or diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and evaluated its course up to 2 years after initial diagnosis to investigate the progression rate of T1DM in both groups.

Methods

This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study that included 59 children and adolescents presented with either diabetic ketosis (DK) (n = 27) or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (n = 32) at their first diagnosis with T1DM.

Results

Apart from the metabolic state of presentation at diagnosis, differences in the other basic clinical and laboratory features of both DK and DKA were not statistically significant (age, BMI, pre- diagnosis symptomatic period, HbA1c, multiplicity of autoantibodies positivity, fasting insulin, and total IgG levels), except from the C-peptide and IgA levels which were lower in DKA (p < 0.05). Regarding family history, only the DK group had individuals with a parent diagnosed with T1DM (p = 0.001). During follow-up there was no difference in the levels of HbA1c, basal insulin dose, and insulin/carbohydrate ratio between the DK and DKA group at 3,6,12 and 24 months' time points.

Conclusions

The severity of presentation of T1DM (DK or DKA) is not associated to the rate of progression of the disease course after diagnosis.

### Factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at onset of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents [^381077b9]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To identify risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents.

Methods

In three time periods (1986–1987, 1996–1997 and 2006–2007) 75, 86 and 245 patients, respectively, aged < 20 years were newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in one tertiary care centre. In this retrospective comparative study, data of clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation at diagnosis, as well as demographic data were retrieved from the patients' files. Comparative analyses were performed between patients presenting with or without diabetic ketoacidosis and between the three time periods.

Results

Patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis were younger (9.2 ± 4.7 vs. 10.4 ± 4.7 years; P < 0.02), thinner (weight standard deviation score -0.59 ± 1.2 vs. -0.25 ± 1.1; P = 0.002) and less frequently had a first- and/or second-degree relative with Type 1 diabetes compared with those without diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation (16.0 vs. 31.2%, respectively; P = 0.001). Children with diabetic ketoacidosis were less likely to have had relevant testing before diagnosis than children without diabetic ketoacidosis. Children aged < 2 years presented more often with diabetic ketoacidosis than the older children (85 vs. 32%; P < 0.001). Children of Ethiopian origin had a higher rate of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis than the rest of the cohort (57.8 vs. 33%; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Factors affecting the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes may be related to the degree of awareness of symptoms of diabetes among parents and primary care physicians. Prevention programmes should aim at increasing awareness and consider the application of special measures to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis in children aged < 2 years and high-risk ethnic groups.

Discussion

Principal findings

This systematic review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young adults presenting with new onset of type 1 diabetes. We found that younger children, those from ethnic minority groups, without medical insurance (in the US), and with a lower body mass index were at highest risk. Having a preceding infection and being exposed to diagnostic error or delayed treatment were also associated with an increased risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis. In contrast, we found that children with a first degree relative with type 1 diabetes, with parents with higher levels of education, or who lived in an area with a higher background incidence of type 1 diabetes seemed less likely to present in diabetic ketoacidosis (see fig 2).

Strengths and limitations

Our rigorous and systematic search encompassed multiple databases and languages, and identified data on more than 24 000 children from 31 countries. Although this strengthens the generalisability of our findings, it also contributed to considerable heterogeneity in terms of design, setting, and predictors included. Despite using appropriate meta-analytic techniques with random effect models, we were unable to control fully for these differences. The studies also varied in quality, and only 18 formally assessed case ascertainment. Many were also retrospective and may have been subject to recording and recall bias. Most of the studies did not provide quantitative data for negative findings, but merely stated that no differences were observed, implying some degree of reporting bias. Although we cannot exclude publication bias, we expect this to be minimal because of the exploratory nature of the question.

Included studies also used a wide range of definitions of diabetic ketoacidosis, reflecting different international settings and periods of study. Only oneused the current diagnostic criteria for diabetic ketoacidosis published by the International Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Diabetes. However, our inclusion criteria incorporated a measurement of pH (pH ≤ 7.2 to < 7.36) or bicarbonate (< 15 to ≤ 21 mmol/L) and so consistently identified those with worse metabolic derangements. Although the absolute frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis may vary with different definitions, it is unlikely that this would substantially alter our overall conclusions. Finally, because of the format of the data, it was not possible to assess the independent contribution of each of the predictors we identified, but we include results of multivariate analyses where reported.

### Clinical and biochemical profile of 786 sequential episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus [^53e94913]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of diabetes which requires rapid assessment and treatment. It is characterized by the triad of hyperglycemia, acidemia and ketosis and results from insulin deficiency. Treatment involves correction of hyperglycemia and hypovolemia and replacement of electrolytes. The incidence of DKA ranges from 4.6 to 8 episodes per 1000 people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. While mortality associated with DKA appears to have significantly decreased over the last 20 years (from 7.96% to 0.67%), DKA still represents a considerable risk in adults, adolescents and young children.

Diabetes is usually classified into type 1 and type 2 diabetes and most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes (90%–95%). It is traditionally accepted that DKA is characteristic of type 1 diabetes. In fact, it has previously been considered that DKA is indicative, or diagnostic, of type 1 diabetes. However, it is also recognized that those with type 2 diabetes can also develop DKA; a retrospective cohort study recently estimated that the incidence of DKA in type 2 diabetes has increased by 4.24% annually between 1992 and 2013. Unfortunately, data reporting on DKA in people with type 2 diabetes are sparse and guidelines for managing DKA in people with type 2 diabetes are based on those for type 1 diabetes.

Newton and Raskinstudied the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 176 episodes of DKA in people with type 1 diabetes compared with 20 with type 2 diabetes. They found a greater proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes experiencing DKA were Latino-American or African-American and required a longer period of treatment to achieve ketone-free urine. Balasubramanyam et al also compared 141 people with type 1 diabetes and 55 people with type 2 diabetes presenting with DKA and identified differences in ethnicities, body mass index and age of onset at presentation. These studies are small and there are currently no published studies comparing DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the UK.

This descriptive study aimed to compare the demographics and clinical course of DKA in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We also explored the hypothesis on whether DKA treatment algorithm is as effective in people with type 2 diabetes as in those with type 1 diabetes.

Duration of symptoms

Four studies compared the duration of symptoms in children presenting with and without diabetic ketoacidosis. Although the mean duration of symptoms was similar in both groups, it was slightly shorter in those with diabetic ketoacidosis (16.5 (SE 6.2) days and 17.1 (6.0) days respectively, P < 0.001). Two other studies found that children with diabetic ketoacidosis had a shorter duration of symptoms (P < 0.005), but the percentage of children with symptoms for less than two weeks did not differ between the groups (24.8% (108/436) and 24.2% (145/601) for those with and without diabetic ketoacidosis respectively, P = 0.80). After adjustment for age, sex, family history of type 1 diabetes, and whether children were diagnosed in primary or secondary care, the duration of classic symptoms (enuresis or nocturia, polyuria, polydipsia, change in appetite, weight loss, candidiasis, and fatigue) also did not predict a diagnosis of new onset diabetes before progression to diabetic ketoacidosis.

Pattern and frequency of symptoms

The six studies which compared symptom pattern and frequency between children with and without diabetic ketoacidosis showed inconsistent findings. One found no difference in the frequency of any of the typical symptoms of diabetes (enuresis or nocturia, polyuria, or polydipsia), whereas children with diabetic ketoacidosis presented more often with vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnoea, weakness, anorexia, and changes in mental status. Two studies also showed that children with diabetic ketoacidosis had significantly greater weight loss than those without (4.84% (SD 3.87%) of body weight v 3.32% (3.53%), P < 0.0001; and 3.35 (SD 2.07) kg v 1.45 (1.85) kg, P < 0.005), while a third study showed no difference (P = 0.296).

### The pathophysiology, presentation and classification of type 1 diabetes [^8b94c77a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite this complexity, certain characteristics in presentation and clinical tools can be utilized for the classification and phenotypic characterization of individual patients, guiding clinical decision‐making (see Table 2). Although both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can present at any age, the age of onset and initial presentation often help in classifying type 1 diabetes. Most individuals with type 1 diabetes present with symptoms of hyperglycaemia, but younger patients present more commonly with diabetic ketoacidosis. At initial diagnosis, 25%–50% of children present in diabetic ketoacidosis, as opposed to 6%–21% of adults. Though use of GRS has not yet been incorporated into standard clinical practice, measuring serum levels of islet autoantibodies and confirming low C‐peptide levels can also aid in classifying type 1 diabetes. Some of these classic phenotypic features, including age, body mass index, and race, have even been shown to predict autoantibody positivity in individuals with type 1 diabetes upon presentation. Current recommendations for classification in adults acknowledge the importance of incorporating multiple tools in patients who are autoantibody negative, including clinical features, C‐peptide testing, and, in some cases, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes.

Variability in the intensity and timing of autoimmune β‐cell destruction is a significant source of heterogeneity in type 1 diabetes. Many individuals experience a brief period of partial remission, known as the honeymoon period, after initiating insulin therapy. However, disease in younger children appears to be commonly associated with a higher number of autoantibodies, fewer insulin‐containing islets, and lower serum C‐peptide concentrations. These individuals also tend to have high‐risk HLA haplotypes. While a more intense autoimmune attack is often associated with a younger age at diagnosis, it is unclear whether increased susceptibility of the developing islets and β‐cells may also contribute to earlier decline in functional β‐cell mass. In contrast, adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes often have a slower time course of autoimmune β‐cell destruction, leading to older age at onset of symptoms. Some of these adults with classic presenting symptoms and absolute insulin deficiency do not have autoantibodies on diagnosis and are referred to as having idiopathic type 1 diabetes. Although it is presumed that their pathology is due to autoimmunity, with potential negative seroconversion, it is unclear whether some of these cases represent alternative β‐cell pathology. However, to distinguish these individuals from those with monogenic diabetes, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes can be considered in paediatric or adult individuals who are antibody negative and have a milder clinical course, with lower insulin requirements and without ketosis.

### Update and harmonisation of guidance for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and young people in the UK [^15cc918c]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Careful and timely intervention is required to optimise glycaemic control and reduce the risk of mortality and devastating complications. Of these, cerebral oedema is the leading cause of death, with a mortality rate of approximately 25%. This article highlights the recent updates to UK fluid therapy guidelines for DKA and provides clinical context for the benefit of paediatricians and junior doctors in light of this new guidance.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^34c57fa9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Identifying targets to reduce the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in the UK [^46950441]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the leading cause of mortality in childhood diabetes, and at diagnosis might represent delayed presentation. The extent and reasons for delays are unclear, but identifying and targeting factors associated with DKA could reduce this incidence.

Objective

To compare the patient pathway before diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children presenting with DKA and non-acidotic hyperglycaemia.

Design, Setting and Patients

Over a 3-month period, children newly diagnosed with T1DM were identified on admission to UK hospitals. Parents and medical teams completed a questionnaire about events before diagnosis.

Results

Data were available for 261 children (54% male), median age 10.3y (range 0.8–16.6 y). 25% presented with DKA, but more commonly in children < 2y (80% vs 23%, p < 0.001). Fewer children with DKA reported polyuria (76% vs 86%) or polydipsia (86% vs 94%) (both p < 0.05), but more reported fatigue (74% vs 52%) and weight loss (75% vs 54%) (both p < 0.01). 24% of children had multiple healthcare professional (HCP) contacts, and these children had lower pH on admission. 46% of children with a delayed presentation to secondary care had non-urgent investigations. 64% of parents had considered a diagnosis of diabetes, and these children were less likely to present with DKA (13% vs 47%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Multiple HCP contacts increased risk of presentation in DKA, whereas, parental awareness of diabetes was protective. Improved public and health professional education targeting non-classical symptoms, awareness of diabetes in under 2 y, and point-of-care testing could reduce DKA at diagnosis of diabetes.

### Emergency department presentations of diabetic ketoacidosis in a large cohort of children [^0d1771fb]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

The high frequency of DKA in children with type 1 diabetes in the United States is of concern, particularly in light of accumulating evidence that DKA episodes may increase risk of long-term complications including increased risk of diabetic kidney disease and alterations in cognition. Studies demonstrate that nations with a higher background prevalence of type 1 diabetes tend to have lower rates of DKA at diagnosis, suggesting that increased awareness of DKA may reduce its incidence. Campaigns to increase diabetes awareness may reduce the frequency of DKA at the time of diabetes diagnosis. One particularly successful effort in Italy was able to reduce rates of DKA in people with diabetes from 78% to 13% by placing educational materials in primary care clinics and schools. Targeted monitoring of children at heightened risk for type 1 diabetes (children with first degree relatives with type 1 diabetes, positive pancreatic autoantibodies, or high-risk HLA profiles) have also been highly successful in preventing DKA at the time of diabetes diagnosis in these groups.

### Ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: frequency and clinical characteristics [^2468d8ba]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening acute complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Although the frequency of DKA as first manifestation of T1DM is higher in developing compared developed countries, there is paucity of information on its characteristics in developing countries.

Methods

This retrospective study determined the frequency of ketoacidosis at diagnosis of new-onset type 1 diabetes and described the clinical characteristics of the patients seen between 1996 and 2011 by auditing the hospital records of all cases. The diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was based on the presence of hyperglycaemia (blood glucose > 11 mmol/L), acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L) and ketonuria (urine ketone ≥ 1+).

Results

At diagnosis of new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus, three-quarter (77.1%) of the children and adolescents presented with DKA. Comparing the frequency of DKA during the initial 8 years (1996–2003) with the later 8 years (2004–2011), it was 81.8% vs 73.1%; p > 005. The frequency has not shown any significant declined over a 16-year period. The frequency of re-admission in ketoacidosis was 24.3%.

Conclusion

Three-quarter of children and adolescents present with DKA as first manifestation of T1DM with no significant decline in frequency over a 16-year period in our hospital.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in children with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus: demographics, risk factors and outcome: an 11 year review in Hong Kong [^3bb28153]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The aim of this study is to analyze the incidence, clinical characteristics, management and outcome of children presenting with DKA in new-onset T1D from 2008 to 2018 in Hong Kong.

Methods

Data was extracted from the Hong Kong Childhood Diabetes Registry. All subjects less than 18 years with newly diagnosed T1D from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018 managed in the public hospitals were included. Information on demographics, laboratory parameters, DKA-related complications and management were analyzed.

Results

In the study period, there were 556 children with newly diagnosed T1D in our registry and 43.3% presented with DKA. The crude incidence rate of new-onset T1D with DKA was 1.79 per 100,000 persons/year (CI: 1.56–2.04). Subjects presenting with DKA were younger (9.5 ± 4.5 vs. 10.5 ± 4.4, p = 0.01) and had shorter duration of symptoms (4.2 ± 5.9 days vs. 10.6 ± 17.1 days, p < 0.01). Regarding management, up to 12.4% were given insulin boluses and 82.6% were started on insulin infusion 1 h after fluid resuscitation. The rate of cerebral edema was 0.8% and there was no mortality.

Conclusions

Younger age and shorter duration of symptoms were associated with DKA in new-onset T1D. Despite availability of international guidelines, there was inconsistency in acute DKA management. These call for a need to raise public awareness on childhood diabetes as well as standardization of practice in management of pediatric DKA in Hong Kong.

### Factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at onset of type 1 diabetes among pediatric patients: a systematic review [^c9db9b84]. JAMA Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) remains a risk. Following a 2011 systematic review, considerable additional articles have been published, and the review required updating.

Objective

To evaluate factors associated with DKA at the onset of T1D among pediatric patients.

Evidence Review

In this systematic review, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, and article reference lists were searched using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome search strategy for primary research studies on DKA and T1D onset among individuals younger than 18 years that were published from January 2011 to November 2021. These studies were combined with a 2011 systematic review on the same topic. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Findings

A total of 2565 articles were identified; 149 were included, along with 46 from the previous review (total 195 articles). Thirty-eight factors were identified and examined for their association with DKA at T1D onset. Factors associated with increased risk of DKA were younger age at T1D onset (< 2 years vs ≥ 2 years; odds ratio [OR], 3.51; 95% CI, 2.85–4.32; P < .001), belonging to an ethnic minority population (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21–0.74; P = 0.004), and family history of T1D (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37–0.57; P < .001), consistent with the 2011 systematic review. Some factors that were not associated with DKA in the 2011 systematic review were associated with DKA in the present review (eg, delayed diagnosis: OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.72–3.01; P < .001). Additional factors associated with risk of DKA among patients with new-onset T1D included participation in screening programs (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21–0.59; P < .001) and presentation during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.76–3.06; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, age younger than 2 years at T1D onset, belonging to an ethnic minority population, delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with increased risk of DKA. Factors associated with decreased risk of DKA included greater knowledge of key signs or symptoms of DKA, such as a family history of T1D or participation in screening programs. Future work should focus on identifying and implementing strategies related to these factors to reduce risk of DKA among new patients with T1D.

The findings presented in our study are crucial for understanding evolving patterns in disease presentation, particularly the increasing prevalence of severe DKA in recent years.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^5e71aaf5]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Although diabetic ketoacidosis should, theoretically, be largely preventable in patients with established diabetes, a recent report from a major US childhood diabetes center showed that children with type 1 diabetes remain at high risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, with an incidence of 8 per 100 patient-years. Children who are uninsured or underinsured, have psychiatric disorders, have poorly controlled diabetes, and live in dysfunctional families are most vulnerable. The efficacy and cost effectiveness of strategies to reduce the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis-before diagnosis and in patients with established diabetes-are important issues for future investigation.

### Clinical features, biomarkers and diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes among children and adolescents in sana' a, Yemen [^c44a9159]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the most common form of diabetes in children and adolescents. It is characterised by destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to partial or absolute insulin deficiency and presentation with symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia, and frequently, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at disease onset. Early diagnosis of new-onset T1D in children and adolescents is vital to avoid DKA, which can increase the risk of mortality and long-term morbidity. Delay in diagnosis occurs if the patient was misdiagnosed on the first primary care visit and was first diagnosed at a secondary-care level. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended in 2015 that children with suspected T1D and DKA should be offered immediate (same day) referral to a hospital with acute paediatric facilities to confirm diagnosis and to provide immediate care.

Various subtypes of T1D have been suggested by some epidemiological studies. However, only two main subtypes, autoimmune and idiopathic, have been categorised by the current American Diabetes Associationand International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD)classification schemes. Most children and adolescents with T1D have autoimmune T1D resulting from immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells with both a genetic predisposition and autoantibodies. The minority have idiopathic T1D with no known aetiology, but with permanent insulin deficiency. As family history of T1D can increase the risk, patients with onset of T1D before the age of 20 years have been also subclassified into those who have at least one first-degree relative with T1D (familial diabetes), and those who have no background of first-degree relative with T1D (sporadic diabetes).

This study was conducted in a cohort of children and adolescents with new-onset T1D in Sana'a, Yemen. The aim was to determine the clinical and biochemical features of these individuals, assess their autoantibody status, evaluate the frequency and impact of a family history of T1D, understand the pattern of presenting symptoms, and to identify the occurrence and risk factors associated with DKA at the time of diagnosis.

DKA is a life-threatening condition with possible high mortality and well-documented negative impact on long-term disease management. Our study not only showed a rise in DKA prevalence, but more importantly, an increase in the number of cases presenting with severe DKA at the time of childhood T1D diagnosis. This substantial increase in severe DKA prevalence over time emphasizes a concerning trend, suggesting that a larger proportion of children are being diagnosed at a more critical stage of metabolic decompensation. This may indicate delays in diagnosis and treatment, potentially due to factors such as late symptom recognition or reduced access to timely medical care. Even in older children, where symptom recognition might be expected to be more straightforward, in this study, the delay in diagnosis persists, resulting in more severe DKA at presentation. Therefore, some initiatives aiming to reduce DKA prevalence at the disease onset seem to be reasonable options for early T1D recognition. Some countries have already implemented public educational campaigns, achieving excellent results by reducing the prevalence of DKA at disease onset. Recently, Cherubini et al. delivered evidence of the effectiveness of social campaigns in increasing awareness about DKA in children by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. The analysis included 14 studies focused on community-based interventions in children below 18 years, and the authors measured only the prevalence of DKA as an outcome. In this systematic review, the pooled difference was a reduction of 7.2% (95% CI: 0.99–13.41). However, educational campaigns should not only be addressed to society but also to healthcare professionals, especially pediatricians, primary care clinicians, and nurses. Greater awareness and skills in identifying T1D symptoms might help reduce the prevalence of DKA at the first presentation of the disease. An example of such a program was a multi-intervention project implemented in a Canadian province. The aim of this project was to reduce the prevalence of DKA in children and young adults and was directed to the groups mentioned above. During the 6-year period of the project, a decrease in the hospitalization rate due to DKA was observed in pediatric patients in the province. Interestingly, the hospitalization rate after the project period returned to a value similar to that applicable before the project, which shows the effectiveness of the campaign, although, at the same time, routine actions are necessary to maintain a constant reduction in hospitalization rate due to DKA. Another study was performed in the UK, and it also emphasized the significance of detecting and targeting factors related to DKA development at T1D onset. In this study, parents of newly diagnosed children and medical teams involved in the diagnostic process were asked to complete a questionnaire about events before diagnosis. The reported results showed that a greater parental awareness of typical T1D symptoms (polyuria and/or polydipsia) was associated with timely T1D diagnosis and DKA reduction. Moreover, this study demonstrated that health professional education targeting nonclassical symptoms, particularly among those below 2 years of age, and point-of-care testing benefited in decreasing the prevalence of DKA at diagnosis. Similar effects have been observed in other countries, such as France, Turkey, and Germany, where campaigns aimed at health professionals and parents helped to improve the early recognition of T1D. One of the most extensive programs was the Parma campaign conducted in Italy. The project involved educational intervention for doctors, teachers, and parents. Over the 8 years of this initiative, a significant reduction in DKA prevalence at T1D diagnosis was observed; the cumulative prevalence of DKA decreased from 78% to 12.5%, and, more importantly, its long-term effects remained several years after it was promoted.

### Reduced prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in young children participating in longitudinal follow-up [^6850b52f]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide, with the greatest increase in children aged < 5 years. Perhaps most alarming is that the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children aged < 5 years is frequently associated with concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Depending on the specific population studied and the definition of DKA used, the reported prevalence of DKA in children under 5 years of age at diagnosis varies between 17.3 and 54.5% (,–) (Table 1). When even younger subsets of newly diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes were evaluated, DKA prevalence has been reported to be as high as 39.7% in children aged < 3 years and as high as 60% in children aged < 2 years at diagnosis.

Table 1
Literature review of DKA at diagnosis in children under age 5 years

Prevention of DKA would eliminate the potential morbidity and mortality associated with cerebral edema at diagnosis and may provide considerable cost savings by reducing days of hospitalization and use of intensive care units. Previous studies of autoantibody-positive children have demonstrated fewer episodes of DKA, reduced morbidity, and improved clinical care in children diagnosed through prospective screening and follow-up. In addition, the diagnosis of children at an earlier stage of the disease (i.e. without metabolic decompensation associated with DKA) may afford children the preservation of remaining β-cell function, the opportunity to participate in intervention trials, and the possibility of fewer long-term complications.

Several ongoing studies are following children at high genetic risk of type 1 diabetes from birth. Some of these studies provide risk information to subjects whereas some do not initially inform parents about their child's type 1 diabetes risk. Intensive follow-up of children with genetic risk of type 1 diabetes in prospective studies, which includes ongoing provision of updated risk information, may increase awareness of symptoms and enable early diagnosis of diabetes and prevention of DKA. Additionally, routine assessments of HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose, and oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in children with confirmed autoantibodies may allow diagnosis of type 1 diabetes prior to recognition of symptoms.

### Factors associated with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of diabetes in children and young adults: a systematic review [^07e29371]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Delayed diagnosis

Four studies explored the impact of delayed diagnosis (delay > 24 hours for any reason) on the development of diabetic ketoacidosis. All reported that a significant proportion (16–51%) of children experienced a delay, but it was not possible to combine data because of different definitions of end points used. Delay of more than 24 hours between initial presentation to a primary or secondary care provider and referral to a multidisciplinary diabetes team in the UK was associated with an increased risk of presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (52.3% v 20.5%, P < 0.05, odds ratio 4.26 (1.54 to 11.79)). A similar increase in risk occurred in children who were not diagnosed on the day of admission to a US children's hospital (59% (17/29) v 33% (35/105), P = 0.0178, odds ratio 2.83 (1.22 to 6.58)). In contrast, two European studies found no effect when there was a delay between the first medical consultation and hospitalisation (odds ratio 0.79 (0.31 to 2.00))or delay of more than 24 hours between the first visit and diagnosis (odds ratio 0.98 (0.73 to 1.31)).

Diagnostic error

Four studies in the US, France, and Poland looked specifically at the outcome of children in whom the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was not made at the first medical consultation because of diagnostic error, judged to have occurred when children were not diagnosed on their first visit, either because they were given a misdiagnosis or signs and symptoms were missed or not recognised. Such children had a threefold increased risk of presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis (combined odds ratio 3.35 (2.35 to 4.79), P < 0.001, I² = 0%) (fig 5). This risk was independent of the presence or absence of infection preceding diagnosis, but diagnostic error was significantly more likely to occur in younger children: the mean age of children who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis was 5.4 (standard error 4.4) years when the diagnosis was missed compared with 8.8 (4.0) years when the diagnosis was not missed (P < 0.001).

### Significant reduction of ketoacidosis at diabetes onset in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes-the stuttgart diabetes awareness campaign, Germany [^f75519a8]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To prevent the potentially life-threatening complication, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at type 1 diabetes onset in children and adolescents, awareness campaigns can lead to a significant reduction of DKA. As in Germany, the incidence of DKA at diabetes onset had remained at a constant rate over the last 15years and increasing numbers of very young children present with higher risk for DKA we decided to set up the Stuttgart Ketoacidosis Awareness Campaign.

Methods

Over 3years (2015–2017) the campaign was conducted using information flyers and posters illustrating the typical symptoms of diabetes at school entry health examinations at the Public Health Department, in day-care facilities, in all pediatric practices and by regular public activities. The period between 2011 and 2013 was selected as a reference period.

Results

Approximately 17000 children, median age 4.5years, and their families were informed about the campaign during the preschool health examination. A total of 118 children and adolescents were treated with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes compared with 127 during the reference period. During the campaign the incidence of DKA decreased significantly from 28% to 16%.

Conclusions

Awareness campaigns like the Stuttgart Ketoacidosis Awareness Campaign about the typical clinical symptoms of type 1 diabetes can significantly reduce the risk for DKA at diabetes onset. Important factors for the success of our campaign were the close cooperation between the children's hospital and the public health department, the targeted approach of families, teachers, and pediatricians and the duration of the campaign over 3years.

### Differentiating diabetes type in children and adolescents with ketosis or ketoacidosis at onset: a retrospective analysis of clinical and biochemical markers [^88647bb0]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Accurate diabetes classification is essential for guiding treatment decisions, and thus, it is critical for clinicians to differentiate between the types of diabetes as early as possible. Although C-peptide, body mass index (BMI), and onset age had been proven to be effective diagnostic indicators for diabetes classification at newly diagnosis of diabetes onset with DK/DKA among adults, or among mixed cohorts of adults with the small proportion of youth included. However, it is important to note that the evidence in adults cannot be simply applied to children and adolescents since there are significant differences between adult-onset and pediatric diabetes, including pathophysiology, development, and treatment response. Furthermore, evidence regarding pediatric populations, particularly Asian children, remains limited. Current literature provides only partial insights into differentiating diabetes subtypes in children and adolescents presenting with new-onset DK/DKA, lacking specific data for Asian populations and well-defined, ethnicity-specific diagnostic criteria. To address this gap, we retrospectively collected and analyzed clinical data from Chinese children and adolescents with new-onset DK/DKA over a two-year follow-up period. This study aimed to determine optimal diagnostic cut-off values for key discriminators, providing a quantitative framework for precise diabetes classification in this population.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes between initially diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis [^690f1743]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common noncommunicable diseases worldwide. According to global data in 2021, 537 million adults had diabetes. A previous study in Thailand reported an increase in the prevalence of diabetes over the 10-year period from 7.1 to 8.9% in men and 8.3–10.8% in women (2004–2014). Many diabetic patients are asymptomatic or have mild hyperglycemic symptoms. However, some patients can present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the first manifestation. According to the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of diabetes mellitus, there are six types of diabetes that are classified by pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, laboratory investigations, and long-term management. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas, causing an insulinopenic state in most patients. At diagnosis, between 70 and 90% of children with T1DM have evidence of an immune-mediated process with islet-cell autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD), islet antigen 2 (IA2), or insulin autoantibodies (IAA). T1DM patients usually have a normal or low body mass index (BMI). According to data from the DIAMOND project initiated by the WHO in 1990, the highest incidence of T1DM was among children 10–14 years old. However, in a recent study of 2,844 Thai diabetic patients diagnosed before the age of 30 years, the proportion of type 1 diabetes was only 68.05%, 56.97%, 41.96%, and 27.75% among patients with ages of onset from 10 to < 15, 15 to < 20, 20 to < 25, and 25 to < 30 years, respectively. All patients with T1DM need lifelong insulin therapy.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^d9a7e836]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is characterized by a serum glucose level greater than 250 mg per dL, a pH less than 7.3, a serum bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq per L, an elevated serum ketone level, and dehydration. Insulin deficiency is the main precipitating factor. Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur in persons of all ages, with 14 percent of cases occurring in persons older than 70 years, 23 percent in persons 51 to 70 years of age, 27 percent in persons 30 to 50 years of age, and 36 percent in persons younger than 30 years. The case fatality rate is 1 to 5 percent. About one-third of all cases are in persons without a history of diabetes mellitus. Common symptoms include polyuria with polydipsia (98 percent), weight loss (81 percent), fatigue (62 percent), dyspnea (57 percent), vomiting (46 percent), preceding febrile illness (40 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), and polyphagia (23 percent). Measurement of A1C, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum glucose, electrolytes, pH, and serum ketones; complete blood count; urinalysis; electrocardiography; and calculation of anion gap and osmolar gap can differentiate diabetic ketoacidosis from hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, gastroenteritis, starvation ketosis, and other metabolic syndromes, and can assist in diagnosing comorbid conditions. Appropriate treatment includes administering intravenous fluids and insulin, and monitoring glucose and electrolyte levels. Cerebral edema is a rare but severe complication that occurs predominantly in children. Physicians should recognize the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis for prompt diagnosis, and identify early symptoms to prevent it. Patient education should include information on how to adjust insulin during times of illness and how to monitor glucose and ketone levels, as well as information on the importance of medication compliance.

### Ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: frequency and clinical characteristics [^e0c468d1]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Among a total of 48 patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who were hospitalized during the 16-year period under review, 37(77.1%), 95% Confidence Interval, CI = 76.2–78.0, presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at first diagnosis of diabetes. Of these 37, 15(40.5%) were males while 22(59.5%) were females, giving a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.5. Comparing the frequency of DKA among newly diagnosed diabetes during the initial 8 years (1996–2003) with during the later 8 years (2004–2011), it was 81.8% (18/22) vs 73.1% (19/26), representing a decline of 8.7%; Z-statistic = 0.727 p > 0.05. The mean age at presentation in relation to gender was for boys 11.4 ± 3.9 years, 95% CI = 9.4–13.4 and for girls 13.2 ± 1.8 years, 95% CI = 12.4–14.0; t = 1.671 p > 0.05. When both sexes were combined, the mean age at presentation was 12.7 ± 2.6 years, 95% CI = 11.9–13.5. The age and gender distribution of patients with DKA are displayed in Table 1.

### Clinical characteristics and predictors of severe ketoacidosis at onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children in a north rhine-westphalian region, Germany [^940e339b]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most serious complication at the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). In Germany, population-based data on its occurrence at DM onset are not yet available. In a population-based study in a North Rhine-Westphalian region, Germany, during 1993–95, data on the clinical presentation at type 1 DM onset were obtained from hospital records for 262 patients under 15 years of age (81% of eligible patients). Information on social status was obtained from 148 families by a standardized questionnaire. The most frequently reported symptoms were polyuria (93.9%), fatigue (64.2%) and weight loss (59.4%). Mean duration of symptoms was 3.5 weeks. At diagnosis 18.3% of the children presented impaired consciousness and 3.5% coma. Mean glucose level was 25.1 mmol/l. Severe ketoacidosis (pH ≤ 7.2) was present in 16.0% of the children. Metabolic derangement was more severe in children under 5 years. Low social status was significantly associated with increased risk of severe ketoacidosis (OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.10–11.35). Frequency of ketoacidosis at DM onset needs to be reduced through increased public and medical awareness of the presenting characteristics of childhood DM.

### A survey of youth with new onset type 1 diabetes: opportunities to reduce diabetic ketoacidosis [^c1d3eda2]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Pediatric patients in Colorado with new onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) increased from 29.9% to 46.2% from 1998 to 2012. The purpose of this study was to compare differences between patients with newly diagnosed T1D who presented in DKA with those who did not across three domains: sociodemographic factors, access to medical care, and medical provider factors, aiming to identify potential targets for intervention.

Methods

Sixty-one patients < 17 years of age with T1D duration < 6 months completed the questionnaire. Groups were compared using Fisher's exact test or the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Results

Parents of 28% of patients researched their child's symptoms on the Internet prior to diagnosis. At the first healthcare visit for symptoms of T1D, 23% were not diagnosed. There were no significant differences between groups (DKA vs non-DKA) in demographics, first healthcare setting for T1D symptoms, provider type at first visit or at diagnosis, insurance status, or specific barriers to care. DKA patients had a longer interval between previous well visit to diagnosis (median 172 vs 263 days, P = 0.01). Non-DKA patients were more likely to have blood glucose measured at P = 0.02, and had fewer symptoms prior to (P = 0.01) the first visit for diabetes symptoms. Parents of non-DKA patients were more likely to be familiar with symptoms of diabetes (P < 0.001) and to suspect diabetes (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Targets for campaigns to prevent DKA include increasing provider glucose and ketone testing, increasing public knowledge about diabetes, and understanding how socio-demographic factors may delay T1D diagnosis.

### Ketoacidosis at onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children – frequency and clinical presentation [^b4079421]. Pediatric Diabetes (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1987, patients with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 1 under 15 yr of age have been registered in Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW), Germany.

Aim

Our aim was to describe the frequency and the clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children.

Methods

All 31 pediatric departments in BW and one diabetes center participated in this study. Hospital records of 2121 children below 15 yr of age were examined retrospectively. DKA was defined as glucose > 250 mg/dL, pH < 7.30 or bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L and ketonuria. Statistical analysis was done after logarithmic transformation.

Results

26.3% (n = 558) of all patients presented with DKA. The mean age of these patients was 7.9 yr. The frequency of DKA is higher in girls than in boys (28.9 vs. 23.8%; p = 0.0079). Those aged 0–4 yr suffered most frequently (p < 0.0001) from ketoacidosis (36.0%). The percentage of DKA in newly diagnosed cases was constant over 10 yr. 23.3% of all patients with DKA presented with an altered level of consciousness; 10.9% of these had clinical signs of coma. No deaths occurred. The proportion of ketoacidosis does not increase concurrently with the number of diabetes manifestations in winter.

Conclusion

The proportion of DKA in children with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is significant. In particular, children < 5 yr and girls face an increased risk. DKA may be the result of a particularly aggressive subtype of diabetes.

### Is diabetic ketoacidosis a good predictor of 5-year metabolic control in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes? [^3ddaa0f7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common metabolic diseases in the pediatric population worldwide. The global increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes among children still remains at the level of 3 to 5% annually. The alarming epidemiological situation may also be observed in Poland with the tendency toward younger age groups. In children aged 0–14 the disease frequency boosted approximately six-fold from 4.2 per 100,000 persons/year in the early 1970s to 24.3 per 100,000 persons/year in 2013 with regular, sinusoidal fluctuations and a slight levelling-off over the past few years. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) stated that diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was the most common, but potentially preventable life-threatening complication related to newly diagnosed T1D. The incidence of this problem is still unacceptably high, especially in the youngest group (below 5 years) and has not changed over the last 20 years despite a sharp increase in T1D diagnoses and improvement in medical care. Overall, more than one-third of newly diagnosed children are affected by DKA. A large global variation is observed in DKA prevalence, with the values varying from 14.7% (Denmark) to 79,8% (Saudi Arabia) depending on a geographic location, the socioeconomic factors of the country and the incidence of diabetes (the awareness is poorer in countries with a lower incidence). The socioeconomic inequalities play a crucial and important role in the DKA rate at diabetes diagnosis. The frequency of DKA in Poland was estimated to be between 22 to 36% and the incidence of coma due to DKA was around 4.7% of children. DKA is the most common cause of diabetes-related death and has an associated mortality rate from 0.15 to 0.35% in developed countries and from 3.4 to 24% in developing countries. Cerebral edema is the leading cause of DKA-related death. It occurs in 0.3–1% people at disease onset. Some authors suggested that when clinically cerebral edema was not observed mild brain injuries were present in at least 50% of children during DKA treatment. Negative neurological complications were associated with persistent alterations in attention and memory 6 months following a DKA episode. Moreover, DKA severity and younger age were the greatest risk factors for changes in the cerebral structure. Aye et al. reported that a single episode of moderate or severe DKA in young children at diabetes diagnosis contributed to lowering the cognitive function and altering brain growth. DKA was also correlated with a longer hospitalization and higher baseline insulin requirements. Moreover, ketoacidosis at diabetes onset was associated with a poor residual β-cell function and, thereby, a shorter remission period. Data concerning long-term glycemic control depending on DKA presence on diabetes diagnosis are contradictory. The majority of authors supported the concept of metabolic tracking and reported a negative influence on metabolic control if diabetes was accompanied by DKA at onset. Numerous differences are observed worldwide in terms of the access to medical services, education level, approach to new insulin and diabetes technologies which could influence the observed data inhomogeneity. No reports concerning this field are available in Poland.

### Has COVID-19 delayed the diagnosis and worsened the presentation of type 1 diabetes in children? [^dfad8a3b]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether the diagnosis of pediatric type 1 diabetes or its acute complications changed during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Italy.

Research Design and Methods

This was a cross-sectional, web-based survey of all Italian pediatric diabetes centers to collect diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and COVID-19 data in patients presenting with new-onset or established type 1 diabetes between 20 February and 14 April in 2019 and 2020.

Results

Fifty-three of 68 centers (77.9%) responded. There was a 23% reduction in new diabetes cases in 2020 compared with 2019. Among those newly diagnosed patients who presented in a state of DKA, the proportion with severe DKA was 44.3% in 2020 vs. 36.1% in 2019 (P = 0.03). There were no differences in acute complications. Eight patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 had laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Conclusions

The COVID-19 pandemic might have altered diabetes presentation and DKA severity. Preparing for any "second wave" requires strategies to educate and reassure parents about timely emergency department attendance for non-COVID-19 symptoms.

, which causes the production of ketones. Ketone buildup in the blood results in metabolic acidosis, which produces symptoms including extreme thirst, frequent urination, stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting, disorientation, and breath that smells like fruit. A chronic autoimmune disease known as Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is characterized by the eradication of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Although it may happen at any age, it often starts to manifest in childhood or adolescent. In T1DM, the immune system incorrectly targets and kills the beta cells, leading to little or nonexistent insulin production. The hormone insulin is essential for controlling blood glucose levels. Because of this, T1DM patients need lifelong insulin medication in order to survive. Excessive thirst, frequent urination, exhaustion, and an increased susceptibility to infections are all typical signs of T1DM.

The treatment of T1DM entails routine blood glucose monitoring, the use of insulin pumps or injections, a balanced diet, routine physical exercise, and the management of additional risk factors for complications. DKA is diagnosed based on clinical presentation and biochemical abnormalities, including hyperglycemia, venous pH of < 7. 3 or serum bicarbonate less than 15, and the presence of ketones in the blood or urine. Ill patients with Type-1 DM should be evaluated for DKA, which can coexist with or be triggered by other acute illnesses. There may be a history of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, or recurrent infection. Patients and parents may also report poor school performance, lack of concentration, altered mental status, and confusion as well. Patients with metabolic acidosis classically display rapid, deep breathing.

The breath may have a fruity odor due to respiratory aceton elimination. Neurologic findings range from alert, to lethargic and drowsy, to comatose correlated with the extent of acidosis. In order to treat DKA and prevent life-threatening consequences, immediate medical intervention essential. DKA calls for intravenous fluids, insulin therapy, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Majority of these factors signify severe disease, and this could be aggravated by delay in recognition and treatment. Overall mortality among children presenting with DKA as the initial presentation in type 1 Diabetes mellitus is 12. 8%.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis at type 1 diabetes diagnosis in children during the COVID-19 pandemic [^683b03de]. Pediatric Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant public health measures that have resulted in decreased acute pediatric care utilization. We evaluated whether the rate of severe presentations of new onset type 1 diabetes (DM1), such as, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has changed since the COVID-19 public health measures were enacted.

Research Design and Methods

A retrospective chart review of children less than 18years of age presenting with new onset DM1 during the pandemic period of March 17, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was conducted at two tertiary care pediatric hospitals in Alberta, Canada. Rates of DKA and severe DKA were compared to the same time period in the year 2019 (pre-pandemic control).

Results

The number of children presenting with newly diagnosed DM1 was similar during the pandemic year of 2020 compared with 2019 (107 children in 2020 vs. 114 in 2019). The frequency of DKA at DM1 onset was significantly higher in the pandemic period (68.2% vs 45.6%; p < 0.001) and incidence of severe DKA was also higher (27.1% in 2020 vs 13.2% in 2019; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

There was a significant increase in DKA and severe DKA in children presenting with new onset DM1 during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This emphasizes the need for educating health care professionals and families to be aware of the symptoms of hyperglycemia and the importance of early diagnosis and treatment even during public health measures for COVID-19.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus in children. Central nervous system changes seen in DKA include the altered sensorium seen commonly in DKA and loosely characterized as diabetic coma and the uncommon but worrisome progressively deepening coma caused by cerebral edema, which has both a high morbidity and mortality. This article discusses the assessment and treatment of DKA in the setting of the pediatric ICU.

### Neurological consequences of diabetic ketoacidosis at initial presentation of type 1 diabetes in a prospective cohort study of children [^395d53bd]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Implications

This study demonstrates common and widespread alterations in brain structure and chemistry in new-onset type 1 diabetes with ketoacidosis in a pediatric and adolescent cohort from a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse population. There are several implications that arise from these findings. First is the imperative to avoid ketoacidosis in children through improved public and professional awareness. Reductions in the rates of ketoacidosis at diagnosis are possible, as has been demonstrated with public health campaigns in Italy and Australia. Second, any neuroprotective strategy developed in the future must be prioritized at initial diagnosis. Finally, we should focus greater attention on neuropsychological evaluation of children with diabetes by both performing a brief mental state examination in all newly diagnosed patients and providing cognitive follow-up. It would appear sensible for clinicians to defer educational activities in patients with a suboptimal mental state for at least 1–2 weeks. Brain injury should no longer be considered a rare complication of DKA. This study has shown that it is both frequent and persistent.

Table 1
Distribution of age and gender of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis

During the period under review, seven (19.8%; 5 girls and 2 boys) of the 37 patients who were earlier registered and treated for DKA were hospitalized for the second time in ketoacidosis, giving a female-to-male re-admission ratio of 2.5:1. Omission of insulin was the precipitating factor of DKA in 4 (57.1%) of the 7 patients who were previously diagnosed and were being followed up for T1DM. These four cases who omitted insulin were because of proclaimed cure at spiritual healing homes. Other clinical characteristics of the patients are depicted in Table 2. The serum electrolyte profile at the point of admission revealed that 27(73.0%) out of the 37 cases had moderate DKA. The remaining 10(27.0%) had severe DKA. Over half (52.3%)of the families of the patients with DKA at initial presentation were of the middle social class while 11.2% were of the high social class and 36.5% were of the low social class. Out of 37 cases of newly-diagnosed T1DM manifesting with DKA, 69.4% had symptoms for 2–3 weeks before presentation and 29.2% had had at least one medical consultation during the period in a private clinic. Two (8.3%) had more than one medical consultations during the same period. The distribution of duration of symptoms before presentation was as follows: less than 2 weeks 10.9%; 2–4 weeks 46.4%; 5–7 weeks 27.3%; and above 7 weeks in 15.4%. The frequency of the presenting symptoms and signs is displayed in Figure 1. Eight (21.6%) of the mothers whose children presented with DKA admitted they did not know that diabetes mellitus can occur in children. The frequency of a positive family history of diabetes mellitus was 8.1% and this involved two mothers and a maternal grandmothers.

### Altered branched chain ketoacids underlie shared metabolic phenotypes in type 1 diabetes and maple syrup urine disease [^00338619]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) may present as an asymptomatic incidental finding, as new-onset classical diabetes symptoms (polydipsia, polyuria, hyperglycemia, and ketonuria), or as diabetic ketoacidosis. Although hyperglycemia without acidosis is the most common presentation, early symptoms such as persistent bedwetting, candidiasis, increased thirst, or weight loss often go unnoticed in young children. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an acute and potentially life-threatening metabolic complication of absolute insulin insufficiency. Various studies estimate diabetic ketoacidosis to be the initial presentation for approximately 30% of children, with notably increased risk in younger children, whose symptoms are frequently overlooked and who are often quicker to deteriorate.

In the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis, insulin deficiency paired with an increase in counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, catecholamines, cortisol, and growth hormone) promotes a catabolic state and guides the body to exploit triglycerides and amino acids in place of glucose for energy production. Excess circulating glucagon stimulates lipolysis and muscle catabolism, and glycerol and alanine serve as substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Hyperglycemia develops due to increased gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and compromised glucose utilization at the peripheral tissues.

During prolonged insulin-deficient states, oxaloacetate is shunted into gluconeogenesis, depleting the oxaloacetate pool within hepatic mitochondria. In the absence of adequate TCA cycle activity, acetyl-CoA from β-oxidation of the free fatty acids liberated by lipolysis is converted into ketones. The major products of ketogenesis are strong organic acids, which, in conjunction with high production of lactate, cause a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

Simultaneously, hyperglycemia and hyperketonemia instigate osmotic diuresis, resulting in a marked loss of water and electrolytes through the urine, further worsened by nausea and vomiting. Hypovolemia can lead to increased catecholamine production and downstream glucagon production, worsening the patient's already dire hyperglycemic state. Excessive volume loss may result in renal hypoperfusion, explaining the high incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Varying clinical presentations at onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children – epidemiological evidence for different subtypes of the disease? [^b557171a]. Pediatric Diabetes (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

On the basis of 2121 case observations between 1987 and 1997, we describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of diabetes mellitus type 1 at its onset. Our objective is to analyze whether clinical presentation follows a uniform pattern or whether there is evidence for different subtypes.

Research Design and Methods

Thirty-one pediatric hospitals and one diabetes center in Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW), Germany, participated in this study. The hospital records of 2121 children below 15 yr of age were examined retrospectively. Statistical analysis was done after logarithmic transformation into a normal distribution.

Results

The average duration of symptoms was found to be 15.2 d (95% CI (Confidence Intervals) = 14.3–16.1) ranging between 2.0 and 180 d (95% central range). The most frequent symptoms were polyuria and polydipsia; 7.2% presented with altered level of consciousness. The mean blood glucose value was 407.9 mg/dL (95% CI = 400.0–416.0), corresponding to 23.3 mmol/L (95% CI = 22.8–23.8). The median pH value was 7.35 (95% CI = 7.34–7.36), and the median base excess was -5 mmol/L (95% CI = -5 to -4). The younger patients had a shorter duration of symptoms and suffered most frequently from ketoacidosis.

Conclusions

Although the symptoms of diabetes at its onset follow a uniform pattern, the clinical presentation and duration of symptoms indicate that there may be various forms of type 1 diabetes.

### The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: a single-centre study in central Pennsylvania [^ec887be7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The majority of patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1D) present with similar symptoms including polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss and fatigue. Unfortunately, some patients progress to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the time of diagnosis of T1D. Children diagnosed in DKA have increased risk of morbidity, mortality, poor glycaemic control, higher medical costs and healthcare resource utilization including ICU level care. Previous research has identified the predictors for children to present in DKA, which include younger children (under 5 years of age), Hispanic or African American race, low socioeconomic status, misdiagnosis at an initial clinical encounter and lack of private health insurance. Thus far, there are limited data on the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the rate and severity of DKA in children at initial diagnosis of T1D. Interestingly, some geographic locations noted an increase in DKA frequency during the COVID‐19 pandemic, while others reported no change. We conducted this study to investigate whether the COVID‐19 pandemic impacted the rate of DKA and previously identified risk factors in children presenting with T1D in a single tertiary care referral centre in central Pennsylvania.

### Highlighting the new consensus guidelines for managing people at risk of, and with early-stage type 1 diabetes-relevance to clinical care in the UK [^986ec12a]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

There are four key areas.

First, guidance is provided around the frequency and intensity of follow‐up for single Ab as well as multiple Ab individuals, the different stages of early‐stage presymptomatic T1D, in adults and children. The pros and cons of the different approaches to glucose monitoring (glycated haemoglobin, continuous glucose monitoring, self monitoring of blood glucose) are outlined and the utility of these different approaches at different stages is discussed. Importantly, advice is also provided around safety. The importance of regular education about symptoms of diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis is highlighted and all health professionals involved in monitoring and care of these individuals have a responsibility to provide this education. At this time there are no formal recommendations of how appropriate monitoring and follow‐up pathways may be practically implemented given this is likely to be a novel service, and this will require attention and careful consideration.

### Factors associated with the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of diabetes in children and young adults: a systematic review [^d731e011]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

A history of prior infection was the only disease related factor associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Infection is known to cause inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and a counter regulatory response that collectively lead to insulin resistance and metabolic decompensation. The infection itself may also trigger more rapid autoimmune destruction of β cells. Infections are associated with a transient increase in risk of type 1 diabetes, and there is increasing evidence for the role of enteroviruses in the early phase of type 1 diabetes through infection of β cells and activation of innate immunity and inflammation. Alternatively, the presence of infection may mask the early symptoms of diabetes and make the diagnosis more difficult.

Factors associated with a decreased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis

Having a first degree relative with diabetes was associated with an up to sixfold decreased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis. The absence of any significant difference between children in whom a member of the family was subsequently diagnosed with diabetes and those without such a family history at the end of the follow-up period suggests that the protective effect of a first degree relative with diabetes at diagnosis was probably due to increased awareness among families with experience of diabetes rather than an increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes predisposing to a milder onset of disease, as suggested previously. This interpretation is consistent with other observations that initial differences in metabolic indices observed at diagnosis between those with and without a family history of diabetes disappear by one year after diagnosis.

It is also possible that some of this protective effect could be due to a family history of diabetes alerting clinicians to an increased possibility of type 1 diabetes. Better disease recognition because of improved awareness of diabetes is further supported by the finding that children from families with higher parental education were less likely to present in diabetic ketoacidosis, and that the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis was inversely proportional to background incidence of type 1 diabetes. These differences may also reflect variations in, for example, access to healthcare, child supervision, or schooling.

### Is diabetic ketoacidosis a good predictor of 5-year metabolic control in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes? [^c61b34d2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presence of DKA at diabetes diagnosis was not associated with poor long-term metabolic control in T1D children using modern technologies after T1D onset. CSII therapy introduced at diabetes onset might prevent HbA 1C deterioration during the follow-up period in children with DKA at diabetes diagnosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of the early implementation of CSII to the long-term metabolic control in children with T1D complicated by DKA on recognition.

The current version of the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is largely based on the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society/European Society of Pediatric Endocrinology (LWPES/ESPE) consensus statement on DKA in children and adolescents published in 2004. This article critically reviews and presents the most pertinent new data published in the past decade, which have implications for diagnosis and management. Four elements of the guidelines warrant modification: (i) The definition of DKA; (ii) insulin therapy; (iii) water and salt replacement; and (iv) blood ß-hydroxybutyrate measurements for the management of DKA.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the time of diagnosis in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a preventable complication given the recognizable symptoms (polyuria, polydipsia, enuresis, weight loss and fatigue) of T1D. 1, 2 Children diagnosed in DKA have increased morbidity, mortality, and incur higher medical costs and healthcare resource utilization including ICU level care. 3 Several previous studies have identified risk factors for children to present in DKA, including age (< 5 or 10‐12), 4 Hispanic and African American race, low socioeconomic status, misdiagnosis at an initial encounter and lack of private health insurance. 5, 6, 7, 8 A recent study in Colorado children was the first to report similar rates of DKA among privately insured children and Medicaid aligning with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. 9 Established rates of DKA at diagnosis of T1D differ between different countries and states within the United States. 8, 10 The aims of this study were to (a) determine the rate of DKA at presentation of T1D at a single tertiary medical centre in central Pennsylvania and (b) evaluate the factors associated with their presentation in DKA.

Preceding infection or febrile illness

Three studies included data on the effect of a preceding infection or febrile illness. In two, a history of infection or febrile illness was associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (odds ratios 6.50 (2.06 to 20.53) and 1.87 (1.05 to 3.33), not combined because I² = 72.2%). In the third study febrile illness before the start of symptoms was more common in the groups with shorter duration of symptoms (< 1 month), but it did not change the percentage with severe ketoacidosis.

Other factors

Time of year

Two studieslooked at the effect of time of year on the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis. Although the total number of cases was higher in winter than in summer, both found that the proportion of diabetic ketoacidosis cases remained stable (combined odds ratio 1.07 (0.89 to 1.28), P = 0.49).

Background incidence of type 1 diabetes

Only one multicentre study reported specifically on the influence of the background incidence of type 1 diabetes on the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis. Using data from 11 centres across Europe, it showed a significant inverse correlation between the proportion presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis and the background incidence of type 1 diabetes for these centres (r s = –0.715, P = 0.012).

### Dapagliflozin [^4d3464a8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, dapagliflozin significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS are not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis at diabetes onset: still an all too common threat in youth [^9d5c1ea0]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the demographic and clinical characteristics of children at the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D), with particular attention to the frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Study Design

The Pediatric Diabetes Consortium enrolled children with new-onset T1D into a common database. For this report, eligible subjects were aged < 19 years, had a pH or HCO(3) value recorded at diagnosis, and were positive for at least one diabetes-associated autoantibody. Of the 1054 children enrolled, 805 met the inclusion criteria. A pH of < 7.3 and/or HCO(3) value of < 15 mEq/L defined DKA. Data collected included height, weight, hemoglobin A1c, and demographic information (eg, race/ethnicity, health insurance status, parental education, family income).

Results

The 805 children had a mean age of 9.2 years, 50% were female; 63% were non-Hispanic Caucasian. Overall, 34% of the children presented in DKA, half with moderate or severe DKA (pH < 7.2). The risk for DKA was estimated as 54% in children aged < 3 years and 33% in those aged ≥ 3 years (P = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.002), lack of private health insurance (P < .001), African-American race (P = 0.01), and no family history of T1D (P = 0.001) were independently predictive of DKA. The mean initial hemoglobin A1c was higher in the children with DKA compared with those without DKA (12.5% ± 1.9% vs 11.1% ± 2.4%; P < .001).

Conclusion

The incidence of DKA in children at the onset of T1D remains high, with approximately one-third presenting with DKA and one-sixth with moderate or severe DKA. Increased awareness of T1D in the medical and lay communities is needed to decrease the incidence of this life-threatening complication.

### Ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents: frequency and clinical characteristics [^d98386fb]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Slightly over three-quarter of the children and adolescents in the present study manifested with DKA at first diagnosis of diabetes. This is not surprising as a similar high prevalence rate has been reported in a previous study in Nigeria. The same is true of reports from Iran and the United Arab Emirates. However, some studies have reported lower prevalence rates, all reflecting the well known wide geographic variation in frequency of DKA at onset of paediatric diabetes mellitus. The differing prevalence rates might be explained by differences in study population, the background prevalence of diabetes in the given population, presence or absence of family history of T1DM, family socioeconomic status, delayed diagnosis and treatment as well as the definition of DKA used in the particular study. All these factors have been reported to influence the prevalence of DKA at onset of type 1 diabetes. The relatively higher mean age (12.7 years) of our patients may contribute to the observed higher prevalence. This view is supported by a report from Finland which indicated a higher prevalence among patients aged 10–14 years compared to those aged 5–9 years. Secular changes in frequency of DKA at onset of T1DM has equally been reported. The clinical implication of DKA as first presentation T1DM may be viewed from two perspectives as proposed by Neu et al. First, as a reflection of a delayed diagnosis and treatment or as an aggressive form of diabetes. Either way, it represents a poor prognostic factor. For instance, DKA in newly diagnosed diabetes has been linked to a poorer glycaemic control, less residual β-cell function (up to two years) after diagnosis, and lower frequency of remission.

### Prevalence and factors associated with diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: a report from a tertiary medical center in central Pennsylvania [^7bd6cdc6]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

An alarming proportion of children who had a healthcare encounter within 30 days of their diagnosis of T1D but who had not been referred for concern of T1D presented in DKA (75%), which was much higher than our average rate of DKA (46%), children in the immediate referral group (37%), or those that presented to the ED directly (51%). Our findings support previous reports that a misdiagnosis of a child presenting in T1D is associated with an increased rate of DKA. 7, 12 One report found rates of misdiagnosis of T1D are highest among very young children (< 5) and independent of type of healthcare insurance. 12 Common misdiagnosis include gastroenteritis, respiratory infection, viral syndrome, yeast infection, and urinary tract infection. 7 Our data suggest children without an immediate referral during a preceding healthcare encounter are at the greatest risk of presenting in DKA and reinforces the importance of appropriate diagnostic screening for T1D in the primary care setting. Limitations of this study include the nature of a retrospective study, which is limited by the accuracy of documented information provided within the medical record and all scanned media, and the single‐centre design.

In conclusion, our study was the first to report the rate of DKA at diagnosis of T1D within a tertiary medical centre in central Pennsylvania at 46% and the associated risk factors. Future interventions such as general public awareness campaigns, educating childhood contacts on the presenting symptoms of T1D or islet autoantibody screening for high‐risk populations were proposed to reduce the rate of children presenting in DKA at diagnosis of T1D. 13, 14

### 'Diabetic ketoacidosis may not always be the answer… ' [^71f8acd1]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We present the interesting case of a 9-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus. He presented to the emergency department extremely unwell and the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis was promptly performed. He was started on the local diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) protocol, but his recovery remained slow. The possibility of an underlying pathology was later addressed and led to the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosis of childhood Addison's disease due to its vague and non-specific symptoms and the importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion. This case also highlights the existence of autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes and the ongoing need to increase awareness and screening of these conditions.

### Clinical characteristics at presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children younger than 15 years in Croatia [^6922b36c]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the clinical and biochemical characteristics of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) at presentation in children younger than 15 years in Croatia during a 9-year period, with special attention to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) incidence. The registered data set comprised blood glucose, pH, serum bicarbonate levels, and clinical symptoms at disease manifestation. During the study period, 692 children were diagnosed with type 1 DM. Polydipsia (96.7%), polyuria (96.05%), and weight loss (82.7%) were the most frequent symptoms anticipating disease detection. Enuresis was recorded in 11.55%. A total of 36.41% patients had DKA (pH < 7.3) at disease onset. During the 9-year period, the percentage of children presenting with DKA at time of diagnosis decreased from 41.67% to 33.33% (z = 1.68, p = 0.046). A positive family history of DM, the only factor with an impact on the DKA incidence rate in our population, lowers the probability of the development of ketoacidosis. This study confirms the importance of the detection of the classic symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss in patients with new-onset type 1 DM. The percentage of patients with DKA at diabetes onset decreased during the observed period but is still high and includes one-third of all patients. This is why in every acutely ill child, especially at a younger age, one should evaluate the possibility of type 1 DM to avoid the development of ketoacidosis.

### Moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis at type 1 diabetes onset in children over two decades: a population-based study of prevalence and long-term glycemic outcomes [^a61dc681]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate in a population-based pediatric cohort: prevalence of moderate-severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis over two decades and its association with long-term glycemic control.

Research Design and Methods

Children < 16years diagnosed with T1D in Western Australia 2000–2019 were included and followed up for ≤ 14years. Moderate-severe DKA at diagnosis was defined as serum pH < 7.2 or bicarbonate < 10mmol/L with hyperglycemia and ketosis. HbA1c was measured ~3-monthly. Trend in prevalence of moderate-severe DKA at diagnosis was investigated using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, age, socioeconomic status, and area of residence. Long-term glycemic control associated with DKA at diagnosis was investigated using linear mixed models adjusting for the same variables and also for visit frequency, CGM and pump use.

Results

Moderate-severe DKA occurred in 534 of 2111 (25.3%) participants. Odds of presenting with moderate-severe DKA increased by 4.1% (95% CI: 2.3, 5.9; p < 0.001) per year. Patients with moderate-severe DKA at diagnosis had higher HbA1c levels than other patients initially; the groups were similar between 2 and 6years duration; from 7years HbA1c levels tracked higher in the group with moderate-severe DKA at diagnosis with significant differences at 8 and 12years (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The increasing prevalence of DKA at diagnosis of pediatric T1D is concerning and highlights the need for early detection programs. Unlike a similar US study, this study did not find a consistent, clinically significant relationship between DKA at diagnosis and long-term HbA1c, raising important questions about the influence of other factors on long-term glycemic outcomes.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children… [^72d1005a]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. If left untreated, diabetic ketoacidosis, a largely preventable life-threatening complication, will occur. Currently, 19% of Canadian children and 40% of US children will present with DKA at the time of diagnosis of T1D. 1, 2 Because symptoms of T1D exist before the onset of DKA, 1 risk factor for DKA is a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of T1D. Other risk factors include younger age and lower socioeconomic status.

1. Several prospective studies, including the Trial to Reduce Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in the Genetically at Risk, have followed up children at increased genetic risk of T1D from birth. 3, 4 Within these research settings, there was an increased awareness of diabetes risk and symptoms provided by the research teams, likely leading to earlier diagnosis and a decreased DKA risk at diagnosis.

In a longitudinal study of children at increased genetic risk of T1D, participants experienced significantly less DKA at the time of diagnosis when compared with patients with new-onset T1D reported in national diabetes registries.
4. A total of 173 children were diagnosed with T1D, among whom 8 patients presented in DKA at diagnosis. Compared with DKA rates in the general population and rates observed in the TEDDY study, TRIGR particpants had lower rates of DKA at T1D diagnosis. Compared with those without DKA, patients with DKA were more likely to have fewer antibodies and more likely to have reported weight loss and fatigue at diagnosis.

### Alarming increase in ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel [^c5e4ca3f]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the incidence and severity of ketoacidosis (DKA) at type 1 diabetes diagnosis during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Israel.

Research Design and Methods

A population-based study the product of a national collaboration of Israeli pediatric diabetes centers investigated the presentation of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. The frequencies of DKA and severe DKA observed during the COVID-19 period from March 15, 2020 (commencement of the first nationwide lockdown) until June 30, 2020 were compared with the same periods in 2019, 2018, and 2017 using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic position.

Results

During the COVID-19 period, DKA incidence was 58.2%, significantly higher than in 2019 (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.18 [95% CI, 1.31–3.60], P = 0.003); 2018 (aOR 2.05 [95% CI, 1.26–3.34], P = 0.004); and 2017 (aOR, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.09–2.93], P = 0.022). The incidence of severe DKA was 19.9%, significantly higher than in 2018 (aOR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.20–5.19], P = 0.015) and 2017 (aOR, 2.73 [95% CI, 1.28–5.82], P = 0.009). In 2020, admissions and duration of stay in the intensive care unit were higher than in previous years (P = 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, children aged 6-11years had higher incidences of DKA (61.3% vs. 34.0%, 40.6%, and 45.1%, respectively, P = 0.012), and severe DKA (29.3% vs. 15.1%, 10.9%, and 5.9%, respectively, P = 0.002).

Conclusions

The dramatic increase in DKA at presentation of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic mandates targeted measures to raise public and physician awareness.

### ESPE / LWPES consensus statement on diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents [^c1a0b088]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM). Mortality is predominantly related to the occurrence of cerebral oedema; only a minority of deaths in DKA are attributed to other causes. Cerebral oedema occurs in about 0.3–1% of all episodes of DKA, and its aetiology, pathophysiology, and ideal method of treatment are poorly understood. There is debate as to whether physicians treating DKA can prevent or predict the occurrence of cerebral oedema, and the appropriate site(s) for children with DKA to be managed. There is agreement that prevention of DKA and reduction of its incidence should be a goal in managing children with diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In Finland, all children presenting with type 1 diabetes are treated in pediatric units, and their parents/guardians are asked whether the child may be recorded in the nationwide Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Register established in 2002. We used data from this register and, in addition, asked the pediatric centers to recheck their hospital records and report the sex, age, and blood pH at diagnosis for all case subjects who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 1 June 2002 and 31 May 2005. The final data encompassed all children < 15 years of age diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in Finland during the 3-year study period. Diabetes was diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. The study was approved by the local ethics committees and the register steering committee.

The study cohort comprised 1,656 children (936 boys, 56.5%), a majority of whom were recorded in the Finnish Pediatric Diabetes Register (1,518 of 1,656, 91.7%). The mean age at diagnosis was 8.0 years (range 0.28–14.99 years), and DKA data were available from 1,616 children (97.6%). The children were treated in 27 centers, 5 of which were university hospitals. In three university hospitals, the prospective type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) project has been running since the mid-1990s to establish strategies for predicting and preventing type 1 diabetes. One child, an 8-year-old girl, died soon after diagnosis with a clinical picture of cerebral edema.

The duration of symptoms before diagnosis was recorded. The degree of consciousness at diagnosis, based on evaluation by the attending doctor, was reported to be normal in 94.5% of the case subjects and impaired in 5.2%, and 0.3% were considered unconscious. Body weight and height were measured on admission, and BMI was calculated (kg/m 2).

Standard laboratory methods were used to measure plasma glucose and blood pH. Diabetic ketoacidosis was defined as blood pH < 7.30 and considered severe if pH was < 7.10.

Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). Two-tailed Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, cross-tabulation and χ 2 analysis, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Pearson correlation analysis were applied when appropriate.

### Changes in the prevalence of diabetes ketoacidosis at the onset of type 1 diabetes in Polish children: a comparative analysis between two 9-year periods-2006-2014 and 2015–2023 [^845a6ec8]. Pediatric Diabetes (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: Having been facing a progressive increase in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), there might be a growing risk of the development of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at disease onset. The prevalence of DKA varies widely by geographic region, ranging from approximately 13% in Sweden to 80% in the United Arab Emirates. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of DKA in childhood-onset T1D from Greater Poland (Poland) in two 9-year periods.

Methods: We assessed the prevalence of DKA in children aged < 18 years with newly diagnosed T1D in Greater Poland (Poland) in two 9-year periods, 2006–2014 and 2015–2023, in a retrospective review of a complete regional cohort. DKA and its severity were classified according to International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) guidelines.

Results: Over the 18 years, 2432 children below 18 years of age with newly diagnosed T1D were recorded. The overall prevalence of DKA was 51.3% (n = 1248), and it rose significantly in two nine-year periods, from 47.7% in 2006–2014 to 53.4% in 2015–2023 (p = 0.007). There was a significant shift toward more severe presentations of DKA. While the prevalence of mild DKA decreased slightly from 51.3% to 47.0% (p = 0.145), and moderate DKA had a notable decline from 33.1% to 25.2% (p = 0.003), the proportion of severe DKA cases rose sharply from 15.5% to 27.7% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions: Despite the increasing incidence of T1D in Poland, healthcare, and parental awareness of T1D symptoms remain low, which results in delayed T1D recognition. The escalating prevalence of DKA at T1D onset in children is a concerning public health issue that necessitates a multifaceted approach to education, prevention, and early intervention. Addressing these challenges might help reduce the prevalence of DKA and improve clinical outcomes for children with T1D.

### Children and adolescents: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^679078f4]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes — pharmacologic options are "limited to four approved drug classes: insulin, metformin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors". Presentation with ketoacidosis or marked ketosis "requires a period of insulin therapy until fasting and postprandial glycemia have been restored to normal or near-normal levels", and "insulin pump therapy may be considered as an option for those on long-term multiple daily injections who are able to safely manage the device". "Initial treatment should also be with insulin when the distinction between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes is unclear and in individuals who have random blood glucose concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL (≥ 13.9 mmol/L) and/or A1C ≥ 8.5% (≥ 69 mmol/mol)". "Metformin therapy should be added after resolution of ketosis or ketoacidosis". "When initial insulin treatment is not required, initiation of metformin is recommended as first-line therapy".

### Clinical presentation of type 1 diabetes [^5ba8255e]. Pediatric Diabetes (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the presenting features of type 1 diabetes in a national incident cohort aged under 15 yr, the duration of symptoms, the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at presentation, and the frequency of a family history of diabetes.

Methods

A prospective study was undertaken of incident cases of type 1 diabetes using an active monthly reporting card system from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1998 in the Republic of Ireland. Follow-up questionnaires were distributed to pediatricians nationally.

Results

Two hundred and eighty-three incident cases were identified. Polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss were the main presenting symptoms in all age categories. Nocturnal enuresis was reported in 19% under 5 yr and in 31% aged 5–9.99 yr. Constipation was noted in five patients and in 10.4% under 5 yr of age. The median duration of symptoms was highest in the youngest (under 2 yr) and oldest (10–14.99 yr) age categories. Presentation in moderate/severe DKA occurred in 25% overall and six of nine of those aged under 2 yr. A family history of type 1 diabetes in a first-degree relative was found in 10.2%.

Conclusions

This study confirms the abrupt onset of type 1 diabetes, the absence of a family history, and the importance of the classical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss in the majority of cases. It reveals secondary enuresis as an important symptom, especially in those under 10 yr, and constipation in the under 5 yr age group. The very young (under 2 yr) are more difficult to diagnose, have more variability of symptom duration, and are more likely to present in moderate/severe DKA. A high index of suspicion aids early diagnosis.

Hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, and vomiting are the most common manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis in pediatric patients. The absence of ketonemia in these patients should prompt a consideration of acute pancreatitis.

Background Stroke and other neurologic complications are rare in pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) without severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or poor glycemic control. Case presentation A previously healthy, 10-year-old female presented with acute thalamic stroke, non-acidotic new T1DM diagnosis and negative hypercoagulopathy workup. She received routine insulin therapy and aspirin, and returned to neurologic baseline within a year without stroke recurrence. Conclusions The contribution of non-acidotic hyperglycemia to stroke risk is better described in adults. Even though unable to prove causality, this case should at least raise awareness of the possible association of pediatric new-onset diabetes and stroke for optimal outcomes.

### Neurological consequences of diabetic ketoacidosis at initial presentation of type 1 diabetes in a prospective cohort study of children [^8264a298]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes varies from 0.1 to 57.6 per 100,000 and is increasing worldwide. Long-term cognitive consequences of type 1 diabetes and associated fluctuations in glycemia during childhood and adolescence are well documented. Strategies to prevent or ameliorate these adverse outcomes require an understanding of the nature and timing of the neurological insults associated with diabetic dysglycemia.

The most severe acute diabetes-related central nervous system complication in type 1 diabetes is cerebral edema associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with 10–25% of affected children experiencing chronic central nervous system morbidity. Although the frequency of DKA at diagnosis is relatively high (15–70% depending on age and geographic region), fulminate clinical cerebral edema in this context is relatively rare, with an incidence rate of 0.5–0.9%; hence, documented brain injury is also rare. The more frequent, milder alterations in brain function and chemistry in newly diagnosed DKA have been assumed to be transitory with normalization after metabolic stabilization, but this assumption has not been formally tested. We hypothesized that just as there exists a continuum of clinical and subclinical cerebral edema, there also is a continuum of brain injury in DKA and that brain injury outside the context of florid cerebral edema is more common than previously recognized.

The purpose of this study in children with new-onset DKA was twofold. The first aim was to document acute alterations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cerebral structure and cognitive function and correlate these with clinical parameters. The second aim was to study the evolution of these alterations in brain structure and cognitive functioning over the first 6 months.

Anthropometry data

Anthropometric characteristics included measuring height (cm) in children aged ≥ 2 years and length (cm) in very young children (aged < 2 years) using a stadiometer, and body weight (kg), after full rehydration, using standard scales. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2), and height/length, by age and sex were expressed as z-scores (SD scores (SDS) and percentiles and the nutritional status was categorised using the WHO growth reference charts and calculator. According to the WHO paediatric reference standards for age 0–19 years, children and adolescents were classified into underweight (BMI < 5th percentile), healthy weight (BMI ≥ 5th to < 85th percentiles) and overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 85th percentiles). Median BMI and height-for-age z-score values were used for comparing weight and height status between patients presenting with and without DKA among children aged < 10 years and those aged ≥ 10 years.

Puberty was assessed by Tanner staging. Of the 342 patients in pubertal ages, 58 (17%) were prepubertal (Tanner stage 1), 69 (20.2%) were at Tanner stage 2, 100 (29.2%) were at Tanner stages 3 and 4, and 115 (33.6%) had completed puberty at Tanner stage 5.

Clinical diagnosis of diabetes

Clinical characteristics included weight and height measurement, case definition, duration and severity of symptoms, pathway to diagnosis, insulin use, and history of DKA at diagnosis. Diagnosis of diabetes was validated by the availability in the records of data on age at onset of the disease, acute or rapid onset of severe clinical symptoms, very high blood glucose levels, ketonaemia, and immediate need for exogenous insulin therapy.

The pathway to diagnosis of T1D was modified from the work of Usher-Smith et al and has been divided into two components: the time interval between onset of symptoms and decision to seek medical help (the appraisal interval), and the overall time extending from onset of symptoms to confirmed diagnosis and treatment initiation (the total diagnosis interval).

### Emergency department presentations of diabetic ketoacidosis in a large cohort of children [^fc2496ae]. Pediatric Diabetes (2023). Medium credibility.

5. Conclusions

Greater efforts are needed for early identification of diabetes and prevention of DKA, as well as the prevention of recurrent DKA in children with known diabetes. Children from lower SES groups are at greater risk for DKA after initial diagnosis of diabetes and at greater risk for more severe DKA, such that prevention efforts should be particularly targeted toward these children. Biochemical profiles of very young children with DKA also suggest that they are at greater risk of cerebral injury and renal dysfunction, despite similar DKA severity (based on pH) compared to the older age groups. Current guidelines suggesting that more intensive monitoring of very young children during DKA treatment are supported by these findings.

### Clinical presentation of childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus in the Al-madina region of Saudi Arabia [^6840bcc9]. Pediatric Diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Aim

To describe the clinical pattern and the laboratory characteristics at presentation of childhood type 1 diabetes mellitus in the Al-Madina region of the north-west province of Saudi Arabia.

Methods

The clinical and laboratory data of a total of 230 children who presented with diabetes during a 10-year period (1992–2001) were retrospectively analyzed based on hospital records.

Results

Polyuria and polydipsia were by far the most frequent symptoms at presentation (96%); three quarters of the children (76.6%) had weight loss at presentation. One hundred and twenty-seven children (55.2%) of 230 presented with ketoacidosis. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.9 yr. The average duration of presenting symptoms before the hospital encounter was 17.1 d ranging from 3.0 to 45.0 d, with an average of 16.2 d in boys and 17.7 d in girls, a difference which was not significant.

Conclusion

Polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss are the most common symptoms at presentation of childhood diabetes mellitus in our region. The frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis was relatively high. The commonly recognized symptoms of diabetes were present in most of the children for a relatively long duration before the diagnosis. This calls for a collaboration of efforts for the early recognition of symptoms by patients and physicians to avoid the more severe types of presentation.

### Prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: are certified athletic trainers an untapped resource? [^360d684d]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The overall incidence rate of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in United States youth has increased 1.9% each year from 2001 to 2015, with the greatest incidence rate being in children aged 10‐14 and 15‐19. 1 The majority of children with new‐onset T1D present with one or two of the four main symptoms of diabetes: polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss and tiredness. 2 It has been reported in the United States that approximately 30% of new‐onset T1D cases progressed to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) before diagnosis. 3 Presentation during DKA has devastating complications including increased morbidity, mortality and psychological distress, and is a predictor of poor long‐term glycaemic control. 4 In addition, those diagnosed during DKA have a significantly higher use of healthcare services and increased medical costs. 5 Lack of awareness by patients and physicians of the presenting signs and symptoms of diabetes accounts for the majority of DKA cases at time of T1D diagnosis. 6

Attempts to improve public awareness of the presenting signs and symptoms of T1D have been successful in decreasing rates of DKA during diagnosis of T1D. 7 In the United States, these T1D awareness campaigns have focused on patients, parents, school teachers and healthcare providers. 8 Certified athletic trainers (ATs) often spend considerable time with student athletes, therefore, we hypothesize that it is especially important that they are targeted in future T1D awareness campaigns. 9 ATs, as a member of the healthcare team, should identify and refer athletes presenting with signs and symptoms of T1D. 10 There is a gap in the literature regarding ATs ability to identify presenting signs and symptoms of T1D and factors, including educational background, that influence AT knowledge of T1D.

This study aimed to bridge that gap by assessing the knowledge of presenting signs and symptoms of T1D and identifying factors that influence this knowledge through a national survey of ATs in the United States.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f2f336e8]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

DKA occurs when there is a disruption in the balance between insulin and the counterregulatory hormones, either from a lack of circulating insulin or increased counterregulatory hormones in response to stress. This imbalance leads to a catabolic state, which precipitates the hallmarks of DKA: hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, increased lipolysis, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. An osmotic diuresis ensues, causing dehydration and the production of more counterregulatory hormones, which further disrupts the balance. At presentation, DKA can be the.

### Association of diabetic ketoacidosis in childhood new-onset type 1 diabetes with day of presentation in Germany [^d60c4a20]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Whether the day of the week on which the child presents affects timely diagnosis and risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not known.

Research Design and Methods

We used data of 30,717 children with new-onset T1D during the last 10 years from the German Prospective Diabetes Registry. We determined the odds ratios of T1D diagnosis and DKA on a weekday, public holiday, and school vacation.

Results

Compared with workdays, the odds ratios of being diagnosed with T1D were lower on weekends (0.39 [95% CI, 0.38–0.41]), public holidays (0.57 [0.53–0.63]), and school vacations (0.83 [0.80–0.85]). The odds of DKA diagnosis were also reduced on weekends (0.55 [0.52–0.59]), public holidays (0.73 [0.63–0.84]), and school vacations (0.85 [0.80–0.90]). Results did not change during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic.

Conclusions

New-onset T1D and DKA in children are more often diagnosed during weekdays than weekends and holidays.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in the pediatric emergency department [^58aa3a94]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Despite many advances, the incidence of pediatric-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is increasing. Diabetes mellitus is 1 of the most common chronic pediatric illnesses and, along with DKA, is associated with significant cost and morbidity. DKA is a complicated metabolic state hallmarked by dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation with insulin and electrolyte replacement under constant monitoring for cerebral edema. When DKA is recognized and treated immediately, the prognosis is excellent. However, when a patient has prolonged or multiple courses of DKA or if DKA is complicated by cerebral edema, the results can be devastating.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis masquerading behind alkalemia an undiagnosed or missed variant of diabetic ketoacidosis [^dbf2c20e]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common emergency in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients. But rarely, they may present with alkalemia instead of acidosis. Diabetic ketoalkalosis which has been reported in adults can also be present in children with type 1 DM. The usual factors causing alkalemia were not found in our patients. This entity may manifest in both newly diagnosed and treated patients.

Case Presentation

The first patient, an 8 year male presented with features of DKA, was diagnosed for the first time as type 1 DM, but was found to have alkalemia. The second patient, a 7 year female was a known case of Type 1 DM on insulin, who presented with dehydration and alkalemia. Both were treated with hydration and insulin and made complete recovery.

Conclusions

A normal or alkalotic pH does not essentially eliminate DKA and needs to be evaluated further to identify the underlying acid-base disturbance.

### Ketoacidosis at onset of type 1 diabetes is a predictor of long-term glycemic control [^5c83e754]. Pediatric Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have evaluated the impact of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at diabetes onset on long-term glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

Objective

We aimed to determine any differences in long-term glycemic control between children/adolescents with T1D presenting with DKA at diabetes onset and those without.

Methods

This retrospective study comprised 335 patients diagnosed with T1D from September 2007 to December 2012, among which 132 (39.4%) presented with DKA. Variables compared between patients with DKA at onset and those without: yearly hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, daily insulin dose, yearly rates of severe hypoglycemia and DKA, percent of patients achieving target HbA1c levels.

Results

After the first year of diabetes, the mean daily insulin dose and HbA1c level were significantly higher in the group with DKA at onset (0.74 ± 0.26 vs 0.69 ± 0.27 units/kg/d, P = 0.049, and 7.85 ± 1.13% vs 7.49 ± 0.94%, P = 0.01, respectively), despite similarity of therapy (multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion), with a similar but not statistically significant trend subsequently. Mean HbA1c since onset was significantly higher in the DKA group (8.08 ± 0.95% vs 7.86 ± 0.95%, P = 0.025). A significantly higher percentage of patients in the group without DKA at onset achieved a mean level of HbA1c since onset within glycemic targets (32% vs 20.5%, P = 0.02). In the DKA group, the frequency of subsequent DKA episodes per diabetes years was significantly higher (P = 0.042).

Conclusions

DKA at diagnosis was associated with less favorable long-term glycemic control as assessed by HbA1c and the rate of DKA episodes. T1D patients presenting with DKA may therefore need stricter treatment and tight follow-up.

2 Identification of At‐Risk Individuals With Screening Programs

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute and life‐threatening condition occurring in 15%–70% of children at the T1D onset, associated with considerable morbidity, need for hospitalisation, and risk of mortality. Awareness campaigns on the warning signs of hyperglycemia have proven only partially effective in reducing the DKA incidence. T1D screening in the general population or in the First‐Degree Relatives (FDR) individuals has recently been shown to be successful in reducing the incidence of DKA at diagnosis by early identification of IAb+ individuals and ongoing monitoring for progression towards Stage 3 T1D. With early identification of presymptomatic T1D and regular follow‐up, the rate of DKA drops significantly. Education of the individuals IAb+ and their families has to include how to detect signs and symptoms of Stage 3 T1D and how to do so in case they appear.

The risk and rate of developing Stage 3 T1D vary depending on IAb status and age at seroconversion, and in individuals with multiple IAb+, the 15‐year risk of progression to Stage 3 type 1 diabetes varies from 18% to 88%. Moreover, the rate of progression varies greatly between individuals and requires longitudinal monitoring, and individuals may occasionally revert from Stage 2 to Stage 1. All this uncertainty can lead to chronic anxiety, and a psychological support should be integrated into follow‐up, whenever possible, delivered by providers with diabetes‐specific training. Some factors have been associated with higher anxiety during screening programs for T1D: parents from an FDR family, parents of children developing IAb+, parents perceiving that the child had a high risk of T1D, and parents with a lower education level.

Algorithms for monitoring people with IAb+, considering modality and frequency, are reported in different consensus and depend on age, length of time since the first detection of IAb+, number of IAb+ detected, and presence or absence of symptoms of T1D. However, there are still some debated points for which we need more evidence, and are reported here:

DKA at T1D onset was very common in both age groups, with no difference in sex distribution (table 2).

Table 2
Clinical and biochemical features of patients presenting with and without diabetic ketoacidosis

The mean (SD) age of patients presenting with DKA was significantly lower than in those without DKA (5.5 (2.5) vs 6.7 (2.5), p = 0.036 for children < 10 years and 13.3 (2.4) vs 14.8 (2.4), p < 0.001 for children ≥ 10 years).

Mean (SD) HbA1c (mmol/mol) of patients presenting with DKA was significantly higher than in those without DKA (97 (14.5) vs 77.1 (10.4), p < 0.001 for children < 10 years and 96.6 (15.1) vs 79.4 (12.6), p < 0.001 for children ≥ 10 years). Mean (SD) plasma glucose (mmol/L) of patients presenting with DKA was significantly higher than in those without DKA (23.7 (4.8) vs 16.3 (5), p < 0.001 for children < 10 years and 22.6 (5.2) vs 15.8 (3.3), p < 0.001 for children ≥ 10 years).

### Diabetic ketoacidosis… [^27fa8cee]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs when there is a relative or absolute decrease in circulating insulin levels in relation to an increase in counterregulatory hormone levels. In response to this imbalance, normal physiologic mechanisms are exaggerated, resulting in hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, ketosis, and acidosis. The biochemical criteria for the diagnosis of DKA are hyperglycemia, venous pH less than 7. 3 or serum bicarbonate level less than 15 mEq/L, and ketonemia or moderate or severe ketonuria. Overall, the most common cause of DKA is new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus. DKA can also be seen in children with T1DM and infection, other intercurrent illness, or inadequate insulin administration. Children with type 2 diabetes mellitus may also present in DKA. High-dose.
