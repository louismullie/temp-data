## Question

How to medicate a 1 year old with diarrhea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to medicate a 1-year-old with diarrhea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the child's age and baseline risk profile. Then, I should assess dehydration severity and classify it. Next, I will outline rehydration therapy with ORS, including dosing and when to use NG or IV routes. After that, I need to address nutrition during and after rehydration. Then, I will evaluate adjunctive therapies such as probiotics and zinc, and explicitly exclude harmful or contraindicated medications. Finally, I should define red flags, follow-up, and when to consider diagnostics or antibiotics, making sure each step aligns with guideline-grade sources and that I double-check any areas of uncertainty as I go.

> Let me first confirm the child's age and baseline risk. At 1 year old, this toddler is in a high-risk group for dehydration and complications from acute gastroenteritis, so I need to ensure early, structured management and close follow-up. I should also remember that most cases in this age group are viral and self-limited, which supports supportive care as the foundation rather than routine antibiotics or antimotility agents [^113X3xko] [^115UZRSB].

> Next, I should review dehydration severity using validated clinical signs and a structured approach. I need to check for general appearance, thirst, skin turgor, capillary refill, respiratory pattern, and mental status. Scales that combine signs outperform single findings, and WHO/IMCI categorization into none, some, or severe dehydration remains practical and widely used, so I will classify accordingly before choosing therapy [^114pDes8] [^1127sU6U].

> Now, for rehydration, I should confirm that reduced-osmolarity ORS is first-line for mild to moderate dehydration. Wait, let me verify the dosing: for infants and children, 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours is standard, with maintenance replacement of 60–120 mL per diarrheal stool or emesis for those under 10 kg, and 120–240 mL for those over 10 kg, continuing until dehydration is corrected. If oral intake fails, nasogastric ORS is reasonable in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately [^115oX9BJ] [^116t5QFh] [^1117Tzi7].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate to IV therapy. Severe dehydration, shock, altered mental status, or failure of ORS warrants isotonic crystalloids such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's with 20 mL/kg boluses, repeated as needed. Once perfusion and mental status normalize, I should transition to ORS to complete deficit replacement and maintain hydration, and I need to ensure that infants who are breastfeeding continue nursing throughout the illness [^115oX9BJ] [^116T8iZ1] [^115BopXz].

> I will now examine nutrition because early refeeding supports recovery and reduces stool output. I should confirm that age-appropriate usual diet can be resumed during or immediately after rehydration; lactose restriction is not routinely required, though a lactose-free diet may modestly shorten duration in some children, and prolonged food restriction is not helpful; if the child is breastfeeding, I need to ensure continued nursing throughout the episode [^115BopXz] [^114vDXPN].

> Let me consider probiotics next. I should double-check the strain and dose: ESPGHAN 2023 supports considering Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 at 1–4 × 10⁸ CFU daily for 5 days to reduce duration and severity in otherwise healthy children. IDSA 2017 also allows consideration of probiotics in immunocompetent pediatric patients, though organism selection and dosing vary, so I will preferentially choose a product with supportive pediatric data and avoid use in immunocompromised hosts due to infection risk [^1169mMQW] [^114dmvXk] [^116EwJPp].

> Now, zinc. I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. Zinc is recommended for children 6 months to 5 years in settings with high zinc deficiency or malnutrition, with typical dosing of 20 mg daily for 10–14 days; however, in children under 6 months, evidence shows no benefit and increased vomiting, so I should avoid zinc in this 1-year-old unless there is malnutrition or a high-deficiency context; moreover, lower-dose regimens are being explored to mitigate vomiting, but guideline-endorsed practice remains 20 mg in eligible older infants [^117EwKV1] [^111KYhPn] [^114mUspr].

> I should confirm what to avoid. Antimotility agents like loperamide are contraindicated in children under 18 years due to risk of ileus, toxic megacolon, and CNS depression; racecadotril has been studied in children, but it is not routinely recommended in U.S. practice and should not be used as first-line; antiemetics may facilitate ORS tolerance in older children, but IDSA suggests ondansetron primarily for those older than 4 years, so I should be cautious and reserve it for select cases with persistent vomiting impeding rehydration; antibiotics are not indicated for routine acute watery diarrhea and should be avoided in asymptomatic contacts [^113DRoeK] [^117S7csM] [^111LYwyM] [^112j4RcW].

> But wait, what if the child has bloody diarrhea or is severely ill? I should review empiric antibiotic triggers: infants under 3 months with suspected bacterial infection, ill-appearing children with dysentery features suggesting Shigella, or those with recent international travel and high fever or sepsis signs may warrant empiric therapy; when indicated in children, azithromycin is a common first choice depending on local susceptibility, while third-generation cephalosporins are preferred in infants under 3 months or with neurologic involvement; I need to ensure that any empiric therapy is de-escalated or stopped once culture results return [^117LXtPW] [^115VatGV] [^116CzgJq].

> Next, I should review red flags and follow-up. Persistent vomiting preventing oral rehydration, signs of severe dehydration, blood in stool, high fever, lethargy, or illness beyond 10–14 days should prompt urgent reassessment. If symptoms persist beyond 14 days, I need to consider noninfectious etiologies and re-evaluate fluids, nutrition, and any prior antibiotics. Routine stool testing is not required in uncomplicated cases, but I should obtain diagnostics if there is severe disease, outbreak context, immunocompromise, or nonresponse to appropriate therapy [^111pT2PA] [^117LXtPW] [^11475HQT].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention counseling is addressed. Hand hygiene, safe food and water, and rotavirus vaccination per schedule reduce morbidity. Families should be educated that most diarrhea is viral and self-limited, that ORS is the cornerstone of therapy, and that unnecessary antibiotics or antimotility agents can cause harm. Aligning expectations with evidence-based care improves adherence and outcomes [^115uPKwB] [^116q4pye] [^115ZP2zZ].

For a 1-year-old with diarrhea, **ORS is first-line** [^116t5QFh] to prevent and treat dehydration; give 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours for mild-to-moderate dehydration, then resume age-appropriate diet [^115oX9BJ] and continue breastfeeding or formula [^112a9xde]. Do not use **loperamide** [^113DRoeK] or other antimotility agents due to serious risks. Consider **probiotics** (e.g. L. reuteri DSM 17938) [^1169mMQW] to shorten illness [^114dmvXk]. Zinc is not routinely recommended for children under 6 months [^111KYhPn]; reserve antibiotics for dysentery or high-risk scenarios [^117LXtPW]. Seek urgent care for severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, blood in stool, high fever, lethargy, or poor intake [^116jwv3M].

## Hydration management

Hydration is the cornerstone of diarrhea management in young children [^117NPgwT]. The **oral rehydration solution (ORS)** is the first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate dehydration [^116t5QFh] [^116JZifh]. For infants and children, administer 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours [^115oX9BJ]. After rehydration, resume age-appropriate feeding and continue breastfeeding or formula [^111Lqkk8] [^112a9xde]. Continue breastfeeding throughout the illness [^114vDXPN]; if formula-fed, continue the usual formula [^115BopXz].

---

## Nutritional management

- **Continue feeding**: Maintain breastfeeding or formula feeding during the illness [^112a9xde] [^114vDXPN].

- **Age-appropriate diet**: Resume normal age-appropriate diet immediately after rehydration [^111Lqkk8] [^115BopXz].

- **Avoid restrictive diets**: Do not restrict lactose-containing foods unless there is documented lactose intolerance [^notfound].

---

## Medications to avoid

Certain medications are contraindicated or not recommended for young children with diarrhea:

| **Medication** | **Reason for avoidance** |
|-|-|
| Loperamide | - Serious adverse effects including respiratory depression and paralytic ileus [^notfound] |
| Antiemetics (e.g. ondansetron) | - Not recommended routinely <br/> - Use only in specific circumstances [^117S7csM] |
| Antibiotics | - Not indicated for viral diarrhea <br/> - Reserve for specific bacterial infections [^115ZP2zZ] [^117LXtPW] |

---

## Adjunctive therapies

### Probiotics

Probiotics may reduce the duration and severity of acute diarrhea in children [^114dmvXk]. The **ESPGHAN 2023 guidelines** recommend Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 at 1–4×10⁸ CFU daily for 5 days [^1169mMQW].

---

### Zinc supplementation

Zinc supplementation is recommended for children older than 6 months in areas with high zinc deficiency or malnutrition [^117EwKV1]. It is **not routinely recommended for children under 6 months** [^111KYhPn].

---

## Indications for medical evaluation

Seek medical evaluation if any of the following occur:

- Signs of severe dehydration (lethargy, sunken eyes, very slow skin pinch, inability to drink) [^113a8hNS].

- Persistent vomiting preventing oral rehydration [^1117Tzi7].

- Blood in stool or mucus [^notfound].

- High fever (> 39°C) or fever lasting > 24 hours.

- Lethargy, irritability, or poor intake [^113a8hNS].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **ORS**: First-line therapy for hydration [^116t5QFh].

- **Continue feeding**: Breastfeeding or formula feeding should continue [^112a9xde].

- **Avoid**: Loperamide and other antimotility agents [^113DRoeK].

- **Consider**: Probiotics (L. reuteri DSM 17938) [^1169mMQW].

- **Zinc**: Not routinely recommended for children under 6 months [^111KYhPn].

- **Antibiotics**: Only for specific bacterial infections [^117LXtPW].

---

The primary treatment for a 1-year-old with diarrhea is **ORS and continued feeding** [^116t5QFh] [^112a9xde]; avoid loperamide and other antimotility agents [^113DRoeK], consider probiotics [^1169mMQW], and reserve antibiotics for specific bacterial infections [^117LXtPW]. Seek medical evaluation for severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, blood in stool, high fever, or lethargy [^114NBuaN].

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^115ZP2zZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Obtaining Appropriate Treatment

When seeking care for their child's diarrheal illness, parents frequently reported a goal of symptom relief or "just ideas about how to treat [it] more effectively" (mother of a child aged 1–3 years):

Help me to give him.something or told me.if I have to do something to make him get better sooner. (Mother of a child aged 1–3 years)

Many parents confirmed their understanding that "antibiotics do not work for viruses" (mother of an infant aged < 1 year). Most parents understood the difference between a viral and bacterial etiology of infectious diarrhea and did not expect antibiotics unless their child had a bacterial infection. Several parents also mentioned concerns about antibiotic resistance and adverse effects if using antibiotics inappropriately:

I know that bacterial would be if there's a bacteria thing that really should get some help from antibiotics; viral usually just kind of has to run its course. And there's not really a whole lot medication-wise, like antivirals don't have as great of a selection, medication-wise, as antibacterial. (Mother of a child aged 1–3 years)

Parents generally believed that antibiotics would be appropriate if their child were confirmed to have a bacterial infection through a diagnostic test:

Because if he does have a bacterial infection that's causing the diarrhea, then yes, I do want an antibiotic to help with the bacterial infection. (Mother of a child aged 1–3 years)

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea remains a leading cause of mortality and illness among young children, with more than 500 000 deaths estimated to have occurred globally among children aged < 5 years in 2019. After a diarrheal episode, young children are at an increased risk of repeated episodes, malnutrition, and cognitive delays, which can have long-term consequences. In 2019, diarrhea accounted for more than 45 million disability-adjusted life-years lost in children aged < 5 years.

In the 1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) strategy to reduce child morbidity and mortality and improve growth and development in children aged < 5 years. The focus of the guidelines for treating diarrheal disease has been the prevention and treatment of dehydration and promotion of optimal nutrition during a diarrheal episode. In the health center, children are categorized by clinical findings as having none, some, or severe dehydration, and treatment is framed accordingly. Children with some dehydration receive low osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) in the health facility, while those who cannot tolerate oral fluids or have severe dehydration receive initial intravenous (IV) fluids. The home management guidlines for children who have diarrhea with no dehydration and those who have already been rehydrated at the health center recommend extra fluids (including increased breastfeeding) and ORS to prevent dehydration. All children with diarrhea should continue feeding and receive a prescription for zinc. As a component of the IMCI, the WHO Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 encourages countries to use community-based health workers to assess diarrheal disease severity using established criteria; for mildly ill children deemed appropriate for home care, their caretakers are educated on providing appropriate home care for diarrhea as described above. Public health messages in the media and routine health visits are other means for communicating this information to families.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116EwJPp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — probiotics and zinc recommendations — Probiotic preparations may be offered to reduce the symptom severity and duration in immunocompetent adults and children with infectious or antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (weak, moderate), and specific recommendations regarding selection of organism(s), route, and dosage may be found through literature and manufacturer guidance. Oral zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years of age who reside in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or who have signs of malnutrition (strong, moderate). Meta-analyses report probiotics reduced mean duration of diarrhea by 25 hours (95% confidence interval, 16–34 hours), reduced the risk of diarrhea with a duration > 4 days, and reduced stool frequency on the second day of symptoms, with overall greater efficacy when a viral etiology is identified; most trials report decreased duration and stool frequency, and no adverse events have been directly attributable in healthy recipients, though bacteremia or fungemia has occurred in critically ill or immunocompromised people. For zinc, a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found oral zinc shortened acute diarrhea in children 6 months to 5 years by 10 hours, with 27 hours reduction among children with signs of malnutrition; the effect on hospitalization and death could not be measured, treatment of persistent diarrhea was shortened by about 16 hours, vomiting was noted to be more common with zinc, and an RCT evaluating a 14-day course in US outpatients and inpatients aged 6 months to 6 years is ongoing.

When should feeding be initiated following rehydration — recommendations and evidence: Human milk feeding should be continued in infants and children throughout the diarrheal episode (strong, low), and resumption of an age-appropriate usual diet is recommended during or immediately after the rehydration process is completed (strong, low). Evidence includes that early feeding (within 12 hours of beginning rehydration) was as safe and effective as later feeding among children aged < 6 years old with acute diarrhea, and a meta-analysis of 33 trials involving children < 5 years of age found that a lactose-free diet reduced the duration of diarrhea by an average of 18 hours and reduced treatment failure by one half. Although the BRAT diet and avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for those interventions are limited, and instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours does not appear to be useful.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^112bh1kD]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Differences in definitions of acute pediatric diarrhea limit accurate quantification of disease burden, treatment coverage, associations with risk factors and health outcomes, and intervention effects. As noted previously, the use of a quantitative definition alone may not always reflect a clinically relevant disease state. Until further validation studies are performed, research settings could consider systematic use of a definition that requires "both" that a minimum frequency threshold is met (≥ 3 loose/watery stools in a 24-hour period) "and" the perception by a caregiver that such an event constitutes an aberration from normal for the individual. Such a definition emphasizes the systematic integration of both the frequency measure and the consideration of caregivers' perception of illness, a combination that, although recognized in early WHO guidelines, we found to be inconsistently applied in practice. Ultimately, a set of standardized definitions of diarrhea based on events of clinical relevance and that target potential pathways for intervention are needed for both research and programmatic evaluation. Biomarkers that represent underlying pathology, including markers of environmental enteric dysfunction, inflammation, microbial dysbiosis, as well as fluid loss, may aid in developing improved clinical definitions. In addition, studies to determine age and feeding status standardized stool frequencies among infants and young children in low-resource, high-burden settings may lead to more accurate definitions of diarrhea for specific subgroups. Universal adoption of a set of valid gold standard definitions specifically aligned with various programmatic and research goals will lead to more accurate estimates of coverage and better-informed resource prioritization.

### Gastroenteritis in children [^112w212R]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is defined as the frequent passage of unformed, liquid stools. Regardless of the cause, the mainstay of management of acute gastroenteritis is provision of adequate fluids to prevent and treat dehydration.

Methods and Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute gastroenteritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 16 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clear fluids, enteral rehydration solutions (oral or gastric), lactose-free feeds, loperamide.

### Traveler's diarrhea in the pediatric population: etiology and impact [^111ZLscJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Children who travel are at risk of developing the same, well-known illnesses that affect adult travelers. The etiology, treatment, and actual risk of these illnesses are not well defined in children. The limited amount of data available forces clinicians to extrapolate appropriate treatment for children. Recommendations for children have not been standardized. The role and judicious use of antimicrobials in the treatment of pediatric traveler's diarrhea have evolved during recent decades and will be reviewed here. The past 2 decades have seen an unprecedented, sustained growth in travel. The epidemiology related to travel medicine has evolved to describe travelers and their illnesses more specifically. The development of the field of travel medicine has led to greater understanding and improved, targeted treatment of travel-related illnesses. Most of the data available today describe traveler's diarrhea in adults. Children traveling to distant destinations from their home country have not been well studied, yet treatment parameters exist in practice and will be reviewed here.

### The applicability and efficacy of guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in outpatient children: a field-randomized trial on primary care pediatricians [^1148Sauo]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the applicability and efficacy of guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) as used by pediatricians.

Study Design

This was a national, open, randomized, controlled intervention trial. The intervention consisted of a 2-hour course based on the guidelines for management of AGE. Seventy-five randomly selected primary care pediatricians underwent training in AGE management (group A), and 75 pediatricians who were not specifically trained served as controls (group B). Each pediatrician enrolled 10 children age 1–36 months with acute-onset diarrhea. Outcome measures were guidelines applicability, duration of diarrhea, and difference in body weight between the first visit and 5–7 days later.

Results

The baseline features of the children were similar in groups A (n = 617) and B (n = 692). A total of 404 of the 617 children in group A (65.5%) were fully treated according to the guidelines, compared with 20 of the 692 children in group B (3%). Most violations involved administration of unnecessary drugs or diets. The duration of diarrhea was shorter in group A (intention-to-treat: 83.3 vs 90.9 hours; P < .001). Weight gain was marginally, but statistically significantly, higher in the children treated according to the guidelines (per-protocol analysis: +16.5 gr vs -13.5 gr; P < .05).

Conclusions

Guidelines for AGE have good applicability and excellent efficacy. Adjunctive medical interventions are associated with a longer duration of diarrhea.

### Diagnosis and management of dehydration in children [^114pDes8]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The most useful individual signs for identifying dehydration in children are prolonged capillary refill time, abnormal skin turgor, and abnormal respiratory pattern. However, clinical dehydration scales based on a combination of physical examination findings are better predictors than individual signs. Oral rehydration therapy is the preferred treatment of mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea in children. Appropriate oral rehydration therapy is as effective as intravenous fluid in managing fluid and electrolyte losses and has many advantages. Goals of oral rehydration therapy are restoration of circulating blood volume, restoration of interstitial fluid volume, and maintenance of rehydration. When rehydration is achieved, a normal age-appropriate diet should be initiated.

### Treating diarrhoeal disease in children under five: the global picture [^115UxHir]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Rates of childhood mortality due to diarrhoea remain unacceptably high and call for renewed global focus and commitment. Affordable, simple and effective diarrhoeal treatments have already been available for many years, yet a shift in international health priorities has seen coverage of recommended treatments slow to a near-standstill since 1995. This article reviews coverage of recommended childhood diarrhoeal treatments (low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc), globally and regionally, and provides an overview of the major barriers to wide-scale coverage. It is argued that to ensure smooth supply and equitable distribution of ORS and zinc, adequate financing, relevant policy changes, strong public, private and non-government organisation (NGO) collaboration, local manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, mass media awareness and campaigning, in conjunction with strong government support, are necessary for successful treatment scale-up.

### Infectious diarrhea in developed and developing countries [^116nboPy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea from gastrointestinal infection remains a common problem. In industrialized countries, management is aimed at reducing morbidity and defining groups that may benefit from further investigation. Most infectious diarrhea is self-limiting and only requires supportive management. Viral agents are increasingly recognized as causative agents of epidemic and sporadic diarrhea. In developing countries, diarrhea is a major cause of mortality in children. Oral rehydration therapy, guided by a clinical assessment of the degree of dehydration, is cheap, simple, and effective and remains the mainstay of management of infant diarrhea. Controversies focus on the optimal formulation of oral rehydration solution. A vaccine against rotavirus has the potential to save millions of lives worldwide.

### Evaluation and management of traveler's diarrhea in children [^112Y7T67]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Traveler's diarrhea is the most common travel disease in both children and adults. Adult guidelines for traveler's diarrhea have been established, but significant gaps persist in guidance for the evaluation and management of pediatric traveler's diarrhea. Adult guidelines are not necessarily applicable in children, and it is essential for clinicians to account for the differences in pediatric pathophysiology, clinical presentations, and treatment recommendations when evaluating and managing pediatric traveler's diarrhea.

### Gastroenteritis aggressive versus slow treatment for rehydration (GASTRO): a phase II rehydration trial for severe dehydration: WHO plan C versus slow rehydration [^113a8hNS]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of acute gastroenteritis occur annually in children under 5 years. In this age group, gastroenteritis is the second biggest cause of mortality (after acute respiratory illnesses). The vast majority of deaths occur in low resource settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. A large case-control study, Global Enteric Multicentre study of gastroenteritis (GEMS), conducted in Africa and Asia showed that children with moderate/severe gastroenteritis seeking care at health centres are 8.5 times more likely to die than non-gastroenteritis controls. A third of the fatalities occurred < 7 days following enrolment — indicating that current treatment strategies may not be working in practice and/or are poorly implemented.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced guidance on the management of dehydration in children with diarrhoea, largely based on expert opinion. In children (without severe malnutrition), oral rehydration solution (ORS) is recommended for children with diarrhoea with some dehydration, defined as two or more of the following: restlessness/irritability, sunken eyes, drinks eagerly/thirsty and/ or skin pinch goes back slowly (plan B). Intravenous fluids are recommended for resuscitation of children with severe dehydration, defined as the presence of two or more of the following clinical features: sunken eyes, skin pinch goes back very slowly ≥ 2 seconds (s), lethargy and/or inability to drink (under the protocol called 'plan C'), using 100 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline. This is the approximate volume estimated to have been lost in children with 10% dehydration and is recommended to be given over 3 h (or 6 h in children < 1 year). Plan C consists of two steps in which the volume and rate of infusion are different and also differ by age group (< 1 year and ≥ 1 year). In Step 1 30 ml/kg over 30 min (or 1 h if < 1 year) and then in Step 2 70 ml/kg over 2.5 h (or 5 h if < 1 year). For children presenting with shock (defined as the presence of all three of weak and fast pulse, temperature gradient and capillary refilling time > 3 s), WHO also recommends initial fluid boluses given for shock (i.e. up to 3 boluses of 20 ml/kg of normal (0.9%) saline given as rapidly as possible) followed directly by Step 2, i.e. 90–130 ml/kg. These management guidelines are recommended in resource-poor settings, despite no formal testing in a clinical trial. A review of the evidence underpinning WHO management guidelines in 2012, with regard to shock and rehydration management, focused principally on the type of fluid for resuscitation but did not consider the rate or volume.

### Gastroenteritis in children [^117NPgwT]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute gastroenteritis results from infection of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly with a virus. It is characterised by rapid onset of diarrhoea with or without vomiting, nausea, fever, and abdominal pain. Diarrhoea is defined as the frequent passage of unformed, liquid stools. Regardless of the cause, the mainstay of management of acute gastroenteritis is provision of adequate fluids to prevent and treat dehydration.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent acute gastroenteritis in children? What are the effects of treatments for acute gastroenteritis in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 20 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of: rotavirus vaccines for the prevention of gastroenteritis; enteral rehydration solutions (oral or gastric), lactose-free feeds, and loperamide for the treatment of gastroenteritis; and ondansetron for the treatment of vomiting.

### Racecadotril in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a systematic, comprehensive review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112P19Bp]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Tolerability considerations

The most objective assessment of tolerability derives from blinded studies. In this regard, six blinded studies including 326 and 312 patients in their combined racecadotril and placebo arms have reported a cumulated AE incidence of 10.4 and 10.6%, respectively (Table 3). A double-blind trial comparing racecadotril to loperamide included on 52 and 50 patients per arm, respectively, but even with these limited sample sizes detected a statistically significant difference in AE incidence (11.5% vs. 22.0%). Open add-on studies with 1480 patients receiving background treatment only and 1575 children receiving additional racecadotril reported also a low AE incidence with racecadotril (3.4%; Table 3); this was lower than in the placebo-controlled trials but only slightly higher than with background treatment. A minor increase with active treatment in an open-label study may at least partly represent observer bias. The latter conclusion is supported by the observation that open actively controlled studies including 420 and 411 patients found an identical AE incidence with both active treatments (Table 3). Thus, across all studies, racecadotril and its various comparators had a comparable AE incidence (4.4% vs. 4.1%; Table 3). Given that this is based on more than 2000 participants per arm, these are robust numbers despite the fact that 22% of studies did not report on AE incidence. A formal meta-analysis based on four placebo-controlled or add-on studies also found that AE incidence occurred similarly in the absence and presence of racecadotril (hazard ratio 0.99, confidence interval 0.67–1.46). A second meta-analysis apparently being based on a larger number of studies but reported in abstract form only reported the relative risk for experiencing an AE with racecadotril as compared to placebo to be 0.765 (confidence interval 0.611–0.962). The most recent meta-analysis, based on four studies in five distinct populations reported a risk ratio of 0.99 (confidence interval 0.73–1.34).

### Acute diarrheal disease in children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment [^112d1yoU]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

Infectious diarrhea — U.S. burden and pathogen-specific epidemiology (Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network [FoodNet]/CDC): Acute gastroenteritis accounts for an estimated 179 million outpatient visits, nearly 500 000 hospitalizations, and > 5000 deaths annually. In adults, 1.5% of all hospital discharges are coded as gastroenteritis, the lifetime risk of a hospital discharge with gastroenteritis is 1 in 8, and the estimated prevalence of diarrhea among adults in the prior month is 3%–7%. Incidence is highest among children < 5 years, while hospitalization and death are highest in persons 65 years or older. FoodNet data indicate norovirus (58%) exceeds Salmonella enterica subspecies (11%) as a cause of illness, whereas Salmonella enterica subspecies exceed norovirus for hospitalization (35% vs 28%) and death (28% vs 11%). Before rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus caused 3 million annual episodes, > 500 000 outpatient visits, 27 000 hospitalizations, and about 25 deaths; after vaccine introduction, norovirus has been associated with nearly 1 million ambulatory care visits and 14 000 hospitalizations annually. Among children < 5 years, common bacterial pathogens are Salmonella enterica subspecies (42%), Campylobacter (28%), Shigella (21%), Yersinia (5%), and E. coli O157 (3%); together these five pathogens caused 291 000 illnesses, 103 000 physician visits, 7800 hospitalizations, and 64 deaths yearly, and before rotavirus vaccine an average of 369 children aged < 5 years died from diarrhea.

### A comparison of the NIRUDAK models and WHO algorithm for dehydration assessment in older children and adults with acute diarrhoea: a prospective, observational study [^117EFG91]. The Lancet: Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhoea is the eighth leading cause of death globally and the fifth leading cause of death in low-income countries. Despite considerable progress in reducing early childhood deaths over the past 50 years, diarrhoea morbidity and mortality remains high in older children and adults with 5.7 billion cases and 1.1 million deaths globally in 2019. In many countries, epidemics of diarrhoeal disease are becoming more frequent due to the effects of climate change, conflict, and mass displacement.WHO warned of an "unprecedented" surge in cholera outbreaks in 2022, with epidemics reported in 30 countries and an overall case fatality ratio of nearly 2% — twice the acceptable limit and the highest in a decade. Although diarrhoea incidence varies by age and region, most adults and older children will experience at least one episode of diarrhoea annually. The vast majority of these episodes will follow a relatively benign course; however, approximately 5% of episodes in older children and adults, or about 285 million cases each year, will lead to moderate or severe disease requiring medical management. Evidence suggests that older people can be especially susceptible to diarrhoea morbidity and mortality.

Although antibiotics can be useful in specific situations, appropriate rehydration remains the most important management strategy for acute diarrhoea in all populations. As the severity of dehydration from acute diarrhoea can vary widely, accurately assessing and managing dehydration remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. - Patients with severe dehydration require immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids in a hospital to prevent hypovolaemic shock, electrolyte derangements, and death; those with mild to moderate dehydration can be safely managed in an ambulatory setting with oral rehydration solution alone; and those with no dehydration require only guidance for continued oral intake and expectant management at home. Accurate assessment of dehydration status can thus improve the cost-effectiveness of diarrhoea management by reducing intravenous fluid and hospital bed usage while also reducing the morbidity and mortality that results from both overtreatment and undertreatment.

### Probiotics use in childhood acute diarrhea: a web-based survey [^115k1XdX]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Goals

To evaluate practices and barriers for the use of probiotics in acute diarrhea among pediatric gastroenterologists.

Background

Probiotics have shown significant therapeutic potential in acute infectious diarrhea. However, literature data regarding practice patterns in childhood are limited.

Study

A web-based 9-item survey among 1854 pediatric gastroenterologists worldwide.

Results

Only 634 (34%) responded. Forty-one were excluded owing to incomplete data. Finally 593, USA (n = 407) and non-USA (n = 186) participants, showed: limited use in acute diarrhea (28% and 32% prospectively), prescription of a 1 strain product only by 31% and 24%, respectively, and limited utilization in ambulatory settings (43% and 51%, respectively) and in prevention of diarrhea (2.6% and 3.4%, respectively). Most participants felt there is lack of useful clinical guidelines (91% and 84%, respectively), and found this therapy effective or very effective (54% and 62%, respectively). Dosing and duration were extremely variable, the youngest age treated ranged from 2 months to 2 years of age, and adverse effects were extremely rare. These characteristics were shared by USA and by non-USA participants, with no significant differences between groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Many pediatric gastroenterologists worldwide do not use probiotics for acute diarrhea owing to lack of appropriate guidelines and/or poorly designed products. Therefore, worldwide health authorities should provide pharmaceutical and clinical guidelines for the appropriate use of probiotics in acute diarrhea of childhood.

### Update on prolonged and persistent diarrhea in children [^114xaokp]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight recent advances in our understanding of prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in children. The focus is on the contribution of these illnesses to the global burden of diarrhea, their impact on childhood growth and development, novel epidemiologic links between prolonged and persistent diarrheal episodes, and strategies for their prevention and management.

Recent Findings

Although less common than acute diarrhea, prolonged and persistent episodes of diarrhea in childhood constitute a significant portion of the global burden of diarrhea. These episodes also play a key role in the vicious cycle of childhood diarrhea and malnutrition in which undernutrition is both a risk factor and an outcome of diarrhea. Increased efforts to provide WHO-recommended zinc therapy for all children with diarrhea in developing countries will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. In children who develop persistent diarrhea, yogurt-based or amino acid-based diets may accelerate their recovery.

Summary

In addition to increased implementation of strategies already known to effectively prevent and manage acute diarrhea, further research is needed to address the recognition, prevention, and treatment of prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in resource-limited settings.

In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^112LiNgZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Advances in diagnostics have enabled the detection of more gastrointestinal pathogens, but misuse of diagnostics can lead to inappropriate antibiotic use and excess financial burdens. Ensuring appropriate use of diagnostics is crucial for optimizing patient care and promoting stewardship of health care resources.

Objective

To elicit parents' and clinicians' perspectives on expectations for care of pediatric diarrhea with a focus on diagnostic testing and to evaluate the potential for an electronic clinical decision support tool (ECDST) to improve appropriate use of diagnostics.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this qualitative study, purposeful sampling was used to recruit parents of children who had sought care for diarrhea and clinicians who care for children with diarrhea from 5 urgent care sites and 1 emergency department in Utah. Recruitment ended after achievement of inductive thematic saturation. Participants were interviewed between June 15, 2023, and January 24, 2025.

Main Outcome and Measures

Key themes on expectations for management of pediatric diarrhea and perceptions of an ECDST. Interviews elicited expectations for diagnostic testing and treatment of pediatric diarrhea as well as the perceived utility of an ECDST. Analysis followed an applied thematic analysis framework.

Results

Forty-four parents (40 [91%] female; median age, 34 years [range, 21–47 years]) and 16 clinicians (11 [69%] female; median age, 42 years [range, 29–59 years]) were interviewed. Three motivators were identified for parents to seek clinical care for a child with diarrhea: (1) reassurance, (2) understanding the cause of symptoms, and (3) appropriate treatment. Parents viewed diagnostic testing as a tool for meeting these expectations. Clinicians expressed skepticism for the value of diagnostics in informing etiology or treatment but reported that they may order diagnostics to reassure parents. Many clinicians acknowledged the benefits of an ECDST to assist with evidence-based decision-making for diagnostics and facilitate communication with families.

Conclusions and Relevance

This qualitative study identified both similarities and tensions between parents and clinicians in expectations for pediatric diarrhea care, especially pertaining to the role of diagnostics. The findings suggest that strategies such as the use of ECDSTs are needed to resolve tension in care expectations, facilitate diagnostic stewardship, and optimize care for pediatric diarrhea.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^117UnYWe]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Current Definitions and Historic Origins

We reviewed definitions from 7 clinical practice guidelines (all from the World Health Organization [WHO]), 2 programmatic documents, and 94 research publications (Supplementary Table 1). The definition of diarrhea in guidelines varied by source document and time. In 1988, the WHO published a consensus definition of diarrhea that combined a quantitative component and accounted for the normal stool patterns in breastfed infants: " usually defined as the passage of three or more liquid motions (i.e. liquid enough to take the shape of the receiving container) during a 24-hr period. However, for exclusively breast-fed infants the definition is usually based upon what the mother considers to be diarrhea ". The current WHO definition does not deviate far from this earlier definition: " the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhea, nor is the passing of loose, 'pasty' stools by breastfed babies ". World Health Organization-sponsored clinical practice recommendations for health workers use different variations of this definition, which are sometimes less specific, such as 3 or more loose stools in a 24-hour period without consideration of what is normal for the individual. Other WHO-sponsored guidelines use definitions focused on an aberration from normal for the individual without a quantitative specification, such as caregiver report of diarrhea, or passage of loose or liquid stools more frequently than is normal for the child.

The DHS use caregiver report of diarrhea within a 2-week recall period to assess the period prevalence of diarrhea. Interviewers are prompted to define diarrhea for the caregiver if he/she is unfamiliar with the term. Specifically, the 2015 Phase 7 DHS survey asks, " has (NAME) had diarrhea in the last 2 weeks? ". The instructions note that, " if a respondent is not sure what we mean by diarrhea, tell her it means three or more loose or liquid stools per day. " Likewise, diarrhea classified in the MICS is based on caregiver report of the child experiencing diarrhea in the previous 2 weeks. Similar to DHS, the interviewer training guide provides further explanation of the diarrhea definition to be used: " 3 or more loose or watery stools in the last 24 hours or more loose or watery stool than are normal for individual ". The MICS instructions also point out that breastfed babies may have multiple loose stools per day that are not diarrhea.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^111KYhPn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using either a fixed-effect or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency. Acute diarrhoeaThere is currently not enough evidence from well-conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence). In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD -11.46 hours, 95% CI -19.72 to -3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD -26.39 hours, 95% CI -36.54 to -16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence). Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, moderate certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence). Persistent diarrhoeaIn children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well-nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute diarrheal infections in adults [^116PfkuA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diarrheal infections are a common health problem globally and among both individuals in the United States and traveling to developing world countries. Multiple modalities including antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies have been used to address these common infections. Information on treatment, prevention, diagnostics, and the consequences of acute diarrhea infection has emerged and helps to inform clinical management. In this ACG Clinical Guideline, the authors present an evidence-based approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of acute diarrhea infection in both US-based and travel settings.

### Lower-dose zinc for childhood diarrhea – A randomized, multicenter trial [^114mUspr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Although we have witnessed a 90% decline in diarrhea deaths over the past four decades, diarrheal diseases remain a major public health problem. In 2018, approximately 500,000 children died from diarrhea. Most of these deaths could be avoided if children received high-quality management using the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommended care, which includes oral rehydration solutions and supplemental zinc.WHO and UNICEF currently recommend 20 mg zinc daily supplementation for 10–14 days in addition to oral rehydration solutions for the management of acute diarrhea in children. This recommendation is based on studies demonstrating that supplemental zinc results in a shorter duration of diarrhea, reduces number of stools and stool output, reduces the risk of persistent diarrhea, and may reduce the risk of subsequent illness episodes and increase weight gain. -

The currently recommended dose was based on assumptions of increased zinc losses during diarrhea and the need for additional zinc above the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for mucosal regeneration. Replication studies generally used the 20 mg zinc dose without any further dose-ranging studies. This dose substantially exceeds the RDA for zinc in infancy and early childhood (2–5 mg/day).

Zinc given orally can cause vomiting due to its strong metallic taste in saliva and gastric irritability; both of which are dose-dependent. In a meta-analysis of 11 acute diarrhea trials (n = 4438), subjects who received supplemental zinc were significantly more likely to vomit with the initial dose than with placebo (12.7% vs. 7.6%; RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.30 to 1.84). In another review, the risk of vomiting was significantly higher with zinc supplementation in children older than age 6 months (risk ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials).

Lower doses of zinc, provided they are equally effective, might have the advantage of reducing associated vomiting. We therefore performed a randomized, double-blind controlled trial comparing two lower doses of zinc with the current recommended dose in low- and middle-income country settings. We hypothesized that lower zinc doses (5 or 10 mg/day) compared with standard zinc dose (20 mg/day) would be non-inferior with respect to diarrhea treatment efficacy, but superior with respect to side effect profile (i.e. vomiting).

### Evaluation of diarrhea management appropriateness and its determinants among children under five years of age in regional and national referral hospitals in Eritrea: a cross-sectional study [^117FUYGW]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diarrhea is the leading cause of death among children under five, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the African and South-East Asian regions. Deaths from diarrhea in this age group account for about 9% of all global fatalities, translating to over 1,300 young children dying each day, many of whom could be prevented with simple treatments. For instance, dehydration from acute diarrhea can be safely and effectively treated in over 90% of cases through oral rehydration, except in severe cases.

In developing countries, including Eritrea, treatment guidelines often rely on clinical presentation due to limited laboratory services and patient overload. However, adherence to these guidelines for managing common childhood illnesses, such as diarrhea and respiratory infections, remains low globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Pocket Book of Hospital Care for Children and the Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness (IMNCI) Chart Booklet, diarrhea management requires a systematic approach to assessment, management, and prevention. The essential elements in managing a child with diarrhea include providing Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), zinc, and counseling for continued feeding. Caregivers should also receive education on feeding and hygiene practices to reduce diarrhea morbidity.

The WHO guidelines recognize Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS) therapy as the gold standard for clinically effective and cost-efficient diarrhea management. ORS is recommended for all patients, regardless of age or causative agent, unless they are comatose or severely dehydrated, as it is less expensive, equally effective, and more practical than intravenous fluids. The new ORS formulation is officially recommended by WHO and UNICEF. Furthermore, antimicrobials are reserved for cases of bloody diarrhea, severe cholera, or serious non-intestinal infections. WHO states that antibiotic treatment is necessary in only 5% of childhood diarrhea cases. Anti-diarrheal drugs and anti-emetics should be avoided in young children with acute or persistent diarrhea or dysentery, as they do not prevent dehydration or improve nutritional status, and may cause dangerous, potentially fatal side effects.

### Racecadotril in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a systematic, comprehensive review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117Us3KZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute diarrhea in children is a global health problem with an estimated 2 billion episodes each year; an estimated 1.9 million children die from the condition, mostly in developing countries, amounting to 18% of all deaths in children under the age of 5 years. Seventy eight percent of these fatalities occur in Africa and Southeast Asia. In developed countries, acute diarrhea is usually but not always a mild disease only rarely associated with mortality but with a substantial number of hospitalizations and high costs. Oral rehydration treatment (ORT) is the cornerstone of treatment of acute diarrhea and its widespread adoption has improved prognosis of the condition over the past 30 years. Several medications are available that reduce symptom severity and/or shorten duration of a diarrheic episode, including zinc, adsorptive agents such as charcoal and smectite, probiotics, anti-bacterial and anti-viral drugs, and the opioid receptor agonist loperamide, although use of the latter is contra-indicated in infants younger than 24 months and no longer recommended in recent guidelines.

### Management of diarrhea in young children in sub-saharan Africa: adherence to World Health Organization recommendations during the global enteric multisite study (2007–2011) and the vaccine impact of diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study (2015–2018) [^1173Jtim]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has some limitations. First, the case definition for GEMS and VIDA only includes medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhea; consequently, the results are not representative of case management of individuals with less severe diarrhea, who are less likely to receive ORS while at a health facility. However, moderate-to-severe diarrhea is linked to a higher risk of diarrhea-associated mortality and other sequalae, and thus appropriate management of MSD is a priority. Second, home management was only assessed in children seeking care for MSD, possibly representing a select population who were not given guideline-adherent management in the home. Third, these results are from a research setting with additional funding support and oversight, and so the generalizability to other sites is uncertain. However, we believe the presence of the GEMS and VIDA study at these sites would have a positive impact on case management and not the reverse, and thus it is possible that our study overestimated adherence to treatment guidelines, as suggested by lower estimates of ORS coverage in Bamako published elsewhere.

### Defining pediatric diarrhea in low-resource settings [^115JmLgr]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract

Differences in definitions of acute pediatric diarrhea result in variable estimates of morbidity and mortality, treatment coverage, and associations with risk factors and outcomes. We reviewed published literature and guidelines focused on acute pediatric diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries. Clinical guidelines most commonly defined diarrhea in terms of quantity of loose or watery stool with consideration of normal stool patterns, whereas research studies often relied exclusively on a quantitative definition. The most commonly used quantitative definition, ≥ 3 loose or watery stools in a 24-hour period, has been compared to gold standards of caregiver perception and visual inspection of stool, with variable agreement. Age, breast-feeding status, and setting (facility vs household-based) influence the performance of quantitative diarrhea definitions in children. Universal adoption of a set of valid gold standard definitions specifically aligned with various programmatic and research goals will lead to more accurate coverage estimates and better-informed resource prioritization.

Fluid and nutritional management of diarrhea — oral rehydration solution (ORS) dosing for mild to moderate dehydration specifies infants and children: ORS, 50–100 mL/kg over 3–4 hours; adolescents and adults (≥ 30 kg): ORS, ≥ 2 L, with maintenance replacement for infants and children of < 10 kg body weight: 60–120 mL ORS for each diarrheal stool or vomiting episode; up to ~500 mL/day, and > 10 kg body weight: 120–240 mL ORS for each diarrheal stool or vomiting episode; up to ~1 L/day, while adolescents and adults take ad libitum, up to ~2 L/day, and losses are replaced as long as diarrhea or vomiting continue; in severe dehydration, children, adolescents, and adults receive intravenous isotonic crystalloid boluses until pulse, perfusion, and mental status return to normal, with administration up to 20 mL/kg body weight, malnourished infants may benefit from smaller-volume frequent boluses of 10 mL/kg body weight, and if unable to drink, rehydration can be via nasogastric tube or intravenous 5% dextrose 0.25 normal saline with 20 mEq/L potassium chloride; breastfed infants should continue nursing, and after rehydration, maintenance fluids are resumed with an age-appropriate normal diet.

### Racecadotril in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children: a systematic, comprehensive review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112DvxC5]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

While loperamide is a standard treatment for mitigating symptoms in adults with acute diarrhea, its use in children is excluded in those aged less than 24 months and recent guidelines more generally recommend not to use loperamide in children. Of note, most racecadotril studies in acute diarrhea have included children of less than 24 months (Table 1). Our search has identified only one study comparing racecadotril with loperamide in children with acute diarrhea. That trial found loperamide and racecadotril to be equally effective for the primary endpoint, number of diarrheic stools until recovery, and for secondary endpoints, but significantly more children in the loperamide group required concomitant medications to reach this goal. While it may be argued that loperamide may have been under-dosed in that study (0.03 mg/kg as compared to regular dose of 0.04 mg/kg), the loperamide dose was sufficient to cause a considerable incidence of AEs. Moreover, the finding of comparable efficacy of loperamide and racecadotril is in line with many direct comparative trials in adults. Thus, in contrast to loperamide, there is a solid database supporting the use of racecadotril in children of all ages including those aged less than 24 months. In an age group where both treatments can be used, they exhibit similarly efficacy, as they did in many studies in adults.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

A large gap exists between diarrheal treatment recommendations and their application by healthcare workers and caregivers in the community. Opportunities exist for improvement in case management for children with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in low-resource settings, and these improvements could reduce mortality and malnutrition. Site-specific sensitization interventions may be needed to improve adherence to WHO diarrhea management guidelines. Implementation-based interventions should consider local knowledge, behavior, and infrastructure.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^115vYhcz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, m RCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data collection and analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses (using either a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

Thirty‐three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency.

Acute diarrhoea

There is currently not enough evidence from well‐conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence).

In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD −11.46 hours, 95% CI −19.72 to −3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD −26.39 hours, 95% CI −36.54 to −16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence).

Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI −4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, low certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, low certainty evidence).

None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Persistent diarrhoea

In children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD −15.84 hours, 95% CI −25.43 to −6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well‐nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality — The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged < 18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality < 250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

### Diarrhea and your child… [^115UZRSB]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

When a child's bowel pattern changes suddenly to a loose and watery bowel movement and occurs more often than usual, he or she has diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common symptom of illness in young children. In the United States, children younger than 4 years may have diarrhea 1 or 2 times each year. Diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Here is information from the American Academy of Pediatrics about acute diarrhea, as well as how to manage the symptoms, and how to help reduce your child's chances of getting diarrhea. Most diarrhea in children is caused by viruses. Diarrhea can also be caused by bacteria, parasites, changes in diet, problems with the intestines, and the use of some medicines. Most of the time mild.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^1137fNSA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhoea causes around two million child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation could help reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea, and is recommended by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Strategy

In November 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing oral zinc supplementation (≥ 5 mg/day for any duration) with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. Diarrhoea duration and severity were the primary outcomes. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using the fixed- or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.

Main Results

Eighteen trials enrolling 6165 participants met our inclusion criteria. In acute diarrhoea, zinc resulted in a shorter diarrhoea duration (MD -12.27 h, 95% CI -23.02 to -1.52 h; 2741 children, 9 trials), and less diarrhoea at day three (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; 1073 children, 2 trials), day five (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95; 346 children, 2 trials), and day seven (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98; 4087 children, 7 trials). The four trials (1458 children) that reported on diarrhoea severity used different units and time points, and the effect of zinc was less clear. Subgroup analyses by age (trials with only children aged less than six months) showed no benefit with zinc. Subgroup analyses by nutritional status, geographical region, background zinc deficiency, zinc type, and study setting did not affect the results' significance. Zinc also reduced the duration of persistent diarrhoea (MD -15.84 h, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24 h; 529 children, 5 trials). Few trials reported on severity, and results were inconsistent. No trial reported serious adverse events, but vomiting was more common in zinc-treated children with acute diarrhoea (RR 1.71, 95% 1.27 to 2.30; 4727 children, 8 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where diarrhoea is an important cause of child mortality, research evidence shows zinc is clearly of benefit in children aged six months or more.

Main Results

Twenty-four trials, enrolling 9128 children, met our inclusion criteria. The majority of the data is from Asia, from countries at high risk of zinc deficiency, and may not be applicable elsewhere. Acute diarrhoea. There is currently not enough evidence from well conducted randomized controlled trials to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or hospitalization (very low quality evidence). In children aged greater than six months with acute diarrhoea, zinc supplementation may shorten the duration of diarrhoea by around 10 hours (MD -10.44 hours, 95% CI -21.13 to 0.25; 2175 children, six trials, low quality evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, six trials, moderate quality evidence). In children with signs of moderate malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around 27 hours (MD -26.98 hours, 95% CI -14.62 to -39.34; 336 children, three trials, high quality evidence). Conversely, In children aged less than six months, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on mean diarrhoea duration (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, two trials, low quality evidence), and may even increase the proportion of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, one trial, moderate quality evidence). No trials reported serious adverse events, but zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea causes vomiting in both age groups (RR 1.59, 95% 1.27 to 1.99; 5189 children, 10 trials, high quality evidence). Persistent diarrhoea. In children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, five trials, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of moderate malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children below six months of age.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea — adults and children: In immunocompetent children and adults, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bloody diarrhea while waiting for results of investigations is not recommended (strong, low), except for infants < 3 months of age with suspicion of a bacterial etiology; ill immunocompetent people with fever documented in a medical setting, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and bacillary dysentery presumptively due to Shigella; and people who have recently travelled internationally with body temperatures ≥ 38.5°C and/or signs of sepsis (weak, low). When indicated, the empiric antimicrobial therapy in adults should be either a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin, or azithromycin, depending on the local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate), and empiric therapy for children includes a third-generation cephalosporin for infants < 3 months of age and others with neurologic involvement, or azithromycin, depending on local susceptibility patterns and travel history (strong, moderate). Empiric antibacterial treatment should be considered in immunocompromised people with severe illness and bloody diarrhea (strong, low), and asymptomatic contacts of people with bloody diarrhea should not be offered empiric treatment but should be advised to follow appropriate infection prevention and control measures (strong, moderate).

### Examining the use of oral rehydration salts and other oral rehydration therapy for childhood diarrhea in Kenya [^113XXFjJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Reductions in the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) in sub-Saharan Africa highlight the need to examine caregiver perceptions of ORT during diarrheal episodes. Qualitative research involving group discussions with childcare providers and in-depth interviews with 45 caregivers of children < 5 years of age who had experienced diarrhea was conducted in one rural and urban site in Kenya during July-December 2007. Diarrhea was considered a dangerous condition that can kill young children. Caregivers preferred to treat diarrhea with Western drugs believed to be more effective in stopping diarrhea than ORT. Inconsistent recommendations from health workers regarding use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) caused confusion about when ORS is appropriate and whether it requires a medical prescription. In the rural community, causal explanations about diarrhea, beliefs in herbal remedies, cost, and distance to health facilities presented additional barriers to ORS use. Health communication is needed to clarify the function of ORT in preventing dehydration.

### Factors associated with the duration of moderate-to-severe diarrhea among children in rural Western Kenya enrolled in the global enteric multicenter study, 2008–2012 [^113qJgTi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Diarrheal disease is a leading cause of death among young children worldwide. As rates of acute diarrhea (AD; 1–6 days duration) have decreased, persistent diarrhea (PD; > 14 days duration) accounts for a greater proportion of the diarrheal disease burden. We describe factors associated with the duration of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in Kenyan children < 5 years old enrolled in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study. We found 587 (58%) children experienced AD, 360 (35%) had prolonged acute diarrhea (ProAD; 7–13 days duration), and 73 (7%) had PD. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors associated with diarrheal duration. Risk factors independently associated with longer diarrheal duration included infection with Cryptosporidium (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.868, P = 0.035), using an unimproved drinking water source (HR: 0.87, P = 0.035), and being stunted at enrollment (HR: 0.026, P < 0.0001). Diarrheal illness of extended duration appears to be multifactorial; given its association with adverse health and development outcomes, effective strategies should be implemented to reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal illness. Effective treatments for Cryptosporidium should be identified, interventions to improve drinking water are imperative, and nutrition should be improved through exclusive breastfeeding in infants ≤ 6 months and appropriate continued feeding practices for ill children.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111ndPHx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

Clostridium difficile epidemiology and testing considerations — In children, asymptomatic colonization is common and complicates interpretation, with a "high frequency (up to 70%) of asymptomatic colonization among healthy newborns", and rates that "gradually fall to adult levels… by about 2 years of age", making results in "an individual child < 2 years of age" uncertain. In hospitals, "C. difficile is more prevalent in diarrheal stools obtained > 72 hours after admission", and, because asymptomatic carriage is recognized, "patients without diarrhea should not be tested or treated". C. difficile "should be considered in patients with diarrhea occurring in hospitals".

### Parent and clinician perspectives on diagnostic testing for children with diarrhea: a qualitative study [^115wUiRv]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Understanding the Etiology

Understanding the etiology of the diarrheal illness was a priority for most parents. Many believed that diagnostic testing to identify the specific etiology of the illness would be useful. Parents indicated that knowing the etiology would offer desired reassurance and potentially inform treatment decisions:

I think a diagnostic test would bring more comfort, because you would know exactly what's going on. And if it's correct. If we wanted to just guess, I could Google it. (Father of a child aged 1–3 years)

Some parents expressed concern that without a diagnostic test, clinicians were merely speculating about the etiology and therefore may not have been using the most appropriate treatment:

I'd rather have a definitive test. Now what the procedure with the test is, I'm not sure. But I'd rather.have a test done just to pinpoint it and narrow down instead of just winging it. (Father of a child aged 1–3 years)

When a visit did not include diagnostic testing to assess the etiology of diarrhea, some parents expressed frustration:

I was hoping they would.do a test and kind of figure out what it was. But like, honestly,.going there was pointless, because we got.no answers. (Mother of a child aged 1–3 years)

However, other parents were satisfied with a clinician's knowledge and reassurance without further testing:

I think it's okay if the doctor is just saying it's a virus, like I don't need a super definitive answer as long as they are sure. (Mother of a child aged > 3 years)

### Universal recommendations for the management of acute diarrhea in nonmalnourished children [^112N7wAv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite a substantial consistency in recommendations for the management of children with acute gastroenteritis (AGE), a high variability in clinical practice and a high rate of inappropriate medical interventions persist in both developing and developed countries. The aim of this study was to develop a set of clinical recommendations for the management of nonseverely malnourished children with AGE to be applied worldwide.

Methods

The Federation of International Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (FISPGHAN) Working Group (WG) selected care protocols on the management of acute diarrhea in infants and children aged between 1 month and 18 years. The WG used a 3-step approach consisting of: systematic review and comparison of published guidelines, agreement on draft recommendations using Delphi methodology, and external peer-review and validation of recommendations.

Results

A core of recommendations including definition, diagnosis, nutritional management, and active treatment of AGE was developed with an overall agreement of 91% (range 80%-96%). A total of 28 world experts in pediatric gastroenterology and emergency medicine successively validated the set of 23 recommendations with an agreement of 87% (range 83%-95%). Recommendations on the use of antidiarrheal drugs and antiemetics received the lowest level of agreement and need to be tailored at local level. Oral rehydration and probiotics were the only treatments recommended.

Conclusions

Universal recommendations to assist health care practitioners in managing children with AGE may improve practitioners' compliance with guidelines, reduce inappropriate interventions, and significantly impact clinical outcome and health care-associated costs.

RESULTS

General Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized With Diarrhea

Between May 2014 and April 2016, a total of 3166 hospitalized children meeting the study criteria were recruited at the 3 study hospitals. The majority of patients were male (1945 of 3166; 61.4%), with ages ranging from 1 month to 15 years (median age, 10 months; interquartile range [IQR], 6.5–16.7 months). Patients were hospitalized for a median of 5 days (IQR, 3–7 days) with 88.7% (2808 of 3166) of patients showing improvement or resolving symptoms within 3 days of enrollment.

Patients were segregated into 3 diarrheal types: acute nonbloody (1775 of 3166; 56.1%), acute bloody (1096 of 3166; 34.6%), or persistent (295 of 3166; 9.3%) (Table 1). Owing to the clinical complexity of persistent diarrhea, statistical comparisons were conducted between the 2 acute diarrhea groups only. Patients with nonbloody diarrhea were more likely to experience vomiting than those with bloody diarrhea (66.8% vs 38.7%; p = 0.001) and dehydration (15.0% vs 2.6%, respectively; p = 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of patients with bloody diarrhea experienced abdominal pain (26.4% vs 19.3% of those with nonbloody diarrhea; p = 0.001). Systemic C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were significantly higher in patients with bloody than in those with nonbloody diarrhea (21.0 [IQR, 6.7–40.2] vs 7.0 [4.0–24.0] mg/L; P < .001).

### Acute gastroenteritis. the COMMENT working group on acute diarrhea: where are we now and where are we going? [^116EFcA7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Recently, the Consensus Group on Outcome Measures Made in Paediatric Enteral Nutrition Clinical Trials (COMMENT) was established. COMMENT agreed that consensus is needed on a core set of outcomes with agreed-upon definitions on what should be measured and reported in nutritional trials. To achieve this goal, 6 working groups were set up, including the working group on Acute Diarrhea. The following 4 steps are needed to complete the work: (1) to identify how outcomes related to acute diarrhea are reported; (2) to decide on the methodology for determining which outcomes to measure in clinical trials; (3) to develop a core outcome set for clinical trials performed in subjects with acute diarrhea; and (4) to determine how to measure the outcomes in the core set. The aim of this paper is to summarize what has been achieved and implemented so far, what is currently being done, and what we aim to achieve in the not so distant future.
