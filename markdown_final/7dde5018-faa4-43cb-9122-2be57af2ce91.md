## Question

Back of Knee pop sound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a "pop" at the back of the knee, with transparent step-by-step thinking and verification of each inference along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about characterizing the pop by timing, pain, swelling, instability, and activity. Then, I should verify which posterior knee structures most plausibly generate a pop and why. Next, I will consider high-priority differentials such as hamstring avulsion, meniscal root pathology, proximal tibiofibular joint subluxation, and cyst rupture. After that, I should review a targeted history, physical exam, and imaging algorithm, and finally outline management pathways for likely diagnoses and follow-up checkpoints, making sure each step is supported by the best available guidance and studies.

> Let me first confirm the core characterization questions I must ask, because the significance of a "pop" hinges on context: Was there an acute twisting or sprinting injury, did the pop coincide with immediate pain or a fall, did swelling occur within hours, and was there an inability to bear weight or instability, as these features change the pretest probabilities for ligamentous or meniscal injuries and fractures. I need to ensure I capture mechanism, pain localization, swelling timeline, mechanical symptoms, and red flags such as fever or calf pain to avoid missing infection or DVT [^111ezFBM] [^112WwUqr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought the pop was most likely an ACL tear because "popping at injury" is classic for ACL, but wait, the complaint specifies the pop is at the back of the knee, so posterior etiologies such as PCL, meniscal root, hamstring avulsion, or proximal tibiofibular joint subluxation should rise on the list. The ACL sits anterior and typically produces anterior instability and hemarthrosis rather than isolated posterior pain, so I should correct that assumption and prioritize posterior structures accordingly [^115xM2jT] [^112EwKy8].

> Next, I should review the anatomic sources in the posterior knee that can plausibly generate a pop. The semimembranosus and semitendinosus tendons and their tibial insertions, the popliteus complex, the biceps femoris at the fibular head, the medial and lateral gastrocnemius origins, meniscal roots and posterior horn mechanics, the proximal tibiofibular joint capsule, and the Baker's cyst are the principal candidates. A pop may reflect tendon avulsion, meniscal root disruption, joint subluxation, cyst rupture, or even crepitus from degenerative changes, and I need to check which of these fit the patient's age, activity, and timing profile [^113Tqum2] [^112wC7y8] [^1115K6VU] [^112oebL3].

> I will now examine high-priority traumatic differentials. A distal semitendinosus avulsion often presents with a pop, sudden posterior-medial thigh pain, and a palpable defect near the medial tibia during sprinting or hyperextension, with MRI confirming the diagnosis. Wait, I almost conflated semitendinosus and semimembranosus origins — let me verify — semitendinosus inserts at the medial tibia, so the lump and pain are medial-posterior rather than directly popliteal, which aligns with the reported 78% distal avulsion pattern in recent series. I should confirm the exam by palpating for a gap and testing resisted knee flexion [^111VjjYt] [^117TmjAd].

> Another key traumatic cause is a meniscal root tear of the medial meniscus, where patients may describe a painful pop during squatting or stair ascent, often with posterior knee pain and mechanical symptoms. I need to check for bone cysts at the root attachment because their presence, while insensitive, is highly specific and correlates with longer symptom duration. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, and I should correlate with mechanical exam maneuvers such as McMurray and Thessaly, keeping in mind that posterior root tears impair hoop tension and accelerate OA progression if untreated [^113Zh2a2] [^115qj5Zs] [^1115K6VU].

> But wait, what if the pop is lateral-posterior and positional? Proximal tibiofibular joint instability or subluxation can produce popping and catching, especially in athletes with twisting mechanisms, and may mimic lateral meniscal pathology. I should double-check for a palpable prominence laterally and reproduce symptoms with dynamic testing, and consider dynamic sonography or fluoroscopy if clinical suspicion remains high after standard imaging is unrevealing [^112oebL3] [^113bFjYY].

> I should also consider a Baker's cyst rupture in patients with underlying OA or inflammatory arthritis who develop sudden posterior calf pain and swelling after a pop. I need to ensure I do not misattribute this to DVT by examining for a communicating cyst and calf ecchymosis, and I should use ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and guide management if necessary [^notfound].

> Let me consider pediatric and adolescent variants briefly. A discoid meniscus can present with the classic "popping knee" syndrome, often lateral, with clicking or popping during flexion-extension. If the patient is young and has mechanical symptoms without a clear trauma, I should keep discoid meniscus in mind and obtain MRI to define morphology and look for tears or instability patterns [^116S8yos].

> Next, I should review the targeted history elements that sharpen the differential. Timing relative to injury, activity at onset, exact pain location, immediate swelling, mechanical symptoms such as locking or giving way, prior injuries or surgeries, and systemic features guide pretest probabilities. For example, a pop with immediate swelling within 0–12 hours raises concern for internal derangement or ligamentous injury, whereas delayed swelling favors a degenerative process. I should confirm whether the patient felt unstable or fell at the time of the pop [^111ezFBM] [^112EwKy8].

> I will now examine the focused physical exam. I need to inspect for ecchymosis, deformity, or effusion, palpate along the joint lines, over the hamstring insertions, the popliteus, and the proximal tibiofibular joint, and perform McMurray, Thessaly, Lachman, posterior drawer, and varus-valgus stress tests. I should also palpate the medial tibial insertion for a semitendinosus gap and test resisted knee flexion to localize pain. Let me verify that a positive McMurray or Thessaly supports meniscal pathology, while posterior drawer supports PCL injury, and dynamic maneuvers can reproduce tibiofibular subluxation or snapping pes if present [^112WwUqr] [^113Tqum2] [^1117sbWP].

> Now, I need to check the imaging strategy. For acute trauma with inability to bear weight, focal tenderness, or effusion, weight-bearing radiographs are indicated to exclude fracture or dislocation. MRI is the modality of choice when internal derangement is suspected, particularly for meniscal root tears, hamstring avulsions, and cysts. Dynamic ultrasound is valuable for snapping syndromes, tibiofibular instability, and guided interventions. I should confirm that routine radiographs are not needed for atraumatic chronic knee pain without focal findings, to avoid unnecessary radiation [^1173JbUm] [^117ERmUi] [^113Zh2a2] [^11736s2W].

> If the working diagnosis is semitendinosus avulsion, I should confirm the plan. Most acute complete avulsions benefit from early surgical repair within about two weeks to optimize outcomes and minimize adhesions, whereas partial tears may be managed conservatively with protected weight bearing, bracing, and progressive rehabilitation. I need to ensure timely referral to sports medicine or orthopedic surgery for operative decision-making [^111VjjYt].

> If a meniscal root tear is suspected, I should verify indications for repair. Active patients with acute traumatic root tears or chronic symptomatic tears without advanced OA are candidates for transosseous repair, which has superior outcomes to meniscectomy. I should also counsel that delaying treatment risks cartilage degeneration and that rehabilitation should limit early flexion and tibial rotation to protect the repair, aligning with biomechanical guidance on load modulation [^113Zh2a2] [^112KdwPb].

> If proximal tibiofibular joint instability is identified, I should confirm that initial management is often conservative with activity modification, bracing, and strengthening. For chronic instability or persistent symptoms, surgical stabilization may be considered, and I should coordinate care with a sports knee specialist [^112oebL3].

> If a Baker's cyst rupture is diagnosed, I should double-check that management is typically conservative with rest, ice, compression, elevation, and NSAIDs, reserving aspiration or injection for refractory cases and ensuring the underlying intra-articular pathology is addressed to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and safety netting. I should reassess pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms within 1–2 weeks, escalate to MRI if symptoms persist or worsen, and screen for complications such as DVT when calf pain and swelling are present. I should also educate the patient that a pop without pain or swelling may be benign crepitus, but persistent mechanical symptoms warrant further evaluation to prevent missed internal derangement [^113bFjYY].

A pop at the back of the knee is most often due to **benign causes** such as cavitation, tendon snapping, or minor meniscal movement, especially if painless and not associated with swelling or instability [^11736s2W]. However, a painful pop with swelling, instability, or locking suggests **serious injury** — such as a posterior cruciate ligament tear, meniscal root tear, or hamstring rupture — and **requires urgent evaluation** [^115xM2jT] [^113Zh2a2] [^111VjjYt]. Persistent or recurrent popping with symptoms warrants **clinical assessment and imaging** (MRI) to rule out structural pathology and guide management [^111ezFBM] [^116S8yos].

---

## Common causes of popping at the back of the knee

### Benign causes

- **Cavitation**: Gas bubble release in the joint during movement, causing a painless pop [^notfound].
- **Tendon snapping**: Semimembranosus, semitendinosus, or biceps femoris tendons snapping over bony prominences, often painless [^notfound].
- **Minor meniscal movement**: Small meniscal shifts or folds causing occasional popping without significant pathology [^notfound].

---

### Pathological causes

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Associated symptoms** |
|-|-|-|
| Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury | - Tear or sprain of the PCL <br/> - Often from dashboard injury or hyperextension | - Pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Instability <br/> - Pop at injury [^112EwKy8] |
| Meniscal root tear | - Detachment of meniscal root <br/> - Disrupts hoop stresses | - Posterior knee pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Locking <br/> - Popping during squatting or stairs [^113Zh2a2] |
| Hamstring rupture | - Complete or partial tear of distal hamstring tendons | - Sharp pain <br/> - Pop <br/> - Bruising <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Lump in posterior thigh [^111VjjYt] |
| Baker's cyst rupture | - Rupture of synovial cyst behind knee | - Sudden pain <br/> - Swelling <br/> - Pop sensation [^notfound] |
| Proximal tibiofibular joint instability | - Subluxation or dislocation of proximal tibiofibular joint | - Lateral knee pain <br/> - Instability <br/> - Popping [^112oebL3] |

## Clinical significance of popping at the back of the knee

The clinical significance depends on **associated symptoms and the clinical context**:

- **Painless popping**: Usually benign, often due to cavitation or tendon snapping; no immediate concern unless persistent or progressive [^1117sbWP] [^114bPzZu].
- **Painful popping with swelling or instability**: Suggests significant injury (e.g. PCL tear, meniscal root tear, hamstring rupture); requires urgent evaluation and management [^115xM2jT] [^113Zh2a2] [^111VjjYt].
- **Recurrent popping with mechanical symptoms**: Indicates underlying structural abnormality (e.g. meniscal tear, ligamentous instability); warrants further investigation and possible intervention [^1115K6VU].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include a **focused history** covering the mechanism of injury, onset, associated symptoms (pain, swelling, instability, locking), and activity level [^111ezFBM]. The **physical examination** should assess joint effusion, range of motion, ligamentous stability (Lachman, posterior drawer, varus/valgus stress), and palpation of posterior structures (hamstrings, popliteus, joint lines) [^112WwUqr].

---

### Imaging studies

- **MRI**: Gold standard for evaluating soft tissue injuries, meniscal pathology, ligamentous injuries, and cystic lesions [^113Zh2a2].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for dynamic assessment of tendon snapping, cystic lesions, and guided interventions [^11736s2W].
- **Radiographs**: Indicated for acute trauma, suspected fractures, or degenerative changes [^117ERmUi].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause and severity**:

- **Conservative management**: Rest, ice, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and activity modification for minor injuries or benign causes [^113ZcVJG].
- **Surgical intervention**: Indicated for significant ligamentous injuries, meniscal root tears, hamstring ruptures, or persistent symptomatic lesions [^113Zh2a2] [^111VjjYt].
- **Rehabilitation**: Essential for recovery, focusing on strength, flexibility, and proprioception to prevent recurrence [^117TmjAd].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek **medical attention** if:

- Painful popping with swelling or instability
- Inability to bear weight or significant functional impairment
- Recurrent popping with mechanical symptoms (locking, catching)
- Signs of infection (fever, redness, warmth) or vascular compromise

---

A pop at the back of the knee is **usually benign** if painless, but painful popping with swelling or instability suggests serious injury and needs **urgent evaluation**. Persistent or recurrent popping with symptoms warrants **clinical assessment and imaging** to rule out structural pathology and guide management.

### Bone cysts at the meniscal attachment are associated with a longer symptom duration among patients with arthroscopically treated medial meniscus posterior root tear [^115qj5Zs]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To elucidate the features of bone cysts at attachment sites of medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRTs).

Methods

Knees treated using arthroscopic surgery for MMPRT between 2015 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients without a memory of onset (painful popping), prior knee surgeries, concomitant ligament or meniscus injuries or fractures were excluded. Duration from onset to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and type of tear were evaluated during arthroscopy. On radiography, meniscus signs (cleft/ghost/giraffe neck), bone cysts at the attachment site of the MMPRT and posterior shiny-corner lesions (PSCLs; bone marrow lesions on the meniscal-covered portion of the posterior tibial plateau) were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the bone cysts were assessed by comparison with matched patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery for medial meniscus posterior horn tear. In addition, subgroups (cyst-positive/cyst-negative) among patients with MMPRT were created to assess the features of bone cysts.

Results

A total of 275 patients with MMPRT and 275 matched patients with posterior horn tears were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of bone cysts for MMPRT in this study were 22.2% and 98.6%, respectively. Among the 275 knees with MMPRT, compared with the cyst-negative group, the cyst-positive group had a longer duration from onset to MRI (12.9 ± 13.1 vs. 8.3 ± 10.9 weeks, respectively, p = 0.025) and reduced occurrence of PSCLs (18.0% vs. 42.0%, respectively, p = 0.031).

Conclusion

The occurrence of bone cysts at the attachment site was helpful for the accurate diagnosis of MMPRT and related to longer duration from onset to MRI and reduced PSCLs.

### Patellofemoral pain [^112aS254]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). High credibility.

Patellofemoral pain (PFP) medical screening and referral — Medical screening incorporates the findings of the history and physical examination to determine whether the patient's symptoms originate from a condition that requires referral to another health care provider, and prior to diagnosing a person with PFP, it is necessary to rule out all other possible medical conditions. Clinicians should recognize the key signs and symptoms associated with serious pathological knee conditions, continually screen for the presence of these conditions throughout treatment, and immediately initiate referral to the appropriate medical practitioner when a potentially serious medical condition is suspected, and medical conditions for which physical therapy is not indicated must be considered as possible etiologies of a patient's symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^113HWag5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Table 5 — Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests — provides bedside methods to help distinguish conductive hearing loss (CHL) from sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and combining findings from both tests will aid greatly in making this distinction. For the Weber test, strike the tuning fork on a covered elbow or knee, not on a hard metallic or wooden surface, then place a vibrating tuning fork (256 or 512 Hz) at the midline of the forehead or on maxillary teeth; if the sound lateralizes to one ear, there is CHL in that ear or SNHL in the opposite ear. For the Rinne test, place a vibrating tuning fork (256 or 512 Hz) over the mastoid bone, then move it to the entrance of the ear canal; if the sound is heard better by bone conduction in the same ear, there is CHL in that ear, and if heard better by bone conduction in the opposite ear, there is SNHL in the test ear.

### International urogynecological consultation chapter 2.2: imaging in the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse [^117LSJdx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion Points

The intended use of imaging test can be diagnosis, screening, staging, monitoring, surveillance, prediction, or prognosis. This narrative review focuses on the diagnostic value of different imaging modalities in POP. Our working group identified a significant gap in the current literature surrounding imaging use. There is a lack of well-designed studies with clear definitions of reference standard defining POP as disease. Largely, it is stemming from the lack of consensus of what defines "clinically significant POP". Imaging techniques appear to perform moderately well in the diagnosis of advanced POP stages, but those POP cases are easily diagnosed on pelvic examination. An ideal study would be a large cohort focusing on low-grade POP, where the "clinically significant prolapse" is diagnosed as a combination of pelvic examination evidence of POP and the presence of symptoms determined by validated questionnaires. The studies with a similar design will need to be repeated in diverse patient populations. Only after this evidence is obtained can we gain a better insight into the diagnostic abilities of different imaging modalities.

### Review for the generalist: evaluation of anterior knee pain [^112XRXEE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Synovial plica

The knee has normal synovial folds that are residual embryonic remnants persisting from when the knee cavity was a septated structure. Occasionally, pathological conditions occur within the plica(e) due to local synovitis caused by acute, direct or repetitive microtrauma. The inflamed plica can become trapped between the patella and the femoral condyle. Impingement can cause further inflammation and fibrosis with abrasion of the femoral condyle, changes in the articular surface and reactive changes in the subchondral bone. Diagnosis is clinical; common complaints are of medial knee pain worsened with running, stair climbing or squatting accompanied by snapping and catching during flexion (usually flexion arc 30–70 degrees). On examination the medial patellar retinaculum from the patella to the medial femoral condyle or anteromedial joint line may be tender. The plica may be palpable as a thickened band that is tender when pressed against the edge of the condyle. Management includes patellar mobilization and massage, flexibility exercises for the hamstrings, quadriceps and gastrocnemius, and anti-inflammatory medications with surgical removal of the plica reserved for recalcitrant symptoms.

Quadriceps tendinopathy

Pain arising at the quadriceps tendon attachment to the patella is uncommon in the pediatric population. On examination there is tenderness at the superior margin of the patella and pain is exacerbated by resisted quadriceps contraction. Treatment includes local massage at the site of pain in addition to the general principles used for patellar tendinopathy.

Bipartite patella

The patella ossifies between 3 and 5 years of age with gradual coalescence of multiple ossification centers. Accessory ossification centres often occur; the most common location is the superolateral patella. A bipartite patella is usually an asymptomatic, incidental radiographic finding. Radiographs show regular smooth fragment margins with no evidence of soft tissue swelling, differentiating the lesion from acute fracture. Occasionally bipartite patella may cause anterior knee pain. Clinically there is soft tissue tenderness at the superolateral pole of the patella. Initial treatment is conservative with modified activity and local flexibility and strengthening exercises. Surgical options include excision or fixation of the bipartite patella or release of the vastus lateralis insertion.

Stress fracture of the patella

Stress fractures of the patella are rare causes of anterior knee pain. In the pediatric population, it is reported in jumping athletes who present with intense localized pain with possible overlying soft tissue swelling. Radiographs will detect chronic stress reaction; early lesions are best detected by radionucleotide bone scan.

### American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^115xM2jT]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guideline — history and physical for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury — states that a relevant history should be obtained, and a focused musculoskeletal exam of the lower extremities should be performed when assessing for an ACL injury, with Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Relevant history is important for diagnosing ACL injuries and concomitant pathology and should include at a minimum the mechanism and date of injury, history of hearing/feeling a popping sensation, ability to bear weight, ability to return to play, history of mechanical symptoms of locking or catching, localization of pain if possible, and any history of prior knee injuries; history of hearing/feeling a popping sensation and associated swelling is important in predicting an ACL injury. Appropriate physical exam is important in diagnosing ACL injuries and concomitant pathology and should also be performed including at a minimum: a neurovascular exam of the lower extremity with documentation of both distal perfusion and tibial/peroneal nerve function, assessment of varus and valgus laxity at 0 and 30 degrees of flexion, dial testing at 30 and 90 degrees of flexion, and evaluation of anterior-posterior laxity with Lachman's and anterior drawer and rotational laxity with pivot shift and active buckling sign tests. A thorough history and physical exam will assist the practitioner in prompt and accurate diagnosis of ACL injuries and concomitant pathology, and there are no known harms associated with appropriate implementation of this recommendation.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of pelvic floor dysfunction-joint recommendations of the ESUR and ESGAR pelvic floor working group [^11273Hwm]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Consensus was reached for 88% of 82 items and the recommendations regarding indication, patient preparation, imaging protocol, criteria for MRI assessment and reporting were constructed from these.

Indications for MR imaging of pelvic floor dysfunction

The indications for MR imaging of the pelvic floor that scored the highest number of agreement among the group members and the literature review are rectal outlet obstruction (92% agreed upon), rectocele (92% agreed upon), recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) (85% agreed upon), enterocele (85% agreed upon) and dyssynergic defecation (anismus)(85% agreed upon) (Table 1).

POP pelvic organ prolapse

* The indications of MRI in each compartment are listed in a descending order from those that scored the highest number of agreement among both the group members and the literature review

 Number of group members n = 13

Patients' preparation and hardware requirements

Full patients' history of pelvic floor disorder should be taken prior to scanning (consensus 100%). The patient should be examined at least in a 1.5 T MRI unit with a phased array coil, as this is the most agreed-upon field strength (consensus 100%). The patient is examined in the supine position with the knees elevated (e.g. on a pillow with firm consistency) as this was found to facilitate straining and evacuation (consensus 100%). The coil should be centered low on the pelvis to ensure complete visualization of prolapsed organs. The bladder should be moderately filled, therefore voiding 2 hours before the examination is recommended (consensus 100%).

Prior to the examination the patient should be trained on how to correctly perform the dynamic phases of the examination and the evacuation phase (consensus 100%). The patient is instructed to squeeze as if trying to prevent the escape of urine or feces and hold this position for the duration of the sequence. For maximum straining, the patient is instructed to bear down as much as she/he could, as though she/he is constipated and is trying to defecate. For the evacuation phase, the patient should be instructed to repeat the evacuation process until the rectum is emptied.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^114bWFk3]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) patient history — Eliciting prolapse-related symptoms and their quality-of-life impact is the primary goal, and a patient reporting vaginal bulge that she can see or palpate is the most specific symptom for POP observed on examination. A detailed history of vaginal symptoms to be elicited includes vaginal bulging, pelvic pressure and discomfort, bleeding, discharge, splinting/ digitation, and low backache. In addition, urinary symptoms should be obtained, including increased daytime urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary incontinence, difficulty voiding (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, straining to void, and position-dependent micturition), and the sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. Inquiries should be made to uncover any symptoms of bowel dysfunction including constipation, diarrhea, fecal urgency, straining to defecate, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and anal, fecal, or flatal incontinence, and a history of splinting or digitation to empty the bladder or rectum should also be elicited. Because POP can overlap with other conditions, other known etiologies should also be considered, and constipation, diarrhea, anal incontinence, feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation, and rectal bleeding should be evaluated for other causes.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part I. history, physical examination, radiographs, and laboratory tests [^111ezFBM]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently encounter patients with knee pain. Accurate diagnosis requires a knowledge of knee anatomy, common pain patterns in knee injuries, and features of frequently encountered causes of knee pain, as well as specific physical examination skills. The history should include characteristics of the patient's pain, mechanical symptoms (locking, popping, giving way), joint effusion (timing, amount, recurrence), and mechanism of injury. The physical examination should include careful inspection of the knee, palpation for point tenderness, assessment of joint effusion, range-of-motion testing, evaluation of ligaments for injury or laxity, and assessment of the menisci. Radiographs should be obtained in patients with isolated patellar tenderness or tenderness at the head of the fibula, inability to bear weight or flex the knee to 90 degrees, or age greater than 55 years.

### Association between baseline meniscal symptoms and outcomes of operative and nonoperative treatment of meniscal tear in patients with osteoarthritis [^112Lw3Uo]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with meniscal tears reporting meniscal symptoms such as catching or locking have traditionally undergone arthroscopy. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether patients with meniscal tears who report meniscal symptoms have greater improvement with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) than physical therapy (PT).

Methods

We used data from the Meniscal Tear in Osteoarthritis Research (MeTeOR) trial, which randomized participants with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and meniscal tear to APM or PT. The frequency of each meniscal symptom (clicking, catching, popping, intermittent locking, giving way, swelling) was measured at baseline and 6 months. We used linear regression models to determine whether the difference in improvement in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain score at 6 months between patients treated with APM versus PT was modified by the presence of each meniscal symptom. We also determined the percentage of participants with resolution of meniscal symptoms by treatment group.

Results

We included 287 participants. The presence (versus absence) of any of the meniscal symptoms did not modify the improvement in KOOS pain score between APM versus PT by > 0.5 SD (all P interaction > 0.05). APM led to greater resolution of intermittent locking and clicking than PT (locking 70% versus 46%, clicking 41% versus 25%). No difference in resolution of the other meniscal symptoms was observed.

Conclusion

Meniscal symptoms were not associated with improved pain relief. Although symptoms of clicking and intermittent locking had a greater reduction in the APM group, the presence of meniscal symptoms in isolation should not inform clinical decisions surrounding APM versus PT in patients with meniscal tear and knee OA.

### US for diagnosis of musculoskeletal conditions in the young athlete: emphasis on dynamic assessment [^111QRmLK]. Radiographics (2014). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) is increasingly recognized as an important tool for diagnosis and therapeutic management of a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. Advantages of US use in the young athlete include the ability to diagnose dynamic conditions that are occult with other modalities, provide additional diagnostic information, and aid in treatment. Uses of US in young patients include evaluation of acquired musculoskeletal conditions that manifest with symptoms and assessment of congenital variants that may manifest with pain or limitations in activity. Acquired conditions in the young athlete include tendon disorders, such as proximal tendinosis, and ligament disorders, such as anterior talofibular ligament or ulnar collateral ligament tears. While static images are frequently able to depict these disorders without difficulty, a dynamic examination that provides stress to the joint of interest may be able to uncover a ligament tear or insufficiency and concurrently provide the clinician with information regarding joint stability. Numerous congenital variants that occur throughout the musculoskeletal system can be associated with awkward sensations such as snapping, popping, and clunking and occasionally with pain. Pathologic processes associated with congenital variants in the upper extremities include slipping rib syndrome, atraumatic anterior subluxation of the sternoclavicular joint, and snapping triceps syndrome. Conditions that affect the lower extremities include internal and external snapping hip syndrome, snapping knee syndrome, and medial plica syndrome. The dynamic capability of US is ideal for diagnosis of many conditions that affect the musculoskeletal system of the young athlete, many of which would be difficult or impossible to identify with use of other imaging modalities.

### Noisy knees-knee crepitus prevalence and association with structural pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113bFjYY]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Knee crepitus, the audible crackling or grinding noise during knee movement, can be experienced across the lifespan and create concern for underlying pathology. Our systematic review aims to provide a summary estimate of knee crepitus prevalence and its association with structural pathology among the general population and across knee conditions.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and CINAHL.

Eligibility Criteria

Studies evaluating knee crepitus prevalence.

Results

103 studies involving 36439 participants (42816 knees) were included. Based on very low certainty evidence, the pooled prevalence of knee crepitus in the general population was 41% (7609 knees; 95% CI 36% to 45%; I² = 92.6%); in pain-free persons 36% (852 knees; 95% CI 23% to 50%; I² = 91.9%), and in those with osteoarthritis (OA) 81% (18 821 knees; 95% CI 75% to 87%; I² = 97.9%). Across other musculoskeletal knee conditions, the pooled prevalence of knee crepitus ranged from 35% (ligament injury; 2740 knees; 95% CI 27% to 44%; I² = 95.6%) to 61% (cartilage pathology; 1445 knees; 95% CI 40% to 81%; I² = 98.2%). There was low to very low certainty evidence of an association between knee crepitus and radiographic OA (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.99 to 7.24; 1725 knees; I² = 53.0%) and several OA-related features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Conclusion

In this review, knee crepitus was prevalent in the general population, pain-free persons, those with knee OA and other musculoskeletal knee conditions. Knee crepitus was associated with a more than threefold increased odds of radiographic OA diagnosis and several OA-related MRI features. The low to very low certainty of evidence informing our aggregated prevalence estimates and association outcomes suggest that results should be interpreted with caution.

### Meniscal root tears [^113Zh2a2]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Meniscus root tears are a specific type of meniscal injury that have gained attention over the past 5 years and have been reported to account for 10% to 21% of all meniscal tears, affecting nearly 100,000 patients annually. Meniscal root tears either are defined as an avulsion of the insertion of the meniscus attachment or complete radial tears that are located within 1 cm of the meniscus insertion. Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that meniscal root injuries interrupt the continuity of the circumferential fibers, and hence lead to failure of the normal meniscal function to convert axial loads into transverse hoop stresses. The most common presenting symptoms in meniscal root tears are posterior knee pain and joint line tenderness, especially with deep squatting. Another common symptom is a popping sound heard while participating in light activities such as ascending stairs or squatting. Magnetic resonance imaging signs of medial meniscus root tears include: (1) medial meniscal extrusion of ≥ 3 mm in a coronal section; (2) high signal indicating a disruption of the posterior meniscal root region in an axial view; and (3) a "ghost sign", which is the absence of an identifiable meniscus in the sagittal plane, or increased signal replacing the normally dark meniscal tissue signal at the posterior root attachment. Active patients, regardless of age, should be referred early and considered for a meniscal root repair. Indications for a meniscal root repair include acute, traumatic root tears in patients with nearly normal or normal cartilage and chronic symptomatic root tears in young or middle-aged patients without significant preexisting osteoarthritis. Meniscal root repair has been demonstrated to have high satisfaction rates and superior outcomes to arthroscopic meniscectomy for root tears. To restore the function of the meniscus after medial meniscus root tears, a transosseous meniscal root repair technique is most commonly used. The advantage of this technique is the ability to reduce and fix the meniscal root to the broad anatomic footprint to maximize its healing potential. In addition, the transtibial tunnels may contribute to the release of biological factors that can enhance the healing of the meniscal root repair.

### Patellar tendon rupture in a basketball player [^113bCUVT]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

The patient was a 21-year-old male who was referred to physical therapy with a 1-week history of right knee pain and stiffness following an injury of traumatic onset. While attempting to jump off of both legs to dunk a basketball during a game, the patient heard and felt a pop in his right knee that was associated with an immediate onset of pain and swelling. He was unable to bear weight following the injury and, therefore, immediately went to the emergency department, where radiographs were completed and interpreted as negative for a fracture. However, the patella for the right knee was superiorly displaced. The patient was issued crutches and referred to physical therapy. At the time of the initial physical therapy examination, the patient was still not able to bear full weight on the right lower extremity or actively fully extend his right knee. Due to concern over possible meniscal, medial collateral ligament, or patellar tendon involvement, the patient's physician was contacted and magnetic resonance imaging was ordered. Five days later, the patient presented with decreased knee effusion and the special tests for the medial collateral ligament and meniscus were negative. However, the patient was still not able to actively extend his knee, suggesting a possible rupture of the patellar tendon, which was later confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. Surgical repair of the patellar tendon was performed 2 weeks later.

### Pediatric menisci: normal aspects, anatomical variants, lesions, tears, and postsurgical findings [^116S8yos]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Anatomical variants

Discoid meniscus (DM)

A DM is a congenital abnormality of the morphology of the meniscus, in which the meniscus has the appearance of a flat disk instead of the usual semilunar shape. Discoid morphology occurs most commonly in the LM, although cases involving the medial compartment have also been described.

The incidence of this condition is estimated to be 0.4–17% for the lateral DM and 0.06% for the medial DM, and it is bilateral in 20% of cases. However, the true incidence and prevalence are limited, as many discoid menisci are asymptomatic and incidentally detected.

The clinical presentations of discoid menisci can vary significantly, ranging from no symptoms to severe pain during movement. In adults, the commonly observed symptoms include pain during motion, joint locking, instability (giving way), and the classical "popping knee" syndrome (a snapping sound heard from the affected knee). These symptoms are primarily associated with meniscal tears, detachment, or defects in the pMFL.

However, in children, the main clinical manifestations of DM differ from those in adults. Notable symptoms in children include extension block, knee pain, joint line tenderness, locking, clicking, and giving way.

Extension block, which is rarely observed in adults, is the primary clinical manifestation of DM without a tear in children. This may be due to the position or morphology of discoid menisci in developing knee joints or to the relatively large volume of the discoid lateral meniscus (DLM) occupying the smaller inner space of the knee joint. There appears to be a close relationship between extension block and meniscal morphology, especially the thickness of the anterior part of the meniscus, which is significantly greater than the posterior thickness in children with extension block.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven useful for diagnosing a DLM. In adults, the diagnosis of DM is traditionally made if three or more 5-mm-thick contiguous sagittal images show continuity of the meniscus between the anterior and posterior horns. Additionally, Araki et al reported that a DLM is present if the transverse width at the mid-portion of the meniscal body exceeds 14 mm, regardless of the tibial width.

### Conversion of fused hip to total hip arthroplasty with presurgical and postsurgical gait studies [^116Q6n6y]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2012). Low credibility.

This case study presents a subject with a fused hip converted to total hip arthroplasty. Kinematic gait analysis was conducted on 3 occasions, presurgery, 4 months postsurgery, and 2.5 years postsurgery. Presurgery data showed decreased cadence and shorter step length; sound limb possessed increased hip, knee range of motion (ROM), and increased knee flexion during stance; the affected limb had minimal hip motion and normal knee ROM with abnormal pattern. At 4 months postsurgery, the sound limb showed decreased step length, whereas the affected limb showed increased knee extension during stance and increased hip ROM. Data obtained at 2.5 years postsurgery indicated decreased cadence and speed and increased ROM in both limbs. The total hip arthroplasty had provided relief of chronic back and affected hip pain and improved mobility. Gait-specific training is recommended.

### Management of traumatic meniscus tears: the 2019 ESSKA meniscus consensus [^1115K6VU]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on meniscal tears:

- **Definition**: Meniscal tears are injuries to the meniscus, C-shaped fibrocartilaginous structures acting as cushions between the femoral condyles and tibial plateau. Meniscal tears can be partial or complete and can be caused by trauma (from non-contact sports) or degeneration (such as osteoarthritis).
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of meniscal tears involves disruption of the meniscal tissue, resulting from acute trauma or degeneration. Traumatically torn menisci possess a higher degree of degeneration than intact menisci, suggesting that patients with a traumatic meniscal tear may already have had a certain degree of meniscal degeneration. On a molecular level, traumatic meniscus tears exhibit a higher inflammatory/catabolic response as evidenced by higher levels of chemokine and matrix metalloproteinase expression than degenerative tears.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for meniscal tears include advanced age, sports participation (especially pivoting sports such as basketball, soccer, and football), certain occupations associated with kneeling and squatting, and higher BMI. Traumatic meniscal tears are often associated with concomitant ACL injuries. Knee osteoarthritis is the most important risk factors for degenerative meniscal tears.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of meniscal tears often involves symptoms such as knee pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms such as locking, popping, catching, or buckling. Physical examination often reveals posterior knee pain with deep flexion, knee effusion, joint line tenderness, limited ROM, and signs of trauma. Specific diagnostic tests include McMurray test, Thessaly test, Apley grind test, bounce home test, anterior drawer test, and medial-lateral grind test.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of meniscal tears depends on factors such as tear location, size, and chronicity. While many tears can be managed conservatively, larger, unstable tears may require surgical intervention for optimal outcomes. The failure rate of meniscal repair at 5 years is reported to be 22.3–24.3%. Meniscal tears managed conservatively and total meniscectomy are associated with an increased risk of developing arthritic changes on imaging.

### Traumatic separation of a type I bipartite patella: a report of four knees [^114Qj6Q5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Four knees in three patients with traumatic separation of a Type I bipartite patella are reported. Sudden anterior knee pain and an audible pop occurred at the time of the injury and the patients had aching or dull pain before the traumatic episode. Previous aching or dull pain led us to differentiate this type of injury from a usual transverse fracture. A round fracture line seen on the radiographs also led us to differentiate this type of injury from a stress fracture. Accordingly, the diagnosis of a traumatic separation of a Type I bipartite patella was confirmed. This is the first report of a traumatic separation of a Type I bipartite patella to our knowledge.

### Distal hamstring injuries and disorders [^111VjjYt]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Clinical photographs demonstrating isolated complete distal avulsion of biceps femoris tendon from the fibular head (A) and repair of the tendon back to the fibular head. Photograph (B) demonstrating placement of repair stitches through the biceps femoris tendon after anchor placement into the fibular head, and photograph (C) demonstrating completed repair after sutures were tied.

It should be noted that similar to proximal chronic hamstring injuries undergoing surgical intervention, the surgical repair of a chronic distal avulsion of the biceps femoris has been shown to have greater duration of time until return to play, reported at greater than 9 months, and poorer outcomes than with acute repair. Also, delays in surgery are associated with increased scar formation, which can lead to tethering to adjacent neurological structures and cause paresthesia and/or motor weakness. We recommend surgical treatment of complete injuries of the distal biceps femoris within a two-week window from time of the injury when possible.

Acute Medial Side Distal Hamstring Injury

Epidemiology and Presentation

The acute injury to the medial distal hamstrings that occurs most often is to the semitendinous tendon. Isolated rupture of the semitendinosus distally is overall rare, with one recent systematic review only finding 22 instances reported in the literaturewhereas another recent systematic view reported 52 instances. Distal semimembranosus avulsion or musculotendinous junction injuries have also been reported but are even more rare than semitendinosus injuries. Injuries to the medial hamstrings appear to be more common in high-level athletes than the general population. Specifically, this injury tends to occur with sprinting, although hyperextension of the knee is another possible mechanism. When presenting, patients will often report hearing an audible pop and feeling concomitant sharp, searing pain. Patients may note a feeling of a lump in their distal posterior thigh, and may have pain with passive full knee extension. When the patient presents with these constellations of findings, an acute semitendinosus rupture should be suspected. From the most recent systematic review of acute isolated semitendinosus injuries, an interesting demographic finding was that all individuals were males. In addition, the breakdown in location of injury was found to be 78% of injuries involved complete avulsions from the medial tibia, and 22% of tears were localized to the musculotendinous junction.

### Diagnostic performance of self-reported knee crepitus using a knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score item [^1171F6Af]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic performance of a single Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) item in evaluating the presence of knee crepitus.

Design

All 184 participants aged 18–40 years with a symptomatic knee, 9–36 months following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) who were prospectively enrolled in a post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis trial (ACTRN12620001164987) were included. Participants completed the KOOS and underwent physical examination for knee crepitus at baseline. Self-reported knee crepitus (index test) of the ACLR knee was defined as a response of "often" or "always" on item S2 of the KOOS-Symptom subscale (KOOS-S2: Do you feel grinding, hear clicking or any other type of noise when your knee moves?). The presence of knee crepitus on physical examination (reference standard) was defined as continuous grinding, crunching or crackling during three consecutive squats with the investigator's palm placed lightly over the patella. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratios (LR-), and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were calculated.

Results

On physical examination, 113 (62%) participants had knee crepitus, and 71 (39%) met the criteria for self-reported knee crepitus. KOOS-S2 demonstrated a specificity of 73% (95%CI 61%-83%), sensitivity of 47% (95%CI 37%-57%), LR+ of 1.75 (95%CI 1.14–2.70), LR- of 0.72 (95%CI 0.58–0.91), PPV of 74% (95%CI 64%-81%), and NPV of 46% (95%CI 41%-52%).

Conclusion

KOOS-S2 may be a useful method to rule in the presence of knee crepitus on physical examination in individuals post-ACLR; however, it is inadequate for ruling out this clinical sign.

### 'Between-time stories': waiting, war and the temporalities of care [^113vT6sU]. Medical Humanities (2020). Medium credibility.

Thinking time

Virginia Woolf's essay, 'Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid', was published in October 1940, but it gestated just a little earlier, during the final weeks of the Battle of Britain and on the eve of the London Blitz. Woolf writes, there, of what waiting for a bomb to drop might do to thinking:

It is a queer experience, lying in the dark and listening to the zoom of a hornet which may at any moment sting you to death. It is a sound that interrupts cool and consecutive thinking about peace. Yet it is a sound — far more than prayers and anthems — that should compel one to think about peace. Unless we can think peace into existence we — not this one body in this one bed but millions of bodies yet to be born — will lie in the same darkness and hear the same death rattle overhead. Let us think what we can do to create the only efficient air-raid shelter while the guns on the hill go pop pop pop and the searchlights finger the clouds and now and then, sometimes close at hand, sometimes far away a bomb drops. 86

### Subjective crepitus as a risk factor for incident symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^112xWrss]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Subjective crepitus is the reporting of hearing grating, cracking, or popping sounds in and/or around a joint. We aimed to evaluate whether there is an association between crepitus and incident symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a multicenter longitudinal US cohort.

Methods

Knees without baseline symptomatic OA were included. Crepitus frequency was assessed using a question from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score at baseline and at 12, 24, and 36 months. Frequent knee pain and radiographs were assessed at baseline and at annual visits up to 48 months. Radiographic OA was defined as a tibiofemoral Kellgren/Lawrence grade ≥ 2. Symptomatic OA was defined as a knee with both frequent symptoms and radiographic OA. We performed a repeated-measures analysis with a predictor of crepitus and outcome of incident symptomatic OA, adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), with those never reporting crepitus as the referent group.

Results

There were a total of 3,495 participants (42.2% male), with mean ± SD age of 61.1 ± 9.2 years and a mean ± SD BMI of 28.2 ± 4.7 kg/m². The odds of incident symptomatic OA were higher with greater frequency of crepitus (never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always, with adjusted odds ratios of (referent), 1.5, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0, respectively; P < 0.0001 for trend). The group with radiographic OA at OAI baseline but without symptoms contributed 26% of the observations but more than 75% of the incident symptomatic OA cases.

Conclusion

In those without symptomatic OA, subjective knee crepitus predicts incident symptomatic OA longitudinally, with most cases occurring in those with preexisting tibiofemoral radiographic OA but without frequent knee pain. However, an important limitation is that patellofemoral OA was not systematically evaluated within the OAI. Subjective crepitus offers utility for the identification of at-risk individuals, predictive modeling, and future research.

### Snapping pes anserine syndrome [^1117sbWP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

The patient was a 25-year-old man who was serving in the military. He was referred to a physical therapist for a progressively worsening painful snapping sensation in the posteromedial left knee region. Prior magnetic resonance imaging for the left knee was interpreted as normal, except for a mild fluid signal about the left pes anserine bursa. The patient was diagnosed with snapping pes anserine syndrome. However, despite 6 weeks of physical therapist intervention, the patient did not improve. A dynamic real-time ultrasound examination was then ordered, which demonstrated that the pes anserine tendons changed position as the knee moved from flexion to extension, sliding across a heterogeneous rounded mass in the posteromedial knee.

### Interpreting intracorporeal landscapes: how patients visualize pathophysiology and utilize medical images in their understanding of chronic musculoskeletal illness [^114bPzZu]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Gordon: "it would just make you stop and think"

Like Ray and Arthur, Gordon also struggled to understand the origins of the noise and grating sensations within his knee:

Gordon: It's one of those things where you know, it sounds a lot worse than it actually is at the moment you know, it's – because you think, is that grating, wearing something? But it doesn't appear to be, it just appears as though there's something in there that's moving about and making the noise, you know, so…

Interviewer: Yeah. That's something I'm interested in, how people imagine the inside of the knee when they hear sounds like that.

Gordon: Yeah, yeah, it is a funny sound. I don't know how it does it, I don't know. I was listening to something on the telly the other day and the guy was saying that when we crack our fingers and it [claps] does that, that that's a fluid bag inside your finger that's popping or something, and I think, 'How the hell's that? That sounds to me like it's, like there's a bone moving against a bone or something', So I suppose if you did understand a little bit more, perhaps you know, you can do the right things with it rather than, well, it would just make you stop and think, you know.

Gordon imagined that the grating sensation in his knee might have been something "wearing", but as his knee was not deteriorating he reasoned it was something moving around inside. Acknowledging that his interpretation of the sounds and sensations he experienced might be wrong, he referred to a television program that he had watched, which explained cavitation – a crack sometimes heard with a decrease in intracapsular pressure – which he suggests sounded like "bone moving against bone". Given the dissonance between the program presenter's explanation and his own uncertainty about the "funny sound" in his knee, Gordon reasoned that a better understanding of what was happening could help him to "do the right things" and better manage his condition. For Gordon, visualization of his intracorporeal space appears to serve as a heuristic function, as he seeks to reconcile his own understanding of his body with more formal, 'external' explanations, testing the former against the latter.

### Qualitative study exploring the meaning of knee symptoms to adults ages 35–65 years [^116iRwtj]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Cause of symptoms

Participants explained knee symptoms by recounting their personal biographies and relating their symptoms to prior actions, incidents, personal characteristics, or family history. While participants' explanations of the cause varied, a common feature across their accounts was at least partial attribution of symptoms to actions or incidents that were modifiable.

Some participants, particularly adults with a diagnosis of OA, understood their symptoms as overuse of the joint. Participants described the activities they thought may have contributed to their knee problems, including leisure activities (e.g. martial arts) and occupations that required extensive walking, kneeling, or lifting. Participants used language such as "abuse", "overuse", and "wear and tear" to describe the cause. Some participants talked about how they had "pushed" their bodies too far. They perceived the knee as having a finite capacity to withstand activity. For example, one participant, who attributed his knee pain to years of jogging and playing squash, stated, "What has happened is in some ways when you abuse or overuse it, there is a wear… in my case, I overused it more than a normal function which the body was supposed to do" (Chata, age 65, interview).

### Ultrasound imaging of the posterior lateral corner of the knee: a pictorial review of anatomy and pathologies [^113Tqum2]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The posterior lateral corner of the knee is a frequently overlooked area in routine ultrasound examinations, despite its susceptibility to sports injuries. A comprehensive understanding of the regional anatomy helps investigators identify potential sources of pain, where systematic ultrasound examination can be invaluable for uncovering common pathologies including ligamentous sprains and tears. It is important to note that the posterior lateral corner is traversed by the common peroneal nerve and inferior lateral genicular artery, and ultrasound guidance can, for sure, minimize their risk of accidental injury effectively.

### What is the frequency of noise generation in modern knee arthroplasty and is It associated with residual symptoms? [^114xW2S9]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Prior investigations have recognized the presence of patient-perceived noise generation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, questions remain regarding its overall frequency after both TKA and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) as well as with respect to its association with demographic and prosthesis-related factors and its association with patient-reported outcomes.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the frequency with which patients report noise coming from the knee after TKA or UKA; (2) to identify patient and prosthesis-related factors associated with noise generation; and (3) to ascertain whether noise coming from the knee is associated with residual symptoms after knee arthroplasty.

Methods

A five-center survey study was designed to identify patient-perceived noise and to quantify the degree of residual symptoms and functional deficits in patients after TKA or UKA. Data were collected by an independent, third-party survey center, which administered questions about residual symptoms, function, and pre- and postoperative activity levels. Patients meeting prespecified inclusion criteria were specifically questioned regarding perceived noises from their knee within the last 30 days; those who reported hearing noises sometimes, often, or extremely often were categorized as positive. We retrospectively identified 2671 patients who underwent TKA and 744 patients who underwent UKA and who met inclusion criteria; the final survey population included 1580 patients who underwent TKA and 476 patients who underwent UKA (68% response rate). TKA implant types included cruciate-retaining (59%), posterior-stabilized (16%), rotating-platform (13%), gender-specific (7%), and high-flex (5%). Differences in baseline demographic variables were accounted for using multiple logistic regression statistical analyses. Chi square analyses were used to compare the frequency of residual symptoms in those patients with and without noise generation.

Results

Overall, 27% (557 of 2056; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25–29) of all patients undergoing knee arthroplasty reported hearing grinding, popping, or clicking from their operative knee in the last 30 days. Men (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.6; p = 0.02) and younger patients (χ²[df = 7] = 67.3; p < 0.001) were more likely to report noise generation. After controlling for potential confounding variables, noise generation was more common after TKA (29%) than UKA (21%; OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2–2.0; p < 0.001). Among TKA designs, the likelihood of noise generation was greater in posterior-stabilized (41%; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8–3.7; p < 0.001), rotating-platform (45%; OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9–4.2; p < 0.001), and gender-specific (36%; OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2; p = 0.007) designs than in cruciate-retaining (23%) knees. Patient-perceived noise generation was associated with residual symptoms, including difficulty getting in and out of a chair (38% versus 25%, p < 0.001), limp (39% versus 25%, p < 0.001), swelling (42% versus 24%, p < 0.001), and stiffness (40% versus 23%, p < 0.001) compared with those who did not report noise generation after TKA.

Conclusions

Patients frequently perceive noises coming from the knee after arthroplasty, more so in TKA than UKA. Patients reporting noises from the knee were more likely to report functional limitations and the presence of a limp, swelling, and stiffness. Surgeons should inform patients preoperatively of this possibility, because unmet patient expectations are known to negatively impact patient satisfaction after surgery. Subsequent investigations should focus on determining if there is a causal relationship between noise generation and residual symptoms after knee arthroplasty.

### Consensus methods in patellofemoral pain: how rigorous are they? A scoping review [^112wYyqE]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Clinicians and researchers have sought consensus with increasing frequency on topics related to PFP. However, consensus statements on PFP have often failed to rigorously develop consensus recommendations with respect to the four questions we outlined in this review. The lack of systematic searching to identify potential evidence gaps may have resulted in statements focusing on areas with well-established research evidence, or missing important topics where no information exists. Given the potential for consensus to direct whole bodies of research, it is perhaps most concerning that the patient voice has been almost totally absent.

Future consensus statements that are rigorous, representative (of all interested or impacted parties) and clearly report their development processes could be seen as more credible.

### Simultaneous bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture secondary to parathyroid carcinoma: a case report [^111qvRBP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 31-year-old man presented to an orthopaedic clinic with a sudden onset of severe bilateral knee pain and weakness after routine yard work. The patient reported lifting a lightweight wooden log from the ground and then felt a painful pop in his left leg. While falling, he felt a pop in his right leg. He was unable to bear weight and presented to the emergency department, where he was diagnosed with bilateral patellar fractures and was referred for orthopaedic consultation.

The patient was seen in clinic 3 weeks after the injury and was still nonambulatory. His medical history included hypertension controlled with calcium channel blockers, and he was previously a short-term smoker (3 years), but he quit 10 years earlier. He denied anabolic steroid use, diabetes mellitus diagnosis, or any other pertinent medical history.

A bilateral lower extremity examination demonstrated 3+ suprapatellar edema, and he was tender to palpation over the quadriceps tendons with a palpable defect. He was unable to actively extend either knee.

Initial radiographs of the left leg demonstrated a low-lying patella with an avulsion fracture of the superior pole. The right knee radiograph was normal. The patient then underwent magnetic resonance imaging of both knees, which revealed a complete rupture of the left quadriceps tendon and a full-thickness central tear of the right quadriceps tendon. He was advised to undergo surgical repair of both tendons because of his debilitating symptoms and loss of function.

A presurgical complete blood count and complete metabolic panel revealed abnormal creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, hemoglobin, and hematocrit (Table 1). On further questioning, the patient revealed that he had been experiencing intermittent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nocturia, and polydipsia for the past 3 months.

### Review of literature on intraductal meibomian gland probing with insights from the inventor and developer: fundamental concepts and misconceptions [^114fMaq1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Popping Sound

The popping sound observed during probing is like the sound heard upon the release of canalicular fibrosis with a punctal dilator or the snap of an old rubber band and is thought to represent the release of the band of periductal fibrotic tissue constricting the gland duct. It is just a sound and not a side effect.

Multiple popping sounds in quick succession, that in the hand of the prober create a feeling of something gritty lodged within the gland, indicate the release of multiple bands of fibrotic tissue at different depths. When these fibrotic bands are present, the patient and prober will hear what sounds like nails on a washboard as the probe releases the bands of tissue in quick succession.

All of these sounds, and the tactile sensation felt by the prober, are no more side effects than the sound of brushing and flossing one's teeth. The sounds and tactile sensation are documented on a Probe Findings form (shown in Figure 2) used to monitor gland obstruction and improvement over time.

Figure 2
Probe findings form of a patient.

Post-MGP Hemorrhage

Occasionally a microscopic self-limiting hemorrhage is seen at the gland orifice after MGP.

The droplet of blood is not an indication that the gland has been damaged.

Instead, the microscopic, self-limiting hemorrhage, along with the auditory pop or gritty sound described above, confirms that fixed obstruction consisting of abnormal fibrotic or fibrovascular tissue, that often wraps the glands and disrupts the external duct walls was released with probing (Figure 3).

Figure 3
Confocal microscopy image of Meibomian gland distal duct showing disruption of the normally well demarcated external duct wall by fibrovascular tissue invasion. A prominent blood vessel is seen inside the oval. The disruption of the duct wall is indicated by the solid arrow showing a "step off". This gland had not been probed. (Courtesy of SLM.).

One would expect a released fibrovascular stricture of a Meibomian gland, like a released fibrovascular stricture elsewhere in the body, to hemorrhage. This hemorrhage is a natural result of targeting and reversing the root cause of this disease and indicates the beginning of the rehabilitative process for the diseased glands. It is analogous to the small amount of hemorrhage sometimes seen when releasing a stricture of the urethra or esophagus.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113ZcVJG]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Bursitis

Background: A bursa is a sac filled with synovial fluid that acts as a friction cushion between structures. There are 10 bursa within and around the knee, and the 4 major bursa are the prepatellar, suprapatellar, infrapatellar, and pes anserine bursa. When friction or trauma irritates a bursa, it can become inflamed and be a significant source of knee pain. Bursitis is clinically recognized by localized pain, point tenderness, and edema at the sight of the bursa. Septic bursitis may also present with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fevers and leukocytosis.
Etiology: Superficial to the patella is the subcutaneous prepatellar bursa, which can become inflamed with kneeling activities, and is colloquially called "housemaid's knee or carpenter's knee". Inferior to the patella are two bursae, subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa which lies superficial to the patellar ligament, and the deep (subtendinous) infrapatellar bursa which lies deep to the patellar ligament. Inferomedial knee pain may be caused by anserine bursitis. The anserine bursa lies deep to the pes anserinus comprising the tendinous attachments of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius. Proximal to the anserine bursa and deep to the semimembranosus tendon is the semimembranosus bursa. There are three lateral bursae: the bursa deep to the iliotibial tract, bursa deep to the lateral collateral ligament, and the inferior subtendinous bursa deep to the biceps femoris tendon. Posteriorly, there are two subtendinous bursa, one deep to the medial and lateral heads of the gastrocnemius. A bursa can become inflamed by overuse leading to increased friction across the bursa. Septic bursitis requires bacteria to enter the bursa and is associated with trauma.
Diagnostic criteria: Physical exam is significant for pain and point tenderness overlying the affected bursa and may be associated with swelling. Prepatellar bursitis will present with egg-shaped swelling superficial to the patella. Septic bursitis may present with erythema and warmth. Radiologic knee series are usually normal. Evaluation with ultrasound will show a hypoechoic fluid filled sac or discrete fluid collection at the site of pain indicating bursitis.
Treatment: The treatment of bursitis-related knee pain is typically focused on reducing the inflammation of the bursa, itself – this includes ice, NSAIDs, activity modifications (such as knee pads for prepatellar bursitis), injections of corticosteroid, and therapeutic aspiration. For patients with active lifestyle or occupational demands and non-septic bursitis, intrabursal injection of corticosteroids provides acute pain relief. If septic bursitis is suspected, infectious workup includes blood sampling for evaluation of leukocytosis and aspiration of bursal fluid with gram stain and cell count. Treat septic bursitis with antibiotics. Recurrent or persistent severe bursitis may benefit from surgical interventions such as bursectomy.

### Qualitative study exploring the meaning of knee symptoms to adults ages 35–65 years [^116jwNmH]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Some participants, particularly younger ones, accounted for their knee symptoms by referring to a knee injury, some of which occurred when they were recreational athletes. Marta described an injury that she linked to her knee symptoms, saying, "I'm a master in tae kwon do. And I was in the [championship] in '95 and I had to flex my knee and my knee popped. That was the first time that my knee gave out" (Marta, age 44, focus group 2). Others recounted knee injuries from falls. Adam (age 54, interview) explained, "The right side was [injured] coming off of a stepladder".

Being overweight was considered a cause or contributing factor to knee symptoms by putting excess load on the knee. One participant shared his understanding of the effect of weight on his knees, saying, "I carry about 10 pounds, which I've been told that it's multiplied by 15 on your knee" (Peter, age 57, focus group 1). Another participant explained that carrying her backpack increased her knee pain. She then stated, "Obviously, what I'm carrying on my body must contribute to my knee pain" (Yvetta, age 57, interview).

Some participants indicated that family members had OA and suggested that heredity may have put them at risk for their knee symptoms. Samantha (age 44, focus group) explained, "It's hereditary because my grandmother has it, my mom has it, my sister has it". Interestingly, participants did not attribute their symptoms solely to age. Like heredity, when age was mentioned by a few participants as contributing to their symptoms, it was typically in conjunction with other causes.

Prevention of symptoms

In linking their symptoms primarily to actions or incidents, some participants believed that they could have prevented the onset of symptoms had they changed their behavior earlier in life. Some participants indicated that if they had not engaged in high‐impact activities, reduced the extent to which they performed activities, or avoided injuries, they might have prevented their knee symptoms. This was particularly common in older adults. For example, one participant said, "What should I have done different? I think I would have stopped jogging. I would have gone more on a bike… It was nice at that time, but there is a payback" (Chata, age 65, interview).

### A simple, accurate method to confirm placement of intra-articular knee injection [^115GFNZG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-articular knee injections are routinely performed in clinical practice without documenting intra-articular placement.

Hypothesis

A small amount of air to an intra-articular knee injection produces an audible "squishing" sound with range of motion.

Study Design

Prospective nonrandomized clinical trial.

Methods

The study group (20 knees from 20 patients) received an intra-articular injection with a mixture of local anesthetic, corticosteroid, contrast dye, and 1 to 2 cc of air. The control group (10 knees from 5 patients) received extra-articular injections of a mixture of local anesthetic, contrast dye, and 2 cc of air. All knees were examined immediately after injection for a squishing sound with range of motion. Postinjection arthrographic radiographs were taken to verify the actual placement.

Result

All study group knees and no control group knees had intra-articular contrast by radiograph. Clearly audible squishing sounds were heard in 17 of 20 study knees (sensitivity of 85%). Squishing sounds were audible in none of the control knees (specificity of 100%).

Conclusion

Adding 1 to 2 cc of air to knee injections provides a no-cost, reliable, sensitive, and specific method of confirming accurate placement.

Clinical Relevance

This simple method is easily reproduced, can confirm accurate placement, and can eliminate extra-articular injection as the reason for clinical response failure.

### Instability of the proximal tibiofibular joint [^112oebL3]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Injury to the proximal tibiofibular joint is typically seen in athletes whose sports require violent twisting motions of the flexed knee. Instability of this joint may be in the anterolateral, posteromedial, or superior directions. With acute injury, patients usually complain of pain and a prominence in the lateral aspect of the knee. A closed reduction should be attempted in patients with acute dislocation. If this is unsuccessful, open reduction and stabilization of the joint with repair of the injured capsule and ligaments can be done. Patients with chronic dislocation or subluxation report lateral knee pain and instability with popping and catching, which may be confused with lateral meniscal injury. Symptoms of subluxation may be treated nonsurgically with physical therapies such as activity modification, supportive straps, and knee strengthening. For patients with chronic pain or instability, surgical options include arthrodesis, fibular head resection, and proximal tibiofibular joint capsule reconstruction.

Knee pain is among the most common complaints that an orthopedic surgeon may see in practice. It is often worked up with X-rays and MRI, leading to a myriad of potential diagnoses ranging from minimal edema patterns to various types of osteonecrosis. Similarities in certain causes can pose diagnostic challenges. The purpose of this review was to present the 3 types of osteonecrosis observed in the knee as well as additional causes to consider to help aid in the diagnosis and treatment.

Table 2
Satisfaction Survey Responses and Surgical Outcomes

When compared with the ≥ 60 patients, < 60 patients reported higher frequency of experiencing pain in their replaced knee (extremely often: 8.25% vs. 4.21%; P < 0.001), swelling or tightness (extremely often: 9.79% vs. 3.53%; P < 0.001), stiffness (extremely often: 10.3% vs. 4.04%; P < 0.001), and grinding/popping/clicking (extremely often: 9.02% vs. 2.78%; P < 0.001). In the contralateral knee, younger patients also reported higher frequency of stiffness (extremely often: 10.8% vs. 3.70%; P < 0.001) and grinding/popping/clicking compared with the older patient cohort (extremely often: 7.22% vs. 2.44%; P < 0.001) (Table 2).

Overall, fewer patients in the younger cohort considered their replaced knee to feel normal compared with the older cohort (66.5% vs. 75.2%; P < 0.001). Younger patients also reported higher frequency of limping while walking (extremely often: 9.79% vs. 4.63%; P < 0.001), but no difference in frequency of play/participation in recreational activity (extremely often: 11.1% vs. 8.83%, P = 0.540). The < 60 cohort reported requiring more readmissions for knee arthroplasty concerns (10.6% vs. 6.06%; P = 0.004); however, no difference was found in the rate of revision TKA between the cohorts (10.6% vs. 8.07%; P = 0.159; Table 2).

### Triggers for acute flare in adults with, or at risk of, knee osteoarthritis: a web-based case-crossover study in community-dwelling adults [^1126TfdB]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2021). Medium credibility.

The direction of our observed associations with exposure to one or more physical activities is consistent with previous study, as is our positive association with knee buckling. More broadly, our observed associations with a range of physical and psychosocial exposures are consistent with previous study of back pain, knee/hip OA, knee OA, and hip OA. Contrasting observations on psychological associations with hip OA, may be explained by different exposure measurements. Although our positive association with cold/damp weather contrasts previous study, our brief self-report exposure measurement is crude by comparison to the objective weather analysis by Ferreira et al.

Collectively, our observations provide support for our hypothesis that intermittent activity-related exposures are risk factors for flares. Mechanical exposures, including occupational physical loading, often associated with incidence and progression, may also contribute to 'acute-on-chronic' flares. These exposures have been proposed to have an etiological role, and also represent potentially modifiable risk factors for the etiopathogenesis. In the absence of traumatic events (injury), the periodic sudden onset of increased pain (acute flare) may represent short-lived consequences of transient mechanical exposures. Whilst the low-level cumulative and repetitive nature of these exposures may be important for the OA etiopathogenesis, they are likely to be frequent day-to-day encounters, often experienced as innocuous events for many people and not always causal antecedents to a flare. Interestingly, 70% of flares reported during the study were reported as unexpected, but the majority (two-thirds) hold the belief that physical/mechanical factors are their most likely triggers. Further research is needed to confirm whether the cumulative frequency of flare episodes drives OA etiopathogenesis. Our observed median 5-day flare duration, is broadly consistent with previous estimates. The nature of trigger exposures and the duration of flare episodes are important insights for patient-healthcare professional consultations, particularly as our data suggest flares appear more common among working age adults.

### Partial weight-bearing and range of motion limitation significantly reduce the loads at medial meniscus posterior root repair sutures in a cadaveric biomechanical model [^112KdwPb]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

The forces on the sutures at the posterior horn are in agreement with the tibiofemoral contact pressure evolution in this study. TTWB and PWB indicated the lowest forces, followed by normal gait and gait with tibial rotation, and maximum suture forces arose during movements characterized by higher flexion levels such as standing up and sitting down. The peak forces found in the present study agree with the findings of Stärke et al. who found increasing tensile forces of up to 60 N with increasing knee flexion angles. While Stärke et al. applied quasistatic loads of 100 N and 500 N, combined with external and internal rotation moments of 5 N m to their cadavers, the present study simulated tibiofemoral loading via active muscle simulation. The more dynamic knee joint loading resulted in mean peak forces of up to 232 N, as seen during the simulation of sitting down. However, during StandToSit simulation, maximum suture forces at the posterior horn reached values of up to 360 N, thus being in a critical failure region as in the load‐to‐failure in vitro test conducted by LaPrade et al. and Anz et al. where ultimate failure loads of up to 320 N and 368 N, respectively, after cyclic loading were measured. These results with the associated high suture forces in kneeling movements align with findings from studies where posterior root tears frequently occurred traumatically in societies with a kneeling‐associated floor‐based lifestyle and while standing up from a chair or squatting, in combination with popping sounds. Therefore, our results imply that unrestricted activities of daily living can lead to a highly increased risk for MMPRA suture loosening or even cut‐out suture ruptures. Contrary to Stärke et al. the force on the posterior horn was reduced in our study when a 15° external tibial rotation was applied compared to normal straight gait. However, our findings are in accordance with that of Melugin et al. They also observed a continuous decrease in force on the posterior medial meniscus root during internal knee joint rotation (in our case: external tibial rotation) at low flexion angles from 0° to 30° knee flexion. An increase in force compared to the non‐rotation state was only observed at higher flexions from 60° to 90°. In our GaitRotation simulation, the tibial rotation sequence was applied during stance phase, where no flexion angles higher than 30° are applied. As the femoral condyles glide along the tibial plateau when the knee is flexed deeply, the meniscus loses a certain amount of the initial tension at low flexion angles, even under the tibial external rotation. This tension increases again at higher flexion angles, and external tibial rotation influences the root force. In light of this finding, Melugin et al. as well as our data, do not anticipate any major concern in rehabilitation protocols in the early postoperative period for limited flexion gait walking with a moderate 15° external tibial rotation, because such a movement combination is considered to be a higher risk for MMPRA. However, immediate partial WB under cyclic loading leads to meniscus micromotion, which has been identified as a key reason for fixation strength loosening. Moreover, a study by Lee et al. showed good clinical outcomes with only 5% (1/21) re‐tearing root repairs when avoiding partial WB for 6 weeks postoperatively, which is in line with current rehabilitation recommendations. Recent clinical studies have shown that weight loss, younger age, lower BMI, and a lower hip‐knee‐angle are positively correlated with the outcomes after an MMPRA repair.

### Novel joint cupping clinical maneuver for ultrasonographic detection of knee joint effusions [^117DDkHV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Knee effusions occur due to traumatic and atraumatic causes. Clinical diagnosis currently relies on several provocative techniques to demonstrate knee joint effusions. Portable bedside ultrasonography (US) is becoming an adjunct to diagnosis of effusions. We hypothesized that a US approach with a clinical joint cupping maneuver increases sensitivity in identifying effusions as compared to US alone.

Methods

Using unembalmed cadaver knees, we injected fluid to create effusions up to 10 mL. Each effusion volume was measured in a lateral transverse location with respect to the patella. For each effusion we applied a joint cupping maneuver from an inferior approach, and re-measured the effusion.

Results

With increased volume of saline infusion, the mean depth of effusion on ultrasound imaging increased as well. Using a 2-mm cutoff, we visualized an effusion without the joint cupping maneuver at 2.5 mL and with the joint cupping technique at 1 mL. Mean effusion diameter increased on average 0.26 cm for the joint cupping maneuver as compared to without the maneuver. The effusion depth was statistically different at 2.5 and 7.5 mL (P < .05).

Conclusions

Utilizing a joint cupping technique in combination with US is a valuable tool in assessing knee effusions, especially those of subclinical levels. Effusion measurements are complicated by uneven distribution of effusion fluid. A clinical joint cupping maneuver concentrates the fluid in one recess of the joint, increasing the likelihood of fluid detection using US.

Figure 4
Images of coronal T2-weighted slices from (A) being located a few millimeters anterior to (B). Each slice shows a bare medial femoral condyle (toward the right side of the displayed image) and soft tissue interposed in the medial tibiofemoral joint space.

Physical examination after the MRI and approximately eight hours after arrival to the ED demonstrated an invaginated crease along the region of the medial joint line along with two oval regions of cutaneous discoloration and hemorrhagic blistering (Figure 5). These findings raised notable concern for the viability of the skin under those conditions, and thus, we decided on urgent surgical treatment. The patient was brought to the operating room within 20 hours of arrival. An examination under anesthesia revealed a grade 3 posterior drawer and grade 2B Lachman with an obvious medial compartment opening at 0° and 30°. The incision was placed over the medial distal femur and kept proximal to this region of injured skin. The traumatic tissue planes from the injury immediately revealed the exposed bare bone of the medial femoral epicondyle and the invaginated tissue in the medial compartment. With the leg in valgus, the continuous soft-tissue sleeve consisting of the sMCL and the POL/posteromedial capsule was under tension within the medial compartment and was liberated free, accompanied by an audible "pop" (Supplemental Video). With the sMCL and POL/posteromedial capsule having maintained continuity as a sleeve, the respective ligaments were repaired using locking Krackow sutures. These sutures were passed from the medial to the lateral condyle through the transosseous tunnel corresponding to the native attachment sites of the sMCL, POL, and medial patellofemoral ligament and were tied over a metal suture button on the outer cortex of the lateral femoral condyle. The incision and wounds were covered with a nonstick petroleum dressing, and the knee was kept in full extension in a knee immobilizer with touch-down weight-bearing status. One week after injury, the wound was reassessed, showing signs of localized demarcation and eschar formation (Figure 6 A). Early prone passive flexion was initiated at this time with home physical therapy, which continued for a month. Eschar débridement was not performed during this initial visit, and the skin was left open to air. Six weeks after injury, re-epithelialization of the medial skin injury was seen along with delayed healing of the incision (Figure 6 B). The patient's knee flexion was up to 90°, he was allowed to weight-bear as tolerated, and a referral to outpatient physical therapy was placed. At 10 weeks, the incision and medial skin continued to improve (Figure 6 C) as did his flexion (110°), no longer requiring assistive devices. The patient completed a total of 4 months of supervised physical therapy, thereafter transitioning to home exercises. Flexion improved to a max of 130°, the medial wounds continued to improve in appearance, and the patient was able to resume cycling at his desired intensity without subjective symptoms of instability. Given the lack of any patient-perceived functional instability, cruciate reconstruction was deferred in accordance with the patient's wish to avoid additional surgery given a lack of life-altering symptoms. He was able to resume his preinjury level of function and exercise with minimal symptoms, which was supported by his excellent 2-year patient-reported outcome measures that are summarized in Table 1, with the expanded reported outcomes to each question listed in Appendix 1.

### Imaging of patellar fractures [^113JD2y9]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Pole fractures

Small proximal or distal avulsion-type fractures are important to recognize, since they are often associated with substantial soft tissue injury to the quadriceps or patellar tendon. Distal pole fractures (bony avulsion of the patellar tendon) are extra-articular, since the distal pole is devoid of articular cartilage. In this case, lateral radiographs demonstrate patella alta and increased Insall-Salvati ratio (Fig. 4), while upper pole bony avulsions are associated with low-riding patella, also termed patella baja (reduced Insall-Salvati ratio). In the paediatric population, adolescents are most vulnerable to avulsion fractures because of their increase in muscle strength and relative weakness of osteocartilaginous junctions. In this case, there is a large sleeve of unossified patellar cartilage, which may or may not be accompanied by tiny ossific fragments (Fig. 5). Patellar alignment (alta or baja), location of soft tissue swelling, and joint effusion provide clues to diagnosis.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were as follows: radiographically diagnosed with KOA classified as Kellgren-Lawrence scale grades 1–4 (Additional file 2: Table S1), aged between 50 and 70 years, and exhibited symptoms consistent with meniscal injuries, including positive results on the Lachman and McMurray tests. Eligible participants had to exhibit at least one of the following knee symptoms: clicking, catching, popping, a sense of instability, or pain during pivoting or twisting movements. Furthermore, eligible participants had to show signs of osteophytes, signs of a complete cartilage defect evident on knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or radiographic signs of osteophytes or narrowing of the joint space. Moreover, patients had to have a confirmed meniscal tear that extended to the surface of the meniscus on knee MRI (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Finally, all the participants were required to be able to provide informed consent.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: mental inability to participate; inflammatory joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis; crystal arthropathies, such as gout and pseudogout, that specifically affect the knees; recent infections within the last year associated with knee inflammation; or limitations or pain during activities such as sitting, standing, walking, or climbing stairs that were typically more severe than their KOA. Each patient's medical history was screened for any previous allergic or adverse reactions to corticosteroids; corticosteroid injections were not administered if a patient had a history of allergic or adverse reactions to steroids or steroid injections, had received multiple corticosteroid injections in the same area (even if not within the last year), or had uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Further exclusion criteria were a history of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or uncompartmentalized knee arthroplasty (UKA); severe organ dysfunction, such as cardiovascular diseases classified as class III or higher by the New York Heart Association; chronic kidney disease at level III or above on the basis of their outcome conditions; liver disease with a Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score of 20 or greater; or a lack of informed consent.

### Distal perforator-only propeller (D-POP) anterolateral thigh flap for reconstructions around the knee: 4-year experience [^115gXtme]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Soft tissue reconstruction around the knee is challenging from a functional and aesthetic perspective. While locoregional options remain limited, free flaps produce additional scarring and longer hospitalization. We describe the most distal "D-perforator" of ALT-axis and present our 4-year experience with a distal perforator-only propeller anterolateral thigh (D-POP ALT) flap for reconstruction around the knee.

Methods

Seventeen patients (7 males, 10 females, mean age 57 years), had distal perforator-only propeller (D-POP) ALT flap reconstruction of defects following the wide local excision of melanoma around the knee joint between May 2014 and December 2018. The most distal perforator in the line between spina illiaca anterior superior (SIAS) and the upper lateral border of patella was identified and marked with audible-Doppler and perforator-only propeller ALT (POP-ALT) flap, which was designed around it. Perforators were dissected intramuscularly or intraseptally to allow adequate flap mobilization, but no division of main pedicle was ever performed to ensure anterograde blood supply. Flaps were rotated into defects while all donor-sites were closed directly.

Results

The largest flap measured 25 × 6 cm. The perforator was found between 4 and 9 cm proximal to the upper lateral border of patella in all cases. It was found to be septal in 10 cases and intramuscular in 7 cases. Healing was uneventful in all cases, and patients were ambulatory immediately postoperatively. All patients were discharged on postoperative day 1. Excellent long-term outcomes were observed on follow-up by the senior author.

Conclusions

In our experience, this technique is simple, reliable, and versatile. Thin and pliable flaps can be safely raised based on the most distal (D-POP) ALT perforator. In addition, sizeable flaps can be performed while still preserving the main ALT pedicle, if free flap is required for the same patient in the future.

### Evaluation of patients presenting with knee pain: part I [^112WwUqr]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

MECHANICAL SYMPTOMS The patient should be asked about mechanical symptoms, such as locking, popping, or giving way of the knee. A history of locking episodes suggests a meniscal tear. A sensation of popping at the time of injury suggests ligamentous injury, probably complete rupture of a ligament. Episodes of giving way are consistent with some degree of knee instability and may indicate patellar subluxation or ligamentous rupture. A direct blow to the knee can cause serious injury. Anterior force applied to the proximal tibia with the knee in flexion can cause injury to the posterior cruciate ligament. The medial collateral ligament is most commonly injured as a result of direct lateral force to the knee; this force creates a valgus load on the knee joint and can result in rupture of the medial collateral ligament.

Conversely, a medial blow that creates a varus load can injure the lateral collateral ligament. The knee is then palpated and checked for pain, warmth, and effusion. Point tenderness should be sought, particularly at the patella, tibial tubercle, patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, anterolateral and anteromedial joint line, medial joint line, and lateral joint line. Moving the patient's knee through a short arc of motion helps identify the joint lines. Range of motion should be assessed by extending and flexing the knee as far as possible.
5. A patellar apprehension test is then performed. With fingers placed at the medial aspect of the patella, the physician attempts to sublux the patella laterally. If this maneuver reproduces the patient's pain or a giving-way sensation, patellar subluxation is the likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

7 Both the superior and inferior patellar facets should be palpated, with the patella subluxed first medially and then laterally. To test the medial meniscus, the tibia is rotated externally, and the knee is extended from maximal flexion to about 90 degrees; added compression to the medial meniscus can be produced by placing varus stress across the knee joint while the knee is being extended. A positive test produces a thud or a click, or causes pain in a reproducible portion of the range of motion.

### Prospective study of a' popping' sound during percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma [^111zxhN4]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To prospectively evaluate the occurrence of a 'popping' sound during radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its association with early tumor progression and patient survival.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-six patients with 100 tumors underwent RF ablation by using an internally cooled electrode. A popping sound was defined as an audible sound or tactile vibration detected by the operator during RF ablation. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 38 months (mean, 19 months) and included 3–6 month ultrasonography, serum alpha-fetoprotein measurements, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Early local and distant intrahepatic tumor progression within 12 months and survival were analyzed.

Results

A popping sound occurred during 58 of the 100 (58%) tumor ablations. Primary technique effectiveness was achieved in 97 of the 100 (97%) tumors. Major complications occurred in 2 of the 76 patients (2.6%). The cumulative rate of early local tumor progression was 20.8%. At multivariate analysis, early local tumor progression was associated with tumor size larger than 3 cm (odds ratio [OR] = 4.08, P = 0.012) and inversely associated with a popping sound (OR = 0.267, P = 0.026). The cumulative rate of early distant intrahepatic tumor progression was 21.4%, and the cumulative survival of the whole cohort at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months was 98.7%, 96%, 92.7%, and 83.6%, respectively. A popping sound was not significantly associated with either early distant intrahepatic tumor progression (P = 0.341) or patient survival (P = 0.975).

Conclusions

A popping sound during RF ablation is not associated with an increased risk of early tumor progression or poorer patient survival.

The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (≥ 25%) in the XIAFLEX clinical trials in patients with Peyronie's disease were penile hematoma, penile swelling, and penile pain. Table 5 shows the incidence of adverse reactions that were reported in greater than or equal to 1% of XIAFLEX-treated patients and at a frequency greater than placebo-treated patients after up to 8 injections in the pooled placebo-controlled trials through Day 365.

Severe penile hematoma or severe injection site hematoma were reported in 33/551 (6.0%) of XIAFLEX-treated patients and 0/281 (0%) of placebo-treated patients, in Studies 1 and 2 combined.

Reports of penile "popping" sounds or sensations

A popping noise or popping sensation in the penis, sometimes described as "snapping" or "cracking", and sometimes accompanied by detumescence, hematoma and/or pain, were reported in 73/551 (13.2%) XIAFLEX-treated patients and 1/281 (0.3%) placebo-treated patients.

There were no clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of adverse events following treatment with XIAFLEX based on the severity of baseline erectile dysfunction or concomitant phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor use.

XIAFLEX was not associated with shortening of penile length in clinical trials in the treatment of Peyronie's disease.

### The relationship between landing sound, vertical ground reaction force, and kinematics of the lower limb during drop landings in healthy men [^111USNEM]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study, cross-sectional.

Background

Soft-landing instruction, which is advocated in several injury prevention programs, is thought to have a qualitative relationship with decreased vertical ground reaction forces (vGRFs) and increased lower-limb joint excursions.

Objective

To quantify the relationships among landing sound, vGRFs, and lower-limb kinematics during a drop-landing task.

Methods

Twenty-six asymptomatic men aged 18 to 35 years were asked to perform 15 single-leg drop landings from a 30-cm height. Five trials were collected under 3 sound conditions: normal, quiet, and loud. The vGRF, lower-limb kinematics (sagittal plane), and impact sound were recorded during the deceleration phase.

Results

A simple linear regression revealed a significant relationship between landing sound and vGRF (R² = 0.42, P < .001). A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that ankle and knee excursion significantly increased by 7.0° and 11.7°, respectively, during quiet landing (compared to normal landing; P < .001). During the loud landing condition, ankle joint excursion significantly decreased by 9.4° compared to the normal landing condition (P < .001), and hip joint excursion significantly increased by 4.0° compared to normal landing condition (P < .045).

Conclusion

As landing sound decreases, so does vGRF during a drop-landing task. These reductions were achieved by increasing ankle and knee joint excursions. Conversely, as the landing sound increases, so does vGRF. This was the result of decreasing ankle joint excursion and increasing hip joint excursion.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^116z7fAs]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-Surgical Knee Pain (PSKP)

Background: PSKP can be a difficult condition to diagnose, especially in the acute phase, as reports of pain after surgery are to be expected – it is not until several weeks, or even months, into the postoperative period that a practitioner will begin to suspect something is "wrong". Even then, once any complications with the surgery (ie, infection, prosthesis malfunction, fracture, etc) have been ruled out, the usual assumptions are either malingering or drug seeking. For these reasons, PSKP tends to be underdiagnosed and its true incidence is difficult to measure as many patients reporting symptoms of PSKP are simply taken back to the operating room for subsequent surgeries. For example, many patients who undergo arthroscopic knee surgeries for knee OA eventually undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A systematic review reports the overall incidence of TKA after knee arthroscopy is 2.62% and increases to 3.98% when selecting for older patients. The mean and median time from arthroscopy to TKA was 3.4 and 2.0 years, respectively. Annual revision rates of TKA are 0.49%, compared to revision rates of medial unicompartmental arthroscopy (1.07%), lateral unicompartmental arthroscopy (1.13%), and patellofemoral arthroscopy (1.75%). Nearly 20% of the patients experience suboptimal results following TKA, and residual post-TKA pain is a common complaint. Predictors of increased residual post-TKA pain include other pain sites, catastrophizing, and depression.
Etiology: Post-TKA pain can be caused by intrinsic or extrinsic etiologies. Table 8 outlines the possible causes.
Diagnostic criteria: Assessment of residual post-TKA pain includes detailed history, review of surgical reports, and physical exam. Acuity, onset, nature, exacerbating factors can help distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic causes. Physical exam includes visual inspection including joint alignment, palpation, range of motion, patellar tracking and stability in coronal/sagittal planes during range of motion, gait, and exam of the hip and spine. Preoperative and postoperative radiologic images should be reviewed. Obtain weight bearing anterior-posterior, lateral, and merchant views of the knee. Additionally, weightbearing films of the entire leg, hip, and ankle will assess varus or valgus abnormalities. Diagnostic intra-articular local anesthetic injection will support diagnosis of intra-articular source if pain is relieved within a few minutes of injection.
Treatment: Treating knee pain secondary to surgery can be extremely complicate given the fact that it may not be readily apparent what the pain is consequential to. Is it merely postsurgical discomfort that is taking longer than expected to heal, is it the result of a nerve injury (ie, CRPS Type II), a new pathology created by the surgery itself, or something else entirely? An unfortunate confounding factor that negatively impacts these situations is the presence of opioids as these patients will all inevitably be taking due to their having just had a surgical procedure. As such, multimodal analgesia is the optimal perioperative pain control regimen and reduces long-term opioid use with improved patient outcomes. This includes a combination of preemptive analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia, peripheral nerve blockade, patient controlled analgesia, local infiltration analgesia, and oral opioid/non-opioid medications. Yu et al report discontinuing patient-controlled analgesia and femoral nerve blocks from the multimodal regimen and replacing them with liposomal bupivacaine resulted in less overall opioid consumption, with no difference in functional recovery or reported pain control. In patients with centrally sensitized knee pain prior to TKA, duloxetine should be considered to minimize post-TKA pain. For patients with persistent post-TKA pain, physical therapy, range of motion, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) are conservative measures that are effective. Interventional therapies to consider include nerve blockade, peripheral nerve neuromodulation, and dorsal root ganglion neuromodulation.

Knee Pain and/or Involvement of the Flexor and Extensor Muscles

In the last two decades, the incidence of knee pain has increased by approximately 65%. At the present time, affects around 25% of the adult population and warrants nearly 4 million visits to primary care physicians each year. The assessment of knee pain requires careful consideration of the patient's medical history and physical examination. The medical history can provide vital insights into the site and duration of the discomfort, recent traumatic events, and prior medical and/or surgical procedures. The physical examination can identify potential lymphovascular involvement, deformities, asymmetry, signs of acute inflammation, and limitation of Range Of Motion (R.O.M). Laboratory tests may be utilized to confirm a specific diagnosis when the initial medical history and physical examination provide clues but fail to establish a definitive diagnosis. In contrast, radiographic imaging is most appropriate in cases of acute traumatic pain or chronic knee pain.

Symptoms and Signs

Knee pain can arise in various ways, including acute or chronic forms, occuring only during motion or even at rest, and with or without functional impairments such as weakness, instability, stiffness, inability to fully extend the knee, or difficulty walking. Manifestations of acute inflammation include warmth to the touch, redness, and swelling. Additionally, popping or creaking sounds may be audible.

Possible Differential Diagnoses

Acute trauma or its consequences, acute sprains, direct or indirect muscle injury, pes anserine tendinopathy, Baker's cyst, overuse/overload pathology (including degenerative meniscopathy, early OA, and DOMS in athletes) and phlebo-lymphological pathology can all contribute to knee pain.

Conditions That Warrant Consideration

Beyond the aforementioned factors, body weight, posture modifications, axis deviations, and biomechanical changes are additional conditions worth considering when addressing knee pain.

2.5. Questions about pain characteristics

For each of the marked first-tier regions, the respondent was asked to rate pain onset, episode frequency, episode duration (including constant pain without pause), pain intensity, bothering, and depth of pain (superficial, deep, or both). If the respondent had experienced more than one type of pain within a first-tier region, he or she was asked to rate the pain that had bothered him or her the most.

Onset of pain was assessed with the response options less than 4 weeks, 1 to 2, 3 to 5, 6 to 11 months, 1 to 2, 3 to 5 years, and more than 5 years. Participants reporting more than 5 years in pain were asked to report about their age at pain onset. Episode frequency was reported on a 29-point numeric rating scale (NRS; 0–28 days) (Question: During the last 4 weeks: How many days have you had the pain?). Episode duration within the last 4 weeks (Question: About how much of the day have you usually had the pain? [Only count the time when you are awake]) was assessed with the response options less than 1, 1 to 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 10 hours, more than 10 hours, or all the time, without pause. Pain intensity the last 4 weeks was rated on a NRS with the anchors "No pain" (0) and "The strongest imaginable pain" (10) by answering the question "How strong has the pain usually been?" Similarly, bothering the last 4 weeks was rated on a NRS with the anchors "No bother" (0) and "The greatest imaginable bother" (10), in response to the question "How much has the pain usually bothered you?" Depth of pain was assessed by the question "Where is the pain located?" using the response options "Superficially", "Deeply", "Both of the above", or "I don't know". Participants who reported pain in the lower back were also asked about radiating leg pain (yes/no), the distance of the radiation (hip/buttocks; thigh/knee; lower leg/ankle; heel/sole of the foot; instep/toes), and those with pain radiating to the heel, foot sole, or toes where asked about altered sensation in the painful foot (eg, numbness and tingling) (yes/no).

17.2 Patient Counseling for Peyronie's Disease

Advise patients of the following:

Serious complications of XIAFLEX injection include corporal rupture, penile hematoma and skin and soft tissue necrosis related to penile hematoma, and these events may require surgery to correct the complication.
Acute post-injection back pain reactions have been reported in patients treated with XIAFLEX. Back pain may be mild to severe and may radiate to the legs, chest and arms, may include spasms, and may make walking difficult. Events typically resolve within 15 minutes but may last longer. Patients should report post-injection back pain reactions to their healthcare provider.

After the XIAFLEX injections, instruct the patient:

That their penis may appear bruised and/or swollen
That they may have mild-to-moderate penile pain that can be relieved by taking over-the-counter pain medications
To promptly contact their physician if, at any time, they have severe pain or severe swelling of the penis, severe purple bruising and swelling of the penis, difficulty urinating or blood in the urine, or sudden loss of the ability to maintain an erection. These symptoms may be accompanied by a popping or cracking sound from the penis
To return to their healthcare provider's office when directed for further injection(s) and/or penile modeling procedure(s)
To not have sex between the first and second injections of a treatment cycle
To wait 4 weeks after the second injection of a treatment cycle before resuming sexual activity, provided pain and swelling have subsided
To perform gentle, at home modeling activities, as recommended by their physician
To refrain from using a vacuum erection device during treatment with XIAFLEX
To avoid abdominal straining associated with situations, such as straining during bowel movements

Provide the patient instructions on the appropriate technique to perform penile modeling activities at home, as described in "What You Need to Know About XIAFLEX Treatment for Peyronie's Disease: A Patient Guide", and give the patient a copy.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^111BgDf3]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis & treatment of low back pain — pain diagrams and assessment tools: In patients with low back pain (LBP), the guideline asks whether pain diagram findings differentiate the pain‑causing structure and whether assessment tools or questionnaires identify the cause of acute, subacute or chronic LBP; a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address these questions in this patient population, and the work group feels that in the specifically defined patient population it is unlikely that pain diagrams are going to elucidate the cause of LBP.

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: key points of evaluation and management [^1124MX3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies may be a challenge because overlapping symptoms may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Common complaints of patients who have both hip and lumbar spine pathologies include low back pain with associated buttock, groin, thigh, and, possibly, knee pain. A thorough patient history should be obtained and a complete physical examination should be performed in these patients to identify the primary source of pain. Plain and advanced imaging studies and diagnostic injections can be used to further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate sequence of treatment. Both the surgeon and the patient should understand that, although one pathology is managed, the management of the other pathology may be necessary because of persistent pain. The recognition of both entities may help reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, and the management of both entities in the appropriate sequence may help reduce the likelihood of persistent symptoms.

### Knee pain and mobility impairments: meniscal and articular cartilage lesions [^115LrhLv]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Physical impairment measures — bulge sign evaluates the amount of fluid in the knee joint by visual inspection by a clinician; with one hand superior to the patella pushing tissues inferiorly and maintaining pressure, the other hand presses the medial aspect of the knee just posterior to the patellar edge to move fluid laterally, then the lateral aspect is pressed quickly while watching medially for a fluid wave. The variable is nominal with units absent/present, and reliability shows a reliability coefficient of 0.97 in patients with knee osteoarthritis. In addition to visual inspection, knee effusion can be measured using a tape measure or perometer (an optoelectric device designed to measure limb volume) for knee circumference.

### Is pelvic organ prolapse a cause of pelvic or low back pain? [^114zuwLc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the null hypothesis that there is no association between pelvic organ prolapse and pelvic or low back pain.

Methods

A total of 152 consecutive patients with pelvic organ prolapse completed a visual faces scale to quantify the amount of pelvic or low back pain present. Pelvic organ prolapse severity was graded by three techniques: 1) pelvic organ prolapse quantification staging; 2) descent of the leading edge of prolapse; and 3) dynamic cystoproctography. Linear and nonlinear associations of pelvic organ prolapse quantification staging, descent of the leading edge of prolapse, and dynamic cystoproctography findings with pelvic or low back pain were assessed. We also characterized the nature of any significant nonlinear associations.

Results

Descent of the leading edge of prolapse was linearly associated with low back pain. Patients with greater descent of the leading edge of their prolapse reported less low back pain (r = -0.176, P = 0.034). Bladder descent during dynamic cystoproctography was nonlinearly associated with low back pain (P = 0.037). Neither of these associations was statistically significant after controlling for patient age and prior prolapse surgery. There were no linear or nonlinear associations between pelvic organ prolapse and pelvic pain.

Conclusion

Based on the data, pelvic organ prolapse is not a cause of pelvic or low back pain.

### Hamstring strain injury in athletes [^117TmjAd]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Clinical course of hamstring strain injury (HSI) — presentation and healing phases — includes typical onset features and timelines: An HSI can occur anywhere along the length of the muscle, but occurs most frequently in the proximal biceps femoris at the musculotendinous junction, with an individual experiencing a sudden, sharp pain in the posterior thigh and often an audible or palpable popping sensation during overloading and/or overstretching activity; the recurrence rate of HSI ranges between 13.9% and 63.3% when followed over the same and subsequent seasons. The healing process includes 3 phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling; the inflammation phase occurs immediately after HSI and lasts approximately 3 to 5 days, with phagocytic cells entering 2 to 4 days after injury; the proliferation phase may overlap with inflammation and last up to several weeks; and depending on the extent of the HSI, the remodeling phase can continue for up to 2 years. Early range of motion (ROM) and soft tissue mobilization after injury may help promote more organized scar formation, with fewer adhesions to surrounding tissue, and early hip and knee ROM may contribute to less disorganized scar formation and a lower reinjury rate.

### Snapping knee caused by intra-articular tumors [^115esjf6]. Arthroscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Locking of the knee can present with no history of antecedent injury. We identified impingement of intra-articular tumors in 2 cases. Intra-articular tumors are relatively rare. Mechanical symptoms were present in both cases. On physical examination, there was a palpable mass at the medial region of the patellofemoral joint. The interior had been replaced mainly by amorphous necrotic tissue. The definite diagnosis of a soft-tissue mass of the knee could not be made on histologic examination.
