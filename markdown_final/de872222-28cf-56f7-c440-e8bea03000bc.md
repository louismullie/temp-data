## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what Schamberg disease is clinically and how it is classified. Then, I should verify whether there is a specific ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease or if it falls under a broader category. Next, I will check authoritative coding resources and guidelines to confirm the most accurate code. Finally, I will consider any laterality or encounter-type nuances and provide the code with clear documentation guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Schamberg disease is a pigmented purpuric dermatosis, also called progressive pigmentary dermatosis, characterized by chronic, benign, brown-orange patches with petechiae, typically on the lower extremities, and often persistent or recurrent over years [^607f2bd4].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM landscape for pigmented purpuric dermatoses. I initially thought there might be a specific code for Schamberg disease, but hold on, I should verify that against the tabular list and coding tools. I need to check whether ICD-10-CM includes a named entry for Schamberg disease or if it is captured under a more general category for pigmented purpuric dermatosis or other specified vascular disorders of the skin.

> I will now examine the most specific available code. The closest, clinically appropriate ICD-10-CM code is L81.7, which corresponds to "pigmented purpuric dermatosis". This umbrella term encompasses Schamberg disease, Majocchi purpura, and other variants, and is the standard code used when the specific eponym is not explicitly listed in ICD-10-CM [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify laterality and encounter-type requirements. Let me check the tabular guidance: L81.7 does not require a 7th character for laterality or encounter type, so a single code suffices regardless of site or initial versus subsequent encounter, which simplifies coding for this condition [^notfound].

> Next, I should review documentation best practices to support coding accuracy. I need to ensure the record clearly states "pigmented purpuric dermatosis" or "Schamberg disease" so coders can assign L81.7 confidently; if the eponym is used, it is reasonable to parenthetically note the clinical synonym to avoid ambiguity during review [^notfound].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final code. The ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease is L81.7, with no additional characters required for laterality or encounter type, and documentation should reflect the diagnosis as pigmented purpuric dermatosis or Schamberg disease to support coding accuracy [^notfound].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease is **L81.7** (pigmented purpuric dermatosis). This code applies to Schamberg disease and other pigmented purpuric dermatoses, and does not require laterality or additional characters. Accurate documentation of the specific diagnosis supports correct coding and billing [^notfound].

## Clinical description of Schamberg disease

Schamberg disease, also known as progressive pigmentary dermatosis or Schamberg's purpura, is a chronic, benign vascular disorder characterized by:

- **Appearance**: Orange-brown patches with pinpoint petechiae ("cayenne pepper" spots), typically on the lower extremities [^notfound].
- **Course**: Chronic, recurrent, and often asymptomatic or mildly pruritic.
- **Histology**: Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with red blood cell extravasation and hemosiderin deposition.

## ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease

The ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease is **L81.7**, defined as pigmented purpuric dermatosis. This code encompasses Schamberg disease and related entities such as Majocchi's disease and Gougerot-Blum syndrome.

---

## Coding guidelines and documentation requirements

When coding Schamberg disease using ICD-10-CM, the following guidelines and documentation requirements apply:

- **Specific diagnosis**: Document "Schamberg disease" or "pigmented purpuric dermatosis" explicitly in the medical record.
- **Laterality**: Not required for L81.7, as this code does not specify laterality.
- **Additional characters**: No additional characters or extensions are required for this code.

---

## Clinical implications of accurate coding

Accurate coding of Schamberg disease using ICD-10-CM has several clinical implications:

- **Reimbursement**: Ensures appropriate billing and reimbursement for clinical services.
- **Epidemiology**: Facilitates accurate tracking of disease prevalence and incidence.
- **Research**: Enables identification of patients for clinical studies and research.

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for Schamberg disease is **L81.7** (pigmented purpuric dermatosis). Accurate documentation and coding are essential for appropriate clinical management, reimbursement, and epidemiological tracking.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

In recent months, organized medicine has been consumed by the anticipated transition to the 10th iteration of the International Classification of Disease system. Implementation has come and gone without the disruptive effects predicted by many. Despite the fundamental role the International Classification of Disease system plays in health care delivery and payment policy, few neuroradiologists are familiar with the history of its implementation and implications beyond coding for diseases.

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

ICD-10 CM (International Classification of Diseases [ICD] Clinical Modification) visual field defect codes include a directive to "Code any associated underlying cause of the blindness first". For Scotoma involving central area, codes are H53.411 (right eye), H53.412 (left eye), H53.413 (bilateral), and H53.419 (unspecified eye). Homonymous bilateral field defects are coded as H53.461 (right eye), H53.462 (left eye), and H53.469 (unspecified side). Heteronymous bilateral field defects use H53.47. Generalized contraction of visual field is coded H53.481 (right eye), H53.482 (left eye), H53.483 (bilateral), and H53.489 (unspecified eye).

### Global classification of mast cell activation disorders: an ICD-10-CM-adjusted proposal of the ECNM-AIM consortium [^4eb4edcb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Mast cell activation (MCA) is common and occurs in a number of pathologic conditions, including IgE-dependent and independent allergic reactions, atopic disorders, autoimmune processes, and mastocytosis. In a subset of patients, no underlying disease and no known trigger of MCA are found. When the symptoms are severe, systemic, and recurrent, and accompanied by a diagnostic increase in the serum tryptase level or other mast cell mediators, an MCA syndrome (MCAS) may be diagnosed. In these patients, the symptoms typically respond to drugs suppressing MCA, mediator production in mast cells, or mediator effects. In each case, diagnostic consensus criteria must be fulfilled to diagnose MCAS. In other patients, MCA may be local, less severe, or less acute, or may be suspected but not confirmed, so that the diagnostic criteria of MCAS are not fulfilled. In these patients, it may be difficult to prove MCA, for example, by measuring multiple mast cell mediators or basophil activation, the latter as a surrogate of IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. However, validated diagnostic criteria for implicating suspected MCA behind such conditions are lacking, even if some of these conditions have recently been assigned to an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification code (ICD-10-CM). In this article, we discuss diagnostic features and criteria and propose a ICD-10-CM-adjusted classification for disorders associated with MCA, herein referred to as MCA disorders (MCADs), with special emphasis on the delineation between confirmed MCAS, MCAD not fulfilling MCAS criteria, and suspected MCAD that is not present. In addition, we discuss the discrimination between overt MCAD and predisposing conditions, such as atopic states, mastocytosis, and hereditary alpha tryptasemia.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^c5bd4139]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

ICD-10-CM laterality and 7th-character rules — Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and a placeholder X is required if a code needing a 7th character is not 6 characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the code indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When laterality is specified in the diagnosis code, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^953a5a45]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The conversion from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM was the largest change to health care coding in America in the last 30 years. While ICD-10 was approved in 1990 and had been utilized in several countries since as early as 1994, its use only became required in the United States on October 1, 2015. The version used in the United States has several significant modifications suggested during an open comment period and via a field test performed by The American Hospital Association and the American Health Information Management Association. ICD-10-CM, as the version is known, added many more codes than the original World Health Organization version used prior to adoption in the United States. The Department of Health and Human Services originally planned to instate ICD-10 on October 1, 2011, but its implementation met resistance. The American Medical Association feared that the costs of implementing ICD-10 would be extreme and could even put smaller practices out of business. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the date to October 1, 2013. Two additional delays led to the final implementation date of October 1, 2015.

Each ICD-10 code has space for seven characters, an increase from the five available in ICD-9. The nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes available in ICD-10 provide a much greater level of detail than the 14,500 codes available in ICD-9, and mapping diagnoses from one to the other is often convoluted and rarely straightforward. Included in the increased details are codes that specify laterality and severity of disease, features that have a substantial effect on coding in ophthalmology. The increased level of detail is projected to lead to an eventual decrease in denied claims. Unfortunately, this decrease in rejected claims is expected to occur after a period of increased rejected claims lasting from 6 months to 3 years as coders adapt to the new system.–The more detailed information available from ICD-10 codes is also predicted to more easily identify fraud and abuse, give insurance companies more accurate information in order to make coverage decisions, and improve public health monitoring and research. Notably a dually coded database in Canada showed no improvement in the validity of coding with ICD-10 compared to ICD-9. However, a Swedish study did show continual improvement in the accuracy of recording conditions using ICD-10 over a 5-year period related to a coding learning curve.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^424d245d]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — ICD-10 CM classifications and coding rules include the following: open-angle glaucoma is coded as H40.10X-; primary open-angle glaucoma uses H40.111-, H40.112-, or H40.113-; low-tension glaucoma uses H40.121-, H40.122-, or H40.123-; residual stage of open-angle glaucoma uses H40.151, H40.152, or H40.153; and glaucomatous atrophy of the optic disc uses H47.231, H47.232, or H47.233. The footnote defines " = 0, stage unspecified; 1, mild stage; 2, moderate stage; 3, severe stage; 4, indeterminate stage". Additional ICD-10 CM instructions state that certain categories require a "7th character" and, if needed, "a placeholder X must be used" to ensure it is in the seventh position, that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality" and if no bilateral code exists "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and that laterality mapping is standardized as "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^cd799048]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye ICD-10 CM classifications — entities and codes include: Dry eye, unspecified, right lacrimal gland H04.121; left lacrimal gland H04.122; bilateral lacrimal gland H04.123; keratoconjunctivitis sicca (not specified as Sjögren) H16.22-; Sjögren syndrome, sicca syndrome M35.00; Sjögren syndrome with keratoconjunctivitis M35.01; filamentary keratitis H16.12-; exposure keratoconjunctivitis H16.21-; punctate keratitis H11.14-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, and the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct; the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder x must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^d40700dd]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal arterial occlusion ICD-10 CM codes — Central retinal artery occlusion includes H34.11, H34.12, and H34.13; arterial branch occlusion includes H34.231, H34.232, and H34.233; partial retinal artery occlusion includes H34.211, H34.212, and H34.213; and transient retinal artery occlusion includes H34.01, H34.02, and H34.03. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality, and if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, with unspecified codes used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, regardless of which digit it is found in, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3; ICD = International Classification of Diseases and CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^a400e9f3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There was no overall difference in coder efficiency in the 1-year periods before and after ICD-10 implementation (P = 0.76). However, we noted a reduction in coder efficiency during the first 4 months (October 2015 to January 2016) after ICD-10 conversion, which returned to baseline for the remaining 8 months (Figure 2).

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^e0159918]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### Posterior vitreous detachment, retinal breaks, and lattice degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^ab59a3b4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes — precursors to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and related entities are mapped between ICD-9 CM and ICD-10 CM, including break, unspecified (361.00; H33.00-), break, giant (361.03; H33.03-), vitreous detachment/degeneration (379.21; H43.81-), and retinal break without detachment types such as retinal break, unspecified (361.30; H33.30-), horseshoe tear (361.32; H33.31-), and round hole (361.31; H33.32-), as well as retinal dialysis (361.04; H33.04-) and lattice degeneration of the retina (362.63; H35.41-). Additional information for ICD-10 CM states that certain categories have applicable 7th characters and that "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used", and that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; the table specifies " = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral", and that "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^d719b817]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study suggest that the transition to ICD-10-CM in October 2015 was associated with changes in levels and trends for most diagnostic categories in 3 common diagnostic classification systems. While the broad categories used in WHO disease chapters showed only small changes at the transition, numerous large changes (ie, ≥ 20%) in diagnostic category prevalence occurred in the more detailed HHS-HCCs and AHRQ-CCS categories. These 2 classification systems have been widely adopted by health care organizations for many purposes. Given the frequent, large discontinuities in diagnostic category prevalence rates that we identified, predictive models and diagnostic category mappings developed for ICD-9-CM should be refined for ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for health care payment, performance assessment, or disease surveillance.

### Necessity and implications of ICD-10: facts and fallacies [^9d2fadcf]. Pain Physician (2011). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10 is a new system that is expected to be implemented effective on October 1, 2013. This new system is a federally mandated change affecting all payers and providers, and is expected to exceed both the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Y2K in terms of costs and risks. However, the Administration is poised to implement these changes at a rapid pace which could be problematic for health care in the United States. In 2003, HIPAA named ICD-9 as the code set for supporting diagnoses and procedures in electronic administrative transactions. However, on January 16, 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a regulation requiring the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as of October 1, 2013. While ICD-9 and 10 have a similar type of hierarchy in their structures, the ICD-10 is more complex and incorporates numerous changes. Overall, ICD-10 contains over 141,000 codes, a whopping 712% increase over the less than 20,000 codes in ICD-9, creating enormous complexities, confusion, and expense. Multiple published statistics illustrate that there are approximately 119 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 100 distinct ICD-10 codes, whereas there are 255 instances where a single ICD-9 code can map to more than 50 ICD-10 codes. To add to the confusion, there are 3,684 instances in the mapping for diseases where a single ICD-10 code can map to more than one ICD-9 code. Proponents of the new ICD-10 system argue that the granularity should lead to improvements in the quality of health care, since more precise coding that more accurately reflects actual patient conditions will permit smarter and more effective disease management in pay-for-performance programs. This, in essence, encapsulates the benefits that supporters of this new system believe will be realized, even though many of these experts may not be involved in actual day-to-day medical practices. Detractors of the system see the same granularity as burdensome. The estimated cost per physician is projected to range from $25,000 to $50,000. Further, they argue that the ICD-10 classification is extremely complicated, and expensive. Concerns exist that it is being implemented without establishing either the necessity or thinking through the unintended consequences. Opponents also argue that beyond financial expense, it is also costly in terms of human toll, hardware and software expenses and has the potential to delay reimbursement. There is also concern that an unintended consequence of granularity would be the potential for enhanced and unnecessary fraud and abuse investigations. The authors of this article favor postponing the implementation of the ICD-10 until such time as its necessity is proven and implications are understood.

### Idiopathic epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction preferred practice pattern® guidelines [^b546b23f]. Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for epiretinal membrane and vitreomacular traction are as follows: Epiretinal membrane — ICD-9 CM 362.56; ICD-10 CM H35.371, H35.372, H35.373. Vitreomacular traction, adhesion — ICD-9 CM 379.27; ICD-10 CM H43.821, H43.822, H43.823. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned; unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^7e2b2302]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To update and validate the Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (RDCI) utilizing International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes.

Methods

We defined ICD-9-CM (n = 1,068) and ICD-10-CM (n = 1,425) era cohorts (n = 862 in both) spanning the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition in a multicenter, prospective rheumatoid arthritis registry. Information regarding comorbidities was collected from linked administrative data over 2-year assessment periods. An ICD-10-CM code list was generated from crosswalks and clinical expertise. ICD-9- and ICD-10-derived RDCI scores were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The predictive ability of the RDCI for functional status and death during follow-up was assessed using multivariable regression models and goodness-of-fit statistics (Akaike's information criterion [AIC] and quasi information criterion [QIC]) in both cohorts.

Results

Mean ± SD RDCI scores were 2.93 ± 1.72 in the ICD-9-CM cohort and 2.92 ± 1.74 in the ICD-10-CM cohort. RDCI scores had substantial agreement in individuals who were in both cohorts (ICC 0.71 [95% confidence interval 0.68–0.74]). Prevalence of comorbidities was similar between cohorts with absolute differences < 6%. Higher RDCI scores were associated with a greater risk of death and poorer functional status during follow-up in both cohorts. Similarly, in both cohorts, models including the RDCI score had the lowest QIC (functional status) and AIC (death) values, indicating better model performance.

Conclusion

The newly proposed ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI-generated comparable RDCI scores to those derived from ICD-9-CM codes and are highly predictive of functional status and death. The proposed ICD-10-CM codes for the RDCI can be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research spanning the ICD-10-CM era.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Breathing (and coding?) a bit easier: changes to international classification of disease coding for pulmonary hypertension [^66f72f62]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system is broadly used by health-care providers, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to track health trends and statistics at the global, national, and local levels and to provide a reimbursement framework for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current iteration of the ICD system, the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), was implemented in 2015. Although many changes to the prior ICD, Ninth Revision system were included in the ICD-10 system, the newer revision failed to adequately reflect advances in the clinical classification of certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, a proposal to modify the ICD-10 codes for PH was considered and ultimately adopted for inclusion as an update to the ICD-10 coding system. Although these revisions better reflect the current clinical classification of PH, in the future, further changes should be considered to improve the accuracy and ease of coding for all forms of PH.

### Simulation of ICD-9 to ICD-10-CM transition for family medicine: simple or convoluted? [^3f7280a1]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of the transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to Interactional Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), on family medicine and to identify areas where additional training might be required.

Methods

Family medicine ICD-9-CM codes were obtained from an Illinois Medicaid data set (113,000 patient visits and $5.5 million in claims). Using the science of networks, we evaluated each ICD-9-CM code used by family medicine physicians to determine whether the transition was simple or convoluted. A simple transition is defined as 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to 1 ICD-10-CM code, or 1 ICD-9-CM code mapping to multiple ICD-10-CM codes. A convoluted transition is where the transitions between coding systems is nonreciprocal and complex, with multiple codes for which definitions become intertwined. Three family medicine physicians evaluated the most frequently encountered complex mappings for clinical accuracy.

Results

Of the 1635 diagnosis codes used by family medicine physicians, 70% of the codes were categorized as simple, 27% of codes were convoluted, and 3% had no mapping. For the visits, 75%, 24%, and 1% corresponded with simple, convoluted, and no mapping, respectively. Payment for submitted claims was similarly aligned. Of the frequently encountered convoluted codes, 3 diagnosis codes were clinically incorrect, but they represent only < 0.1% of the overall diagnosis codes.

Conclusions

The transition to ICD-10-CM is simple for 70% or more of diagnosis codes, visits, and reimbursement for a family medicine physician. However, some frequently used codes for disease management are convoluted and incorrect, and for which additional resources need to be invested to ensure a successful transition to ICD-10-CM.

Conclusions

This diagnostic modeling study describes and tests a new classification system that maps ICD-10-CM codes into a rich set of diagnostic items (referred to as DXIs), far more fully exploiting ICD-10-CM 's expanded diagnostic detail than widely used existing models. The DXI system predicts key spending and utilization outcomes more accurately than the existing models, potentially enabling improved plan payment, health services research, cost-effectiveness studies, quality reporting, and disease surveillance.

### Corneal edema and opacification preferred practice pattern ® [^14409d67]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Corneal opacification — ICD-10 CM classifications list minor corneal opacity H17.81-, peripheral corneal opacity H17.82-, central corneal opacity H17.1-, and phthisical cornea A18.59, H44.52-. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; the applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, assign separate codes for both the left and right side, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality (i.e., 4th digit, 5th digit, or 6th digit), Right is always 1, Left is always 2, and Bilateral is always 3.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### Diabetic retinopathy preferred practice pattern ® [^cb9e26bb]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) ICD coding — severe nonproliferative and diabetic macular edema mappings are listed as follows: ICD-9 CM 362.06 corresponds to ICD-10 CM codes "E10.341- Type 1 with macular edema", "E10.349- Type 1 without macular edema", "E11.341- Type 2 with macular edema", "E11.349- Type 2 without macular edema", "E13.341- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR with macular edema", and "E13.349- other specified types of diabetes mellitus with severe nonproliferative DR without macular edema". For diabetic macular edema, ICD-9 CM 362.07 corresponds to ICD-10 CM "E10.321 Type 1 mild nonproliferative DR", "E10.331 Type 1 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E10.341 Type 1 severe nonproliferative DR", "E10.351 Type 1 proliferative DR", "E11.321 Type 2 mild nonproliferative DR", "E11.331 Type 2 moderate nonproliferative DR", "E11.341 Type 2 severe nonproliferative DR", "E11.351 Type 2 proliferative DR", "E13.321 other specified diabetes mellitus with mild nonproliferative DR", and "E13.331 other specified diabetes mellitus with moderate nonproliferative DR". Additional information states: "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 6th characters. In the DR series, indicate 'with or without' macular edema. Laterality indicators are not required in this series", with "1 = with macular edema" and "9 = without macular edema". It further specifies, "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available".

### Survival strategies for tsunami of ICD-10-CM for interventionalists: pursue or perish! [^f1ee71f0]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The unfunded mandate for the implementation of International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) is scheduled October 1, 2015. The development of ICD-10-CM has been a complicated process. We have endeavored to keep Interventional Pain Management doctors apprised via a variety of related topical manuscripts. The major issues relate to the lack of formal physician participation in its preparation. While the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Hospital Association (AHA) as active partners in its preparation. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are major players; 3M and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are also involved. The cost of ICD-10-CM implementation is high, similar to the implementation of electronic health records (EHRs), likely consuming substantial resources. While ICD-10, utilized worldwide, includes 14,400 different codes, ICD-10-CM, specific for the United States, has expanded to 144,000 codes, which also includes procedural coding system. It is imperative for physicians to prepare for the mandatory implementation. Conversion from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding in interventional pain management is not a conversion of one to one that can be easily obtained from software packages. It is a both a difficult and time-consuming task with each physician, early on, expected to spend on estimation at least 10 minutes per visit on extra coding for established and new patients. For interventional pain physicians, there have been a multitude of changes, including creation of new codes and confusing conversion of existing codes. This manuscript describes a variety of codes that are relevant to interventional pain physicians and often utilized in daily practices. It is our objective that this manuscript will provide coding assistance to interventional pain physicians.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^8b6d266d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system with clinical modifications (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures associated with health care utilization. The pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) classification system uses ICD codes to determine the presence of 1 or more CCCs (10 body-system categories) and includes posttransplant and technology variables to signify additional complexity (Box). The open-source code CCC system is the most widely used classification system to study patients younger than 18 years with medical complexities. The CCC system has evolved alongside the ICD system and must account for updates in the underlying ICD codes: CCC version 1 (V1)corresponded to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and version 2 (V2) to the transition to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Since implementation of the ICD-10-CM in the US in 2015, however, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The CCC system thus required a major update to capture the full spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^b80625ec]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we aimed to translate the ICD-9-CM codes defined for the RDCI to ICD-10-CM and validate its predictive ability for the key long-term rheumatic disease outcomes of mortality and functional status. We created a set of ICD-10-CM codes that generated comparable RDCI scores and individual comorbidity prevalence estimates to those derived from ICD-9-CM codes within a large, multicenter RA registry, then tested the predictive ability of the RDCI score using the ICD-10-CM code set. We found the ICD-10-CM code set was able to predict mortality and functional status as well as the ICD-9-CM codes. With the updated codes (Table 1), the RDCI can continue to be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research utilizing ICD-10-CM era data.

After assembling an ICD-10-CM code set using a cross walk and clinical expertise, we calculated RDCI scores for RA cohorts spanning ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM time periods. RDCI scores were comparable between cohorts (mean scores of 2.93 vs. 2.92) and, among individuals observed during both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras, RDCI scores had substantial agreement (K = 0.71). Similarly, when we assessed the prevalence of individual comorbidities between coding systems, the absolute differences were quite small (all < 6%). While evaluating individuals in both cohorts, we discovered that agreement between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM varied across individual conditions. Individual conditions with greater chronicity had stronger agreement than acute conditions. For example, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and depression (chronic conditions) all had at least substantial agreement (K > 0.60). In contrast, ulcer or GI problem and fracture of the spine, hip, or leg (acute conditions) had fair and slight agreement (K = 0.27, K = 0.13). We postulate the superior agreement for the more chronic conditions is primarily the result of these conditions being continually addressed and recorded during clinical encounters. However, it is also possible that medical care for acute conditions may have occurred solely outside the VA system. Finally, the variability in agreement may be related to differences in the prevalence of these conditions, with those having the lowest prevalence also having poorer agreement.

### Evaluation of the ICD-10 system in coding revascularisation procedures in patients with peripheral arterial disease in england: a retrospective cohort study using national administrative and clinical databases [^f80a45f0]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Other countries have addressed the deficiencies of the ICD-10 classification by using modified versions of ICD-10, such as the ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) in the United Statesand the German Modification of the ICD-10 (ICD-10-GM) in Germany(Table 4). These extended ICD-10 classifications include subcodes which provide more details about the diagnosis. For example, in the German ICD-10-GM, the I70.2 diagnostic code (Atherosclerosis of the arteries of the extremities) includes seven sub-codes corresponding to the stages of the Fontaine classification, an established classification system for peripheral arterial disease. This information has been used in the development of a risk prediction model for amputations in the PAD patient cohort. The ICD-10-CM classification system used in the US also has subcodes of the I70.2 diagnostic code, which capture the patients' clinical presentation (intermittent claudication, rest pain, ulceration, gangrene). Clinicians in the US recently led an update to the inclusion terms of the existing codes in ICD-10-CM to specifically mention CLTI, making it easier for hospital coders and coding software to allocate the most appropriate code and reduce inconsistencies across healthcare providers. Adding the term "Acute Limb Ischaemia" to the description or inclusion criteria for the ICD-10 code I.74 (Embolism and Thrombosis) may provide clarity for clinical coders.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^593e9e91]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Study design and patient population

We performed a cohort study within the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) registry. This study has been approved by the NWIHCS VA Subcommittee of Human Studies (IRB). The VARA registry is a multicenter prospective cohort of U.S. veterans, > 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with RA by a rheumatologist and fulfill the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria. We assembled ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts within VARA over two separate time periods immediately before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM to represent the different classification eras in the U.S. (Figure 1). A subgroup of patients was included in both cohorts. Within each period, the initial two years were designated as comorbidity ascertainment (ICD-9-CM: October 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015; ICD-10-CM: January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017). Patients were then followed from the index date (ICD-9-CM: October 1, 2015; ICD-10-CM: January 1, 2018) up to December 31, 2021, termed the outcome observation period. A three-month gap between the introduction of ICD-10-CM in the U.S. and the start of our ICD-10-CM cohort was implemented to account for healthcare systems and providers acclimating to the new coding system.

For the current study, VARA participants were included if they were alive as of the index date, had enrolled in the VA at least two years prior to the index date, and had at least one VARA visit during the two years prior to the index date. Participants could contribute to both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts.

Translating ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM codes

We translated the previously validated ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM codes using tools available from the websitesand. The websites are owned and operated by Alkaline Software and the tools provide comprehensive lists of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, as well as suggested conversions between the two classification systems. Utilizing these tools, a list of potential ICD-10-CM codes and their descriptions for each comorbidity in the RDCI was generated (Table 1). The list was reviewed by a physician for clinical relevance and accuracy.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification for the pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physician [^d06e16db]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

After a patient encounter, the physician uses two coding systems to bill for the service rendered to the patient. The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is used to describe the encounter or procedure. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code is used to describe the diagnosis(es) of the patient. On October 1, 2015, ICD-9-CM coding will end, and all physicians will be required to use a new diagnostic coding system, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). This article describes the new diagnostic coding system and how it differs from the old system. There are resources and costs involved for physicians and physician practices to prepare properly for ICD-10-CM. Similar to other important events, the more thorough the preparation, the more likely a positive outcome will occur. Resource use is very important in preparation for the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM. Greater familiarity with ICD-10-CM plus a thorough, effective preparation will lead to reduced costs and a smooth transition. Coding descriptor changes and additional codes occur in ICD-10-CM for chronic bronchitis and emphysema, asthma, and respiratory failure. These changes will affect the coding of these diseases and disorders by physicians. Because the number of codes will increase more than fivefold, the complexity of documentation to support ICD-10-CM will increase substantially. The documentation in the patient's chart to support the ICD-10-CM codes used will need to be enhanced. The requirement for accurate and comprehensive documentation cannot be emphasized enough. All of the coding and documentation changes will be a challenge to pulmonary, critical care, and sleep physicians. They must be prepared fully when ICD-10-CM coding begins and ICD-9-CM coding stops abruptly on October 1, 2015.

### Interrupted time series analysis of cannabis coding in Colorado during the ICD-10-CM transition [^1aa0b7d6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Trends in cannabis and psychodysleptic codes across the transition to ICD-10-CM may be actual trends or may result from systematic biasses introduced by the change in coding systems. This analysis did not assess the sensitivity or specificity of cannabis ICD-10-CM codes and therefore cannot quantify effects due to the change in coding system verses actual trends in discharges involving cannabis. However, level changes observed at the time of the transition to ICD-10-CM are difficult to explain by other external factors. As ICD-10-CM continues to be used, it is possible changes in coding patterns over time could be from implementation and training on the new coding system. The ICD-10-CM system is complex and coding to include the new information like cannabis intoxication or mental health symptoms may take longer to adopt. Examining these more specific codes individually over time may be biassed by coder learning curves. Despite these limitations, the expansion and increased specificity of cannabis codes in ICD-10-CM will strengthen the ability to conduct surveillance of cannabis-related adverse health events. Over time, it is expected that coding practice will stabilise, and true trends will become apparent. However, trends observed in the early years of the ICD-10-CM coding system should be interpreted with caution.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^627e2dfb]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis ICD-10 CM classifications — The appendix lists ICD-10 classifications for conjunctivitis-related entities, including Conjunctivitis, other diseases of conjunctiva caused by viruses with H10.011 – H10.813 (approximately 65 codes in this range) and noting Code first underlying virus or chemical and intent; examples include blepharoconjunctivitis H10.50-, H10.51-, H10.53-, Zika virus A92.5, measles B05.81, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis H10.45, vernal conjunctivitis H10.44, atopic conjunctivitis H10.1-, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) H10.41-, adenoviral conjunctivitis B30.1, herpes simplex virus (HSV) conjunctivitis B00.53, varicella (herpes) zoster virus (VZV) conjunctivitis B02.31, molluscum contagiosum B08.1, bacterial conjunctivitis (including nongonococcal and gonococcal) H10.89, chlamydial conjunctivitis A74.0, ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid (OMMP) L12.1, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) D89.810, D89.811, D89.812, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) L51.3, conjunctival chalasis H11.82, and SARS-COVID 19 U07.1; laterality is indicated where (-) = 1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^0c0feee4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

The transition to ICD-10 afforded the potential of increased granularity of inflammatory arthritides diagnosis codes for clinical care, research, and billing purposes. This quality improvement study found that, despite a 30-fold increase in codes, adoption of ICD-10 has been poor; only 2.1% of available codes were used more than 1% of the time and were nonspecific. This may reflect the lack of financial incentive for accurate ICD-10 coding, because ICD-10 is not tied to reimbursement.

When assessed by year, the percentage of codes used with regularity did not increase. When assessed by clinician specialty, the percentage of codes used was not better for rheumatologists (who might be expected to be more refined users of such codes) than primary care clinicians. This study is limited by potential coding inaccuracies and cannot establish causality.

Overall, consistent with findings in other areas, the data suggest room for better application of inflammatory arthritis codes. This will be important in years to come if the benefits of ICD expansion are to be realized.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^f6832853]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

Methods

This cross-sectional study was deemed exempt from review and the requirement of informed consent by the NORC Institutional Review Board. The reporting of this research follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

ICD-10-CM Code Identification

We searched PubMed for articles published from 2012 to 2022, with all-cause dementia or ADRD as a primary exposure or primary outcome, or where the research population of interest was persons living with all-cause dementia or ADRD (eAppendix in Supplement 1). We found 28 studies utilizing 20 distinct researcher-developed ICD-10-CM or prescription drug code algorithms in addition to the CCW algorithm (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).,

We extracted 43 ICD-10-CM codes and 5 prescription drugs across algorithms (Table 1 and eTable 1 in Supplement 1). We shared the codes with 3 clinicians (2 neurology clinicians and 1 geriatrics clinician) who provide care to persons living with dementia, who recommended excluding 8 codes deemed to not indicate dementia (Table 1). We grouped the remaining codes into tiers by use frequency (tier 1, ≥ 15 algorithms; tier 2, 10–14 algorithms; tier 3, 5–9 algorithms; and tier 4, 1–4 algorithms). We designated prescriptions for ADRD-targeting drugs as indicated by National Drug Codes (NDC) without presence of an ADRD ICD-10-CM code as tier 5.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^d94d131b]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Others have similarly developed ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices developed during the ICD-9-CM era. Quan et al. constructed ICD-10-CM coding algorithms for the Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities using Canadian administrative data. They found the frequency of most comorbidities to be similar between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding algorithms and the ICD-10-CM code set to either match or outperform the ICD-9-CM versions in predicting in-hospital mortality. As in our study, peptic ulcer disease was a condition that differed in frequency between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM. Glasheen et al. have since updated the ICD-10-CM coding for the Charlson Comorbidity Index, validating the predictive performance of ICD-10-CM codes for hospital admission and mortality. Sears and Rundell developed updated ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code lists for the Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI), assessing concordance before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM. The frequency of individual comorbidities was consistent between coding algorithms for thirteen of eighteen comorbidities. While the Functional Comorbidity Index retained predictive value for hospital length of stay with ICD-10-CM codes, there was an interaction between the index and coding algorithm suggesting modest reduced performance with ICD-10-CM codes. Our findings are in agreement with these studies; appropriate ICD-10-CM code sets for comorbidity indices can have concordance with ICD-9-CM versions and retain predictive value for health outcomes.

Comorbidity burden is a crucial determinant of long-term outcomes that include mortality and functional status among people with rheumatic diseases (,–). Thus, we tested the validity of the ICD-10-CM codes by assessing the predictive ability of the RDCI score for mortality and functional status. As expected, higher RDCI scores, indicating a greater comorbidity burden, were associated with higher mortality risk and poorer functional status during follow-up in both the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM cohorts. Moreover, metrics of overall model performance (AIC, QICu) for predicting these same outcomes in each cohort also showed substantial improvement when the RDCI was included. Together, these findings demonstrate that the RDCI calculated with the proposed ICD-10-CM codes maintains expected predictive value for key long-term outcomes.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^12e9dff6]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Line coding

For the line coding, 18 diagnostic terms ("lines") were selected to reflect the range of chronic pain conditions relevant for morbidity coding, and reference codes were prepared for the ICD-11 as well as for the ICD-10. For the ICD-11, reference standards were the 2017 MMS codes. For the ICD-10, only in 50% of the cases a reference standard existed; in the other cases, the "correct" diagnosis was an auxiliary way of expressing the syndrome in ICD-10. The auxiliary code consisted of a combination of etiological codes plus some code for chronic pain (R52.1 or R52.2) (cf S1, Supplementary information, available at). The auxiliary codes were allowed to give the ICD-10 the best chance despite the large number of missing diagnoses for chronic pain.

For each line presented, the participant had to determine the appropriate codes in the ICD-10 (using a link to the ICD-10 browser, 2016 version) and the ICD-11 (using a link to 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 MMS and a special coding tool). The starting point (ICD-10 or ICD-11) was randomized. After coding the lines, the participants were asked whether they had encountered any difficulty in assigning the code (yes or no); whether the level of specificity was appropriate (not detailed enough or just right or too detailed); and whether they had experienced any ambiguity in making the assignment (no or yes, because…).

### Bacterial keratitis preferred practice pattern ® [^3a864023]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — ICD-10 CM classifications and laterality rules include the following: Entities coded under bacterial keratitis include corneal ulcer, unspecified (H16.00-), marginal corneal ulcer (H16.04-), ring corneal ulcer (H16.02-), central corneal ulcer (H16.01-), hypopyon ulcer (H16.03-), perforated corneal ulcer (H16.07-), unspecified corneal edema (H18.20), contact lens keratitis (H18.82-), and bacterial keratitis (H16.8). Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters; "The applicable 7th character is required for all codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct", "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field", and "If a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### A conceptual framework for the revision of the ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders [^b3bb9ec6]. World Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is revising the ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders, under the leadership of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse and within the framework of the overall revision framework as directed by the World Health Assembly. This article describes WHO's perspective and priorities for mental and behavioural disorders classification in ICD-11, based on the recommendations of the International Advisory Group for the Revision of ICD-10 Mental and Behavioural Disorders. The WHO considers that the classification should be developed in consultation with stakeholders, which include WHO member countries, multidisciplinary health professionals, and users of mental health services and their families. Attention to the cultural framework must be a key element in defining future classification concepts. Uses of the ICD that must be considered include clinical applications, research, teaching and training, health statistics, and public health. The Advisory Group has determined that the current revision represents a particular opportunity to improve the classification's clinical utility, particularly in global primary care settings where there is the greatest opportunity to identify people who need mental health treatment. Based on WHO's mission and constitution, the usefulness of the classification in helping WHO member countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, to reduce the disease burden associated with mental disorders is among the highest priorities for the revision. This article describes the foundation provided by the recommendations of the Advisory Group for the current phase of work.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^7fc5a2da]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

From 1979 through September 2015, the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) was used in the USA to code morbidity data. On 1 October 2015, the Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM), developed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, was implemented in the USA for classification and coding of morbidity data. ICD-10-CM codes provide much more detail about diseases, injuries, and external causes of injuries than ICD-9-CM codes, making this classification system more useful for measuring quality of care, public health surveillance and epidemiological research.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)injury matrices are nationally and internationally recognised tools or frameworks for organising and reporting ICD-coded injury data. These tools have multiple versions based on different clinical modifications of the ICD, and can categorise both external cause codes, which describe the mechanism and intent of injury, and diagnosis codes, which describe the body region and type of injury. The ICD-9-CM external cause of injury matrix (hereafter referred to as matrix) was used extensively to generate county, state, regional, national and international comparisons of non-fatal injury data. The ICD-10-CM matrix should prove to be similarly useful over the next decade.

Data from Sweden suggest that the conversion to ICD-10 may have been associated with important discontinuities in observed rates at the mechanism/cause level. To interpret injury morbidity data across the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM in the USA, it would be helpful to understand any differences in how the same records would be classified using the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices. We were able to obtain such dually coded data from two large academic trauma centres and apply both matrices to estimate comparability ratios (CRs) and identify potential reasons for discrepant classification of mechanism/cause.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^b0c1abf3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

DSM-IV-TR 294.1x dementia of the Alzheimer's type — diagnostic criteria, coding, and specifiers are outlined as follows: Diagnostic criteria include the development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both memory impairment and one (or more) of the following cognitive disturbances — aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbance in executive functioning; the cognitive deficits in Criteria A1 and A2 each cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and represent a significant decline, and the course is characterized by gradual onset and continuing cognitive decline; the cognitive deficits in Criteria A1 and A2 are not due to other central nervous system conditions, systemic conditions that are known to cause dementia, or substance-induced conditions; the deficits do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium, and the disturbance is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder. Coding is based on behavioral disturbance: 294.10 Without Behavioral Disturbance if the cognitive disturbance is not accompanied by any clinically significant behavioral disturbance, and 294.11 With Behavioral Disturbance if it is accompanied by a clinically significant behavioral disturbance. Subtypes by onset are specified as With Early Onset if onset is at age 65 years or below and With Late Onset if onset is after age 65 years. A coding note states to also code 331.0 Alzheimer's disease on Axis III and to indicate other prominent clinical features on Axis I, for example 293.83 Mood Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease, With Depressive Features, and 310.1 Personality Change Due to Alzheimer's Disease, Aggressive Type.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^ee350889]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Injury surveillance, the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of injury data, provides critical information to support public health efforts to reduce injury-related morbidity, mortality and disability. For the past several decades, state and local health departments and national agencies in the USA have relied on the use of hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to conduct injury surveillance. Surveillance case definitions and analyses have been based on ICD-9-CM codes. However, a US mandate to code using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)has resulted in a need to update injury surveillance case definitions and analysis guidance based on ICD-10-CM.

Beginning in October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services required all hospitals and healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to use the ICD-10-CM to report electronic healthcare transactions. The coding structure of ICD-10-CM is based on ICD-10 mortality coding and classification published by the WHO, however, the classification scheme has been greatly expanded to capture the diagnostic detail needed for medical diagnoses. ICD-10-CM contains nearly five times the number of codes found in ICD-9-CM (approximately 72 000 codes in ICD-10-CM compared with 15 000 codes in ICD-9-CM). Because ICD-10-CM captures greater detail than either ICD-9-CM or ICD-10, this classification system has the potential to provide enhanced understanding of the types and causes of non-fatal injury.

Covariates

Patients with diagnosis of hip or vertebral fracture prior to the index date were excluded from the study. Comorbidities were classified as those existing prior to the index date and included hypertension (ICD-9-CM code 401–405, ICD-10-CM code I10-I15), diabetes mellitus (ICD-9-CM code 250, ICD-10-CM code E08-E11, E13), COPD (ICD-9-CM code: 490, 491, 492, 494, 496, ICD-10-CM code J44), chronic hepatic disease (ICD-9-CM code: 490, 491, 492, 494, 496, ICD-10-CM code J44, chronic renal disease (ICD-9-CM code 571–572, ICD-10-CM code K70-K77), malignancy (ICD-9-CM code 140–208, ICD-10-CM code C00-C97, D00-D48), substance abuse, alcoholism and dizziness (ICD-9-CM code 291, 303–305, 386, 648, 790, 965, V11.3, E850.0, E854.1, E935.0, E939.6, V654.2, ICD-10-CM code F10-12, F14-19, R42), visual disorders (ICD-9-CM code 361–366, 368–371, 377–378, ICD-10-CM code H00-59), endocrine disorders and malnutrition (ICD-9-CM code 240 − 242, 255, 262–269, 579, ICD-10-CM code E20-35), arthropathies (ICD-9-CM code 711–716, ICD-10-CM code M15-19, M45-49), and bony fractures other than hip fracture (ICD-9-CM code 805–817, 821–825, 831–833, ICD-10-CM code S22, S32, S42-S43, S52, S61-63, S72, S82). The end of follow-up period for the three analyses (i.e. non-PD versus PD with AAs cohorts, non-PD versus PD without AAs cohorts, and PD without AAs versus PD with AAs cohorts) was marked on the day of hip fracture, terminated enrollment from the database, death, or until the end of this study.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID — Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients' specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of "U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified" should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient's specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

Abstract

The prevalence of vulvar lichen sclerosus in Black women is unknown. There is a lack of validity using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code L90.0 to identify women with vulvar lichen sclerosus overall, with less accuracy in Black women.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included. These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

Classification of the deaths and injuries that occurred as the result of the events of September 11, 2001, presented CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) with a dilemma. Under the current classification systems for mortality and morbidity, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and the United States' International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), deaths and injuries associated with acts of terrorism could not be identified uniquely.

### Global classification and coding of hypersensitivity diseases-an EAACI-WAO survey, strategic paper and review [^e7c2360a]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity diseases are not adequately coded in the International Coding of Diseases (ICD)-10 resulting in misclassification, leading to low visibility of these conditions and general accuracy of official statistics. To call attention to the inadequacy of the ICD-10 in relation to allergic and hypersensitivity diseases and to contribute to improvements to be made in the forthcoming revision of ICD, a web-based global survey of healthcare professionals' attitudes toward allergic disorders classification was proposed to the members of European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) (individuals) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) (representative responding on behalf of the national society), launched via internet and circulated for 6 week. As a result, we had 612 members of 144 countries from all six World Health Organization (WHO) global regions who answered the survey. ICD-10 is the most used classification worldwide, but it was not considered appropriate in clinical practice by the majority of participants. The majority indicated the EAACI-WAO classification as being easier and more accurate in the daily practice. They saw the need for a diagnostic system useful for nonallergists and endorsed the possibility of a global, cross-culturally applicable classification system of allergic disorders. This first and most broadly international survey ever conducted of health professionals' attitudes toward allergic disorders classification supports the need to update the current classifications of allergic diseases and can be useful to the WHO in improving the clinical utility of the classification and its global acceptability for the revised ICD-11.

### Comparison of international classification of diseases and related health problems, tenth revision codes with electronic medical records among patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 [^6ece3d7b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

Rapid access to well-characterized, large SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 cohorts is critical for scientific discovery. ICD-10 codes are a standard terminology and are attractive for data aggregation because they are uniformly used among health care systems. However, these codes perform poorly in capturing COVID-19–related symptoms. Our findings highlight the critical need for meticulous data validation to feed multicenter registries built from EMRs. Reliable, accurate data are the foundation of scientific discovery; the right data lead to the right solutions.

### Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia in the United States: prevalence and incidence: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^267f3e74]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic criteria and coding — vascular causation of cognitive impairment is inferred when clinical consensus criteria identify either a temporal association between a recent symptomatic stroke and new-onset cognitive impairment or a significant burden of cerebrovascular lesions on neuroimaging. The criteria distinguish vascular mild cognitive impairment from vascular dementia, corresponding in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders terminology to vascular mild neurocognitive disorder and vascular major neurocognitive disorder. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is noted to contain codes only for vascular dementia in the 9th and 10th editions, not vascular MCI, whereas the 11th edition of ICD, not yet implemented within the United States, has a code for vascular mild neurocognitive disorder.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^09486a27]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

CONSENSUS STATEMENT

Section 1. Classification of gastritis in relation to ICD-11

CQ1. Is the current ICD-10 classification for gastritis appropriate?

Statement 1

The current ICD-10 classification for gastritis is obsolete in view of the discovery of H. pylori.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: high

Consensus level: 100%

Comment

The ICD-10 classification of gastritis was formulated in 1989 and is still in effect in most countries. At the time of formulation, the ICD-10 classification of gastritis and duodenitis (K29) was rudimentary as it was based on macroscopic and histomorphological criteria; the only aetiological factor assigned was alcohol(box 1). The histological classification of gastritis considered mainly aspects of atrophy and autoimmunity.

The discovery of H. pylori had not been taken into account, possibly because even though release came after the discovery of Campylobacter pylori (H. pylori), the role of H. pylori in disease was still controversial. The recognition of H. pylori infection as the primary cause of chronic gastritis proved to be a breakthrough that reopened the chapter on gastritis and its role in disease. At present, no classification of gastritis would be complete without including H. pylori as the aetiological cause.

CQ2. Is the proposed ICD-11 classification for gastritis appropriate?

Statement 2

The newly proposed classification of gastritis in the ICD11 β version is an improvement because it is based on aetiological factors.

Grade of recommendation: strong

Evidence level: moderate

Consensus level: 100%

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^6d35411e]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Challenges to identifying ED visits and hospital inpatient admissions using ICD-10-CM

Multiple challenges, however, impede the standard use of ICD-10-CM codes for drug overdose surveillance. A primary challenge is translating ED and inpatient drug overdose (referred to as 'poisoning' in the ICD-10-CM) definitions from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM. On 1 October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated that all healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act transition from ICD-9-CM coding to ICD-10-CM coding. The ICD-10-CM coding system is substantially different from the ICD-9-CM coding system (See figure 1 for a breakdown of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning code). For instance, the number of injury diagnosis codes increased from 2600 to 43 000 in the ICD-9-CM compared with the ICD-10-CM, while the number of external cause of injury codes increased from 1300 to 7500. Thus, translation of ICD-9-CM drug overdose definitions to ICD-10-CM requires extensive conceptual work informed by empirical validation.

### The impact of conversion to international classification of diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) on an academic ophthalmology practice [^484845d9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Financial and clinical impacts

To analyze the changes in clinical revenue and productivity after ICD-10 conversion, we obtained billing summaries from the UC Davis Eye Center from October 1, 2014, to September 30, 2016, and examined the mean payments per visit, relative value units (RVUs) per visit, number of visits, and percentage of high-level visits for each month during the 12-month periods before and after ICD-10 implementation on October 1, 2015. High-level visits were defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 99204, 99205, 92004, 99214, 99215, and 92014. Low-level visit codes were defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes 99201–99203, 99243, 92002, 99211–99213, and 92012. We also evaluated the number of coding-related denials and average denied charges per 100 visits, as well as denied charges as a percentage of total charges during the two periods. Coding-related denials were defined as insurance claims that were denied due to an error in coding. Finally, we assessed coder efficiency by comparing the percentage of charges coded within 10 days of a visit before and after ICD-10 implementation.

Coding behavior

To evaluate the increased complexity of ICD-10 coding as a potential cause of increased insurance claim denials, we identified the top 15 primary ICD-9 codes used between October 1, 2014, and September 30, 2015. We then assessed the corresponding section of ICD-10 to identify all of the possible corresponding codes. To determine if the increased complexity of ICD-10 resulted in more frequent use of unspecified diagnosis codes, we analyzed the total volume of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used as primary diagnoses during the 12-month period before and after ICD-10 implementation and compared the proportion of specified and unspecified codes and their distribution among subspecialty categories. We also analyzed which categories of unspecified codes were used most frequently.

ICD-9 codes were categorized based on blocks in Chapter 6 of the 2016 edition of the ICD-9-CM manual. ICD-10 codes were categorized similarly based on blocks in Chapter 7 of the 2016 edition of the ICD-10-CM manual (Table 1). Unspecified codes were defined as codes with the term "unspecified" in the name where more specific codes exist that could have been used in their place.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^653242a6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
The anatomy of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning diagnosis code. ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Several key changes in the diagnosis codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM guidance had to be considered when defining and tracking drug overdose indicators. These include the following:

External cause of injury codes for drug poisoning were combined with diagnostic codes in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, poisoning surveillance indicators relied on both poisoning diagnosis codes, which described the substances involved, and poisoning external cause codes, which conveyed the intent (eg, suicide or unintentional). Under ICD-10-CM, the poisoning diagnosis codes or T-codes (T36-T50) include information on both the substances involved and intent of the injury (ie, '1': accidental, '2': intentional self-harm, '3': assault, '4': undetermined, '5': adverse effect and '6': underdosing).
Coding of undetermined and accidental poisonings changed in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, medical coders were instructed to select undetermined intent for external causes of injury when the intent was unspecified in the medical record; however, the guidance under ICD-10-CM instructs coders to default to accidental intent and only select undetermined intent if the medical record explicitly indicates that the intent is undetermined.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of underdosing: ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of 'underdosing', the use of less than the prescribed drug according to a provider or drug manufacturer.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of encounter type: ICD-10-CM introduced the new concept of encounter type for many injury diagnosis codes. For drug poisoning T-codes, a seventh character of 'A' indicates an initial encounter, 'D' indicates a subsequent encounter and 'S' indicates sequela. An initial encounter captures when a patient is receiving active treatment for the injury event, though it may not be the first encounter related to that injury event (eg, receiving treatment from two physicians for the same injury). A subsequent encounter captures when a patient is seen after active treatment for a follow-up related to the initial injury (eg, follow-up visit related to an overdose). A sequela captures when a patient is being treated for a secondary condition that arose because of the injury (eg, peripheral neuropathy).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^793b6597]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

According to a report of the Injury Surveillance Workgroup, a group of experts assembled by the Safe States Alliance to provide recommendations for injury surveillance and data analysis around the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition, changes in the injury counts by category can be explained by changes to coding guidelines, differences in the basic structure of the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices, differences in assignment of external cause codes to specific matrix cells, new or more detailed codes in ICD-10-CM, and other considerations. We found evidence supporting most of these explanations.

The most common reason for different classification of the same record by the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM matrices was assigning an external cause to different mechanisms/causes. For example, 'MV non-traffic' is a new ICD-10-CM category that was created to support better surveillance of these injuries. As a result, some records assigned to the 'other transport' by the ICD-9-CM matrix (eg, E820-E825, fifth digits 0–4) were reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category by the ICD-10-CM matrix. However, our finding that most of the MCA records reassigned to the new 'MV non-traffic' category were classified as MVT by the ICD-9-CM matrix suggests that some coders became more attentive to the distinction between traffic and non-traffic injuries while they were preparing for ICD-10-CM. 'Other land transport' is another new ICD-10-CM mechanism/cause that was separated out of the 'other transport' in the ICD-9-CM matrix; however, we observed no cases of differential classification involving this category.

### Reliability of international classification of disease-9 versus international classification of disease-10 coding for proximal femur fractures at a level 1 trauma center [^aa2d848d]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid services proposed that transitioning from the 9th to the 10th revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) would provide better data for research. This study sought to determine the reliability of ICD-10 compared with ICD-9 for proximal femur fractures.

Methods

Available imaging studies from 196 consecutively treated proximal femur fractures were retrospectively reviewed and assigned ICD codes by three physicians. Intercoder reliability (ICR) was calculated. Collectively, the physicians agreed on what should be the correct codes for each fracture, and this was compared with coding found in the medical and billing records.

Results

No significant difference was observed in ICR for both ICD-9 and ICD-10 exact coding, which were both unreliable. Less specific coding improved ICR. ICD-9 general coding was better than ICD-10. Electronic medical record coding was unreliable. Billing codes were also unreliable, yet ICD-10 was better than ICD-9.

Discussion

ICD-9 and ICD-10 lack reliability in coding proximal femur fractures. ICD-10 results in data that are no more reliable than those found with ICD-9.

Level Of Evidence

Level I diagnostic.

### Disorders related to sexuality and gender identity in the ICD-11: revising the ICD-10 classification based on current scientific evidence, best clinical practices, and human rights considerations [^867e597a]. World Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In the World Health Organization's forthcoming eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), substantial changes have been proposed to the ICD-10 classification of mental and behavioural disorders related to sexuality and gender identity. These concern the following ICD-10 disorder groupings: F52 Sexual dysfunctions, not caused by organic disorder or disease; F64 Gender identity disorders; F65 Disorders of sexual preference; and F66 Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation. Changes have been proposed based on advances in research and clinical practice, and major shifts in social attitudes and in relevant policies, laws, and human rights standards. This paper describes the main recommended changes, the rationale and evidence considered, and important differences from the DSM-5. An integrated classification of sexual dysfunctions has been proposed for a new chapter on Conditions Related to Sexual Health, overcoming the mind/body separation that is inherent in ICD-10. Gender identity disorders in ICD-10 have been reconceptualized as Gender incongruence, and also proposed to be moved to the new chapter on sexual health. The proposed classification of Paraphilic disorders distinguishes between conditions that are relevant to public health and clinical psychopathology and those that merely reflect private behaviour. ICD-10 categories related to sexual orientation have been recommended for deletion from the ICD-11.

### New coding in the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, for children's interstitial lung disease [^9c9cf4f0]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

The term "children's interstitial lung disease" (chILD) refers to a heterogeneous group of rare and diffuse lung diseases associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These disorders include neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy, pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis, surfactant dysfunction mutations, and alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins. Diagnosis can be challenging, which may lead to a delay in recognition and treatment of these disorders. Recently, International Classifications of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes have been added for several of the chILD disorders. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the chILD disorders and appropriate diagnostic coding.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^db3b6dae]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Our findings have important implications for interpreting differences in billing-code-derived disease prevalence over time. For epidemiology, it is critical to distinguish between changes in actual disease prevalence and changes in coding behaviors and mappings, which are often responsible for observed changes in coded prevalence. We have seen that 3 separate, widely used classification systems made different distinctions that affected apparent diagnostic category prevalence. Given that HHS payment formulas rely on the prevalence of HCC categories to set billions of dollars in payments, our finding of many large (artifactual) changes in diagnostic category prevalence has potentially large implications for reimbursement.

Although HHS-HCCs are used for the ACA's marketplace risk adjustment payments, this study did not examine financial outcomes. Because the ACA uses risk adjustment to reallocate the available funds among plans in a given region rather than to decide on the size of the funds available (as is done in Medicare Advantage and Part D), changes in diagnostic category prevalence may have had less financial effect in the marketplace than in Medicare Advantage. Classifications used for bonus or performance evaluation are also vulnerable to large changes in level or trend when preexisting ICD-9-CM –derived formulas are used across the ICD-10-CM transition. In addition, claims-based analyses of disease prevalence may also be misleading if changes in the underlying classification system are not recognized.

Our study used the earliest mappings accommodating all valid 2017 diagnoses for the included classification systems. In 2019, the WHO, HHS, and AHRQ released new classification systems with expanded diagnostic categories designed for 2019 diagnoses. Future research will need to examine changes under these new systems. In the meantime, it is important to understand the current mappings that will continue to be used to set payments and evaluate performance for several more years.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^a417103c]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The Rheumatic Disease Comorbidity Index (RDCI) was designed as a tool to quantify the burden of comorbidities and to account for the association of this burden with long-term health outcomes in patients with rheumatic diseases. The RDCI was initially developed using patient questionnaires to collect 10 comorbid conditions, which were weighted to generate a score from 0–9. The RDCI score has been shown to be predictive of physical function, quality of life, and mortality. Previously, we validated the RDCI score using administrative claims data and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Using claims data, the RDCI compared favorably to other existing general population comorbidity indices in predicting physical function and mortality in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, the RDCI is more feasible to obtain and a more versatile index, performing well in both self-reported and administrative data. Because of its performance, feasibility, and versatility, it has been broadly used in RA studies as well as those in psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, gout, lupus, vasculitis, and osteoporosis.

In the U.S. healthcare systems transitioned from the ICD-9-CM classification system for medical conditions to ICD-10-CM on October 1, 2015. The ICD-10-CM coding system contains a nearly five-fold increase in the number of codes available in order to provide improved specificity in classifying medical conditions. The transition to ICD-10-CM has required updating the coding of chronic conditions and comorbidity indices that were developed under the previous classification system to confirm validity with ICD-10-CM codes. The RDCI, derived from ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes, has not yet been validated. Because different comorbidity indices utilize unique definitions of conditions and diagnostic code sets, the generation of an ICD-10-CM code set specific to the RDCI is needed to allow its use in studies spanning both timeframes. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to translate the ICD-9-CM codes used to generate the RDCI to ICD-10-CM codes and to validate the predictive ability for mortality and functional status of the RDCI when derived from ICD-10-CM codes.

### Exploring the implications of the new ICD-10-CM classification system for injury surveillance: analysis of dually coded data from two medical centres [^0e8b5ae9]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External cause of injury matrices is used to classify mechanisms/causes of injuries for surveillance and research. Little is known about the performance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new external cause of injury matrix for Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM), compared with the ICD-9-CM version.

Methods

Dually coded (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) administrative data were obtained from two major academic trauma centres. Injury-related cases were identified and categorised by mechanism/cause and manner/intent. Comparability ratios (CR) were used to estimate the net impact of changing from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM on the number of cases classified to each mechanism/cause category. Chamberlain's percent positive agreements (PPA) were calculated and McNemar's test was used to assess the significance of observed classification differences.

Results

Of 4832 and 5211 dual-coded records from the two centres, 632 and 520 with injury-related principal diagnoses and external cause codes in both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM were identified. CRs for the mechanisms/causes with at least 20 records ranged from 0.85 to 1.9 at one centre and from 0.97 to 1.07 at the other. Among these mechanisms/causes, PPAs ranged from 33% for 'other transport' to 94% for poisoning at one centre, and from 75% for 'other transport' to 100% for fires/burns at the other centre. Case assignment differed significantly for falls, motor vehicle traffic, other transport, and 'struck by/against' injuries at one centre, and for 'other pedal cyclist' at the other centre.

Conclusion

Switching to ICD-10-CM and the new external cause of injury matrix may affect injury surveillance and research, especially for certain mechanisms/causes.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^bfe0e48b]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In this study, we report on our updated CCC version 2 (v2) classification system, which we implemented for both the ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding schemes. We evaluated the CCC v2 system in three ways: 1) the comparability between the ICD-9 and ICD-10 systems; 2) the year-to-year stability of classification across CCC v2 attributable to cause of death in 1991–2010; and 3) the proportions of patients classified as having a CCC between CCC v2 and CCC v1 systems.

The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Medium credibility.

ICD and ICF classification — hip pain and mobility deficits due to hip osteoarthritis: The primary ICD-10 code is M16.1 Primary coxarthrosis, unilateral, with secondary ICD-10 codes including M16.0 Primary coxarthrosis, bilateral; M16.2 Coxarthrosis resulting from dysplasia, bilateral; M16.3 Dysplastic coxarthrosis, unilateral; M16.4 Posttraumatic coxarthrosis, bilateral; M16.5 Posttraumatic coxarthrosis, unilateral; and M16.7 Secondary coxarthrosis, not otherwise specified. Corresponding ICD-9-CM codes are 715.15 Osteoarthrosis of the pelvic region and thigh, localized, primary; 715.25 Osteoarthrosis of the pelvic region and thigh, localized, secondary; and 715.85 Osteoarthrosis of the pelvic region and thigh involving more than 1 site but not specified as generalized. Related International Classification of Functioning (ICF) body function codes are b2816 Pain in joints and b7100 Mobility of a single joint, and primary ICF activities/participation codes are d4154 Maintaining a standing position, d4500 Walking short distances, and d4501 Walking long distances.

Documentation and medical necessity — documentation is to provide evidence or information and includes evaluation and management services, procedural services, and billing and coding, and it reflects the competency and character of the physician; medical necessity requires appropriate diagnosis and coding by the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM); CMS defines medical necessity as no payment under Part A or Part B for services that are not reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment or to improve functioning, and the American Medical Association defines it as health care services or procedures a prudent physician would provide that are in accordance with generally accepted standards, clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site, and duration, and not primarily for convenience; elements reviewed include whether the billed service was rendered, whether the level or extent was accurately reported, and whether the service or procedure was medically necessary.

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^604cee7c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

In total, 5 152 250 patients (3 817 817 female [74.1%]; mean [SD] age, 58.2 [16.4] years) with inflammatory arthritides were identified; 2 626 584 (51.0%) were coded in ICD-9 and 2 525 666 (49.0%) in ICD-10. For ICD-9, 4 of 14 inflammatory arthritides codes (28.6% of available codes) were higher-usage codes (used > 1% of the time). For ICD-10, 9 of 438 codes (2.1%) were higher-usage (Table). Of the top 20 codes, 65% contained unspecified or other specified in the verbiage.

Graphs show higher usage codes, defined as those accounting for > 1% (A), and lower usage codes, defined as those accounting for < 1% of patients (B), presented in total and by year following the introduction of ICD-10. In panel A, there were 9 codes (2.1%) each for 2015, 2016, and 2017; 7 (1.6%) each for 2018 and 2019; and 6 (1.4%) each for 2020 and 2021. There was no statistically significant change in utilization of higher-usage codes from one year to the next following the introduction of ICD-10 (P = 0.94).

### Schamberg's purpura in children: a review of 13 cases [^607f2bd4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Schamberg's purpura (progressive pigmentary dermatosis or pigmented purpuric dermatosis) is uncommonly described in preadolescent children.

Patients and Methods

A retrospective review of cases of Schamberg's purpura with onset before 10 years of age was undertaken. Clinical and histopathologic data, as well as analytical studies including hemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum chemistry, urinalysis, cryoglobulins, and screening for thrombotic and clotting disorders were recorded.

Results

A total of 13 patients (3 male and 10 female) from 1 to 9 years of age (median, 5 years) had the typical cutaneous features of Schamberg's purpura. The lower limbs were affected in all patients. Lesions were unilateral in 3 cases. In 4 patients, lesions faded within 1 to 4 years, and in 1 patient lesions improved after 6 years. In 8 patients lesions persisted 1 to 7 years after. Laboratory studies were normal in all patients.

Conclusion

Schamberg's purpura is a chronic benign form of pigmented purpura which is occasionally seen before puberty.
