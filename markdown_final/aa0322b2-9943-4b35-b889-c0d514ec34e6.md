## Question

For septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, what symptoms are expected and which imaging modality is most appropriate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the expected symptoms of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and the single most appropriate initial imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis [^112qcuAc] [^112xR8TJ]. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is and when it typically presents, including its subtypes and postpartum context [^112qcuAc]. Then, I should verify the core symptom pattern that raises suspicion, especially the persistence of fever despite antibiotics and pelvic pain in the puerperal or post‑operative setting [^114pgsZv]. Next, I will examine why imaging is required and what it must accomplish diagnostically, including thrombus visualization and exclusion of alternative sources [^112gYLuQ]. After that, I will compare CT, MRI/MRV, ultrasound, and catheter venography, checking accuracy, availability, and special populations such as pregnancy [^114zrJCL] [^114BBcrh]. Finally, I will integrate an evidence‑based recommendation and succinctly restate the expected symptom cluster alongside the imaging choice, double‑checking guideline consistency before concluding [^113ofbwd].

> Let me first confirm the entity to ensure we are framing the question correctly: septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is a rare puerperal or post‑operative complication in which infection of the pelvic veins leads to thrombus formation, classically described as ovarian vein thrombophlebitis and deep septic pelvic thrombophlebitis that may coexist, often arising within 1–3 days after delivery, particularly after cesarean section or pelvic surgery [^112qcuAc] [^112xR8TJ] [^114pgsZv].

> I need to check the typical clinical picture before I jump to imaging, because the pretest probability depends on recognizing the pattern: high‑grade fever and chills that do not defervesce despite broad‑spectrum antibiotics, pelvic or lower abdominal pain that may be unilateral or diffuse, focal pelvic tenderness with a rarely palpable cord‑like mass, leukocytosis that may be absent or only modest, occasional positive blood cultures including Fusobacterium species, and possible systemic sepsis signs such as tachycardia or hypotension; back pain has also been described in postpartum presentations, which can distract from the pelvic source if not considered [^112qcuAc] [^112xR8TJ] [^112koSmU] [^115CJNrb] [^114pgsZv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical diagnosis alone; I should confirm why imaging is required and what constitutes a diagnostic endpoint: because signs are nonspecific, definitive diagnosis rests on direct visualization of an intraluminal thrombus in a pelvic vein, with imaging also used to exclude alternative sources of sepsis, determine thrombus extent including IVC or renal veins, and identify complications such as pulmonary emboli that may alter management [^112gYLuQ] [^112qcuAc] [^113ofbwd].

> I will now examine CT performance and practicality, because if it is both accurate and rapidly available, it may be the first‑line choice: multidetector CT venography demonstrates approximately 97% sensitivity and 93–100% specificity for pelvic venous occlusion compared with duplex ultrasound, provides direct signs such as an enlarged ovarian vein with intraluminal filling defects, allows single‑pass assessment of abdomen, pelvis, and chest for concurrent pulmonary emboli, and is typically accessible 24/7 in emergency settings [^112gYLuQ] [^112qcuAc] [^112xR8TJ].

> Wait, I should verify guideline alignment and not overstate CT beyond what society documents support; the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for acute pelvic pain and for sepsis endorse CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast as usually appropriate when nongynecologic etiologies or a sepsis source search are suspected in nonpregnant patients, which fits SPT's need for cross‑sectional evaluation of pelvic veins and alternative foci in an undifferentiated febrile patient [^114zrJCL] [^113ofbwd].

> Let me consider MRI next and clarify when it moves to the front, because radiation and contrast risks matter; MRI or MR venography avoids ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast, making it preferable in pregnancy or significant renal impairment, and ACR documents favor MRI over CT in pregnant patients with acute pelvic pain or nongynecologic etiologies when available, although MRI is slower, less available emergently, and more motion‑sensitive in febrile or unstable patients, so it functions as a second‑line alternative in most nonpregnant cases [^114zrJCL] [^114BBcrh].

> Initially, I thought ultrasound might suffice given its primacy for many gynecologic complaints, but wait, I should double‑check its ability to visualize deep pelvic veins; transabdominal or transvaginal Doppler ultrasound can be attempted as a bedside screen, yet its sensitivity is limited by the depth and course of pelvic veins and operator dependence, and vascular guidelines note that duplex of abdominal and pelvic veins is less reliable for deep pelvic thrombosis compared with CT or MR, so a negative ultrasound does not exclude SPT when suspicion is high [^112qcuAc] [^113Bxq12].

> I should confirm the role of invasive venography so I do not overuse it up front; catheter venography is the historical gold standard in venous disorders and remains relevant when endovascular therapy is planned, but it is invasive and rarely appropriate as an initial diagnostic test for suspected septic pelvic thrombophlebitis in unstable or undifferentiated settings [^1152ofGd].

> Integrating this, I need to ensure the initial modality recommendation is precise and exception‑aware: for most nonpregnant, hemodynamically stable adults with suspected septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, contrast‑enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis using CT venography techniques is the most appropriate first‑line study because it couples high diagnostic accuracy with speed, availability, and the ability to evaluate competing sources and complications; if the patient is pregnant or iodinated contrast is contraindicated, pelvic MRI with MR venography is the preferred alternative; bedside ultrasound may be used when cross‑sectional imaging is not immediately available, but a negative ultrasound should be followed by CT or MRI if clinical suspicion persists [^112gYLuQ] [^114zrJCL] [^112qcuAc] [^113ofbwd].

> To summarize symptoms before closing, I should reiterate the cluster that should trigger imaging without delay: persistent high fever with chills not resolving on broad‑spectrum antibiotics, pelvic or lower abdominal pain often unilateral with focal tenderness, occasional cord‑like mass, modest or absent leukocytosis with possible Fusobacterium or other gram‑negative bacteremia, onset typically within days postpartum or after pelvic surgery, and possible back pain or sepsis physiology that can obscure the pelvic source if not considered [^112qcuAc] [^112xR8TJ] [^112koSmU] [^115CJNrb] [^114pgsZv].

> Bottom line, and let me double‑check internal consistency one last time: expected symptoms are persistent postpartum or post‑operative fever with pelvic pain despite antibiotics plus supportive but nonspecific labs, and the most appropriate initial imaging in a nonpregnant, stable patient is contrast‑enhanced CT abdomen/pelvis with CT venography to directly visualize pelvic venous thrombus and assess extent and complications, with MRI/MRV reserved when CT is unsafe or contraindicated and ultrasound as a limited screening tool only [^112gYLuQ] [^114zrJCL] [^112qcuAc] [^113Bxq12] [^113ofbwd].

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) presents with **persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics** [^114pgsZv], lower abdominal or flank pain [^112qcuAc], and sometimes a palpable tender mass or signs of sepsis [^1153Vbzz] [^113ofbwd]. The most appropriate imaging modality is **contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis** [^112qcuAc] [^114Z8hWW], which rapidly and accurately detects ovarian or pelvic vein thrombus and septic emboli [^112gYLuQ]. MRI is a suitable alternative when CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^114zrJCL], whereas ultrasound is limited by low sensitivity and operator dependence [^112gYLuQ].

---

## Clinical symptoms and signs

SPT typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Persistent fever**: Unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics [^114pgsZv], often the primary clinical clue [^112koSmU].

- **Lower abdominal or flank pain**: Commonly right-sided [^112qcuAc], reflecting ovarian or pelvic vein involvement [^112koSmU].

- **Palpable tender mass**: Occasionally a cord-like structure in the lower abdomen or flank, though rare [^1153Vbzz].

- **Leukocytosis**: Moderate elevation in white blood cell count in less than one-third of cases [^1153Vbzz] [^114pgsZv].

- **Positive blood cultures**: Present in a minority of cases, often polymicrobial [^1153Vbzz] [^112koSmU].

- **Sepsis or septic shock**: In severe cases [^112koSmU], with hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction [^113ofbwd].

---

## Imaging modalities for diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis of SPT relies on **imaging**, as clinical findings are often nonspecific [^113ofbwd]. The following imaging modalities are commonly used:

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Bedside availability [^114zrJCL] | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited sensitivity for deep pelvic veins [^112gYLuQ] <br/> - Often inconclusive |
| Computed tomography (CT) | - High sensitivity and specificity <br/> - Rapid acquisition <br/> - Widely available [^117Q5jEX] <br/> - Detects thrombus, vein enlargement, perivascular inflammation, septic emboli [^112gYLuQ] | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Iodinated contrast risks (allergy, nephrotoxicity) |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue contrast [^11246a6p] <br/> - Useful when CT contraindicated [^114zrJCL] | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer acquisition <br/> - Contraindications (metal implants, claustrophobia) |

---

## Most appropriate imaging modality

Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the **most appropriate imaging modality** for diagnosing SPT [^112qcuAc]. CT provides rapid, accurate visualization of thrombus within the ovarian or pelvic veins, vein enlargement [^114Z8hWW], perivascular inflammation, and septic emboli [^112gYLuQ]. It is widely available and can be performed quickly, making it ideal in acute settings [^113ofbwd]. MRI is a **valuable alternative** when CT is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, pregnancy) or inconclusive [^114zrJCL], offering high soft-tissue contrast and detection of thrombus and inflammation without radiation exposure [^11246a6p]. Ultrasound is generally **limited** by operator dependence and low sensitivity for deep pelvic veins [^112gYLuQ], making it less reliable as a primary diagnostic tool for SPT.

---

## Conclusion

SPT presents with **persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics**, lower abdominal or flank pain, and occasionally a palpable tender mass or signs of sepsis [^114pgsZv]. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the **most appropriate imaging modality** for diagnosing SPT, providing rapid and accurate visualization of thrombus and associated inflammatory changes [^112gYLuQ]. MRI is a useful alternative when CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^114zrJCL]; ultrasound is generally limited by operator dependence and low sensitivity [^112gYLuQ].

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is an uncommon postpartum complication occurring around 3 days after delivery. It remains unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics when no other obvious source is present. This condition can be confirmed through visualization of a thrombus in the pelvic veins using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment involves prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, with or without the addition of anticoagulation. Thrombophilia may play a role in the development of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, as a recent cohort study reported associations with deep venous thrombosis in 9% of cases and pulmonary emboli in 7%. Although mortality rates for this condition once exceeded 50%, they are now rare, with none reported in recent case series and cohort studies.

Computed tomography/computed tomography venography

CT can be used to accurately diagnose acute pelvic vein or inferior vena cava occlusion and is additionally capable of diagnosing pulmonary emboli, offering a single diagnostic examination to assess both conditions. Most commonly, multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA), combined with late venous-phase imaging (indirect CTV), is used to accurately diagnose pelvic vein or inferior vena cava occlusion, which can be the source of significant pulmonary emboli. On CTA/CTV, thrombi appear as intravascular hypodense masses, sometimes encircled by a hyperdense rim of contrast medium. The thrombosed veins are generally dilated compared to their normal dimensions. In some cases, CT can distinguish perivascular stranding as a sign of an antithrombotic/inflammatory response. The reported specificity and sensitivity compared to DUS are approximately 93–100% and 97%, respectively.

Indirect CTV, in which contrast is injected through a cubital vein and scanning is performed at 70–90 seconds post-contrast injection, combined with CT pulmonary angiography, is a relatively accurate method for evaluating femoropopliteal venous thrombosis in one examination without the need for a second contrast bolus. However, introducing CTV as an alternative to DUS is not ideal since it introduces risks associated with radiation and iodine contrast material. The use of MRI is more appealing in this regard, as MRI is also noninvasive, does not require radiation or iodinated contrast material, and can be used in specific risk groups.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on acute pelvic pain in the reproductive age group [^114BBcrh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Premenopausal women who present with acute pelvic pain frequently pose a diagnostic dilemma, exhibiting nonspecific signs and symptoms, the most common being nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis. Diagnostic considerations encompass multiple organ systems, including obstetric, gynecologic, urologic, gastrointestinal, and vascular etiologies.

The selection of imaging modality is determined by the clinically suspected differential diagnosis. Thus, a careful evaluation of such a patient should be performed, and diagnostic considerations should be narrowed before a modality is chosen. Transvaginal and transabdominal pelvic sonography is the modality of choice when an obstetric or gynecologic abnormality is suspected, while computed tomography is more useful when gastrointestinal or genitourinary pathology is more likely. Magnetic resonance imaging, when available in the acute setting, is favored over computed tomography for assessing pregnant patients for nongynecologic etiologies because of the lack of ionizing radiation.

Pylephlebitis, or septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein, is a serious infectious disorder. Early diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms and signs, limitations of diagnostic modalities, and a lack of familiarity among physicians with this entity. We report the history of a 73-year-old man with a fever of unknown origin (FUO), in whom laboratory tests, blood and urine cultures, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, and Indium-111-leucocyte scintigraphy did not reveal the cause of the fever. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) subsequently indicated the diagnosis of pylephlebitis, which was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) and percutaneous puncture. We conclude that FDG PET allows for the detection of inflammatory foci in patients with FUO and makes the diagnosis of pylephlebitis possible at an early stage.

### What is the significance of ovarian vein reflux detected by computed tomography in patients with pelvic pain [^1142MNCz]. Clinical Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common gynecological complaint. CPP is defined as nonmenstrual pain localized in the anatomic pelvis of at least six months' duration without any identifiable organic cause. It is severe enough to cause functional disability and require treatment. Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a poorly understood disorder and an often-overlooked cause of pelvic pain. Ovarian vein reflux (OVR) and pelvic varicosities contribute to PCS. However, OVR can be seen in asymptomatic women, typically those who are parous.

OVR has a characteristic appearance at enhanced computed tomography (CT). The contrast medium retrogradely fills the ovarian veins and parauterine veins during the arterial phase after intravenous contrast administration. Although CT is not the ideal modality to evaluate all causes of pelvic pain, it is a commonly used diagnostic tool for patients presenting with abdominal and pelvic pain. CT can demonstrate abnormal ovarian venous flow as well as tortuous and dilated ovarian and pelvic veins. Recognizing ovarian vein reflux is important, as it can, when correlated with the patient's clinical presentation, aid in diagnosing PCS.

### Ovarian vein thrombosis mimicking acute abdomen: A case report and literature review [^113H6qUa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old woman presented with acute abdominal pain and fever, suggestive of an acute surgical abdomen. Initial laboratory investigations and imaging studies were performed to rule out appendicitis or other intra-abdominal emergencies. However, the imaging studies revealed thrombosis in the ovarian vein, a rare condition that can mimic acute abdominal pathologies. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications such as infection or thromboembolic events. This case highlights the importance of considering ovarian vein thrombosis in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen, especially in postpartum or post-surgical patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® sepsis [^113ofbwd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. A search for the underlying cause of infection typically includes radiological imaging as part of this investigation. This document focuses on thoracic and abdominopelvic causes of sepsis. In 2017, the global incidence of sepsis was estimated to be 48.9 million cases, with 11 million sepsis-related deaths, accounting for nearly 20% of all global deaths; therefore, understanding which imaging modalities and types of studies are acceptable or not acceptable is imperative.

The five variants provided include the most commonly encountered scenarios in the setting of sepsis, along with recommendations and data for each imaging study. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: a rare case report [^112xR8TJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) is a well-recognized but rare puerperal complication, occurring approximately in 1 in 3000 deliveries. It is more frequent after caesarean section (C-section) (1 in 800 cases) than after vaginal delivery (1 in 9000 cases), likely due to the higher rate of puerperal infection. While its management once relied heavily on surgical treatment and was associated with high mortality rates, recent advancements have improved the prognosis of SPT. Nonetheless, it can still lead to life-threatening conditions. There are two types of SPT: ovarian vein thrombophlebitis (OVT) and deep septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (DSPT). Although these types may differ in clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, they share common pathogenic mechanisms and often occur together.

SPT is an important differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and fever in the postpartum period, and its diagnosis can be challenging. This case report describes the clinical and imaging findings of a female patient diagnosed with right ovarian vein infectious thrombophlebitis following a C-section.

### Imaging modalities in genitourinary emergencies [^111AgKrq]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians rely on a multitude of different imaging modalities in the diagnosis of genitourinary emergencies. There are many considerations to be taken into account when deciding which imaging modality should be used first, as oftentimes several diagnostic tools can be used for the same pathologic condition. These factors include radiation exposure, sensitivity, specificity, age of the patient, availability of resources, cost, and timeliness of completion. In this review, the strengths and weaknesses of different imaging tools in the evaluation of genitourinary emergencies are discussed.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^111yv57r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should focus on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality.

Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### ACR appropriateness criteria pelvic floor dysfunction [^1164ouVp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). High credibility.

Pelvic floor dysfunction is a common and potentially complex condition. Imaging can complement physical examination by revealing clinically occult abnormalities and clarifying the nature of the pelvic floor defects present. Imaging can add value in preoperative management for patients with a complex clinical presentation and in postoperative management of patients suspected to have recurrent pelvic floor dysfunction or a surgical complication. Imaging findings are only clinically relevant if the patient is symptomatic. Several imaging modalities have a potential role in evaluating patients; the choice of modality depends on the patient's symptoms, the clinical information desired, and the usefulness of the test.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions. They are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review process includes an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Prevalence of traumatic hip and pelvic fractures in patients with suspected hip fracture and negative initial standard radiographs — a study of emergency department patients [^113Npw4A]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of hip and pelvic fractures in emergency department (ED) patients with hip pain and negative standard initial radiographs, a retrospective cohort study was conducted at an academic, community-based ED. Patients presenting within a one-year period with hip pain who received a plain-film radiograph were included. Eligible patients were identified through electronic records. Radiographs and magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. Initial plain radiographs were reviewed at the point of care by board-certified radiologists, while MRI images were evaluated by radiologists with fellowship training in musculoskeletal imaging. Structured follow-up was conducted more than one month post-visit to rule out a subsequent hip fracture diagnosis. Confidence intervals (95% CIs) and kappa (κ) statistics were calculated as appropriate.

Seven hundred sixty-four of 895 patients (85.3%) completed follow-up and were included in the study group. Among these patients, 219 (29%) showed evidence of fracture on initial radiographs. Of the 545 patients with negative initial radiographs, 62 (11.4%) underwent hip MRI during the ED visit. MRI identified 24 additional patients with hip fractures. Interobserver agreement for detecting fractures on MRI was very good (κ = 0.847). For patients with negative initial plain radiographs who did not undergo a hip MRI, follow-up did not reveal any subsequent diagnosis of fracture. Thus, 24 of 545 patients, or an additional 4.4% of those with initially negative radiographs, were found to have fractures upon MRI.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European Society of Paediatric Radiology [^117Pojz1]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Imaging pathway for suspected physical abuse**: In cases of suspected physical abuse in children, Figure 6 outlines the appropriate initial and follow-up investigations. The investigations depend on the child's age, the presence or absence of abnormal neurology on examination, and the presence or absence of other physical injuries.

- **Imaging of the neuroaxis**: Children under 1 year with suspected abusive head trauma (AHT) should undergo a high-resolution non-contrast CT with 3-D reformats. If the CT is abnormal (intracranial haemorrhage, skull fracture, parenchymal injury), an MRI of the brain and spine should be conducted within 2–5 days. If the CT is normal with no abnormal neurology and no suspicion of non-accidental injury, no further imaging is needed. However, if the CT is normal but there is abnormal neurology or a high index of clinical suspicion for physical abuse, an MRI of the brain and whole spine is recommended within 2–5 days. An MRI of the whole spine should accompany the initial MRI brain examination for suspected AHT due to the high likelihood of associated spinal findings. MRI of the brain and spine offers increased sensitivity for parenchymal injury, intracranial haemorrhage, and fluid collections. It also aids in further delineation of extra-axial collections, assessment of septations within collections, and differentiation of acute from chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs). Dating of extra-axial haemorrhage is notably challenging and is a topic of significant debate in court settings because factors such as fluid resorption and the presence of mixed density collections can impact interpretations.

### Detection of unsuspected pelvic DVTs on abdominopelvic CT scans: a potentially life-saving diagnosis [^117Q5jEX]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious and common disorder with significant cost and morbidity implications for society, and it can be life-threatening in some cases. While the majority of VTE cases are diagnosed using lower extremity ultrasound or CT pulmonary angiography, some deep venous thrombosis (DVT) cases may occasionally be identified on CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis by an observant radiologist. The purpose of our study was to determine the fraction of new or unsuspected DVTs diagnosed on CTAP (CT of the abdomen and pelvis) and to examine their subsequent management and clinical course.

After Institutional Review Board approval, we conducted a retrospective search of an institutional imaging database to find all cases of DVTs diagnosed on CTs of the abdomen and pelvis. Patients with positive studies were further investigated through clinical chart reviews to understand their subsequent management and clinical course. The 90-day mortality of the patients diagnosed with DVT on CTAP was also recorded.

A total of 62 patients met the criteria for a positive DVT diagnosis on CTAP. Of these 62 cases, 26 (42%) were new. In 24 out of these 26 cases (92%), management was substantially changed, most commonly through the initiation of anticoagulation. The 90-day mortality rate for patients diagnosed with pelvic DVTs on CTAP in our cohort was 21%. Timely detection of pelvic DVTs can have significant implications for patient management, morbidity, and mortality. Therefore, pelvic veins should be included in the search pattern of all radiologists who review CTs of the abdomen and pelvis.

### Improving diagnostic efficiency: Analysis of pelvic MRI versus emergency hip aspiration for suspected hip sepsis [^112neaKz]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Accurately diagnosing and treating childhood hip sepsis is challenging. Adjacent bone and soft-tissue infections are common and can lead to delayed and inappropriate treatment. This study evaluated the effect of early advanced imaging (bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging) in the management of suspected hip sepsis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of pediatric patients admitted between 2003 and 2009 with suspected hip sepsis was performed. Patients were classified into two categories: Group I — immediate hip aspiration or Group II — advanced imaging performed before intervention.

- **Results**: In total, 130 patients (53 in Group I and 77 in Group II) were included. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to laboratory values, temperature, number of anesthetics, and length of hospital stay. However, patients in Group I were younger than in Group II (5.4 vs. 7.3 years, P = 0.02), and more patients in Group I were unable to bear weight on the affected limb compared with Group II (83% vs. 61%, P = 0.009). In Group I, 36 patients (68%) had a septic hip compared with 35 patients (45%) in Group II. In Group I, 16 patients (30%) required reoperation versus 13 (17%) patients in Group II. Results from the multivariate analysis demonstrated that reoperation was required 2.8 times (95% confidence interval, 1.12–6.78) more often in Group I compared to Group II (P = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Advanced imaging performed before hip aspiration improves diagnostic efficacy and may decrease the need for reoperation.

- **Level of Evidence**: III.

### Acute appendicitis complicated by septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein shown by 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT [^112ju8QT]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein is a serious infectious disorder and is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. In this case, we presented 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT findings in a 45-year-old man with acute appendicitis complicated by septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein. The 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT showed intense radiotracer uptake in the thrombosis of the portal vein, with higher SUV max and larger disease extent than the 18 F-FDG PET/CT. This case demonstrated that 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be a useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of this infectious condition.

### Initial imaging assessment of severe blunt trauma [^112EuLhr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Total body computed tomography (CT) scan is increasingly used in traumatised patients, but the need for an initial rapid imaging assessment beforehand remains unknown. To address this problem, we assessed the value of an initial imaging assessment (chest X-ray, pelvic X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography) in severely traumatised patients in a prospective study.

- **Design and setting**: Prospective study of a cohort in a Level 1 trauma centre of a university teaching hospital.

- **Patients and interventions**: 400 patients with severe blunt trauma underwent a rapid imaging assessment at the bedside within 30 minutes of arrival at the hospital, including chest and pelvic X-ray, and abdominal ultrasonography. The decision taken for each imaging technique (chest drainage or thoracotomy, pelvic angiography, and laparotomy, respectively) was judged as appropriate or inappropriate.

- **Measurements and results**: Emergency chest drainage or thoracotomy was performed in 78 cases (78 appropriate), pelvic angiography in 8 cases (5 appropriate), and immediate laparotomy in 48 cases (47 appropriate). Emergency treatment was decided in 108 patients, and the decisions were considered appropriate in 392 (98%, 95% CI: 97%-99%) cases. Three variables (heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale) were independent predictors of the need for an emergency decision, but among patients who had none of these criteria, 16% required an emergency decision.

- **Conclusions**: A simple and rapid initial imaging assessment enabled appropriate emergency decisions before further imaging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pelvic pain in the reproductive age group: 2023 update [^114zrJCL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

This review focuses on the initial imaging in the reproductive age adult population with acute pelvic pain, including patients with positive and negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels, with suspected gynecological and non-gynecological etiology. For all patients, a combination of transabdominal and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with Doppler is usually appropriate as an initial imaging study.

- **Suspected non-gynecological etiology in patients with negative β-hCG**: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, with or without contrast, is usually appropriate.

- **Suspected non-gynecological etiology in patients with positive β-hCG**: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be appropriate.

- **Suspected gynecological etiology in patients with negative β-hCG**: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast, MRI of the pelvis without contrast, or MRI of the pelvis with and without contrast may be appropriate.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence.

### Multidetector CT of expected findings and complications after hysterectomy [^115TiwrS]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Occasionally, complications such as deep venous thrombosis, bladder compression, and superinfection may occur. The latter is heralded by fever, pelvic pain, leukocytosis, and elevated acute phase reactants and is suggested at imaging by the enlargement of a known lymphocele, appearance of septations, internal inhomogeneity, or by an abscess-like appearance with thickened enhancing walls.

- **Delayed superinfection**: A lymphocele nine months after radical abdominal hysterectomy in a 41-year-old female suffering from recurrent fever after chemotherapy was observed. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed a fluid-like collection with a thick, enhancing wall in the right lateral pelvis, the site of a small lymphocele described in a previous ultrasound (not shown). Signs of iliac-femoral thrombosis were absent. Fever, laboratory, and imaging abnormalities ultimately regressed after intensive antibiotics (partially reproduced with permission from reference number).

### Imaging in pelvic osteomyelitis: Support for early magnetic resonance imaging [^1163yrMe]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Children with pelvic osteomyelitis may present with non-specific symptoms. Conventional imaging modalities, including plain radiographs, ultrasound, technetium bone scans, and computed tomography, rarely demonstrate pathology diagnostic of this condition. As a result, accurate diagnosis is often delayed, leading to surgical diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that could be avoided. This study reports the radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 23 children admitted with suspected pelvic osteomyelitis, highlighting MRI abnormalities and proposing an anatomical classification based on patterns of pelvic involvement.

- **Methods**: The medical records and imaging reports of all patients admitted with suggestive history and physical examination of pelvic osteomyelitis between July 31, 1992, and March 10, 2003, were reviewed. Diagnostic criteria were based on those used by Farley et al. in 1985. Specific attention was given to imaging strategies and the influence of each radiographic method on the ultimate diagnosis.

- **Results**: MRI abnormalities included soft tissue inflammation and bone edema, appearing bright on T2 and short inversion time short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images and enhanced after gadolinium administration. Five distinct patterns of pelvic involvement were observed, each corresponding to a cartilaginous epiphysis or apophysis.

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: a rare case report [^1131CSSh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

After 1–3 days of C-section, the patient's haemoglobin level showed a progressive decline from 97 to 88 to 83 g/L. The platelet count increased from 79 to 88 × 10⁹/L. B-ultrasound imaging suggested an abdominal wall incision haematoma. Based on these findings, we considered the diagnosis of abdominal incision haematoma after C-section. A second surgery for the removal of the abdominal wall haematoma was performed on the third day after the C-section. We removed a blood clot of approximately 100 mL between the rectus abdominis and the anterior sheath. Moreover, approximately 10 mL of blood clot was removed from the right rear of the rectus abdominis, peritoneal front. The intraoperative blood loss was approximately 20 ml.

On postoperative day 1 of the second surgery, the patient recorded a body temperature of 39.5°C, a low haemoglobin level of 89 g/L, and an increased platelet count of 108 × 10⁹/L. The patient was administered piperacillin-tazobactam at 2.5 g every 8 hours and levofloxacin at 0.4 g daily. Acetaminophen was also administered as an antipyretic symptomatic treatment. The patient was advised to get out of bed as early as possible and move more frequently to prevent thrombosis.

On postoperative day 2 of the second surgery, the body temperature was 38.6°C, the haemoglobin level was 83 g/L, and the platelet count increased to 138 × 10⁹/L. On postoperative day 3, the body temperature declined to 37.2°C. On postoperative day 4 of the second surgery, the haemoglobin level was 84 g/L, and the platelet count level was 167 × 10⁹/L. Her fibrinogen level was 2.2 g/L.

### Recognizing the CT manifestations of gynecologic conditions encountered in the emergency department [^111gWhKe]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Women commonly present to the emergency room with subacute or acute symptoms of gynecologic origin. Although a pelvic exam and ultrasound (US) are the preferred initial diagnostic tools for gynecologic entities, a CT is often the first-line imaging modality in the emergency department. This paper provides a review of normal uterine enhancement and normal pregnancy-related findings, and familiarizes radiologists with the CT appearances of gynecologic entities traditionally described on ultrasound that may present to the emergency department.

### The natural history of pelvic vein thrombosis on magnetic resonance venography after vaginal delivery [^117AB4UR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism constitutes the leading cause of direct maternal mortality in the developed world. At the time of writing, there are no studies using magnetic resonance venography (MRV) to delineate the incidence and natural history of intraluminal filling defects in the postpartum period in patients with low thrombosis risk.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective cohort study of women at low thrombosis risk postvaginal delivery undergoing MRV in the early postpartum period.

- **Results**: In 30 eligible and consenting participants, independently adjudicated MRV, conducted on a median of postpartum day 1, identified definite thrombosis in 30% (95% confidence interval, 13.6–46.4%) of study participants. All episodes of definite thrombosis were identified in the iliac and ovarian veins. Probable thrombosis was identified in an additional 27% of study participants (95% CI, 10.3–41.7%), and possible thrombosis in an additional 10% (95% CI, 0–20.7%).

- **Conclusion**: In this group of low-risk postpartum patients, we identified a high prevalence of definite pelvic vein intraluminal filling defects of uncertain clinical significance. This study suggests that some degree of pelvic vein intraluminal filling defect may be a normal finding after uncomplicated vaginal delivery.

### Pelvic venous disorders in women: 5-year update from a Society of Interventional Radiology Foundation-sponsored research consensus panel [^114TKY3v]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) are rarely considered a cause of chronic pelvic pain in women evaluated by nonvascular specialists. A Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Foundation-sponsored Research Consensus Panel addressed this issue, identifying multiple gaps in the literature and making recommendations to enhance the evidence. Since the publication of these recommendations in 2019, significant progress has been made in developing the necessary tools to improve the ability to conduct rigorous clinical studies and advance the evidence supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PeVD. This report summarizes the 5-year impact of the panel's recommendations. The investment made by the SIR Foundation to host a Research Consensus Panel on PeVD has facilitated enduring academic productivity related to this clinical issue.

### Consensus statement on the management of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions from the VIVA Foundation, the American Venous Forum, and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society [^1152ofGd]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Low credibility.

CT venography has previously demonstrated value in detecting thrombus within abdominal and pelvic venous structures. However, there are no large studies specifically correlating the anatomic features and metrics of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL) on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the presence of venous stasis symptoms. A retrospective series of 50 asymptomatic patients found that 24% had greater than 50% diameter compression of the left iliac vein on CT. MR venography showed 90% sensitivity in a retrospective series of 28 patients with NIVL; nonetheless, its utility is limited by availability, patient tolerance, and potential for artifacts.

Venous duplex ultrasonography may serve as an alternative method for diagnosing NIVL noninvasively in centers with local expertise in this modality. While not predictive of symptoms, these data suggest that the anatomic features of NIVL can be identified through axial imaging and may be valuable in assessing for NIVL in the presence of symptoms.

### A diagnostic dilemma of fever and back pain postpartum [^115CJNrb]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old woman presented with fever, chills, and back pain 6 weeks postpartum. An infused CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast confirmed septic pelvic vein thrombophlebitis as the diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report describing such a massive thrombophlebitis extending from the superior vena cava to the femoral vein inferiorly, responsive to conventional anticoagulation therapy. This exceptional case reminds us to consider septic pelvic thrombophlebitis in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with fever and back pain of unknown etiology.

- **Analysis and interpretation**: These same contributors participated in the analysis and interpretation of the data gathered from the ultrasound technology.
- **Data collection**: The aforementioned team members also contributed to data collection efforts to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential venous disorders.
- **Writing the article**: FF, JS, FB, MS, NO, and IT collectively contributed to composing and refining the article, focusing on highlighting the benefits and methods of transvaginal ultrasound.
- **Critical revision of the article**: The article underwent critical revision by all contributors to enhance its clarity and accuracy.
- **Final approval of the article**: The complete drafting and revision process received final approval by FF.
- **Statistical analysis**: Not applicable, as this study did not incorporate quantitative analysis methods.
- **Obtained funding**: Not applicable, as the study did not require external funding resources.
- **Overall responsibility**: FF was accountable for overseeing the entirety of the project, ensuring its integrity and validity.

These contributions underscore the collaborative effort in advancing diagnostic methodologies for pelvic venous disorders, although the study's low credibility rating suggests cautious interpretation and further validation is necessary.

### MDCT of pelvic inflammatory disease: A review of the pathophysiology, gamut of imaging findings, and treatment [^112BEoSt]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), representing an ascending, sexually spread pyogenic infection of the female genital tract, is a commonly encountered cause for emergency visits and hospitalizations among young and adult female patients. Although gynecologic evaluation and sonography constitute the mainstay of diagnosis, multidetector CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is frequently performed as the initial imaging modality due to the often vague and indeterminate clinical presentation. Thus, knowledge and attention to the often subtle early imaging features of PID provide radiologists with a critical opportunity to direct and expedite appropriate pathways of patient care, minimizing the risk for secondary complications, including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and enteric adhesions.

This paper reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, early and late imaging features of PID, as well as potential secondary complications and treatment options. Additionally, it discusses published data metrics on CT performance regarding sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and potential imaging differential diagnostic considerations.

### Imaging of pelvic venous disorders (PeVD); should every patient get an MRI [^114iw6m6]? Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Pelvic venous disease (PeVD) is part of the broad differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain, presenting a challenging diagnostic and clinical workup to identify those patients most likely to benefit from intervention. Ultrasound, MRI, CT, venography, and intravascular ultrasound can all provide information to aid in the diagnostic algorithm. The purpose of this article is to review imaging as a component of the outpatient workup of patients with chronic pelvic pain, guiding the appropriate understanding and use of imaging modalities to accurately identify patients suffering from PeVD. A favored approach is to begin with transabdominal sonography, with selective use of MRI/MRV in specific patient populations.

### Can cross-sectional imaging replace diagnostic venography in pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) [^116JanHw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. The present study included a limited sample size, which poses a risk of type II error. The results may be subject to selection bias because this study is retrospective. The outcomes were reported from a single tertiary referral center, which may not be generalizable to other, less experienced centers. The lack of IVUS is a significant limitation in assessing compression syndromes in our study. Additionally, the absence of treatment is considered a significant limitation because the uncertainty regarding the patients' outcomes, when certain imaging modalities are not utilized, is a considerable limitation. The lack of treatment can affect their results.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^1125yTLj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

In stable patients with suspected Fournier's gangrene, we suggest considering performing a CT scan (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with Fournier's gangrene, we recommend that imaging should not delay surgical intervention (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). For those with Fournier's gangrene and hemodynamic instability persisting after proper resuscitation, we suggest against CT imaging (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene is mainly clinical. Plain radiographs, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate gas in the soft tissue planes and help determine the extent of the disease. Evidence of gas formation is present in nearly half of all patients with FG and is highly specific (94%).

Ultrasonographic findings typically include marked thickening of the scrotal skin, soft tissue inflammation, collections/abscesses, and subcutaneous gas. Additionally, ultrasound can demonstrate paratesticular fluid, which is seen prior to clinical crepitus; it also allows examination of scrotal contents along with Doppler blood flow. As imaging evaluation in patients with FG may be limited by factors such as acute renal failure or hemodynamic instability, which make transport to the imaging department unsafe, bedside and point-of-care ultrasound have emerged as useful tools for FG diagnosis. Ultrasound has multiple advantages: it can be promptly performed at the patient's bedside and can evaluate the scrotal region efficiently.

Lemierre syndrome is a potentially fatal condition following an oropharyngeal infection. It is characterized by thrombophlebitis of head and neck veins with systemic dissemination of septic emboli. The most frequently isolated pathogen is Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report an unusual case of Lemierre syndrome in a 4-year-old child caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with multivisceral emboli affecting the brain, orbits, lungs, and heart valves. We also discuss its atypical clinical presentation, the crucial role of imaging in early diagnosis, and the different treatment modalities of this life-threatening syndrome.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the emergency department (ED), all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation to the ED. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the observers, specifically the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To guarantee a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalizing the ultrasound part of the case record form.

The CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, so all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist. Contrary to ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours. To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed (< 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, 1,000–5,000).

### ACR appropriateness criteria: Postmenopausal subacute or chronic pelvic pain [^114Hfqkc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Pelvic pain is common in both reproductive age and postmenopausal women, and the major etiologies change throughout the life cycle. Chronic pain is defined as lasting for at least 6 months. There are many gastrointestinal and urinary disorders associated with chronic pain in this age group, which are not discussed in this guideline.

Pain may be localized to the deep pelvis, with potential causes including pelvic congestion syndrome, intraperitoneal adhesions, hydrosalpinx, chronic inflammatory disease, or cervical stenosis. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, while CT and MRI may be appropriate for further characterization of sonographic findings.

Alternatively, pain may be localized to the vagina, vulva, or perineum, with potential causes including vaginal atrophy, vaginismus, vaginal or vulvar cysts, vulvodynia, or pelvic myofascial pain. Imaging is primarily indicated in the context of an abnormal physical exam. Ultrasound is the initial modality of choice, while MRI may be appropriate for further characterization in select cases.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment.

### The utility of dynamic magnetic resonance venography in the setting of pelvic venous pathology [^113GMTrD]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The standard initial noninvasive imaging modality for diagnosing May-Thurner syndrome is duplex ultrasound. However, this modality provides only indirect measures and is frequently limited, necessitating further imaging to make the diagnosis. Other noninvasive imaging modalities, such as computed tomographic venography, time-of-flight imaging, and magnetic resonance venography, allow for direct visualization but lack hemodynamic and anatomic information about the cardiac cycle.

Intravascular ultrasound is the invasive tool of choice in the setting of iliac vein compression syndrome, but quality, noninvasive imaging modalities have yet to be described. Contrast-enhanced, dynamic magnetic resonance venography allows for detailed imaging of the pelvis as well as dynamic vascular imaging, thereby improving preoperative planning.

### Pylephlebitis complicating acute appendicitis: Prompt diagnosis with contrast-enhanced computed tomography [^111uKV5d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Pylephlebitis, a rare complication of abdominal infections, is a septic thrombophlebitis of the portal venous system with high rates of morbidity and mortality.

- **Case report**: We present a case of pylephlebitis complicating acute appendicitis and report the utility of a computed tomography scan in the diagnosis.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: The prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of pylephlebitis are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality, but clinical presentation is often nonspecific. A computed tomography scan is instrumental in the early diagnosis of pylephlebitis because it readily reveals the thrombus in the mesenteric or portal vein in the setting of acute appendicitis. Early and aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary, and anticoagulation therapy can also be used to prevent bowel ischemia.

### Septic thrombophlebitis of multiple dural sinuses extending to bilateral internal jugular veins due to acute sphenoid sinusitis: A case of Lemierre's syndrome [^113nURJA]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Lemierre's syndrome (LS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by septic thrombophlebitis within the head and neck region. The lack of a standardized definition in the literature contributes to its limited evidence base. LS presents with various clinical manifestations, often showing atypical features across different age groups, and early diagnosis of LS is challenging due to its nonspecific nature. Recent evidence highlights significant short- and long-term morbidity risks. Successful management requires a multidisciplinary approach and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

While LS is commonly associated with oropharyngeal infections, it can also arise from non-oropharyngeal sources, complicating diagnosis and management. We present a case of LS secondary to acute isolated sphenoid sinusitis in an 86-year-old woman. Imaging revealed multiple metastatic septic thrombophlebitis, including bilateral cavernous, inferior petrosal, right transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and internal jugular veins. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius, and endoscopic sphenoidotomy identified a fungus ball, with cultures confirming Streptococcus anginosus and Aspergillus fumigatus. The patient demonstrated significant recovery with no complications at follow-up.

This case illustrates a complex, multifocal pattern of septic thrombophlebitis, extending to multiple venous structures, highlighting the need for comprehensive imaging and a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosing and managing this rare complication.

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: a rare case report [^1176uT1d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

On postoperative day 1, the patient complained of the surgical wound being painful but bearable. Physical examination showed normal body temperature with dry and odourless petechial haemorrhage on the skin surrounding the abdominal incision above the uterine margin and below the navel. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 10.20 × 10⁹/L, the haemoglobin level was 97 g/L, and the platelet count level was 79 × 10⁹/L.

On postoperative day 2, she complained of aggravated pain at the abdominal incision and odourless ecchymosis of the skin around the abdominal incision at the right lateral margin with local tension. The body temperature was 37.5 °C, the WBC count was 11.32 × 10⁹/L, the haemoglobin level was 88 g/L, and the platelet count level was 85 × 10⁹/L. A palpable mass with unclear boundary and tenderness was detected.

On postoperative day 3, the pain of the patient's incision progressively aggravated, with a body temperature of 38.2 °C. An ultrasound examination revealed an abdominal wall incision haematoma with a size of approximately 43 × 32 × 10 mm. The WBC count was 9.05 × 10⁹/L. The haemoglobin level was 83 g/L, and the platelet count was 88 × 10⁹/L.

### Is a pelvic examination contributory in the initial evaluation of women with recurrent urinary tract infections [^117UosJh]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) affect up to 44% of women; evidence-based guidelines regarding the contributory role of a pelvic examination in these women are lacking. We hypothesize that routine pelvic examination has a limited role in the evaluation and management of women with rUTI when appropriate symptoms-based screening is performed and normal post-void residual volume (PVR) is confirmed.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of women ages 18–85 years presenting to Wake Forest Pelvic Health Center with two culture-proven UTIs in 6 months or three UTIs in 12 months with a documented pelvic examination. Pregnant women were excluded. Data extraction included demographics, medical history, screening assessment of vaginal bulge symptoms, urine culture results, imaging, physical/pelvic examination findings, PVR, treatment recommendations, and outcomes within 1 year of initial assessment. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were performed.

- **Results**: Of 160 charts screened, 91 met the inclusion criteria. Nineteen (21%) had symptoms of vaginal bulge, and 14 (17%) had PVR > 100 ml. Pelvic examination provided new/contributory information in eight (8.8%) of women. The negative predictive value of absence of bulge symptoms and normal PVR was 89%. Within 1 year, 41 (46%) reported symptom resolution with rUTI treatment with no difference between those with or without a contributory pelvic examination (p value = 0.64).

- **Conclusions**: In women with rUTI who report absence of vaginal bulge symptoms and have a PVR < 100 ml, a pelvic examination has limited contributory value.

### Computed tomography imaging of septic shock. Beyond the cause: the "CT hypoperfusion complex". A pictorial essay [^111D2YvX]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The importance of diagnostic imaging for establishing the source of infection is well recognized. A wide range of imaging tools is currently available for investigating septic shock. The choice of imaging modality depends on several factors, the most important of which include the overall clinical condition of the patient and the presence or absence of localizing signs and symptoms as summarized in Table 1.

The diagnostic accuracy of CT for identifying the source of clinically suspected septic shock has been well established, allowing for the rapid and detailed study of multiple body areas simultaneously. CT provides a standardized method for patient evaluation, which is not operator-dependent. In a few minutes, CT can provide images of multiple body regions simultaneously, improving the ability to identify the septic source, which can enhance patient management. CT also plays an increasingly important role in guiding aspiration and drainage with a high degree of accuracy.

CT should be performed in all patients using a spiral technique, craniocaudal acquisition, and in a supine position with abducted upper limbs to reduce the radiation dose and guarantee higher image quality of the thoraco-abdominal organs. Breath-hold acquisitions can ensure the avoidance of motion artifacts. In emergency settings, CT examinations should include both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced acquisitions of the abdomen. High concentrations (370–400 mg I/mL) of intravenous (IV) contrast medium (80–130 mL iodinated contrast medium, depending on the patient).

### Computed tomography imaging of septic shock. Beyond the cause: The "CT hypoperfusion complex". A pictorial essay [^113DpGcB]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Septic shock qualifies as a medical emergency and represents one of the most important causes for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Sepsis refers to life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated host response to infection. According to the new Septic 2016 definition, also referred to as Sepsis-3, septic shock patients can be identified by the co-occurrence of sepsis symptoms with persistent hypotension that requires vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or higher, or serum lactate levels > 2 mmoL/L (18 mg/dL), despite adequate volume resuscitation. This revised definition emphasizes that sepsis is the primary cause of death from infection.

Sepsis-associated mortality is high, ranging from 10 to 40%, and the incidence of sepsis has continuously increased in parallel with the average age of the population and the increased invasiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Mortality is associated with multiple pathogenic factors, including the timeliness of diagnosis and the execution of appropriate and early treatment. Due to the high mortality rate, the early identification and appropriate management of sepsis are crucial to improving outcomes, as well as time-dependent emergencies such as polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke.

The management of septic shock requires prompt recognition and the appropriate administration of antibiotic therapy, hemodynamic support, and the identification and treatment of the infection source. Early sepsis identification is the cornerstone of management.

### Vascular CT and MRI: A practical guide to imaging protocols [^11246a6p]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

CT/MR venography of the abdomen and pelvis is commonly performed to assess for the extension of lower limb deep vein thromboses (DVTs) or for a compressive venous syndrome, such as May-Thurner syndrome, which is the obstruction of the left common iliac vein by the crossing right common iliac artery. MRV is preferable to CTV due to the presence of contrast mixing artifact with the latter, and imaging of the thighs can be included (see Figs. 13 and 14). CTV is preferred when assessing potential inferior vena cava (IVC) filter complications, such as malposition, migration, tilting, caval thrombosis, or perforation.

- **Figure 13**: A 45-year-old man with bilateral leg swelling underwent an MR venogram of the abdomen and pelvis. A coronal image from a T2-weighted sequence (a) demonstrated an expanded suprarenal IVC with heterogeneous T2 high signal material, likely thrombus (arrow). Coronal (b) and axial (c) images from a venous-phase T1-weighted fat-saturated post-gadolinium sequence demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement of the intraluminal IVC material, raising concern for tumor thrombus. A coronal image from a T1-weighted fat-saturated post-gadolinium sequence of the abdomen (d) shows a horseshoe kidney with an exophytic mass arising from the right lower moiety (curved arrow), which was subsequently confirmed as a papillary renal cell carcinoma on biopsy.

- **Figure 14**: A 35-year-old woman underwent an abdominal MR venogram 5 days post-dilation and curettage for an intrauterine fetal death at 25 weeks. Coronal images from a post-contrast venous-phase fat-saturated T1 sequence depict the findings.

### The spectrum of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1152dbdw]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Pelvic infection presents a serious problem for the practicing physician and the radiologist who is called to determine the origin and extent of the inflammatory process. Pelvic infection may clinically mimic other pelvic inflammatory processes, and imaging based on the various aspects of it may provide information to distinguish pelvic infection from other pelvic pathological conditions. This article reviews the various imaging modalities involved in the radiological management of pelvic infection, as well as their findings, with special attention to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Although discouraged in childbearing-age women, CT often provides the first diagnosis of an unsuspected acute gynaecological disorder; therefore, familiarity with their imaging appearances is crucial to avoid missing or misinterpreting clinically important entities which may require surgical treatment. If clinical conditions and scanner availability permit, MRI is superior to CT for further characterisation of uterine abnormalities causing acute pain and genital bleeding. Additionally, cross-sectional imaging is helpful to elucidate the varied imaging appearances of PID and atypical genital infections.

### Polyarticular septic arthritis secondary to septic thrombophlebitis of the brachiocephalic vein: A rare case report [^114KickQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Polyarticular septic arthritis (PASA) accounts for approximately 15% of all septic arthritides and is rare in immunocompetent adults. Even with appropriate therapy, PASA's mortality rate is nearly 50%.

- **Case report**: We report a rare presentation of PASA caused by idiopathic septic thrombophlebitis of the brachiocephalic vein in an immunocompetent adult female patient who presented with symptoms of right clavicular, left wrist, and right hip pain associated with fevers. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in blood cultures and joint aspiration of one of the affected hips. A transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for valvular vegetations, and computed tomography of the chest with contrast revealed thrombi in the brachiocephalic and subclavian veins extending to the superior vena cava. It also showed bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with septic pulmonary emboli. No clear precipitant for the underlying septic thrombophlebitis was identified. Management was conservative, with systemic anticoagulation and IV antibiotics. The patient's symptoms improved, and she was discharged to subacute rehabilitation.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Early diagnosis and treatment of PASA in the emergency department is imperative to reducing overall morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case report of idiopathic septic thrombophlebitis of the subclavian vein causing PASA in an immunocompetent adult.

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: a rare case report [^113ccqVG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) is a well-recognized but rare puerperal complication that has two types: ovarian vein thrombophlebitis (OVT) and deep septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (DSPT). This case report describes the clinical and imaging findings of a female patient diagnosed with right ovarian vein infectious thrombophlebitis after caesarean section (C-section).

- **Case presentation**: A 35-year-old G3P2 female who presented with a foetal vein Galen malformation at 41 weeks of gestation underwent a C-section. The patient exhibited a high fever after the procedure, and anti-inflammatory treatment was ineffective within one week. An abdominal wall incision haematoma was discovered, necessitating a second surgery for its removal. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with an abdominal incision haematoma and right ovarian vein infectious thrombophlebitis after the C-section. Imipenem and tigecycline were used to enhance the anti-inflammatory effects, while low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin were administered as anticoagulant therapy. On the 30th day after the C-section, the right ovarian vein thrombus disappeared.

- **Conclusion**: This case highlights the need to consider the potential relationship between abdominal incision haematoma and ovarian vein thrombophlebitis. Despite advances in the management of venous thromboembolism globally, more data on epidemiology, including first incidence, prevalence, recurrence, risk factors, management of bleeding complications, and increased awareness in Asian populations, are necessary.

### Can cross-sectional imaging replace diagnostic venography in pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) [^115ABgEC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

In comparing MRV with venography, MRV was less likely to visualize dilated ovarian veins (66.7% vs. 86.7%; p = 0.009) and pelvic plexus (46.7% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.027). Venography was more likely to detect ovarian vein incompetence (73.3% vs. 60%; p = 0.121) and pelvic plexus incompetence (80% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.003).

- **Comparison with venography**: Venography was superior in demonstrating moderate and severe venous congestion with a P value of .034.

- **Comparing CTV with venography**: CTV was more likely to detect IIV dilations (60% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.003) and IIVR (73.3% vs. 40%; P < .001).

- **Venography performance**: Venography was more likely to visualize OV dilations (80% vs. 53.3%; p = 0.001) and pelvic plexus dilations (60% vs. 40%; p = 0.028). It was also superior in demonstrating moderate and severe venous congestion with a P value of .002.

Additionally, both CTV and diagnostic venography modalities did not show any findings related to Nutcracker syndrome and inferior vena cava anomalies. Intravenous ultrasound (IVUS) was not used in our study due to cost and unavailability at our institution. The pressure gradient was not evaluated, as Nutcracker syndrome was not a focus of this analysis.

### Computed tomography in patients with sepsis presenting to the emergency department: Exploring its role in light of patient outcomes [^115R9oXw]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

In the CT group (n = 62/192), 96.8% of the patients received a microbiological test to identify the responsible agent, though in 20%, no agent was identified. A detailed description of the etiological agents can be found in the supplementary Table 2.

The median time-to-CT after sepsis diagnosis (ttCTsd) was 3.83 hours (IQR 1.50–29.97 hours), whereas the median time-to-CT after emergency department arrival (ttCTeda) was 7.44 hours (IQR 3.68–30.77 hours). Concerning organ regions covered by the CT scan, approximately half of the patients (n = 32) received a CT scan of more than one organ region. Specifically, in 33.9% of the patients (n = 21), more than two organ regions were scanned; in 12.9% (n = 8), more than three; and in 4.8% (n = 3), four organ regions were scanned.

The most commonly examined region was the chest (95.2%; n = 49/62), followed by the abdomen/pelvis (62.9%; n = 39/62), and the head (19.4%; n = 12/62). The extremities were the organ region least commonly examined at 4.8% (n = 3/62). The percentage of positive findings on CT, graded as possible or certain foci per organ region, was 57.1% (n = 28/49) for the chest and 53.9% (n = 21/39) for the abdomen/pelvis. An infectious focus was least commonly found in the head (8.3%, n = 1/11).

- **Focus-CTs**: In 58.1% (n = 36/62), secondary findings were documented. Most commonly, other findings (55.6%; n = 20/36), tumor (11.1%; n = 4/36), and trauma (8.3%; n = 3/36) were noted. Only one patient had a fracture as an incidental finding. In 25.0% (n = 9/36), several secondary findings were documented.

### Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis presenting as ureteral obstruction [^112ziUL4]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a relatively uncommon but serious postpartum complication. Although infrequent, OVT may progress to involve the inferior vena cava, the renal vein, or may cause sepsis and septic pulmonary embolism, all of which are potentially life-threatening. Clinical misdiagnosis is common, and, unfortunately, most affected women undergo laparotomy for possible appendicitis. We present an interesting case of OVT presenting as ureteral obstruction in a postpartum woman who was in her early 20s.

Knowledge of this entity and clinical suspicion for its occurrence in a puerperal patient with fever and abdominal pain not responding to antibiotics should guide clinicians to appropriate diagnosis and treatment, avoiding misdiagnosis, unnecessary laparotomy, and potential complications.

### ACR Appropriateness Criteria® osteomyelitis or septic arthritis-child (excluding axial skeleton) [^1149eE7k]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Imaging plays an integral role in the evaluation of suspected musculoskeletal infections in children, not only in the accurate identification of infections such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis but also in guiding management. Various diagnostic modalities serve different purposes in the assessment of suspected pediatric musculoskeletal infections. The purpose of this document is to provide imaging guidance in the most frequently encountered clinical scenarios in which osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis are suspected, outside of the axial skeleton.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion is utilized to guide recommendations.

### 18f-fdg pet/ct for diagnosing infectious complications in patients with severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy or stem cell transplantation [^117KH3mV]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

We found a clear correlation between FDG uptake in the CVC tract and septic thrombophlebitis of the subclavian vein, supporting the results of another study on the value of 18 F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosing septic thrombophlebitis, where 18 F-FDG PET/CT was prospectively conducted in patients with suspected septic thrombophlebitis. 18 F-FDG PET/CT indicated pathological tracer uptake in all nine patients with proven septic thrombophlebitis. Control patients in that study were collected from a retrospective cohort of patients with deep venous thrombosis without signs of infection who underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT for other reasons. Selection bias in that study makes it impossible to calculate positive and negative predictive values of 18 F-FDG PET/CT for detecting septic thrombophlebitis.

A caveat in our study is that ultrasound was only performed on clinical grounds, potentially missing asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis. However, the negative predictive value of 18 F-FDG PET/CT for the presence of septic thrombophlebitis is estimated to be high (94%), as in only one patient with persistent bacteraemia was a deep venous thrombosis ruled out solely on the absence of clinical signs. On the other hand, the positive predictive value (67%) regarding septic thrombophlebitis might be underestimated in our study, because ultrasound was not performed in all patients, precluding these patients from fulfilling the definition of septic thrombophlebitis. In three patients with FDG uptake in the subclavian tract and persistent bacteraemia, only one ult

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: A rare case report [^1153Vbzz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

In view of the lack of precise laboratory examination methods, the diagnosis of SPT has been challenged. After physical examination, the patient usually exhibits no toxic reaction. The lower abdomen may have tenderness on palpation, and occasionally, a cord or sausage-like abdominal tenderness may be recognized, which is the most diagnostic finding in an abdominal examination, but it is rare. In less than one-third of cases, leukocytosis is moderate and blood cultures are positive. In this case, although the patient's clinical condition did not change, the analysis parameters of inflammation improved after the third antibiotic treatment.

Although the incidence of VTE in Asian populations is lower than that in Western countries, the overall burden of VTE in Asia has been greatly underestimated. Factors that can explain the lower prevalence of VTE in Asian populations relative to Western populations may include the limited availability of Asian epidemiological data, ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility to VTE, low awareness of thrombotic diseases in diagnosis, and fewer Asian patients with symptomatic VTE. Generally, the clinical evaluation, diagnostic tests, and treatment precautions of VTE between Asian and Western populations are the same. Management of VTE is based on balancing the benefits of treatment with the risk of bleeding. For Asian populations, this is a particularly important consideration because of the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage caused by the use of vitamin K antagonists.
