## Question

A 37-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, comes to the physician for very painful menses that have caused her to miss at least 3 days of work during each menstrual cycle for the past 6 months. Menses occur with heavy bleeding at regular 28-day intervals. She also has constant dull pain in the pelvic region between cycles. She is otherwise healthy. She weighs 53 kg (117 lb) and is 160 cm tall; BMI is 20.7 kg/m². Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Pelvic ultrasonography shows a uniformly enlarged uterus and asymmetric thickening of the myometrial wall with a poorly defined endomyometrial border. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?
A. Endometrial tissue within the uterine wall
B. Endometrial tissue in the fallopian tubes
C. Cystic enlargement of the ovaries
D. Benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option is the most likely cause of the findings in a 37-year-old woman with severe dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, chronic pelvic pain, a uniformly enlarged uterus, asymmetric myometrial thickening, and a poorly defined endomyometrial junction on ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how the clinical presentation maps onto potential etiologies. Then, I should verify which imaging features are most specific and which are supportive. Next, I will compare the leading differential diagnoses (adenomyosis, leiomyomas, endometriosis) against the provided data. Finally, I will align the most likely diagnosis with the pathophysiology and guideline-supported imaging criteria to reach a confident conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. Severe dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, and chronic pelvic pain in a reproductive-age woman strongly suggest a uterine source of pain and bleeding, with adenomyosis high on the list; endometriosis remains in the differential, but the uterine-centric symptoms and exam without adnexal masses or nodularity make isolated endometriosis less likely as the primary driver here [^112qBvT7] [^116SJhqY].

> Now, I need to check the imaging features against established adenomyosis criteria. A uniformly enlarged uterus, asymmetric myometrial wall thickening, and a poorly defined endomyometrial junction are classic indirect sonographic features of adenomyosis per MUSA and contemporary reviews; these reflect myometrial hypertrophy and disruption of the junctional zone rather than discrete masses, which fits the described ultrasound [^117MBaXX] [^114rDDg8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the key differentials. Leiomyomas typically present as well-circumscribed, round, hypoechoic masses with shadowing and a preserved endomyometrial interface; the described "poorly defined endomyometrial border" and diffuse uterine enlargement without discrete fibroids argue against leiomyomas as the primary diagnosis here, although coexistence is possible and not rare [^112ooduR] [^111AZPDW]. Endometriosis can cause dysmenorrhea and chronic pain, but the uterine enlargement and asymmetric myometrial thickening with junctional zone blurring are not expected with isolated endometriosis; moreover, endometriosis is best visualized as ovarian endometriomas or deep infiltrating lesions rather than diffuse uterine wall changes, which we do not have here [^116SJhqY] [^113YDvS5].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Adenomyosis is defined by ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium, disrupting the endomyometrial junction and inciting myometrial hypertrophy; this histopathology directly explains the ultrasound findings of asymmetric myometrial thickening, globular uterine enlargement, and a blurred endomyometrial interface, aligning with the case description [^114Vui4n] [^111h4DiL].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic framework and guideline direction. SOGC recommends transvaginal ultrasound as first-line imaging for suspected adenomyosis, with MRI as a second-line problem-solver when ultrasound is inconclusive or when concomitant pathology is suspected; the constellation of indirect MUSA features seen here is sufficient to support a clinical diagnosis of adenomyosis without immediate MRI in most cases, reserving MRI for equivocal scenarios or surgical planning [^116yLTG7] [^115WhTfs] [^112Kyujk].

> Putting this together, the most likely cause of these findings is endometrial tissue within the uterine wall — adenomyosis — because the clinical triad of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and chronic pelvic pain matches adenomyosis, and the ultrasound triad of uniform uterine enlargement, asymmetric myometrial thickening, and a poorly defined endomyometrial junction is characteristic of adenomyosis per MUSA and contemporary imaging reviews; the absence of discrete fibroids and the uterine-centric imaging pattern make leiomyomas and isolated endometriosis less likely primary explanations here [^112qBvT7] [^117MBaXX] [^114rDDg8].

> Final answer: A. Endometrial tissue within the uterine wall (adenomyosis).

---

The most likely cause of the findings is **adenomyosis** [^114rDDg8], defined by endometrial tissue within the myometrium, which explains the uniformly enlarged uterus, asymmetric myometrial thickening, and blurred endomyometrial junction on ultrasound [^117NbGeZ] [^114rDDg8]. This diagnosis aligns with the patient's severe dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, and chronic pelvic pain [^112qBvT7] [^114NUGfn]. Leiomyomas would show discrete, well-circumscribed masses [^112ooduR]; endometriosis would present with endometrial tissue outside the uterus; and cystic ovarian enlargement would not explain the uterine findings.

---

## Clinical presentation and risk factors

Adenomyosis typically presents with **dysmenorrhea**, **menorrhagia**, and **chronic pelvic pain** [^112qBvT7], often with a uniformly enlarged uterus and asymmetric myometrial thickening on imaging [^117NbGeZ] [^117XTnxV]. Risk factors include **parity**, **prior uterine surgery**, and **age** [^116iQYWs] [^111qG7s6]. This patient's symptoms and imaging are consistent with adenomyosis [^114rDDg8].

---

## Ultrasound findings

Ultrasound is the **first-line imaging** for adenomyosis [^116yLTG7], with characteristic features [^117MBaXX]:

- **Uniformly enlarged uterus**: Diffuse myometrial involvement [^117NbGeZ].
- **Asymmetric myometrial thickening**: Often posterior wall predominance [^116mWZug].
- **Poorly defined endomyometrial junction**: Blurred interface from endometrial invasion [^116mWZug].
- **Myometrial heterogeneity**: Hypoechoic striations and small cysts [^117NbGeZ].

These findings match the patient's ultrasound and support adenomyosis [^112Kyujk].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Ultrasound findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Adenomyosis | - Dysmenorrhea <br/> - Menorrhagia <br/> - Chronic pelvic pain <br/> - Uniformly enlarged uterus | - Asymmetric myometrial thickening <br/> - Poorly defined endomyometrial junction <br/> - Myometrial heterogeneity [^114rDDg8] |
| Leiomyomas (fibroids) | - Discrete masses <br/> - Well-circumscribed <br/> - Often multiple | - Well-defined hypoechoic masses <br/> - Circumferential flow <br/> - Shadowing [^112ooduR] |
| Endometriosis | - Cyclic pain <br/> - Infertility <br/> - Endometrial tissue outside uterus | - Ovarian endometriomas <br/> - Deep infiltrating lesions <br/> - Normal uterine architecture [^117XTnxV] |
| Cystic enlargement of ovaries | - Adnexal masses <br/> - Often asymptomatic | - Ovarian cysts <br/> - Normal uterine architecture [^notfound] |

---

The patient's ultrasound and symptoms are most consistent with **adenomyosis**, not fibroids, endometriosis, or ovarian cysts [^112Kyujk].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely cause is **adenomyosis**, with endometrial tissue within the myometrium explaining the uniform uterine enlargement, asymmetric myometrial thickening, and blurred endomyometrial junction, along with severe dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia [^115anqpM].

### Adenomyosis [^116mfJsY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is characterized as ectopic endometrial tissues within the myometrium in the uterus. The etiology and pathogenetic mechanism(s) responsible for adenomyosis are poorly understood. Definite diagnosis is made on hysterectomy specimens, although attempts are made at securing preoperative diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging and myometrial biopsies. Definite treatment of symptomatic women is hysterectomy.

### Grading sonographic severity of adenomyosis: a pilot study assessing feasibility and interobserver reliability [^117MBaXX]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis is a benign uterine disease associated with dysmenorrhea, heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, as well as with subfertility, recurrent miscarriages, and poor in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. These symptoms may significantly affect a patient's quality of life. The reported prevalence of adenomyosis varies broadly, ranging between 5% and 70%. Great heterogeneity in study populations, different diagnostic modalities and criteria (histology, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], and transvaginal ultrasonography [TVUS]) might cause this broad range.

MRI and TVUS are the modalities of choice in diagnosing adenomyosis and are equally accurate. However, MRI is more expensive and not a point‐of‐care test. The introduction of 2‐dimensional (2D) and 3‐dimensional (3D) images in TVUS improved the diagnostic accuracy of TVUS. Recent developments in TVUS enable the noninvasive diagnosis of less pronounced adenomyosis, allowing earlier and customized management. Currently, TVUS is suggested to be the first step in the clinical pathway of women with symptoms of adenomyosis. In 2019, a sonographic criteria and reporting system for adenomyosis was recommended by the MUSA (Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment) group and was updated in 2021. The latest MUSA paper suggested a distinction between direct and indirect features. Direct features of adenomyosis indicating the presence of ectopic endometrium within the myometrium are subendometrial lines and buds, hyperechoic islands, and myometrial cysts. In contrast, indirect features are related to the secondary sonographic effects of ectopic endometrial tissue, such as shadowing and an interrupted junctional zone, or related to the associated myometrial hypertrophy such as globular uterus or asymmetric myometrium. The absence of direct features of adenomyosis makes the diagnosis of adenomyosis less likely. Some papers suggest a clinically positive relation between the number of MUSA features and the severity of symptoms of adenomyosis.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^117XTnxV]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis is a benign gynecological disease affecting approximately 20 percent of women of reproductive age, with a key characteristic of ectopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium. This disease is frequently called "enigmatic" as the pathophysiology remains unknown, and several theories have been suggested. Among these theories, 1 revolves around an invagination of the endometrial basalis layer via a tissue injury and repair ("TIAR") process, while the other depicts a process of metaplasia of displaced embryonic pluripotent cells or differentiation of adult stem cells.

Adenomyosis is characterized by a broad clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic patients diagnosed incidentally to women suffering from severe dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, chronic pelvic pain, fertility issues, and impaired quality of life. Some studies suggest that up to 82% of symptomatic women required hysterectomy and 37% were given chronic pain medications.

While the gold standard for diagnosing adenomyosis is the histological inspection of specimens obtained following hysterectomies,2D transvaginal ultrasonography is widely accepted as the first‐line diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of superficial, deep and ovarian endometriosis holding an overall sensitivity of 65–81% and an overall specificity of 65–100%.,

In 2015, the MUSA (Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment) statement was published, encompassing the terms, definitions, and measurements for describing myometrial features and lesions with transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). This statement mentions the following features as typical for adenomyosis: asymmetrical myometrial wall thickening, myometrial cysts, myometrial hyperechoic islands, fan‐shaped shadowing, echogenic sub‐endometrial lines and buds, translesional vascularity within the myometrium, irregular junctional zone, and interrupted junctional zone.

### Adenomyosis: single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals a paracrine mesenchymal-epithelial interaction involving the WNT / SFRP pathway [^114Vui4n]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

In its advanced stages, the disease imitates malignancy, not in terms of histology but by its clinical course. The unclear etiology and lack of effective medical therapy make adenomyosis a challenging clinical disorder. It is clear, however, that estrogen is essential for the growth of ectopic endometrium outside the uterus. Therefore, medical strategies blocking ovarian steroidogenesis and local estrogen synthesis by the aromatase enzyme represent an indispensable option for treatment. However, the majority of patients require hysterectomy, which is a radical treatment but not an appropriate option for women who desire pregnancy.

Adenomyosis once was seen as a disease of parous women that could be diagnosed only by surgical resection and pathological examination. However, advancements in high-resolution imaging now allow for noninvasive diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging or transvaginal ultrasound. Ultrasound features of the adenomyotic uterus include an enlarged uterus, asymmetry of the myometrial thickness, a poorly defined endomyometrial junction, and heterogeneously hypoechoic myometrium. Development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques also revealed a higher prevalence of adenomyosis in infertile women; suggested mechanisms underlying uterine factor infertility include abnormal decidualization resulting in impaired endometrial receptivity, altered peristalsis of the uterus, and disruption of the endomyometrial junction. Alterations in the immune system linked to sex steroid hormone changes and epithelial mesenchymal transition in women with adenomyosis may promote inflammation and impair fertility. Some studies have shown that adenomyosis is associated not only with infertility but also increased risk of miscarriage.

Recent research has led to new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of adenomyosis. Evidence from next-generation screening-based studies identified KRAS mutations in endometrial epithelial cell clones and adjacent adenomyotic tissue. These activating KRAS mutations, which also have been found in endometriosis, are one of the most frequent driver mutations in malignancies, such as lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers. KRAS mutations in adenomyosis and endometriosis are confined to endometrial epithelial cells and associated with specific pathways that increase cell survival and proliferation. These mutations also have been associated with progesterone resistance in adenomyosis. The findings of next-generation screening-based studies favor mechanisms involving invagination of mutated cells rather than metaplasia or differentiation of progenitor cells; however, more work is needed to understand gene expression in the extremely heterogeneous adenomyotic cell populations and cross talk with surrounding tissues.

### Adenomyosis: a sonographic diagnosis [^117NbGeZ]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is a common benign uterine condition and a frequent cause of pelvic pain in premenopausal women. Transvaginal US is now considered the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of adenomyosis, and thus radiologists should be familiar with its sonographic appearance. US findings can be divided into three categories, which parallel the histology of adenomyosis: (a) ectopic endometrial glands and stroma, (b) muscular hyperplasia/hypertrophy, and (c) increased vascularity. Ectopic endometrial glands manifest as echogenic nodules and striations, radiating from the endometrium into the myometrium. When the glands contain fluid, myometrial cysts and fluid-filled striations may be visible at US. Muscular hyperplasia and hypertrophy cause focal or diffuse myometrial thickening and globular uterine enlargement, often with thin "venetian blind" shadows. The combination of these findings results in a heterogeneous myometrium, with blurring of the endometrial border. Adenomyosis increases uterine vascularity, depicted as a pattern of penetrating vessels at color Doppler US. Other US techniques that are helpful in the diagnosis of adenomyosis include obtaining cine clips and coronal reformatted images, both of which can survey the entire endometrial-myometrial border, and performing saline-infusion sonohysterography, during which ectopic glands frequently fill with either air or fluid. While most cases of adenomyosis develop spontaneously, there are specific inciting causes that include tamoxifen use, postendometrial ablation syndrome, and deep-infiltrating endometriosis. Mimics of adenomyosis include leiomyomas, uterine contractions, neoplasms, and vascular malformations. This article reviews the pathophysiology of adenomyosis and correlates it with the US findings, highlights specific causes of adenomyosis, and describes how to distinguish this common diagnosis from a variety of mimics. Online supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2018.

### Adenomyosis: what the patient needs [^113iPxrE]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

A panel of experts in the field of endometriosis expressed their opinions on management options in a 28-year-old patient, attempting pregnancy for 1 year, with severe cyclic pelvic pain and with clinical examination and imaging techniques suggestive of adenomyosis. Many questions this paradigmatic patient may pose to the clinician are addressed, and all clinical scenarios are discussed. A decision algorithm derived from this discussion is also proposed.

Role of ultrasound and MRI in diagnosis

With the introduction and advancement of ultrasound and MR techniques, various criteria have been utilized in the noninvasive narrowing of the clinical differential, determining the depth of myometrial invasion and monitoring treatment response.

Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) represents a cost-effective initial screening modality for adenomyosis. Ultrasound features of adenomyosis can be divided into direct or indirect features (Fig. 1). Direct features are due to the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium, and indirect features are due to a hypertrophied myometrium as described by Atri et al. Table 1 describes ultrasound features of adenomyosis as described in previous literature. To report the diagnostic accuracy of TVS in adenomyosis, several meta-analyses have been published. Estimated pooled sensitivities of 72 to 82%, pooled specificities of 81 to 85%, and pooled positive likelihood ratios 3.7 to 4.67 have been reported; however, one meta-analysis suggested that variability between studies does not allow for accurate statistical pooling. With the introduction of color and power Doppler ultrasound, three-dimensional TVS and elastography techniques to the work-up of adenomyosis, there is promise for further improvement in diagnostic accuracy.

Direct and indirect imaging features of adenomyosis

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents a second line, detailed imaging modality for the detection of adenomyosis (Fig. 2). Similar to ultrasound, various direct and indirect features can be used to describe adenomyosis, but need more knowledge of uterine anatomy and its cyclic variations. Table 1 describes MRI features of adenomyosis as described in previous literature. Few prospective studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in the diagnosis of adenomyosis. These studies have reported sensitivity between 70 and 93% and specificities between 86 and 93%. Despite being less operator dependent, MRI needs more reader experience and optimization of imaging technique to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^111erLhF]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective cohort study utilized collected data from a tertiary referral center between 2010 and 2022. The study included non‐pregnant women who underwent targeted pelvic ultrasound scans due to symptoms potentially indicative of adenomyosis, such as menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility.

Several accredited gynecologists with expertise in gynecological imaging performed the pelvic targeted scans. For this study, all examinations were reviewed by an independent reviewer according to established diagnostic criteria for adenomyosis. The reviewer was blinded to the demographic and clinical data. This methodological approach aimed to minimize bias and increase the reliability of the imaging assessments.

The ultrasound scans were performed using commercial Voluson 730, E6/E8/E10 (GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) ultrasound machines equipped with high‐resolution transvaginal probes. Women diagnosed with adenomyosis based on the revised MUSA criteria were included in the study.

To ensure thorough visualization and accurate diagnoses, a systematic approach was employed using high‐resolution TVS. The probe was moved systematically through the uterus and adnexa in sagittal and transverse planes. Uterine morphology was assessed for features such as an enlarged or globular shape and asymmetry in myometrial wall thickness. Myometrial changes, including a heterogeneous echotexture, myometrial cysts, and hyperechoic striations, were identified and correlated with the revised MUSA criteria. Junctional zone abnormalities, including thickening and ill‐defined borders, were also evaluated. Doppler imaging was used to identify vascular patterns within the myometrium, particularly in areas suspected of adenomyosis. For concurrent endometriosis, ovarian evaluations focused on detecting endometriomas characterized by their ground‐glass echogenicity, thick walls, and absent internal vascularity. Additionally, hypoechoic nodules and thickened uterosacral ligaments suggestive of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) were examined in the pouch of Douglas and surrounding pelvic structures.

Cervicitis and endometritis

Both represent early manifestations of PID. In cervicitis, the cervix may be enlarged and hyperaemic on US, with an enhancing endocervical canal and parametrial fat stranding and free fluid on CT/MRI. Endometritis can occur in PID, during the peripartum period, and after gynaecological procedures. Findings of a thickened heterogenous endometrium on US, abnormal endometrial enhancement relative to the inner myometrium on CT/MR, and fluid within the cavity suggest endometritis. The uterine border may be indistinct from parametrial tissue. Uterine empyema (pyometra) is characterised by complex fluid in the uterine cavity containing gas or air-fluid levels.

Salpingitis, tubal empyema (pyosalpinx)

In salpingitis, the fallopian tube is swollen (> 5 mm diameter) and thickened. In pyosalpinx, pus distends the lumen (echogenic on US) and the mural thickening is hyperaemic on Doppler US, enhancing on CT (Fig. 1). CT may show surrounding pelvic inflammation, including uterosacral ligament thickening and para-aortic lymphadenopathy. CT-multiplanar reconstruction helps identify the tubular contour, while MRI additionally differentiates pyosalpinx from haematosalpinx by the presence of intratubal blood products. In pyosalpinx, there is tubal wall thickening, enhancement and inflammation. On DWI, restricted diffusion suggests pyosalpinx, while unrestricted diffusion suggests hydrosalpinx.

### Diagnosis and initial management of dysmenorrhea [^117AjUrE]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain. It negatively affects patients' quality of life and sometimes results in activity restriction. A history and physical examination, including a pelvic examination in patients who have had vaginal intercourse, may reveal the cause. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain in the absence of pelvic pathology. Abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, noncyclic pain, changes in intensity and duration of pain, and abnormal pelvic examination findings suggest underlying pathology (secondary dysmenorrhea) and require further investigation. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed if secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea. Symptoms and signs of adenomyosis include dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and a uniformly enlarged uterus. Management options for primary dysmenorrhea include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis. Topical heat, exercise, and nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in patients who have dysmenorrhea; however, there is not enough evidence to support the use of yoga, acupuncture, or massage.

Classification of adenomyosis

The use of complex imaging techniques has revealed various subtypes of adenomyosis, often associated with histopathologic variation in glandular and muscular components. Furthermore, initial studies have linked various imaging criteria to symptoms of adenomyosis. Therefore, the need for a more holistic approach to identify various disease characteristics incorporating symptomatology, morphology, and pathologic features is rising in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy and adequately guide treatment decisions. Important factors to be included in classification systems would be the site and location of pathology, configuration, and size/volume relative to the total myometrial thickness. Most recent ultrasound and MR classification and reporting systems have been developed by Van den Bosch et al. and Bazot respectively, but the clinical relevance remains to be tested.

Treatment

As with many aspects of adenomyosis, treatment remains controversial. Important factors to be considered and discussed with patients are age, symptom severity, desire for future conception, and associated comorbidities. Recent studies estimate a prevalence of adenomyosis among females younger than 40 years to be about 20–30%, while in the rest of the patients, diagnosis is usually established in the fourth or fifth decade. Furthermore, diffuse adenomyosis, depth of invasion, and coexisting fibroids and/or endometriosis are associated with increased frequency/severity of symptoms and reproductive complications. Currently, treatment is on a case by case basis, and hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment in patients who are willing and do not wish for future fertility. With the introduction of assisted reproductive techniques, delayed age of conception, and availability of minimally invasive treatment options, the shift from hysterectomy as the "go to" option seems inevitable.

### Symptoms and classification of uterine adenomyosis, including the place of hysteroscopy in diagnosis [^116MYkMm]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Where histology used the presence of glands and/or stroma in the myometrium as pathognomonic for adenomyosis, imaging uses the appearance of the myometrium, the presence of striations, related to the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium, the presence of intramyometrial cystic structures and the size and asymmetry of the uterus to identify adenomyosis. Preliminary reports show a good correlation between the features detected by imaging and the histological findings. Symptoms associated with adenomyosis are abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain (dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia), and impaired reproduction. However a high incidence of existing comorbidity like fibroids and endometriosis makes it difficult to attribute a specific pathognomonic symptom to adenomyosis. Heterogeneity in the reported pregnancy rates after assisted reproduction is due to the use of different ovarian stimulation protocols and absence of a correct description of the adenomyotic pathology. Current efforts to classify the disease contributed a lot in elucidated the potential characteristics that a classification system should be relied on. The need for a comprehensive, user friendly, and clear categorization of adenomyosis including the pattern, location, histological variants, and the myometrial zone seems to be an urgent need. With the uterus as a possible unifying link between adenomyosis and endometriosis, exploration of the uterus should not only be restricted to the hysteroscopic exploration of the uterine cavity but in a fusion with ultrasound.

### Diffusely enlarged uterus: evaluation with MR imaging [^111hKNat]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Diffuse uterine enlargement is a common clinical finding. Because this abnormality can represent a physiologic manifestation, benign tumor, or malignancy, the diagnostic dilemma of a diffusely enlarged uterus can be challenging. Clinical findings can provide valuable information in regard to physiologic effects, pregnancy-related changes, and hormonal causes. Cytologic examination is essential for identification of cervical and endometrial malignancies. However, since preoperative histologic examination of myometrial lesions is not possible, preoperative distinction between benign and malignant conditions is frequently difficult. Imaging thus plays an important role in evaluation of myometrial lesions. In particular, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows specific diagnosis of several different lesions. Signal voids and prominent vessels at MR imaging are characteristic of vascular lesions. Adenomyosis and leiomyomas can be distinguished from other lesions with MR imaging, although a variety of unusual manifestations can be seen. MR imaging findings that allow distinction between leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma have yet to be clearly established; however, invasion, hemorrhagic necrosis, or rapid growth is suggestive of malignancy. Endometrial stromal sarcoma tends to have distinct MR imaging features that allow differentiation from benign lesions.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^113GDd2v]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine whether the co‐occurrence of endometriosis affects the sonographic features of adenomyosis based on the revised Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA) criteria.

Methods

This prospective cohort study utilized data from a tertiary referral center collected between 2010 and 2022. Non‐pregnant women aged 20–53 years who presented with symptoms potentially related to adenomyosis and underwent pelvic ultrasound scans were included. Diagnoses were based on the revised MUSA criteria, which distinguish between direct features (endometrial cysts, hyperechogenic islands, echogenic sub‐endometrial lines, and buds) and indirect features (globular shape of the uterus, asymmetrical uterine wall thickening, irregular junctional zone, fan‐shaped shadowing, translesional vascularity, and interrupted junctional zone). Patients were categorized into 2 groups: 1) concurrent adenomyosis and endometriosis and 2) isolated adenomyosis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrospectively collected.

Results

Ninety‐four patients were diagnosed with adenomyosis. Of these, 24 (27%) had concurrent endometriosis, while 70 had isolated adenomyosis. The most frequent sonographic features were globular uterine configuration (52%), myometrial cysts (44%), and asymmetrical myometrial thickening (33%). The isolated adenomyosis group had a higher proportion of direct features (29%) and both direct and indirect features (33%) compared to the concurrent group, which predominantly exhibited indirect features (71%) (P < .05). Direct features of myometrial cysts were significantly more frequent in the isolated adenomyosis group (51%) compared to the concurrent group (21%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Utilizing the revised MUSA criteria revealed significant differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis in symptomatic patients with concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis. This highlights the necessity for standardized diagnostic methods and enhances understanding of the complex relationship between adenomyosis and endometriosis, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis in clinical practice.

### A systematic review of adenomyosis: It is time to reassess what we thought we knew about the disease [^114NUGfn]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To summarize and update our current knowledge regarding adenomyosis diagnosis, prevalence, and symptoms.

Data Sources

Systematic review of PubMed between January 1972 and April 2020. Search strategy included: "adenomyosis [MeSH Terms] AND (endometriosis[MeSH Term OR prevalence study [MeSH Terms] OR dysmenorrhea[text word] OR prevalence[Text Word] OR young adults [Text Word] OR adolesce* [Text Word] OR symptoms[Text Word] OR imaging diagnosis [Text Word] OR pathology[Text Word].

Methods Of Study Selection

Articles published in English that addressed adenomyosis and discussed prevalence, diagnosis, and symptoms were included. The included articles described pathology diagnosis, imaging, biopsy diagnosis, prevalence and age of onset, symptoms, and concomitant endometriosis.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Sixteen articles were included in the qualitative analysis. The studies are heterogeneous when diagnosing adenomyosis with differing criteria, protocols, and patient populations. The prevalence estimates range from 20% to 88.8% in women who are symptomatic (average 30%-35%), with most diagnosed between the ages of 32 years and 38 years. The correlation between imaging and pathology continues to evolve. As imaging advances, newer studies report that younger women who are symptomatic are being diagnosed with adenomyosis on the basis of both magnetic resonance imaging and/or transvaginal ultrasound. High rates of concomitant endometriosis create challenges when discerning the etiology of pelvic pain. Symptoms that are historically attributed to endometriosis may actually be caused by adenomyosis.

Conclusion

Adenomyosis remains a challenge to identify, assess, and research because of the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, especially in women who wish to retain their uterus. As noninvasive diagnostics such as imaging and myometrial biopsies continue to improve, younger women with variable symptoms will likely create criteria for diagnosis with adenomyosis. The priority should be to create standardized histopathologic and imaging diagnoses to gain a deeper understanding of adenomyosis.

### Endometriosis and infertility: a committee opinion [^116SJhqY]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis — diagnosis and staging emphasize that laparoscopy is required for a definitive diagnosis and histologic evaluation is warranted when visual inspection is inconclusive; history and physical findings suggestive of endometriosis include cyclic or chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a fixed retroverted uterus, an adnexal mass, and uterosacral ligament nodularity, thickening, or tenderness; ultrasound can help establish a presumptive diagnosis of an ovarian endometrioma but cannot reliably image peritoneal implants; the therapeutic benefit of laparoscopy to increase fecundity in mild disease is minimal and, accordingly, laparoscopy of asymptomatic women with infertility simply to rule out or confirm disease is unwarranted; disease heterogeneity ranges from a single 1 mm peritoneal implant to ≥ 10 cm endometriomas.

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^114rDDg8]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

While histopathologic analysis of the myometrium has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of adenomyosis, usually following hysterectomy, such an approach is not applicable to women wishing to preserve their uterus. In the past 20 years, noninvasive methods have been shown to be relatively sensitive and specific for the diagnosis.

Two‐dimensional, 3D, and color Doppler TVUS can be used to detect adenomyosis with a sensitivity of approximately 84%, 85%, and 94%, respectively. There are several features suggestive of adenomyosis that may be detected on ultrasound that can be categorized as direct or indirect as per the revised definitions of the Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA). Direct features indicate the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue in the myometrium, including myometrial cysts, hypoechogenic islands, and echogenic subendometrial lines and buds. In contrast, indirect features are secondary to the ectopic endometrial tissue, in many cases reflecting the muscular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and comprise a globular shape of the corpus, asymmetrical myometrial thickening, fan‐shaped shadowing, translesional vascularity, and an irregular or interrupted junctional zone.

It is important to view adenomyosis on a spectrum, defined by the number and type of features, and not as a binary (present or absent) diagnosis. Different individuals may have different numbers and combinations of features. Still, differences in genetics, epigenetics, and molecular expressions within the ectopic endometrial tissue may contribute to the clinical picture seen in a given patient. For example, in work performed in the UK, a single feature of adenomyosis as determined by 2D TVUS was not associated with quantified HMB, but bleeding volume increased proportionally to the total number of features detected.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a more expensive technique to diagnose adenomyosis accurately and, in most instances, is used as a second‐line investigation with a sensitivity of 88%–93%. Whereas most MRI features of adenomyosis overlap those seen on TVUS, focusing on the junctional zone and irregularities within provides greater diagnostic potential for MRI.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^113ByjDw]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine whether the co-occurrence of endometriosis affects the sonographic features of adenomyosis based on the revised Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA) criteria.

Methods

This prospective cohort study utilized data from a tertiary referral center collected between 2010 and 2022. Non-pregnant women aged 20–53years who presented with symptoms potentially related to adenomyosis and underwent pelvic ultrasound scans were included. Diagnoses were based on the revised MUSA criteria, which distinguish between direct features (endometrial cysts, hyperechogenic islands, echogenic sub-endometrial lines, and buds) and indirect features (globular shape of the uterus, asymmetrical uterine wall thickening, irregular junctional zone, fan-shaped shadowing, translesional vascularity, and interrupted junctional zone). Patients were categorized into 2 groups: 1) concurrent adenomyosis and endometriosis and 2) isolated adenomyosis. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrospectively collected.

Results

Ninety-four patients were diagnosed with adenomyosis. Of these, 24 (27%) had concurrent endometriosis, while 70 had isolated adenomyosis. The most frequent sonographic features were globular uterine configuration (52%), myometrial cysts (44%), and asymmetrical myometrial thickening (33%). The isolated adenomyosis group had a higher proportion of direct features (29%) and both direct and indirect features (33%) compared to the concurrent group, which predominantly exhibited indirect features (71%) (P < .05). Direct features of myometrial cysts were significantly more frequent in the isolated adenomyosis group (51%) compared to the concurrent group (21%, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Utilizing the revised MUSA criteria revealed significant differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis in symptomatic patients with concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis. This highlights the necessity for standardized diagnostic methods and enhances understanding of the complex relationship between adenomyosis and endometriosis, underscoring the importance of accurate diagnosis in clinical practice.

### Clinical manifestations of adenomyosis patients with or without pain symptoms [^111tDTMQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We summarized some characteristics related to pain manifestation and, more specifically, dysmenorrhea in patients with adenomyosis. The symptoms of pain together with obvious elevation of CA125 and rectal irritation as well as thicken myometrial layer under the TVUS may be regarded as clues for clinicians when dealing with adenomyosis. A clinical model constituted by these characters may improve the preoperative diagnosis rate of adenomyosis, thus providing timely and effective treatment for the patients. Further investigations are required for better pain management in clinical work.

### Diagnosis and classification of uterine fibroids [^116mbmTn]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Uterine fibroids, or leiomyomas, are benign uterine tumors with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 75%. While only a minority become symptomatic, their impact on quality of life remains profound owing to heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms, and reproductive dysfunction. Interestingly, fibroids are not reliably diagnosed on physical examination, nor can their impact be predicted through palpation. Consequently, the diagnosis and phenotypic categorization of uterine fibroids relies primarily on imaging to guide subsequent clinical management. Ultrasound should be the first-line diagnostic modality, and magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for complex cases and/or surgical planning. Adherence to standardized structured reporting across imaging modalities is critical to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiate fibroids from conditions such as adenomyosis or malignancies, predict therapeutic responses, and plan surgical interventions. Imaging reports should follow the FIGO classification system for uterine fibroids, to enable a standardized description of their relationship to the endometrium, myometrium, and uterine serosa.

### Adenomyosis: diagnosis and management [^116iQYWs]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis is a clinical condition where endometrial glands are found in the myometrium of the uterus. One in three patients with adenomyosis is asymptomatic, but the rest may present with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, or infertility. Heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common symptom. Adenomyosis is distinct from endometriosis (the presence of endometrial glands outside of the uterus), but the two conditions often occur simultaneously. Risk factors for developing adenomyosis include increasing age, parity, and history of uterine procedures. Most patients are diagnosed from 40 to 50 years of age, but younger patients with infertility are increasingly being diagnosed with adenomyosis as imaging modalities improve. Diagnosis of adenomyosis begins with clinical suspicion and is confirmed with transvaginal ultrasonography and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment of adenomyosis typically starts with hormonal menstrual suppression. Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems have shown some effectiveness. Patients with adenomyosis may ultimately have a hysterectomy if symptoms are not controlled with medical therapy.

### Adenomyosis at a glance: an integrated review of transvaginal ultrasound and MR imaging findings [^112Mediw]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis is a benign uterine disorder increasingly recognized in premenopausal women. Given its significant clinical burden, an accurate noninvasive diagnosis is paramount. Both transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance (MR) provide an adequate assessment of adenomyosis, the former being recommended for first-line imaging evaluation and the latter being mainly used as a problem-solving technique. In this article, the authors review the TVUS and MR imaging findings of adenomyosis while referring to their histopathological background. Whereas direct signs correlate directly to ectopic endometrial tissue and are highly specific to adenomyosis, indirect signs result from myometrial hypertrophy and increase diagnostic sensitivity. Potential pitfalls, differential diagnoses, and frequently associated estrogen-dependent conditions are also discussed.

### Guideline no. 437: diagnosis and management of adenomyosis [^115anqpM]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on adenomyosis:

- **Definition**: Adenomyosis is a condition characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue within the myometrium.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of adenomyosis involves the disruption of the endometrial-myometrial boundary, leading to the formation of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma in the myometrium.
- **Epidemiology**: Adenomyosis is a common condition, with prevalence estimated at 21.8% in patients undergoing surgery for endometriosis.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, adenomyosis is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, infertility, miscarriage, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. These symptoms can significantly impact a woman's QoL. Adenomyosis often coexists with other gynecological conditions, such as endometriosis or fibroids, which can complicate the clinical presentation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of adenomyosis is generally benign, as it is not a malignant condition. However, it can significantly impact the QoL due to the associated symptoms.

### Imaging for uterine myomas and adenomyosis [^115MS2PJ]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Uterine myomas and adenomyosis are common findings, in particular in patients with symptoms of abdominal enlargement, pelvic pressure, abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia. Diagnosis and differentiation between the 2 entities are critical in establishing treatment options and the operative approach for surgical management. Herein are reviewed diagnostic options, their relative accuracy, and the effect of accurate diagnosis on treatment. A review was performed using PubMed, MdConsult, OVID, and reviews including cross-referenced articles and prospective and retrospective studies published from 1980 to 2013. Also reviewed are use of ultrasound with its various methods, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography in the diagnosis, pretreatment evaluation, and differentiation of myomas and adenomyosis.

### Quality improvement guidelines for uterine artery embolization for symptomatic leiomyomata [^116qUK4G]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Definitions — symptoms and clinical outcome metrics — are specified as follows. Adenomyosis is defined as implants of endometrial tissue within the uterine wall that may cause progressive dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and it is best distinguished from leiomyomata with magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical success is defined as significant improvement or resolution of presenting symptoms without additional therapy. Dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menstruation. Menorrhagia is defined as heavy, prolonged menstrual flow that may result in chronic blood-loss anemia, most commonly caused by submucosal leiomyomas, but also by intramural leiomyomas that distort the endometrial cavity.

### MRI for adenomyosis: a pictorial review [^1158wWw1]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is asymptomatic in one third of cases, in the remaining being a cause of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain and uterine enlargement. Its role in infertility is still debated, with a reported frequency of association of 1–14%. There are, however, no large studies on this topic.

Clinical diagnosis of adenomyosis is usually difficult due to the nonspecific nature of symptoms and the confounding factor of coexistent pelvic diseases.

Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the main radiologic tools for the diagnosis of adenomyosis. MRI has a diagnostic accuracy of 85%, with added value in confirming the diagnosis and determining disease characteristics and extent and additional uterine lesions.

### MRI for adenomyosis: a pictorial review [^117LUdn5]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is defined as the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium. It is a disease of the inner myometrium and results from infiltration of the basal endometrium into the underlying myometrium. Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the main radiologic tools for this condition. A thickness of the junctional zone of at least 12 mm is the most frequent MRI criterion in establishing the presence of adenomyosis. Adenomyosis can appear as a diffuse or focal form. Adenomyosis is often associated with hormone-dependent lesions such as leiomyoma, deep pelvic endometriosis and endometrial hyperplasia/polyps. Herein, we illustrate the MRI findings of adenomyosis and associated conditions, focusing on their imaging pitfalls.

Teaching Points

- Adenomyosis is defined as the presence of ectopic endometrium within the myometrium.
- MRI is an accurate tool for the diagnosis of adenomyosis and associated conditions.
- Adenomyosis can be diffuse or focal.
- The most established MRI finding is thickening of junctional zone exceeding 12 mm.
- High-signal intensity myometrial foci on T2- or T1-weighted images are also characteristic.

### Imaging for adenomyosis: making the diagnosis by sonography [^112UKybt]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate a systematic approach for ultrasound diagnosis of adenomyosis.

Design

Stepwise demonstration of the ultrasound features of adenomyosis with narrated video footage.

Setting

In 2015, the International Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment group published a consensus on which terminology to use when describing myometrial lesions seen on ultrasonography [12]. However, 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasound features of adenomyosis are demonstrated most optimally using video clips.

Interventions

A systematic description, including pictograms of individual features of adenomyosis, is correlated to the typical findings of adenomyosis in 2D and 3D ultrasound images and video clips.

Conclusion

A structured, systematic description of individual 2D and 3D ultrasound features is important for a correct diagnosis of adenomyosis [3–5].

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^113jHxpJ]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

During the study period, 710 patients underwent targeted sonographic examination for symptoms suggestive of adenomyosis. Ninety‐four women were diagnosed with adenomyosis based on the MUSA criteria. Of these, 24 women (26%) had concurrent adenomyosis and endometriosis (of whom 9 were diagnosed with DIE), and 70 had isolated adenomyosis.

Table 1 displays the demographic data of the study population. There were no statistically significant differences regarding maternal age, weight, smoking status, parity, and uterine surgical interventions, including past cesarean sections or curettage. Figure 1 presents the sonographic features of the control and study groups based on the MUSA criteria.

Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Study Cohort

Figure 1
Distribution of sonographic features of adenomyosis in the study cohort based on the MUSA criteria.

The most frequent sonographic features for diagnosing adenomyosis were indirect signs such as globular uterine configuration (52%) and asymmetrical myometrial thickening (33%), along with the direct feature of myometrial cysts (44%). For the whole cohort, 55% of patients exhibited 1 diagnostic feature, 34% exhibited 2, and 11% exhibited 3 sonographic diagnostic features, as outlined in Table 2. No significant differences regarding the number of diagnostic features based on the MUSA criteria were demonstrated between the groups (P = 0.2).

Table 2
Number of Sonographic Features of Adenomyosis Per Patient Based on the Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA) Criteria

Within the study group of concurrent adenomyosis and endometriosis, the most common features were the indirect signs of globular uterine configuration (58%) and asymmetrical thickening (33%). In contrast, within the control group of isolated adenomyosis, the most common feature was the direct sign of myometrial cysts (51%), followed closely by the indirect feature of globular uterine configuration (50%). Figures 2 and 3 provide visual examples of direct and indirect features illustrating the differences in sonographic presentations.

### Clinical manifestations of adenomyosis patients with or without pain symptoms [^115PuGSB]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients in pain group were at younger ages when diagnosed and suffered the onset of disease. Curiously, the median intervals between onset and diagnosis of the pain and painless group were the same, both 4 days. Maybe other symptoms such as AUB or subfertility were the driven factors for patients in painless group to obtain the diagnosis.

TVUS, either 2D or 3D, was widely used to make a diagnosis of adenomyosis with a group of studies carried out to evaluate its accuracy. It played important roles in evaluating the severity of adenomyosis and providing a reference for the treatment. J. Naftalin et al suggested a statistically significant association between the ultrasound features of adenomyosis and the severity of menstrual pain, in detail, the irregular endometrial–myometrial junction and asymmetrical myometrial thickening. A higher possibility of posterior thicken myometrial layer was also seen in pain group, with no significant differences between pain and painless group in concurrent uterine fibroids (P = 0.092) or benign endometrial diseases (P = 0.940).

The elevation of CA125 was quite common in adenomyosis, but it was far from satisfied to be a predictive marker because of the limited specificity. Actually, there are no biomarkers in use with certain values in differentiating adenomyosis from other gynecological disease, and more investigations are needed to bring through the standstill.

Substantial similarities can be found between adenomyosis and endometriosis in terms of clinical features and pathogenetic pathways.38.8% of the 291 adenomyosis patients were identified with concurrent endometriosis, as previously reported in our group. We also noticed a significant difference between pain and painless group on rectal irritation. The theory that rectal irritation and EM are related with pain symptoms is mostly empirical, lacking of clinical research data to support. More patients were found with coexisting endometriosis in the pain group in this study, which made sense as dysmenorrhea was quite common among endometriosis patients. Our results were evidenced by real-world data, suggesting that we should pay attention to the presence of EM in patients with adenomyosis-related pain in clinical work.

Uterus and adnexa — evaluation and reporting: The uterus should be evaluated for fibroids, focal myometrial thickening, congenital anomalies, and number of cesarean scars, and the adnexa and cul-de-sac should be evaluated; abnormalities should be imaged and documented. The presence and number of leiomyomata should be documented, with measurements and the location of the largest and any potentially clinically significant leiomyomata reported, and linear echogenic structures (synechiae) within the uterine space should be noted. If a Müllerian duct anomaly is identified or suspected, it should be reported, recognizing that accurate characterization is optimally performed in the nongravid state. The ovaries and adnexa should be evaluated, any masses should be measured and characterized, and the cul-de-sac should be evaluated for the presence or absence of free fluid.

### Imaging spectrum of typical and atypical adenomyosis [^116aQUVw]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Adenomyosis, characterized by heterotopic endometrial tissue within the myometrium, is a common yet poorly understood condition affecting patients of childbearing age. Although typical features of adenomyosis are extensively discussed in the literature, there is no consensus on its imaging classification. The Morphological Uterus Sonographic Assessment (MUSA) consensus statement is a valuable tool for identifying and describing typical adenomyosis imaging features at US. However, for MRI, there is still no standardized consensus for descriptors and subtypes. The diverse atypical manifestations of adenomyosis are a diagnostic challenge. Familiarity with these manifestations is essential for accurate diagnosis, avoiding misdiagnosis, and ensuring optimal clinical management. The authors examine the imaging appearances of typical and atypical adenomyosis at US and MRI, encompassing focal adenomyosis, diffuse adenomyosis, adenomyomas (solid and cystic types), polypoid adenomyomas, adenomyosis during pregnancy, and malignant transformation. The discussion includes clinical, surgical, and pathologic aspects in the differential diagnosis, with consideration of uterine contractions, deep endometriosis with myometrial infiltration, leiomyomas, and accessory cavitated uterine masses. Practical tips are provided to assist radiologists in distinguishing adenomyosis from other conditions. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Subinvolution of the placental site as the cause of hysterectomy in young woman [^1163bTiM]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient was given four units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma, however abdominal US re-examination revealed an enlarged uterus with the accumulation of blood around the intrauterine tampon. Pelvic CT and MRI imaging with contrast did not reveal a pathological cause of bleeding. Given that the patient was deemed clinically unstable, an emergency total abdominal hysterectomy was performed without further imaging such as angiography. Histopathological examination of uterus identified large thrombus in the endometrial cavity and the typical findings of subinvoluted placental bed vessels. Microscopic sections of myometrium revealed large, dilated superficial myometrial blood vessels with thickened walls at the placental implantation site indicative of SPS (figure 1). There was no evidence of retained products of conception or inflammation of the decidua neither in the curettage material nor in the removed uterus. The diagnosis of SPS was made.

### CT features of adenomyosis [^113knocr]. European Journal of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the computed tomography (CT) features of adenomyosis in patients with known adenomyosis as established with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

Methods

A computerized search identified 16 women with pelvic MR diagnosis of adenomyosis who also had enhanced pelvic CT. Original CT reports were reviewed for potential prospective diagnosis of adenomyosis. CT images were reviewed for enhancement phase, inner and outer myometrium attenuation, uterine enlargement (width > 6 cm), inner myometrial thickening (≥ 12 mm), and myometrial cysts.

Results

Adenomyosis was detectable on CT in 8 of 16 patients. For these 8 patients, inner and outer myometrium distinction was excellent in 7 (88%) and limited in 1 (12%), and mean inner myometrial thickness was 25 mm (range 14–47 mm). CT enhancement phase was parenchymal in 7 (88%), uterus was enlarged in 8 (100%), and 7 (88%) had myometrial cysts. Adenomyosis was focal in 5 (63%), diffuse in 2 (25%), and both in 1 (12%). None of the original CT reports included adenomyosis as a diagnosis.

Conclusions

CT can suggest a diagnosis of adenomyosis based on uterine enlargement, thickened inner myometrium, and/or myometrial cysts.

### Diffuse myometrium thinning and placenta accreta spectrum in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): a case report and review of the literature [^117VUoKF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs of uterine atony and ultrasonographic features in this case report are essential from a clinical perspective. The clinical signs of uterine atony during induction labor with oxytocin injection can lead to suspicion of abnormal uterus wall structure in SLE patients. In the case series, three patients had oxytocin administration during induced labor. These cases experienced continuous uterine atony after the baby's birth, even though intramuscular injection of the uterotonic agent. Tomimatsu et al. expressed the atonic situation as a collapsed uterus. Uterine atony and PAS can result in massive postpartum bleeding (mean amount of 4800 ml), which was the reason to perform hysterectomies in most cases. In our case, there were clinical signs that indicated abnormalities in the contractive function of the uterine muscle from the second trimester. First, the patient had cervical length shortening without uterine contraction in her second trimester. Second, the uterine fundus was softened like a marshmallow when midwives examined the induction of labor. Uterine atony might be a pivotal notification to lead further investigation and prepare for organizing a multidisciplinary team before delivery.

To diagnose the PAS before labor is always challenging in patients with an unscarred uterus. We should note the structural relationship of placental invasion to the uterine wall by ultrasonography in SLE patients from the beginning of pregnancy. Inoue et al. reported placenta thickening and missing decidual blood flow detected by superb microvascular imaging of ultrasonography that led to a diagnosis of PAS before labor. Mittal et al. reported that the loss of myometrial definition in uterine with increased placental lacunae vascularity was the critical finding to suspect PAS. In our patient, there was a thick placenta with an increased size of placental lacunae at first, and then it spread throughout the uterus in the third trimester.

In conclusion, we have presented an unusual complication of SLE that might be related to the unique condition of the estrogen-mediated immune system. Clinicians should always pay attention to the possibility of uterine wall thinning as uterine atony and the structural abnormality between the placenta and uterine wall for SLE patients without any risk.

### Management of uterine adenomyosis: current trends and uterine artery embolization as a potential alternative to hysterectomy [^111qG7s6]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Etiology

The precise etiology and pathophysiology leading to the development of adenomyosis remains undetermined. Several theories have been introduced, including traumatic, immunological, hormonal, metaplastic, and stem cell. Traumatic and immunological theories suggest disruption of endometrial-myometrial interface with invagination of eutopic (normally located) endometrial cells, while hormonal, metaplastic, and stem cell theories rely on the altered behavior of atopic (displaced) cells. These mechanisms, in addition to various risk factors, such as age, parity, previous uterine surgery, smoking, ectopic pregnancy, antidepressant, and tamoxifen therapies, are believed to contribute to the development of adenomyosis. Regardless of etiology, histopathologic features remain the same, and definitive diagnosis is established by the presence of "ectopic, non-neoplastic, endometrial glands and stroma surrounded by hypertrophic and hyperplastic myometrium" on hysterectomy specimens.

Diagnosis

Adenomyosis remains an underdiagnosed condition. This is largely due to lack of pathognomonic symptoms related to this condition. Symptomatic patients varyingly present with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and subfertility, and up to 30% of patients are asymptomatic. Furthermore, confounding coexisting pathologies (usually fibroids and endometriosis) add to the difficulty of diagnosis, as both entities present with similar clinical features.

### Ultrasound findings of adenomyosis in adolescents: type and grade of the disease [^116Ajhbo]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the ultrasound features, types, and degrees of adenomyosis among adolescents and to correlate these findings with clinical symptoms DESIGN: A retrospective observational study.

Setting

Gynecological ultrasound units from January 2014 to June 2020.

Patients

A total of 43 adolescents (aged 12–20 years) who were diagnosed as having adenomyosis at a pelvic ultrasound examination.

Interventions

Ultrasound features and location and type of adenomyosis within the uterus were evaluated on stored 2-dimensional images and videos and 3-dimensional volumes. Adenomyosis was classified as mild, moderate, and severe according to the extension of the disease in the uterus as described in our previous published classification.

Measurements and Main Results

Adenomyotic features recorded among our population were myometrial hyperechoic areas, uterine wall asymmetry, intramyometrial cystic areas, and some types of junctional zone alterations. The posterior uterine wall (58%) and the outer myometrial layer (93%) were mostly affected. In 44% of adolescents (19/43) with adenomyosis, at least 1 location of pelvic endometriosis was documented. Dysmenorrhea was the most commonly reported symptoms (88%), and it was associated with adenomyosis of the outer myometrium, myometrial hyperechoic areas, uterine wall asymmetry, and intramyometrial cystic areas. Adolescents with dyspareunia showed diffuse adenomyosis (9/9 patients) including both the inner and outer myometrium (7/9 patients) and in the posterior wall (7/9 patients). Heavy menstrual bleeding was associated with diffuse adenomyosis (18/23 patients) mostly of the outer myometrium (22/23 patients). Scoring system showed predominantly mild disease and no severe adenomyosis was found. Adolescents with diffuse adenomyosis were significantly older and showed a high percentage of heavy menstrual bleeding compared with those with the focal disease of the inner myometrium.

Conclusion

This study shows that adenomyosis is not only a pathology of adult life, but it involves young patients mostly in a mild-to-moderate form and is associated with typical painful symptoms. In adolescents, the diagnosis of adenomyosis is feasible through a noninvasive way with ultrasound and a proper management can be set.

### MRI for adenomyosis: a pictorial review [^111h4DiL]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adenomyosis is a common benign gynaecological disorder defined as the presence of ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium. It is a disease of the archimetra or inner myometrium and results from infiltration of the basal endometrium into the underlying myometrium, with subsequent hypertrophy and hyperplasia of smooth muscle.

It is difficult to accurately determinate the incidence of adenomyosis since the diagnosis can only be made with certainty by microscopic examination of the uterus. Although generally estimated to affect 20% of women, the incidence was approximately 65% in one study in which meticulous histopathological analysis of multiple myometrial sections was performed.

The mean frequency of adenomyosis at hysterectomy is between 20% and 30%.

The aetiology of adenomyosis is still not fully understood and various theories have been proposed. Exposure to oestrogen, parity, and prior uterine surgery are known risk factors. The most consensual theories propose that adenomyosis results from invagination of the endometrial basalis layer into the myometrium or from embryologically misplaced pluripotent Müllerian remnants.

Histopathological examination allows direct visualisation of endometrial tissue inside the myometrium. Criteria for the histologic diagnosis of adenomyosis include the presence of penetrating glands at least: one low-power field from the endo-myometrial junction, 2.5 mm below the basal layer of endometrium or deeper than 25% of overall myometrial thickness. Areas of myometrial smooth muscle proliferation are present around endometrial islands.

On gross pathology, the uterus is usually firm, enlarged and globular, with hypertrophic myometrial smooth muscle containing ectopic endometrium with dilated glands, cysts and haemorrhage.

So far, no study is available on the natural history of adenomyosis, and information regarding its prevalence and characteristics in adolescent girls and postmenopausal women remains limited. Some studies indicate that the diagnosis of adenomyosis is rare in adolescence and features of classic adenomyosis are not typical, with cystic adenomyosis being almost specific to adolescent and young women. The incidence of adenomyosis in adulthood significantly varies between studies, mainly because of differences in diagnostic criteria. In one study, the incidence varied from 12 to 58% between hospitals and 10–88% between pathologists. In postmenopausal women, evidence points that adenomyosis begins during women's fertile age.

### Sonohysterographic findings of endometrial and subendometrial conditions [^111717Hv]. Radiographics (2002). Low credibility.

Sonohysterography has become the standard test in the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine and postmenopausal bleeding because it allows reliable differentiation between focal and diffuse endometrial and subendometrial lesions, with the most common being polyps and submucosal fibroids. An endometrial polyp usually appears as a well-defined, homogeneous, polypoid lesion that is isoechoic to the endometrium with preservation of the endometrial-myometrial interface. Atypical polyps have cystic components, multiplicity, a broad base, and hypoechogenicity or heterogeneity. Submucosal fibroids are usually broad-based, hypoechoic, well-defined, solid masses with shadowing and an overlying layer of echogenic endometrium that distorts the endometrial-myometrial interface. Atypical fibroids are pedunculated or have a multilobulated surface. The major advantage of sonohysterography is that it can accurately depict the percentage of the fibroid that projects into the endometrial cavity. Endometrial hyperplasia usually appears as diffuse thickening of the echogenic endometrial stripe without focal abnormality, but occasionally focal hyperplasia can be seen. Endometrial cancer is typically a diffuse process, but early cases can appear as a polypoid mass. Adhesions usually appear as mobile, thin, echogenic bands that bridge a normally distensible endometrial cavity, but occasionally thick, broad-based bands or complete obliteration of the endometrial cavity is seen. Although endometrial lesions have characteristic features, a wide range of appearances is possible, with significant overlap between entities. Radiologists should be familiar with the broad spectrum of findings that may be seen at sonohysterography in both benign and malignant processes to raise the appropriate level of concern and to direct the clinician toward the appropriate means of diagnostic biopsy or surgery.

Saline infusion sonohysterography — endometrial measurement and lesion assessment should be performed in the sagittal plane by measuring each endometrial layer separately and adding the results to obtain the endometrium thickness, while documenting whether layers are uniform and symmetric or if asymmetry or irregularities are present. Endometrial polyps and fibroids should be measured in 3 orthogonal planes, and when addressing fibroids, a comment about the subjective depth of projection into the endometrial cavity as a percentage of the overall fibroid size is helpful for determining treatment options.

### Clinical manifestations of adenomyosis patients with or without pain symptoms [^112TzyPC]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uterine adenomyosis is a status of hyperplasia and hypertrophy of uterine myometrium due to the ectopic growth of the endometrial glands and stroma. Though clinically common, it confuses us due to a lack of standard diagnostic criteria. Adenomyosis can be diagnosed by surgical procedure, such as hysterectomy, which gives an access to a full myometrial assessment, or by myometrial biopsies. Two common noninvasive imaging methods, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are widely adopted in clinical work with high accuracy.

Heterogeneous as it is in clinical features, adenomyosis may lead to various performances in different individuals, such as abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), different forms of pain, nausea, difficulties with urination and so on. Among them, AUB and dysmenorrhea are the top two reasons for patients to see a doctor, which may exert burdensome impacts on their daily life. Several published literatures have shed light on the treatment of the pain caused by adenomyosis, especially dysmenorrhea.–Few studies have focused on the factors or clinical behaviors related to pain arising from adenomyosis. Our previous study identified that patients with adenomyosis received less accurate preoperative diagnosis, as the accuracy rate was only 36.4%. Most patients with pain symptoms were not correctly diagnosed before surgery, resulting in inappropriate or inadequate treatment. We carried out this retrospective study with an intention to help understand the clinical features of patients with adenomyosis-related pain and improve the preoperative diagnosis rate of such patients, thus providing timely and effective treatment for them.

### Abdominal ultrasound-guided transvaginal myometrial core needle biopsy for the definitive diagnosis of suspected adenomyosis in 1032 patients: a retrospective study [^116ox3K4]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the results of abdominal ultrasound-guided transvaginal myometrial core needle biopsy (CNB) for the definitive diagnosis of adenomyosis.

Design

Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).

Setting

Private practice.

Patients

A total of 1032 consecutive premenopausal women aged 22 to 53 years who had undergone myometrial CNB and uterine-preserving surgery to treat adenomyosis, which was preliminarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and ultrasonographic findings.

Intervention

Transvaginal myometrial CNB under abdominal ultrasound guidance.

Measurements and Main Results

The mean age of the 1032 patients was 41.4 years (range, 22–53 years); 61% were aged 40 to 49 years, and 33% were aged 30 to 39 years. The mean Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) score was 271.1, and total pain score was 11.79. The mean anterior myometrial thickness was 2.79 cm (range, 0.7–8.7 cm), and the posterior myometrial thickness was 3.72 cm (range, 1.1–9.4 cm). A total of 2596 myometrial tissue cores were obtained from thickened myometrium via abdominal ultrasound-guided transvaginal myometrial CNB. At histopathologic examination the tissue cores demonstrated adenomyosis in 2167, myometrial hypertrophy in 343, and leiomyoma in 86. Patients were classified into a concordant group (adenomyosis only, adenomyosis plus hypertrophy, and adenomyosis plus leiomyoma; n = 951) and a discordant group (hypertrophy and leiomyoma; n = 81), depending on conformance between the pathologic result and the preliminary ultrasonographic diagnosis. The study showed a 92.26% concordance rate of adenomyosis between the transvaginal myometrial CNB and ultrasonographic diagnoses. The mean number of tissue cores in the discordant (n = 2.12) and concordant (n = 2.55) groups differed significantly (p < .05).

Conclusion

Abdominal ultrasound-guided transvaginal myometrial CNB can be used in the definitive diagnosis of clinically and/or sonographically suspected adenomyosis in patients undergoing uterine-preserving surgery. Future research should focus on improving the definitive diagnostic rate of adenomyosis by using transvaginal myometrial CNB.

### Adenomyosis: a clinical review of a challenging gynecologic condition [^116DS4KY]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Adenomyosis is a heterogenous gynecologic condition. Patients with adenomyosis can have a range of clinical presentations. The most common presentation of adenomyosis is heavy menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea; however, patients can also be asymptomatic. Currently, there are no standard diagnostic imaging criteria, and choosing the optimal treatment for patients is challenging. Women with adenomyosis often have other associated gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis or leiomyomas, therefore making the diagnosis and evaluating response to treatment challenging. The objective of this review was to highlight current clinical information regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, imaging findings, and treatment of adenomyosis. Several studies support the theory that adenomyosis results from invasion of the endometrium into the myometrium, causing alterations in the junctional zone. These changes are commonly seen on imaging studies such as transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The second most common theory is that adenomyosis results from embryologic-misplaced pluripotent mullerian remnants. Traditionally, adenomyosis was only diagnosed after hysterectomy; however, studies have shown that a diagnosis can be made with biopsies at hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Noninvasive imaging can be used to help guide the differential diagnosis. The most common findings on 2-dimensional/3-dimensional TVUS and MRI are reviewed. Two-dimensional TVUS and MRI have a respectable sensitivity and specificity; however, recent studies indicate that 3-dimensional TVUS is superior to 2-dimensional TVUS for the diagnosis of adenomyosis and may allow for the diagnosis of early-stage disease. Management options for adenomyosis, both medical and surgical, are reviewed. Currently, the only definitive management option for patients is hysterectomy.

Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids)

Leiomyomas are prevalent benign tumors comprising smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts while being rich in extracellular matrix. Their prevalence increases with age and has been reported to be 69% in white women and 83% in black women by the age of 50. Whereas the exact pathogenesis of a leiomyoma is unknown, it appears to be multifactorial with the involvement of genetics, gonadal steroid exposure, and environmental factors. Leiomyomas can manifest in various phenotypes that vary in size, number, and location. While most women have no symptoms related to their leiomyomas, others may present with a spectrum of symptoms. Consequently, decisions regarding expectant, medical, or procedural interventions depend on a combination of the desires of the individual and their leiomyoma phenotype. Collectively, these circumstances challenge investigators and clinicians to understand when and how a given leiomyoma phenotype is responsible for the experienced symptoms and what therapeutic options best fit the patient's goals, particularly those related to fertility.

The complex context created by this highly prevalent disorder led to the development of the FIGO classification system, which was designed primarily according to the location of the leiomyoma with respect to the endometrium and uterine serosa (Figure 3). Submucous leiomyomas include those in contact with the endometrium, as determined clinically by hysteroscopy or uterine imaging using ultrasound‐based techniques or MRI. While Types 0, 1, and 2 project into the endometrial cavity, Type 3 leiomyomas are those in contact with the endometrium without focal distortion of the endometrial cavity. Intramural leiomyomas are surrounded by myometrium and are deemed Type 4 leiomyomas. In contrast, those in contact with the uterine serosa (Types 5, 6, and 7) are categorized by the degree to which they project out of the uterus, with Type 7 being the pedunculated variety. Type 8 leiomyomas are those found in alternate locations, most commonly the cervix. Especially important for intrauterine surgery, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, are the tumors that contact both the endometrium and the uterine serosa, which are categorized with two numbers reflecting, in order, the endometrial and serosal relationships (e.g. Types 2–5 or 3–6). It is critically important that clinicians do not attempt hysteroscopic myomectomy, as removal will result in peritoneal cavity entry, termination of the procedure, and the risk of damage to surrounding visceral and other structures including the bladder, bowel, ureters, and blood vessels.

4.2 Ultrasound

While it has limitations, ultrasonography is the first‐line modality due to its availability, ease of use, absence of radiation exposure, and relatively low cost. Transabdominal and especially transvaginal ultrasonography effectively identify fibroids with sensitivity rates ranging from 90%–99%. It also provides invaluable information regarding the presence of adnexal structural pathology. Furthermore, its dynamic nature helps to map and classify the type of fibroids using FIGO's leiomyoma classification system. As outlined by MUSA criteria, fibroids typically present with a regular or lobulated uterine contour, well‐defined margins, and asymmetric uterine walls. They are smooth, round, or oval, often with edge shadowing and homogeneous echogenicity. Vascular features include circumferential blood flow and a nonthickened junctional zone. Evaluation of the endometrial cavity for a submucosal fibroid component can be performed by sonohysterography, utilizing contrast‐infused saline or gel, which increases diagnostic accuracy. Both two‐ and three‐dimensional sonohysterography achieve near‐perfect sensitivity and specificity (98%–100%) for diagnosing submucosal fibroids and may be an alternative to hysteroscopy in clinical practice. However, the accuracy of ultrasound is limited by large body habitus, enlarged uterus, and shadowing with multifibroid uteri. Furthermore, ultrasound cannot reliably assess the blood supply of fibroids, which is necessary to predict the success of uterine artery embolization.

4.3 Magnetic resonance imaging

Although significantly more expensive, MRI remains the most accurate diagnostic modality for detecting fibroids, with a reported sensitivity of 99%, providing superior soft tissue contrast and a large field‐of‐view (Figure 2). It is especially valuable for fibroid mapping in preparation for surgery or minimally invasive treatmentsand distinguishing among FIGO types, such as Type 3 from 4, or deep Type 2 from 2 to 5. It also provides critical information regarding their perfusion, the presence of tissue degeneration, and the presence of features that distinguish fibroids from adenomyosis or adenomyomas. An additional advantage of MRI is its ability to detect features that are concerning for leiomyosarcoma, with a pooled sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 96%. Finally, magnetic resonance‐guided high‐intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) is a minimally invasive treatment option for reducing the volume of fibroids, in which MRI plays an integral role.

### Unicornuate uterus with a functional non-communicating horn in adolescent [^112yUSEp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Common causes of pelvic pain are primary dysmenorrhoea, Müllerian duct anomalies, outflow obstruction, leiomyoma, endometriosis and adenomyosis. Unicornuate uterus with a rudimentary horn is a rare congenital malformation of the female genital tract, asymptomatic because of lack of functional endometrium. This study presents a rare case of a non-communicating functional rudimentary horn. A 16-year-old unmarried Yemeni female adolescent with a history of irregular painful menstrual period visited Obstetrics and Gynaecology outpatient clinic. Pelvic ultrasound was conducted showing an asymmetrical uterine configuration with the non-communicating rudimentary horn on the right side. Laparoscopic excision of the horn was planned for the patient. Non-communicating rudimentary horn with functional endometrium should be considered as a differential diagnosis in the female adolescent with obstructive uterine symptoms. Early diagnosis is crucial. Using the laparoscopic approach, an expert surgeon prefers definitive management to excise the rudimentary horn.

UAE and adenomyosis

Adenomyosis is often present concurrently with uterine fibroids. Given the efficacy of UAE in fibroid disease, it has also been proposed as an alternative minimally invasive treatment option for the management of adenomyosis (Taran et al; Ferenczy; Antero et al; Froeling et al.).

A review of UAE in adenomyosis published in 2011 by Popovic et al. reviewed studies from 1999 to 2010 and evaluated 511 women with an overall finding of symptomatic relief in 387 women (75.7%) with a median follow-up of 26.9 months. Symptom relief in the short term was seen in 83.3% with pure adenomyosis and 92.9% with combined adenomyosis and fibroids, and in the long term, symptom improvement was seen in 64.9% (pure adenomyosis) and 82.4% (combined cases). Data showed that the improvement was most dramatic in the short term (3–12 months) with trends towards long term recurrence. Although the review concluded that UAE was deemed favourable in terms of cost-effectiveness, minimal side-effects, and retention of fertility the quality of evidence was deemed insufficient to establish UAE as a potential first-line treatment for adenomyosis.

A research group in the Netherlands have continued to explore this area with a series of studies over the past decade. Smeets et al.) studied an initial cohort of 40 patients with adenomyosis, of which 18 patients had pure adenomyosis and 22 patients had both adenomyosis and fibroids. Symptoms were assessed using the UFS-QoL and found 29 patients had a good relief of symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. During the follow-up period, 7 patients (18%) underwent hysterectomy and some of these patients also showed evidence of progressive junctional zone thickness on MRI. In conclusion, the authors found that of the patients who retained their uterus, 87.9% (29 out of 33) were asymptomatic. The need for hysterectomy or clinical outcomes were not influenced by the additional presence of fibroids to adenomyosis. The presence of a thick junctional zone at baseline MRI and at 3 months follow-up after UAE is a predictive factor for the need for additional therapy (hysterectomy or repeat UAE) during long-term follow-up, which is a useful additional factor to consider when counselling patients.

AAGL practice report — imaging evaluation for suspected uterine sarcoma notes that pelvic ultrasonography and sonohysterography "represent the mainstay of imaging for endometrial pathology, but these modalities are not infallible". In women with postmenopausal bleeding, "an endometrial echo of > 4mm indicates possible intrauterine pathology", although "there is no evidence this applies to asymptomatic postmenopausal women with a thickened endometrial echo". Ultrasound may show "mixed or poor echogenic areas with central necrosis" and Doppler can reveal "irregular vessel distribution, low impedance of flow, and high peak systolic velocity"; if sarcoma is suspected after ultrasound, "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in further evaluation", but MRI features that suggest LMS "can also be consistent with benign degenerating uterine myomas", and "Significant change in size between interval scans, in addition to these features, should raise concern".

Associated conditions

Adenomyosis is frequently associated with hormone-dependent pelvic lesions. Leiomyomas are present in almost 50% of cases involving adenomyosis of the uterus (Fig. 12), while one third of young women with clinically suspected, deeply infiltrating endometriosis had MRI features of uterine adenomyosis (Fig. 13). Adenomyosis also seems to be correlated with severe endometriosis.

In the presence of an adenomyosis-like lesion in the subserosal region of the uterus, one should consider the hypothesis of subserosal endometriosis, with myometrial involvement (Fig. 14). The distinction is important, since the two conditions have different physiopathology — in invasive deep endometriosis, the lesion originates from outside the uterus and secondarily involves the serosal surface and outer myometrium. In this scenario, other findings of endometriosis should be sought.

Adenomyosis is a significant factor of sterility in these patients, presumably by impairing uterine sperm transport. Adenomyosis is also associated with endometrial and cervical polyps (Fig. 15).

We could not perform transvaginal examination and ultrasonography because of the virginity of the girl. Transabdominal ultrasound revealed a 24 × 24-mm heterogeneous cystic mass on the left adnexal region suggesting a noncommunicating functional rudimentary horn. This mass was within the left lateral uterine myometrial wall, and otherwise, the uterus and endometrial cavity seemed normal on ultrasonographic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cavitated nodule of 25 mm with hemorrhagic components inside the mass on the left side of the uterus and the normal endometrial cavity with a normal size uterus. After detailed evaluation and counseling, a decision was taken to perform laparoscopy.

Intervention(S)

Laparoscopic resection of the ACUM.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

On laparoscopic exploration, we first observed a globular enlargement on the left wall of the uterus under the round ligament. Both the ovaries and the uterus were normal, and there were two normally developed fallopian tubes with no abnormality communicating with the normal uterus. The mass had irregular muscle fibers and ambiguous limits for detaching from the normal myometrial tissue. Afterward, the mass was resected completely without entering the endometrial cavity. It was thought that these irregular borders may be a factor of confusion as a degenerated myoma on the diagnosis. The blunt and sharp dissection methods were used bidirectionally, and finally, the lesion was enucleated. The mass was incised, and chocolate-like brownish fluid spilled out from the cavity of the mass. The endometrium-like epithelium and surrounding muscular layer were seen on the mass. The myometrial defect was approximated and closed with a polyglactin absorbable suture. Histopathological examination revealed the endometrial lining cavitated mass surrounded by myometrium, and thus, it was consistent with the diagnosis of ACUM.

Result(S)

The postoperative period of the patient was uneventful. She was discharged without any complaint. Her severe pelvic pain and symptoms of dysmenorrhea were resolved 1 month after the surgery. We did not prescribe any medication for menstrual suppression and pain management before or after surgery. During the follow-up period, she had a regular menstrual cycle and no pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea for 2 years.

Conclusion(S)

Accessory cavitated uterine mass is a new entity having a normal endometrial cavity and is different from other müllerian duct anomalies. Severe dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain are early-onset, and they are persistent despite using medications, but suspecting this problem is the main determinant for confirming the diagnosis. The final diagnosis of ACUM can be made after resecting the mass and confirming with histopathological examination. Accessory cavitated uterine mass may be confused with a similar lesion of juvenile cystic adenomyosis (JCA). They present very similar clinical and pathological findings, but JCA is a rare form of focal adenomyosis that contains cystic contents inside the lesion, and it has more intense adenomyosis surrounding the endometrial lining of a cavitated mass. In our case, histopathological examination revealed muscle fibers around the endometrial epithelium, with no adenomyotic foci. It was so difficult to distinguish these two similar lesions during the surgery. Thus, we could distinguish ACUM from JCA with this pathological confirmation. Accessory cavitated uterine mass may also be misdiagnosed as U4a of ESHRE/ESGE classification and 2b of ASRM classification, but it should be distinguished from these anomalies. Moreover, it is important to define ACUM clearly in the U4 or U6 class of the ESHRE/ESGE and 2b of ASRM classification systems.

### Management of uterine adenomyosis: current trends and uterine artery embolization as a potential alternative to hysterectomy [^114bd5Qy]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adenomyosis is defined by the abnormal location of endometrial tissue within the myometrium associated with hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the myometrial stroma. Although pathogenesis and etiology of adenomyosis remain unknown, two main theories have been proposed: invagination of the endometrial basal layer and metaplasia of embryonic stem cells. Prevalence of adenomyosis varies widely from 5 to 70% with recent studies showing about 20% prevalence among which the majority were premenopausal. Despite the absence of specific (pathognomonic) diagnostic features for uterine adenomyosis, typical symptoms include menorrhagia, chronic pelvic pain, and dysmenorrhea. These symptoms are commonly encountered in other gynecological disorders including leiomyomas and endometriosis, often confounding the clinical diagnosis.

For more than a century, diagnosis was dependent on histopathologic examination of post-hysterectomy specimens till the introduction of noninvasive ultrasound and MR techniques. Since then, several studies have illustrated high sensitivities and specificities for both two-dimensional transvaginal sonography (TVS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Current treatment options for symptomatic adenomyosis include hysterectomy, medication, conservative surgery, or minimally invasive techniques including uterine artery embolization. To date, hysterectomy remains the definitive treatment. This is mainly due to difficult diagnosis, the diffuse nature of the disease, and little evidence-based literature needed to standardize treatments. This consequently results in a management dilemma, particularly in symptomatic patients who wish to preserve their uterus.

Uterine artery embolization (UAE) was first described in 1995 by Ravina et al. then later established as an effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Since then, UAE has been investigated as a noninvasive treatment option for adenomyosis with initial promising results. What remains to be known is whether UAE can be validated as a safer, noninvasive, uterine-sparing alternative to hysterectomy. This article summarizes current trends in management of uterine adenomyosis with special focus on the emerging role of UAE.

### A clinician's guide to the treatment of endometriosis with elagolix [^111XNbYN]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

### Significance of incidentally thick endometrial echo on transvaginal ultrasound in postmenopausal women [^114jLsmu]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal bleeding is "cancer until proven otherwise". A thin distinct endometrial echo on transvaginal ultrasound has a risk of malignancy of 1 in 917 and does not require an endometrial biopsy. If the endometrial echo is poorly visualized, then in such women, saline infusion sonohysterography is an appropriate next step. The prevalence of asymptomatic endometrial thickening (mostly due to inactive polyps) is high, approximately 10% to 17% of postmenopausal women. The risk of malignancy in such polyps is low (approximately 0.1%), and in structures that mimic polyps, it is also low (0.3%). The incidence of serious complications from an operative intervention in such postmenopausal women is not insignificant (1.3%-3.6%). Thus, automatic intervention in such women, without any high-risk status, is not warranted.

### Differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis and concurrent endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis: a MUSA criteria analysis [^116y81Yk]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Overall, our study highlights significant differences in the sonographic features of adenomyosis in symptomatic patients when it occurs concurrently with endometriosis compared to isolated adenomyosis. This research contributes to the broader investigation of the complex interplay between endometriosis and adenomyosis, suggesting that the spectrum of these conditions is more nuanced than previously understood. Our findings imply that these conditions may represent more than 2 distinct entities with varying etiologies potentially coexisting. Additionally, the study reinforces the value of ultrasound imaging in diagnosing and assessing these conditions. These insights pave the way for future research to improve diagnostic techniques and enhance our understanding of these interconnected diseases.

- endometriosis can be a chronic, relapsing disorder, which may necessitate a long-term follow-up

- adolescent patients with endometriosis are more likely than adult patients to present with acyclic pain

- physical examination of adolescent patients with endometriosis will rarely reveal abnormalities, as most will have early-stage disease

- endometriosis in adolescent patients is often early-stage and atypical.

First-trimester ultrasound lexicon — interstitial ectopic pregnancy (EP) is defined as a rare EP in which implantation occurs within the intramyometrial segment of the fallopian tube; diagnostic aids include absence of a sliding sign between the uterus and gestational sac (GS), three-dimensional coronal reconstruction, a uterine claw sign of myometrium partially surrounding the GS, or a thin myometrial band between endometrium and GS. The interstitial line sign may be useful but is rarely encountered; it connects the endometrium to the ectopic gestational sac. The term "cornual EP" should be avoided.

### New sonographic classification of adenomyosis: Do type and degree of adenomyosis correlate to severity of symptoms? [^112jkofZ]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To correlate the type and degree of adenomyosis, scored through a new system based on the features of transvaginal sonography, to patients' symptoms and fertility.

Design

This is a multicenter, observational, prospective study.

Setting

Two endometriosis tertiary referral centers (University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and University of Siena).

Patients

A total of 108 patients with ultrasonographic signs of adenomyosis.

Interventions

A new ultrasonographic scoring system designed to assess the severity and the extent of uterine adenomyosis was used to stage the disease in correlation with the clinical symptoms. Menstrual uterine bleeding was assessed by a pictorial blood loss analysis chart, painful symptoms were evaluated using a visual analog scale, and infertility factors were considered.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 108 patients with ultrasonographic signs of adenomyosis (mean age ± standard deviation, 37.7 ± 7.7 years) were classified according to the proposed scoring system. Women with ultrasound diagnosis of diffuse adenomyosis were older (p = .04) and had heavier menstrual bleeding (p = .04) than women with focal disease; however, no statistically significant differences were found regarding the presence and severity of dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea. Higher values of menstrual bleeding were found for severe diffuse adenomyosis, with the highest values being found in those with adenomyomas. In patients trying to conceive, the presence of ultrasound findings of focal disease was associated with a higher percentage of infertility than in those with diffuse disease, and the focal involvement of the junctional zone showed a higher percentage of at least 1 miscarriage than in those with diffuse adenomyosis.

Conclusion

The ultrasonographic evaluation of the type and extension of adenomyosis in the myometrium seems to be important in correlation to the severity of symptoms and infertility.

### ESUR consensus MRI for endometriosis: protocol, lexicon, and compartment-based analysis [^113YDvS5]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Torus uterinus and proximal USL: The torus uterinus corresponds to the fusion of the USLs posteriorly to the cervix that forms a semicircle denoting the borders of the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas). Thus, the proximal USL is located along the posterior vaginal fornix and corresponds to the segment with a transverse orientation (Fig. 4a–k). The conventional elements defining the MRI location of the torus/USL ligament were deemed insufficiently precise, and many publications demonstrated their lack of reproducibility. Thus, the group went further in the description of MRI criteria to positively identify a torus/USL deposit (Table 2).

### Clinical manifestations of adenomyosis patients with or without pain symptoms [^111Y1dvN]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we identified that most adenomyosis patients had symptoms accompanied by pain manifestation. Proportions of various forms of adenomyosis-related pain were also calculated, with dysmenorrhea ranking the first. Patients in pain group presented following characteristics compared to those without pain: younger onset age and younger diagnosed age, higher level of CA125, more likely to have concomitant rectal irritation, elevated CA125, thicken myometrial layer and endometriosis. We also identified that an elevated level of pre-surgical CA125 and thicken posterior myometrial layer were both independent risk factors for the morbidity of pain symptoms.

The pain manifestation was one of the main driving factors for adenomyosis patients to carry out relative physical examinations. In our research, adenomyosis-related pain included dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and anorectal pain, none of which were specific enough to be highly predictive for adenomyosis. An American study analyzed the symptoms of adenomyosis in the form of interviews, which provided us with more detailed and straight findings. Totally 11 different types of pain were documented together with several representative quotes, and dysmenorrhea was complained the most, which echoes our study. Pelvic pain and dyspareunia were also mentioned at lower frequencies.

In our further analysis for dysmenorrhea, it was interesting to notice that the analysis results were consistent with the above pain analysis except for the symptom of rectal irritation. The elevated level of pre-surgical CA125 and thicken posterior myometrial layer were also independent risk factors for the appearance of dysmenorrhea. These results further indicated the close relationship between dysmenorrhea and adenomyosis.

Though poorly understood, a widespread theory is that the pathogenesis of adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial basalis layer in the myometrium through invagination, possibly because of the damage of the endometrial-myometrial border or the changes of the immune system. The occurrence of dysmenorrhea may attribute to increased prostaglandin production in adenomyotic tissues, inflammation, nerve fiber density as well as upregulated oxytocin receptors, all of which still needs to be further verified.–

### Contemporary evaluation of women and girls with abnormal uterine bleeding: FIGO systems 1 and 2 [^116B1Qqo]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
FIGO subclassification system for leiomyomas. The system includes the tertiary classification of leiomyomas dependent on location. Classification of lesions that are transmural are categorized by their relationship to both the endometrial and the serosal surfaces. The endometrial relationship is noted first, with the serosal relationship second (e.g. Type 2–5). Leiomyomas that do not relate to the myometrium at all are classified as Type 8, and would include cervical lesions (demonstrated), those that exist in the round or broad ligaments without direct attachment to the uterus, and other so‐called "parasitic" lesions.

Only submucous leiomyomas appear to be linked directly with objectively measured increased blood loss — data that have not distinguished if Type 3 lesions are included. Consequently, since most leiomyomas do not appear to contribute to AUB symptoms, women with Type 3–8 leiomyomas should be investigated for other possible causes of AUB. There is a paucity of data related to the leiomyoma‐related cause of AUB symptoms when there is no direct physical link with the endometrium.

TVUS remains the first line of investigation for leiomyomas, with a sensitivity of between 90% and 99%. Leiomyomas are typically well‐defined spheroids with shadows at the edge of the lesion caused by the interface between fibroid tissue and normal myometrium. The echogenicity of the lesion varies depending on the proportion of muscle cells and fibrous stroma within the lesion. Color Doppler can delineate circumferential flow around the lesion, sometimes characterized as a "ring of fire". Sonohysterography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when lesions are suspected to involve the endometrial cavity. Further information on the number, location, and size of the lesions may be provided by MRI and may suggest the possibility of sarcomatous change; however, diagnostic reliability for malignancy remains uncertain.

### Evaluation of junctional zone differential and ratio as possible markers of clinical efficacy in uterine artery embolisation of adenomyosis [^112gUDLM]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Morphological data

Multiple papers showed a decrease in uterus volume of 8–54% within a year following UAE, assessed by MRI. Our data on uterine volume decrease in cases of pure adenomyosis (median 26%, range 48%) falls within the range reported in the literature.

The decrease in JZmax following UAE was 12.0–33% in the studies published 1999–2010. In the other systematic review of studies between 2001–2016, 4 papers reported a decrease in JZ of 13.7%–38%; however, most papers (26/30, 86.7%) cited in this systematic review did not report on JZ. JZ thickness was shown to be thicker in patients who underwent hysterectomy for persistent symptoms; however, the insufficient response was not correlated with significantly thicker JZ in another paper. Our finding of a 15% mean reduction in JZ thickness is in line with previous reports.

Besides the widely used junctional zone thickness, JZ differential and JZ to myometrial ratio have also been suggested as objective measures to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in adenomyosis. Kitamura et al. found no significant decrease in JZratio after embolization of 19 patients with pure or dominant adenomyosis – our findings regarding JZratio change are in alignment.

This is the first study to our knowledge to report on the correlation between QoL change and junctional zone characteristics. A significant correlation between QoL change vs. JZmax change, and QoL change vs. JZdiff change underlines the importance of these measurements and their relation to the imaging appearance of adenomyosis. JZmax as the classic, long-debated MR morphological factor still in use in everyday practice, forms the base of the imaging diagnosis of adenomyosis and is a main pillar in some aspects of disease classification. JZdiff, on the other hand, is considered as a second-line measurement in imaging diagnosis. Based on our findings, JZdiff could play a more significant role in the imaging diagnosis and the ever-evolving classification of adenomyosis as a marker of junctional zone inhomogeneity. Moreover, the change in JZdiff after UAE in adenomyosis may be a potential marker of clinical success.

Comparison Between Dysmenorrhea And Non-Dysmenorrhea Group

Since 68% patients presented dysmenorrhea, we made a further analysis for adenomyosis patients with pure dysmenorrhea (131) (presented in).

Patients in dysmenorrhea group were also much younger than those in non-dysmenorrhea group in terms of the age at diagnosis and onset of disease (P = 0.012 and P = 0.012, respectively). A higher level of pre-surgical CA125 was identified in patients of dysmenorrhea group compared with the other one (P < 0.001). More patients in dysmenorrhea group presented elevated CA125 (P < 0.001), thicken myometrial layer (P < 0.001) and concurrent endometriosis (P = 0.023). In the multivariable analysis, an elevated level of pre-surgical CA125 (P < 0.001) and thicken posterior myometrial layer (P = 0.008) were both independent risk factors for the appearance of dysmenorrhea.

Endometrial polyp in a 44-year-old woman with acute uterine bleeding and associated bilateral ovarian neoplasm. Sagittal (a) and oblique-coronal (d) T2-weighted images show a huge polypoid mass (arrowheads) arising from the uterine fundus that fills the endometrial cavity and protrudes into the cervical canal. Note the hypointense stromal axis of the polyp (arrows). Corresponding sagittal (b) and oblique-coronal (e) precontrast fat-suppressed T1-weighted images show hyperintense foci on the polyp edge (thin arrows), representing haemorrhage. On gadolinium-enhanced sagittal (c) and oblique-coronal (f) fat-suppressed T1-weighted images, the implant base (stromal axis) of the polyp shows intense enhancement (arrows). The patient underwent bilateral uterine artery embolisation in order to control bleeding

Regarding management, hysteroscopic polypectomy is the gold standard for both diagnosis and treatment. Conservative management is reasonable in the case of small polyps in asymptomatic patients.

The key differential diagnosis of post-menopausal bleeding is endometrial carcinoma, which usually shows intermediate signal intensity (hyperintense compared with the myometrium) on T2-weighted images. Identification of the central fibrous core and of intratumoural cysts favour the diagnosis of EP. Conversely, myometrial invasion, necrosis, a lower enhancement compared to the adjacent myometrium and irregular internal "cystic" areas suggest carcinoma. Endometrial hyperplasia is a premalignant condition that does not have a characteristic imaging appearance (Fig. 2); therefore, any focal endometrial thickening warrants hysteroscopy and biopsy, especially in post-menopausal women.
