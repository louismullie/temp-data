## Question

Screening for IPMN

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about screening for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical context and scope of "screening" versus surveillance. Then, I should verify the prevalence and epidemiology to frame risk. Next, I will classify IPMN subtypes and their malignant potential. After that, I need to review guideline-based risk stratification and surgical indications. Then, I will examine surveillance protocols by guideline and reconcile differences. I should also consider special populations, including high-risk individuals and post-resection patients. Finally, I will appraise emerging tools, address controversies, and synthesize a practical, patient-centered approach with explicit uncertainties and monitoring triggers.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating population screening with surveillance of known lesions. IPMNs are cystic precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and are typically detected incidentally on cross-sectional imaging; there is no recommendation for mass screening of the general population, and management centers on risk-stratified surveillance and selective resection rather than screening per se [^111cgBki] [^112FoNte] [^114SW6w3].

> I should double-check the prevalence and epidemiology to calibrate baseline risk. Population-based data suggest pancreatic cysts are present in roughly 8% of adults, with IPMNs comprising a substantial fraction and prevalence rising with age; importantly, most IPMNs are small branch-duct lesions without worrisome features, and the absolute risk of progression to PDAC is low but increases over time, which underpins the rationale for prolonged surveillance in selected patients [^111cgBki] [^1127NK7A] [^1168Vjfv].

> Next, I will classify IPMN subtypes and verify their malignant potential, because this drives management. Main-duct (MD) and mixed-type IPMNs carry a higher risk of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma, with malignancy rates around 62% in surgical series, supporting a lower threshold for resection in fit patients; branch-duct (BD) IPMNs are more common and generally indolent, though risk is not zero and increases with size, mural nodules, and main duct dilation, necessitating individualized surveillance intensity [^114LigrQ] [^113uStdi] [^111sjr4k].

> Hold on, I should verify the risk stratification frameworks before applying them. The revised Fukuoka (IAP 2017) and European guidelines categorize features as high-risk stigmata (HRS) versus worrisome features (WF), with HRS prompting surgical referral and WF prompting EUS ± FNA and closer surveillance; the AGA guideline similarly uses solid component and dilated duct as key thresholds for surgery, and all emphasize that size alone is insufficient for decision-making without corroborating features [^113UPjVk] [^114SW6w3] [^1172dZxP].

> I will now examine surgical indications, and I need to ensure I align with consensus. For MD-IPMN, resection is generally recommended in surgical candidates given the high malignancy risk. For BD-IPMN, absolute indications include enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, obstructive jaundice, or positive cytology for high-grade dysplasia, while relative indications include cyst ≥ 3 cm, main duct 5–9 mm, or rapid growth, with decisions individualized to age, comorbidity, and patient preference [^114LigrQ] [^114SW6w3] [^113Dhr8H].

> Wait, let me verify surveillance protocols by guideline, because this is where confusion often arises. The European guideline recommends MRI-based surveillance indefinitely as long as the patient remains fit for surgery, typically 6-month follow-up in year 1 then annually if stable; the revised Fukuoka guideline supports MRI/MRCP with interval tailored to size and features; the AGA suggests MRI every 1–2 years for 5 years, with discontinuation if no change, a stance increasingly challenged by long-term data showing late progression and concomitant cancers [^114SW6w3] [^113fRG8n] [^1172dZxP].

> But wait, what if we stop at 5 years — does risk truly plateau? I should confirm the evidence on late progression. Multiple cohorts show that cumulative risks of developing worrisome features or requiring surgery rise substantially after 5 years, with some cancers detected beyond 5 years; thus, many experts argue against routine cessation of surveillance at 5 years in otherwise fit patients, particularly given the field defect concept and the possibility of metachronous lesions [^111RBbVg] [^111sjr4k] [^115xyV34].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with high-risk individuals with familial pancreatic cancer or pathogenic variants. CAPS-endorsed screening targets genetically susceptible individuals aiming to detect resectable stage I PDAC or high-grade precursors; initial modalities are MRI/MRCP and/or EUS, with management centralized at high-volume centers, and surveillance intervals individualized based on findings and age, recognizing that small BD-IPMNs are common and that progression can be slow [^111SsuZC] [^113jrsTW] [^115ZW763].

> I should confirm post-resection surveillance, because recurrence or new lesions can occur. After resection, lifelong surveillance is advised, with intensified intervals for high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma and standard intervals for low-grade lesions; recurrence risk persists years after surgery, reinforcing the need for long-term imaging and multidisciplinary follow-up [^111vdsgQ] [^115263kq].

> Next, I should review emerging tools and biomarkers, but I need to be cautious about overpromising. EUS ± FNA improves characterization of mural nodules and allows cytology, though sensitivity is imperfect; short MRI protocols can maintain diagnostic performance while reducing time and cost; molecular cyst fluid panels and immune microenvironment studies are promising but not yet practice-changing; PET/CT may add specificity when conventional features are equivocal, yet should not replace guideline-based assessment [^112gsxS1] [^116RvL1G] [^1168Vjfv] [^114B31jR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping surveillance — what are the counterarguments and uncertainties? The AGA's 5-year stopping rule has been challenged by studies showing late cancers and progression beyond 5 years; conversely, some registry data in strictly low-risk BD-IPMNs suggest minimal progression after 5 years, but selection and ascertainment biases limit generalizability; until robust, validated discontinuation criteria exist, individualized decisions should weigh life expectancy, comorbidity, and patient values [^112mnbrN] [^116sZcHu] [^114Cmofq].

> I need to ensure we address patient-centered outcomes and feasibility. Surveillance is resource-intensive and can provoke anxiety, yet prospective data suggest minimal impact on health-related quality of life and anxiety in routine follow-up; nonetheless, adherence to guidelines is often suboptimal in real-world cohorts, underscoring the need for streamlined pathways and patient education [^114zoLKg] [^111YNs9b].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I should double-check that it aligns with major guidelines. For incidentally detected IPMN, confirm subtype with MRI/MRCP; if MD or mixed-type, refer for surgical evaluation in appropriate candidates; if BD-IPMN without HRS, initiate MRI surveillance with intervals based on size and features, consider EUS for WF, and avoid stopping surveillance prematurely in fit patients; integrate MDT decisions, document growth and ductal changes rigorously, and adjust intensity with evolving features or patient status [^114SW6w3] [^113UPjVk] [^112nU5TV].

> Finally, I should acknowledge key controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. The optimal surveillance interval, the precise criteria for stopping surveillance, the role of biomarkers to replace imaging, and the cost-effectiveness of lifelong follow-up remain unresolved; ongoing studies and consensus updates should prioritize predictive models, biomarker validation, and pragmatic surveillance strategies that balance early detection against overtreatment and resource burden [^1168Vjfv] [^116BLZWn] [^114Cmofq].

---

Screening for IPMN is not recommended for the general population [^112FoNte] because of the high prevalence of incidental cysts [^1127NK7A] and the risk of overtreatment [^112FoNte]. Instead, **surveillance is advised for patients with known IPMNs**, using MRI/MRCP as the preferred modality [^114SW6w3] and tailored to cyst size, features, and patient risk [^113fRG8n]. Main-duct IPMNs generally warrant resection if the patient is fit [^114SW6w3], whereas branch-duct IPMNs without high-risk features are surveilled [^114Cmofq]; surveillance should continue as long as the patient remains a surgical candidate [^114SW6w3], as risk rises over time [^111sjr4k] [^111RBbVg].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

IPMNs are increasingly detected due to improved imaging [^112Qi5Cp]; their prevalence in the general population is approximately 2.5–8% [^notfound] and increases with age [^113c3Ze7]. Most are branch-duct IPMNs, which are often indolent, whereas main-duct IPMNs carry higher malignant potential [^114LigrQ].

---

## Risk stratification and indications for surveillance

IPMNs are stratified by malignant potential using international consensus guidelines [^113UPjVk]:

| **Risk category** | **Features** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk stigmata | - Obstructive jaundice <br/> - Enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm <br/> - Main pancreatic duct ≥ 10 mm | Surgical resection if fit [^114SW6w3] |
| Worrisome features | - Cyst ≥ 3 cm <br/> - Non-enhancing mural nodule <br/> - Main duct 5–9 mm <br/> - Abrupt duct change with atrophy <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - Elevated CA 19–9 | - EUS ± FNA <br/> - Consider surgery if high-grade dysplasia or malignancy [^113Dhr8H] |
| Low-risk features | - Branch-duct IPMN < 3 cm <br/> - No mural nodules <br/> - Normal main duct | Surveillance with MRI/MRCP [^114SW6w3] |

---

## Recommended imaging modalities for surveillance

MRI/MRCP is preferred for IPMN surveillance because it avoids radiation, provides high soft-tissue contrast, and delineates ductal communication [^113fRG8n]; **CT is reserved** for patients with MRI contraindications or when MRI is unavailable [^notfound]. EUS is used when additional detail is needed — such as for small mural nodules or when tissue sampling is required [^112gsxS1].

---

## Surveillance intervals and duration

Surveillance intervals are tailored to cyst size, features, and patient risk:

- **Initial follow-up**: 6–12 months after diagnosis to confirm stability [^112nU5TV].
- **Stable lesions**: Annual MRI/MRCP thereafter [^112RxEmR].
- **Lesions ≥ 3 cm or with worrisome features**: 6-month intervals with EUS ± FNA [^112nU5TV].
- **Duration**: Lifelong surveillance as long as the patient remains fit for surgery, as risk increases over time [^114SW6w3] [^111sjr4k].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness of surveillance

Surveillance enables early detection of progression and concomitant pancreatic cancer, improving survival and resection rates [^111RSWZn]. However, **overdiagnosis and overtreatment** remain concerns, particularly for low-risk branch-duct IPMNs [^112FoNte] [^114Cmofq].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Imaging limitations**: Small mural nodules or subtle ductal changes may be missed [^notfound].
- **Patient factors**: Anxiety, compliance, and comorbidities affect surveillance adherence [^111YNs9b].
- **Resource utilization**: Lifelong surveillance imposes significant healthcare costs [^111k92mz].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

Advanced imaging (e.g. PET/CT, AI) and molecular biomarkers may improve risk stratification and reduce unnecessary surgery [^114B31jR] [^116BLZWn]. Short MRI protocols are being explored to streamline surveillance without compromising diagnostic accuracy [^116RvL1G].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **General population**: No screening recommended [^111eE2ae].
- **Patients with IPMNs**: Surveillance with MRI/MRCP tailored to risk [^114SW6w3].
- **Main-duct IPMNs**: Consider resection if fit [^114SW6w3].
- **Branch-duct IPMNs**: Surveillance unless high-risk features develop [^114Cmofq].
- **Duration**: Lifelong surveillance as long as the patient remains a surgical candidate [^114SW6w3].

---

Screening for IPMN is not recommended for the general population; instead, **risk-adapted surveillance with MRI/MRCP** is the cornerstone of management, balancing the benefits of early detection against the risks of overtreatment [^114SW6w3].

At what age should screening begin and end?

There was disagreement about the age to initiate screening in HRIs (Appendix). For individuals with familial PC, the average age at diagnosis is 68. Fifty-one per cent voted to recommend starting screening at age 50. In contrast, screening typically begins at age 40 in PRSS1 mutation carriers with hereditary pancreatitis owing to younger age of onset of PC. Smokers with a family history of PC have a greater risk of developing PC than non-smokers, but there was no consensus as to whether to recommend initiating screening at an earlier age for current smokers (Appendix). There was also no consensus recommendation about the age to end screening for HRIs without pancreatic lesions (Appendix).

How should high-risk individuals be screened?

Published screening studies have employed different screening tests. Direct interpretation of screening modalities is limited by differences in study populations, and reported diagnostic yields have ranged between 1.3% and 50%, depending on whether resected neoplasms or pancreatic lesions were tabulated (table 1). Of 1040 HRIs screened, to date only 70 (6.7%) had a pancreatic lesion or suspected neoplasm resected. Small cysts (branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms or BD-IPMNs) are the most common abnormality detected (in 34% and 53% of HRIs aged 50–59 and 60–69, respectively). Solid masses are rarely detected (20 of 70 resected were pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The number of incident PCs detected in published studies is likely to be unreported (only four were cohort studies, all with limited follow-up), but eight of 20 (40%) of the PCs diagnosed in screened HRIs were not detected at baseline screening.

### Screening for pancreatic cancer: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^112FoNte]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Pancreatic intraductal lesions and guideline accuracy — risk of overdiagnosis is suggested by surgical series in noncancer indications and low specificity of management criteria: In 2 studies, 26% to 54% of pancreata removed at surgery for reasons other than pancreatic cancer contained intraductal neoplasia, and International Consensus Guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms had high sensitivity (98.4%) but low specificity (14.8%) to predict high-grade dysplasia or invasive cancer, suggesting screening in the general population might lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^115263kq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) — post-resection recurrence risk and surveillance intervals: Retrospective studies have reported a high risk of recurrence, 17–65% in IPMNs with pancreatic cancer, and these patients should be followed per pancreatic cancer guidelines. After resection of an IPMN with high-grade dysplasia, recurrence rates of 13–31% are reported and we recommend surveillance with MRI or EUS on a 6-month basis; the median time to recurrence varies from 19 to 47 months, with a wide range of 4 to 180 months. For surgically resected IPMN with low- or intermediate-grade dysplasia, recurrence is 0–22%; in the absence of pancreatic cysts in the remnant, surveillance with MRI every 24 months appears reasonable. If there is an IPMN in the remnant pancreas, patients should be followed based on the size of the largest IPMN, and the shortest surveillance interval should be followed (i.e., if there is a 1.5 cm cyst then surveillance would be yearly).

Another target for early detection and treatment is IPMN (agree 87.7%, evidence high, 'do it'). Detection and treatment of IPMN with high-grade dysplasia should be considered a success of a screening/surveillance programme (agree 95.9%, evidence high, 'do it').

IPMNs, particularly IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia, are associated with a significantly increased risk of invasive PC. The IPMN phenotype has been described in familial PC relatives and gene mutation carriers. The frequency and rate at which IPMNs in HRIs progress to invasive PC are not well known. In patients with apparently sporadic non-invasive IPMNs it may take 3–5 years for a clinically detectable non-invasive lesion to progress to an invasive PC. Furthermore, in patients with small BD-IPMN(s) followed up over 5 years, only 2.4–6.9% of these lesions progressed to invasive PC.

Important areas where there was lack of consensus: areas for future research

Topics that did not reach consensus voting are listed in the Appendix. Additional evidence is required to more accurately answer important questions, such as who to screen, when to begin screening and the frequency of screening. Some of the important gaps in knowledge pertain to the optimal age at which to begin screening, the role of as yet unidentified PC susceptibility genes as a guide to optimising screening and how to incorporate environmental risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, obesity and other exposures into risk stratification.

The CAPS summit recommended prioritising research into areas where there was lack of consensus: diagnostic evaluation and management of cystic and solid lesions detected by screening and postoperative management. Importantly, the group recommends collaborative multicentre institutional review board-approved studies to collect data on demographics, family history, risk factors, and to bank tissue, juice, aspirated fluid and blood to improve biomarker prediction of the risk of progression to PC in HRIs. Ultimately, research into how to improve screening methods, the outcomes of screening and surveillance for PC and the cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches, is of the highest priority.

4.4 What is the best imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN?

MRI is the preferred imaging modality for the follow-up of IPMN. EUS can be used in selected cases (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

See section 3 for details.

4.5 Should the progress of IPMN be followed for as long as the patient is fit for surgery?

The risk of IPMN progression increases over the time, therefore patients affected by IPMN without indication for surgery should be followed up until they are no longer fit for surgery (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

The risk of progression of IPMN increases over the time as does the risk of developing indications for surgical resection. Interruption of surveillance is not recommended if the patient is fit for a potential surgical resection. A single study on IPMN concluded that patients with a Charlson-age comorbidity index ≥ 7 have an 11-fold risk of comorbidity-related death within 3 years and only 6% of patients will die of malignant IPMN.

4.6 Should patients with IPMNs be screened for other tumours (including pancreatic cancer)?

The incidence of new extra-pancreatic neoplasms during the follow-up evaluation of pancreatic IPMN is not significantly greater than in the general population. Comprehensive screening outside the national protocols might not be necessary. Patients with IPMN are at risk of developing pancreatic cancer and attention should be paid to its concomitant development even when an IPMN has been successfully resected (GRADE 1C, strong agreement).

A systematic review concluded that the available data remain inconclusive. Two large studies including both surgically resected or followed IPMN did not find any difference in terms of incidence of extra-pancreatic neoplasms in patients with IPMN if compared with the general population.

4.7 Should MD-IPMN always be resected?

Patients with MD-IPMN who are fit for surgery should undergo resection (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Surgery for MD-IPMN is universally accepted considering the high-rate of malignancy due to MD-IPMN, even though no randomised trials comparing surgery with observation are available. As discussed in statement 4.1 above, a MD-IPMN measuring between 5 and 9.9 mm is a relative indication for surgical resection, while MD-IPMN measuring ≥ 10 mm (see statement 4.1 for details) is an absolute indication for surgical resection.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: clinical surveillance and management decisions [^112UsbgA]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a relatively rare cystic neoplasm. Although most IPMNs appear to be benign and may be managed by surveillance, all IPMNs are considered premalignant lesions with malignant potential. As such, current efforts are focused on identifying those neoplasms that are at high risk for malignancy to optimize treatment strategy and outcome. IPMNs with invasive carcinoma have clinical outcomes that approach those of conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Management guidelines recommend surgical resection for IPMNs with high-risk imaging or cytologic features. The role of adjuvant therapy is unclear, and we review the evidence for chemoradiation here. Some studies suggest adjuvant chemoradiation may have the greatest impact in malignant IPMNs with adverse histologic features, that is, lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis or positive surgical margins. As more IPMNs are recognized and treated, more evidence will accumulate to guide clinicians regarding appropriate use of radiotherapy in the management of IPMN.

### International intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms registry: long-term results based on the new guidelines [^116sZcHu]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of a long-term intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) registry and evaluate new guidelines.

Methods

A prospectively maintained IPMN registry involving 6 centers in Europe and the United States was used to collect the data. Patients with more than 1-year follow-up and no malignancy diagnosed within the first 3 months of surveillance were included.

Results

From 1999 to 2014, 620 patients were included. The median follow-up time was 3 years. Thirty-seven (6%) patients developed malignancy with a median time from IPMN diagnosis to malignancy of 10.3 months. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year actuarial rates of disease-free survival were 97%, 93%, and 92% respectively. Four hundred thirty-one patients met criteria for low-risk branch duct IPMN consisting of cyst size less than 3 cm, with no solid component or main duct dilation. Eight malignancies were diagnosed in this subgroup, all of them within the first 5 years. From this subcohort, 112 patients had a follow-up time of more than 5 years, and no malignancy was diagnosed.

Conclusions

In IPMN lesions with low-risk features at baseline, the risk of progression to malignancy after the first 5 years of follow-up was minimal. Furthermore, the main cyst characteristics remained unchanged during their surveillance.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^116NKD8W]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Due to the widespread availability and increased use of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, incidental PCNs are increasing in incidence. Certainly, the numbers of patients that are referred to pancreatic surgery clinics have steadily increased over the years as a result. The prevalence of PCNs is more common in the general population than previously considered and increases with age, rising to over 75% in patients over 80 years of age in selected populations. About half of PCNs will be IPMNs, thus radiographic screening is impractical, although once identified, surveillance is necessary. When to stop this surveillance is difficult to determine and may be abbreviated in older individuals, but certainly will need to be more than 5 years in the absence of improved prognostic tools for the general population. Radiographic characteristics remain the main components of current treatment guidelines and there are significant differences between guideline recommendations and clinical practice. Future updates to these guidelines will benefit from an improved body of evidence and should endeavor to provide a single universally accepted version, distinguish MCNs from IPMNs, and incorporate methodologies that improve their positive predictive value. Cyst fluid molecular diagnostics have shown promise in differentiating low-grade dysplastic IPMNs from high-grade and invasive IPMNs, and there is now evidence that dysplasia is associated with distinct changes in the tumor immune microenvironment.

### Main-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: high cancer risk in duct diameter of 5 to 9 mm [^113uStdi]. Annals of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The 2012 international consensus guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) recommend surgical treatment in main-duct IPMN patients with a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter of ≥ 10mm. Aim of the present study was to analyze cancer risk in patients with an MPD diameter of less than 10mm.

Methods

All consecutive patients (prospective data protocol) with histological proof of IPMN who underwent surgery between January 2004 and December 2013 were included in the study. Clinical characteristics, particularly preoperative imaging with regard to morphology of the MPD, were correlated with final histopathology.

Results

Among a total of 605 patients who underwent surgery for IPMN, there were 320 patients with MPD involvement, 238 patients with mixed-type IPMN, and 82 patients with main-duct IPMN alone. The total malignancy rate including high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma in IPMNs with MPD involvement was 68%. When the MPD diameter was 5 to 9mm, malignancy rate was 59%, whereas in MPD diameter more than 10mm, it was 73%. No statistical correlations were observed between MPD diameter and clinical and/or IPMN features such as age, cyst location, mural nodules, serum tumor markers, or bilirubin.

Conclusions

Main-duct IPMNs with a MPD between 5 and 9mm already bear a significant risk of malignancy. Therefore, surgical treatment is clearly indicated in patients with a MPD diameter of ≥ 5mm and the 2012 guidelines should be discussed and adapted with regard to this topic.

4.20 How should patients be followed up who underwent surgical resection for an IPMN?

Lifelong surveillance is recommended following resection of an IPMN as long as the patient is fit and is willing to undergo surgery if indicated. Patients with evidence of anIPMN-associated invasive carcinoma should be followed up in the same manner as those with a resected pancreatic cancer. IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or MD-IPMN should have close follow-up every 6 months for the first 2 years, followed by yearly surveillance. IPMN with low-grade dysplasia should be followed up in the same manner as non-resected IPMN (see statement 4.2 and figure 1 for details). Patients with IPMN in the remnant pancreas, who do not have high-grade dysplasia or MD-IPMN, should be followed up in the same manner as non-resected BD-IPMN (see section 4.15 and figure 1 for details). Follow-up imaging using MRI or EUS is recommended (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Several studies have reported that IPMN recurrence is possible 5 to 10 years after resection. The risk of BD-IPMN and MD-IPMN recurrence is similar (7–8%). Resected IPMN with low-grade dysplasia have a low risk of recurrence (5.4−10%) with disease-free survival of approximately 52 months, while IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma have a higher risk (> 50%), with disease-free survival of 29 months.

4.21 What preoperative investigation should be performed for a patient with an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma? Should the same criteria be used as for pancreatic cancer?

The diagnostic investigation for an IPMN-associated invasive cancer should follow the same algorithm used for pancreatic cancer (GRADE 1C, strong agreement).

No studies have examined the differences between an IPMN-associated invasive carcinoma and spontaneous pancreatic cancer with respect to local tumour extension or staging for distant metastases.

### Long-term outcomes and risk of pancreatic cancer in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111cgBki]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Incidental detection of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) has increased in recent years primarily due to improved resolution and widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are the most frequently identified PCLs. Current international consensus guidelinesfor management of IPMNs recommend image-based surveillance with the aim to detect clinical and imaging features of advanced neoplasia (high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer). Although a minority of IPMNs warrant surgical resection, our existing knowledge about the prevalence, natural history, and risk of malignancy in IPMNs is largely derived from surgical series, or from patients treated at tertiary centers, populations which are not representative of the population burden of the disease. There is a critical need to define the prevalence and natural history of IPMNs in a population-based cohort to inform surveillance guidelines.

A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysisestimated the pooled population prevalence of PCLs at approximately 8%. The reported prevalence varies across studies depending on the imaging modality used, geographical location, and age of the cohort studied, and most studies include all PCLs not specifically IPMNs. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there are no population-based estimates of the burden of pancreatic cancer (PC) in individuals with IPMNs or the proportion of PCs that develop from or adjacent to an IPMN. This study uses a population-based cohort to assess the prevalence and associated long-term outcomes and PC risk in IPMN. In addition, we investigated the proportion of PCs that arose from IPMNs (IPMN-PCs) and compared their outcomes with those of non-IPMN PCs.

### International cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium summit on the management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer [^115ZW763]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Screening individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer (PC) detects early, potentially curable, pancreatic neoplasia.

Objective

To develop consortium statements on screening, surveillance and management of high-risk individuals with an inherited predisposition to PC.

Methods

A 49-expert multidisciplinary international consortium met to discuss pancreatic screening and vote on statements. Consensus was considered reached if ≥ 75% agreed or disagreed.

Results

There was excellent agreement that, to be successful, a screening programme should detect and treat T1N0M0 margin-negative PC and high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). It was agreed that the following were candidates for screening: first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with PC from a familial PC kindred with at least two affected FDRs; patients with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome; and p16, BRCA 2 and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) mutation carriers with ≥ 1 affected FDR. Consensus was not reached for the age to initiate screening or stop surveillance. It was agreed that initial screening should include endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and/or MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography not CT or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. There was no consensus on the need for EUS fine-needle aspiration to evaluate cysts. There was disagreement on optimal screening modalities and intervals for follow-up imaging. When surgery is recommended it should be performed at a high-volume centre. There was great disagreement as to which screening abnormalities were of sufficient concern to for surgery to be recommended.

Conclusions

Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals, but more evidence is needed, particularly for how to manage patients with detected lesions. Screening and subsequent management should take place at high-volume centres with multidisciplinary teams, preferably within research protocols.

### Refinement of screening for familial pancreatic cancer [^114MCzXd]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Surveillance programmes are recommended for individuals at risk (IAR) of familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) to detect early pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC). However, the age to begin screening and the optimal screening protocol remain to be determined.

Methods

IAR from non-CDKN2A FPC families underwent annual screening by MRI with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in board-approved prospective screening programmes at three tertiary referral centres. The diagnostic yield according to age and different screening protocols was analysed.

Results

253 IAR with a median age of 48 (25–81)years underwent screening with a median of 3 (1–11) screening visits during a median follow-up of 28 (1–152)months. 134 (53%) IAR revealed pancreatic lesions on imaging, mostly cystic (94%), on baseline or follow-up screening. Lesions were significantly more often identified in IAR above the age of 45years (p < 0.0001). In 21 IAR who underwent surgery, no significant lesions (PDAC, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) 3 lesions, high-grade intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN)) were detected before the age of 50years. Potentially relevant lesions (multifocal PanIN2 lesions, low/moderate-grade branch-duct IPMNs) occurred also significantly more often after the age of 50years (13 vs 2, p < 0.0004). The diagnostic yield of potentially relevant lesions was not different between screening protocols using annual MRI with EUS (n = 98) or annual MRI with EUS every 3rd year (n = 198) and between IAR screened at intervals of 12months (n = 180) or IAR that decided to be screened at ≥ 24months intervals (n = 30).

Conclusions

It appears safe to start screening for PDAC in IAR of non-CDKN2a FPC families at the age of 50years. MRI-based screening supplemented by EUS at baseline and every 3rd year or when changes in MRI occur appears to be efficient.

### Early detection of sporadic pancreatic cancer: summative review [^113Tfyta]. Pancreas (2015). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm is reported to arise in the pancreas of pedigrees of FPC on follow-up before or at the development of PC. 142 Even IPMN patients without a family history of PC may develop 1 or multiple concomitant PCs. Multiple IPMNs (≥ 10) are associated with a higher prevalence of noninvasive or invasive concomitant PC. As these observations show increased predisposition of IPMN patients to PC, close surveillance of IPMN patients may lead to early detection of SPC. A JPS-endorsed group of 74 pancreas centers throughout Japan launched a prospective collaborative surveillance study in 2012 and registered more than 2100 patients with branch duct IPMN without "worrisome features" during a 2-year entry period until July 2014. These patients will undergo a fixed protocol of surveillance for 5 years, that is, blood tests, dynamic CT, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and EUS at the time of registry; blood tests plus CT every 6 months every year; and blood tests and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography plus EUS every 12 months. This study may allow us to determine precise incidence of PC concomitant with branch duct IPMN and provide us with some insight into the early diagnosis of SPC.

Early Detection Research Network

Early Detection Research Network of the NCI has established several key resources for researchers. First, the EDRN has established 2 reference sets: one that contains 100 sera and plasma from early-stage PCs along with 100 benign disease controls (other benign diseases of the pancreas) and a second, which is currently accruing samples, that contains sera and plasma from patients with resection-confirmed cystic lesions of the pancreas. These samples are all well annotated for clinical features and procured under a standard operating protocol. The collection of these samples required coordinated collaboration among more than 5 major pancreatic centers. A second significant contribution of the EDRN has been the publication of important principles and operating procedures for the systematic discovery and validation of biomarkers. 143 The system consists of (a) establishing a reference set of specimens collected under PRoBE design criteria, (b) using the reference set to prevalidate candidate biomarkers before committing to full-scale validation, (c) performing full-scale validation for those markers that pass prevalidation testing, and (d) ensuring that the reference set is sufficiently large in numbers and volumes of sample that it can also be used to study future candidate biomarkers. This system provides rigorous and efficient evaluation of candidate biomarkers and biomarker panels. Reference sets should also be constructed to enable high-quality biomarker-discovery research. 143

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^113DGv8E]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas is a disease with a high prevalence. It is estimated that the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) in the general population is approximately 20–30% and that half of these are IPMNs. While it is recognized that IPMNs can progress to cancer, the high prevalence of IPMNs and the low incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) in the general population indicate that only a minority of IPMNs progress to invasive carcinoma. Considering that IPMN of the pancreas was defined by the World Health Organization only as recently as in 1996, there is a lack of information regarding the natural history of these neoplasms and in particular regarding long-term prognosis. Published data show that the risk for cancer differs according to the epithelial type of IPMN and that it is higher in IPMNs affecting the main pancreatic duct, either in isolation or combined with branch duct involvement (main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs, respectively). For this reason, current guidelines recommend surgical resection for all IPMNs with involvement of the main pancreatic duct, provided the patient is fit for surgery. In contrast, the risk for cancer is significantly lower for IPMNs that are limited to branch ducts (branch-duct IPMN); therefore, surgical resection is considered to be an indication in only a minority of patients with branch-duct IPMN. However, because it is currently not possible to predict which of the IPMNs that do not require surgical resection will progress to cancer, a large proportion of patients require life-long follow-up. Data from the literature support the current conservative management of the majority of patients with "small" (< 3–4 cm) branch-duct IPMNs, who do not have IPMN-related symptoms and do not present worrisome radiological features. Invasive carcinoma is reported to develop during follow-up in 1–11% of patients.–The risk for pancreatic cancer developing at a distance from the IPMN also seems to be increased, with a 5-year incidence reported in approximately 7% of patients under surveillance and a standardized incidence ratio of 15.8- to 26-fold. Even though published data support the safety of surveillance for the majority of patients with IPMN, experiences are not uniformly positive. This is most likely explained by the use of different inclusion criteria and different indications for surgery or surveillance as well as by the small size of some of the study cohorts.

### Long-term outcomes and risk of pancreatic cancer in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^1127NK7A]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study provides population estimates exploring the association between IPMNs and PCs. In the general population, IPMNs on CT were present in approximately 1 of 10 patients aged 50 years or older, of which more than 80% were branch-duct IPMNs without high-risk or worrisome features. Among IPMNs that were F-N at baseline, fewer than 10% developed worrisome or high-risk features on follow-up. PC development in IPMN was a rare event overall. Moreover, in F-N IPMNs, the incidence of PC was not significantly different from that among patients without IPMNs, a key finding that if validated in a larger population could challenge the relevance of extended surveillance in this population of patients with F-N IPMNs who make up most of the IPMN population. We further found that malignant IPMNs comprised approximately 10% of PC diagnoses and that IPMN-PC was earlier stage at diagnosis and associated with improved survival regardless of stage at presentation compared with non-IPMN PC. Results of this study provide insights regarding IPMN prevalence and the associated PC risk and may inform future population surveillance strategies and guidelines for patients with IPMNs.

### The 2012 international consensus guidelines of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas (fukuoka criteria) predict the malignant potential, even in actual clinical situations [^1157uT8K]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the present study was to validate the use of the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) (Fukuoka criteria) in patients without findings of obstructive jaundice and/or an enhanced solid component.

Methods

This retrospective study included patients who underwent pancreatectomy for IPMN between October 2002 and September 2016. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for malignancy were calculated for each feature of high-risk stigmata.

Results

Of the 135 patients who underwent surgery for IPMN, 50 (37.0%) had low/intermediate-grade dysplasia, 25 (18.5%) had high-grade dysplasia, and the remaining 60 (44.5%) had invasive carcinoma. A malignant potential was, thus, present in 63% of all resected cases. Considering an actual clinical situation, the predictors for malignant potential were assessed in 62 patients without findings of obstructive jaundice and/or an enhanced solid component. A multivariate analysis revealed that the Fukuoka criteria were the only independent factor for predicting the malignant potential (odds ratio, 5.69; P = 0.036).

Conclusions

The present study suggested that malignant potential can be accurately detected by faithfully keeping to the Fukuoka criteria. Using these criteria enables us to identify patients with malignant potential, even in the actual clinical situations.

### Risk of the watch-and-wait concept in surgical treatment of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm… [^115Q5mES]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective To provide an overview of the surgical management of IPMNs, focusing on the time of resection. Design, Setting, and Participants. All preoperative images were reviewed retrospectively in blinded fashion by 2 radiologists with expertise in pancreatic diseases. Each IPMN was clinically classified as MD, MT, or BD. The size and number of cysts larger than 10 mm were recorded. The main pancreatic duct was considered dilated when it measured 5 mm or more. Branch-duct IPMN was defined as 1 or more pancreatic cysts in communication with the duct system, in the absence of MPD dilation. An MPD diameter of 5 mm or more was a criterion for MD IPMN, independently of the presence of 1 or more BD cysts. Mixed-type IPMN was defined as 1 or more BD lesions with a MPD diameter of more than 5 mm.

The radiological signs considered to suggest IPMN progression toward malignant disease were enhancing or nonenhancing mural nodules, cyst wall thickness, and solid components, as well as an MPD dilation of 5 mm or more. Conversely, invasive cancer was diagnosed when atypia extended beyond the mucosal layer. Low-grade IPMN were diagnosed as adenoma and included in the too early group; IGD IPMN were diagnosed as borderline and together with in situ carcinoma, composed the timely group. Invasive cancer, including colloid-type carcinoma, PDAC arising from IPMN, and PDAC concomitant with IPMN, belonged to the too late group. Final histopathologic assessment revealed LGD-IPMN or adenoma in 438 of 1439 resections, which were consequently classified as too early. On the other hand, 497 of 1439 resected lesions turned out to be invasive PDAC and were thus classified as too late. The remaining 35.

1% of resections were classified as timely, since the lesions were diagnosed as either borderline IPMN or in situ carcinoma. In this study, almost one-third of patients underwent resection too late. Most of them were found to have radiological and clinical features suggestive of IPMN-associated malignant conditions. However, suspicious radiological features were absent in 12% of patients in the too late group and two-thirds of patients in the timely group.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: current state of the art and ongoing controversies [^1159gsTW]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

With the widespread use and advances in radiographic imaging, Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are identified with increasing frequency. Although many studies have addressed its biology and treatment, true understanding of its natural history continues to elude us. Its malignant potential places careproviders in a clinical dilemma of balancing the morbidity of pancreatectomy against the risk of malignant transformation while under continuous surveillance. Recently, there have been conflicting data published in the literature, generating more uncertainty in the field. In this article, we critically analyze the contrasting consensus guidelines from the International Association of Pancreatology and the American Gastroenterology Association, and address lingering questions and controversies. We also synthesize newly published data in the context of current standard of care, and provide a comprehensive review and recommendations for the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up strategy in the management of patients with Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms.

Guidelines for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN) Management

2015 American Gastroenterological Association Guideline on the Diagnosis and Management of Asymptomatic Neoplastic Pancreatic Cysts

These guidelines were established by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) for the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic PCNs (Table 1). The AGA guidelines only address asymptomatic cysts and do not evaluate the impact of symptoms on the management of these cysts. The AGA guidelines were established following a systematic evaluation of the relevant evidence on the management of these pancreatic cysts. An expert consensus was acquired on clinically relevant questions regarding diagnosis and management. The conclusions of the systematic reviews are reported in the AGA's technical reviewand were used by the AGA's Clinical Practice Guideline Committee as the basis for the formal guidelines. Specifically, the recommendations use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Notably, the committee graded all the evidence related to the management of pancreatic cysts to be very low in quality because most of the data were collected from case series. Thus, all their statements were considered conditional and dependent on each patient's situation.

### Validation of the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: more than 5 years of follow-up [^112mnbrN]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent guidelines suggest that imaging surveillance be conducted for 5 years for patients with at most one high-risk feature. If there were no significant changes, surveillance is stopped. We sought to validate this follow-up strategy.

Methods

In study 1, data were analysed for 392 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and at most one high-risk feature who were periodically followed up for more than 1 year with imaging tests. In study 2, data were analysed for 159 IPMN patients without worsening high-risk features after 5 years (stop surveillance group).

Results

In study 1, pancreatic cancer (PC) was identified in 12 patients (27.3%) in the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) indication group and none in the non-EUS-FNA indication group (P < 0.01). In the EUS-FNA indication group, 11 patients (25%) died, whereas 29 (8.3%) died in the non EUS-FNA indication group (P < 0.01). In study 2 (stop surveillance group), PC was identified in three patients (1.9%) at 84, 103 and 145 months.

Conclusions

PC risk and mortality for IPMNs not showing significant change for 5 years is likely to be low, and the non-EUS-FNA indication can provide reasonable decisions. However, three patients without worsening high-risk features for 5 years developed PC. The stop surveillance strategy should be reconsidered.

Key Points

- The AGA guidelines provide reasonable clinical decisions for the EUS-FNA indication.
- In stop surveillance group, PC was identified in 3 patients (1.9%).
- In stop surveillance group, 2 of 3 PC patients died from PC.
- Risk of pancreatic cancer in "stop surveillance" group is not negligible.

### Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: to operate or not to operate? [^1125Z9hb]. Gut (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs) of the pancreas are reported to be less aggressive than the main-duct type. Hence, less aggressive treatment has been proposed for the former.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness of a follow-up protocol for BD-IPMNs.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

An academic tertiary referral centre.

Patients

From 2000 to 2003, 109 patients with BD-IPMNs underwent trans-abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with secretin. Patients who presented malignancy-related parameters (size > 3.5 cm, nodules, thick walls, carbohydrate antigen 19.9 level > 25 U/l, recent-onset or worsened diabetes) and/or complained of symptoms were submitted to surgery (arm A). All asymptomatic patients without suspicion of malignancy were followed up according to a 6-month clinical-radiological protocol (arm B).

Main Outcome Measures

The effectiveness of conservative management of BD-IPMNs.

Results

20 (18.3%) patients underwent surgery (arm A); pathological diagnosis of BD-IPMNs was always confirmed. 89 (81.7%) patients were followed up for a median of 32 months (arm B); of these, 57 (64%) patients had multifocal disease. After a mean follow-up of 18.2 months, 5 (5.6%) patients showed an increase in lesion size and underwent surgery. The pathological diagnosis was branch-duct adenoma in three patients and borderline adenoma in two.

Conclusions

Surgery is indicated in < 20% of cases of BD-IPMNs, and, in the absence of malignancy-related parameters, careful non-operative management seems to be safe and effective in asymptomatic patients. Although observation for a longer time is needed to confirm these results, our findings support the guidelines recently recommended by the International Association of Pancreatology.

### Acute pancreatitis in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a single-center retrospective cohort study with systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EKWss]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The present study has several limitations, including the small sample size and data collected from only one center, which may include selection bias. The inherent restrictions of retrospective design also apply, including limiting the generalization of results to other populations and not allowing the measurement of certain factors or long-term follow-up. Protocol for the systematic review and meta-analysis was not pre-recorded on PROSPERO. Data on IPMN epithelial cell subtypes were missing for some patients. Lastly, the few studies in the meta-analysis may not provide sufficient power to draw reliable conclusions. The pooled analysis also included case-control studies with a lower evidence quality.

### Current management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^113c3Ze7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2026). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are a common entity with a prevalence in the general population that increases with age. Depending on the involvement of the main pancreatic duct, they can be divided into main-duct (MD), mixed-duct, and branch-duct (BD) variants. Most BD-IPMNs are low-risk and surveilled, while MD-IPMNs are generally resected. When necessary, a standard pancreatic resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended. The use of molecular profiling, intraoperative pancreatoscopy, and surveillance end points are discussed.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm surveillance leads to early diagnosis and better outcomes of concomitant cancer [^111RSWZn]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine whether long-term surveillance of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) leads to early diagnosis and better clinical outcomes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) developing concomitantly with IPMNs.

Summary Background Data

Long-term image-based surveillance is recommended for patients with low-risk IPMNs. However, it is unknown whether the surveillance can improve surgical and survival outcomes of patients with concomitant PDACs.

Methods

Using a prospective single-institutional cohort of 4,620 patients with pancreatic cysts including 3,638 IPMN patients, we identified 63 patients who developed concomitant PDAC during long-term surveillance. We compared overall survival (OS) of 46 cases with concomitant PDAC to that of 460 matched cases diagnosed with non-IPMN-associated PDAC at the same institution. Multivariable hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall mortality were computed using the Cox regression model with adjustment for potential confounders.

Results

Concomitant PDACs were identified at an earlier cancer stage compared to non-IPMN-associated PDACs with 67% and 38% cases identified at stage 2 or earlier, respectively (P < 0.001) and 57% and 21% cases with R0 resection, respectively (P < 0.001). Compared to non-IPMN-associated PDACs, concomitant PDACs were associated with longer OS (P = 0.034) with a multivariable hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.39–0.96). The 5-year survival rate of patients with concomitant PDAC was higher compared to patients with non-IPMN-associated PDAC (34% vs. 18%, respectively; P = 0.018).

Conclusions

The surveillance for patients with IPMNs was associated with early identification of concomitant PDACs and longer survival of patients diagnosed with this malignancy.

### Pancreatic cancer screening [^114f3PVv]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Accumulating data indicate that clinically available abdominal imaging tests such as EUS and MRI/MRCP can detect asymptomatic precursor benign (IPMN, PanIN) and invasive malignant pancreatic neoplasms, such as ductal adenocarcinoma, in individuals with an inherited predisposition. These asymptomatic FPCs detected have been more likely to be resectable, compared to symptomatic tumors. The most challenging part of screening high-risk individuals is the selection of individuals with high-grade precursor neoplasms for preventive treatment (ie, surgical resection before development of invasive cancer). Ongoing and future research should focus on formulating and validating a model for FPC risk and neoplastic progression using patient characteristics, imaging, and biomarkers. The comparative cost and effectiveness of various approaches for screening and surveillance of high-risk individuals also deserves study. For now, screening is best performed in high-risk individuals within the research protocols in academic centers with multidisciplinary teams with expertise in genetics, gastroenterology, radiology, surgery, and pathology.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^1166o2xi]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Between January 2008 and December 2013, 503 patients with a radiological or histological diagnosis of IPMN were discussed at the pancreatic multidisciplinary conference at Karolinska University Hospital. Of these, 51 patients (10.1%) went straight to surgery for resection of an IPMN that fulfilled the criteria for surgical treatment. Another 49 patients (9.7%) with a "surgical IPMN" did not undergo surgery because of poor fitness. Eight patients (1.6%) were diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic IPMN-associated cancer at the time of presentation and were referred for chemotherapy. The remaining 395 patients with a "non-surgical IPMN" were enrolled in a surveillance program. The current study is based on the latter patient group (Group 1) and the group of 49 patients with contraindications for surgery, who were also kept under surveillance (Group 2).

### Progression of unresected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas to cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111sjr4k]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

It is not clear how best to manage patients with low-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas because little is known about IPMN progression to cancer. We sought to determine the cumulative incidence of development of pancreatic cancer in persons with unresected IPMNs (particularly low-risk IPMNs).

Methods

We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases through November 30, 2016 for studies reporting the cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer in patients with unresected IPMNs or studies that provided data in sufficient detail for us to calculate cumulative incidence values. We categorized patient series as studies on low-risk IPMNs (lesions without main pancreatic duct involvement or mural nodules) or non-low-risk IPMNs. We calculated meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up by using the inverse variance method and random-effects model.

Results

Among 1514 articles screened, we identified 10 studies of low-risk IPMNs (n = 2411) and 9 studies of non-low-risk IPMNs (n = 825). In studies of low-risk IPMNs, the meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were 0.02% at 1 year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0%-0.23%; I² = 0.0%), 1.40% at 3 years (95% CI, 0.58%-2.48%; I² = 58.5%), 3.12% at 5 years (95% CI, 1.12%-5.90%; I² = 88.0%), and 7.77% at 10 years (95% CI, 4.09%-12.39%; I² = 79.8%). These values were much higher in studies of non-low-risk IPMNs; cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were 1.95% at 1 year (95% CI, 0.0%-5.99%; I² = 84.2%), 5.69% at 3 years (95% CI, 1.10%-12.77%; I² = 89.9%), 9.77% at 5 years (95% CI, 3.04%-19.27%; I² = 92.0%), and 24.68% at 10 years (95% CI, 14.87%-35.90%; I² = 74.3%). The pooled cumulative incidence steadily increased linearly as the follow-up duration increased.

Conclusions

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that low-risk IPMNs have almost 8% chance of progressing to pancreatic cancer within 10 years, and higher-risk IPMNs have almost 25% chance of progressing to cancer in 10 years; incidence values increase linearly with time. Continued long-term surveillance is therefore vital for patients with low-risk IPMNs.

### Are the current guidelines for the surgical management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas adequate? A multi-institutional study [^115WcWUq]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists regarding the management of patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). International consensus guidelines stratify patients into high-risk, worrisome, and low risk categories.

Study Design

The medical records of 7 institutions were reviewed for patients who underwent surgical management of IPMN between 2000 and 2015.

Results

There were 324 patients included in the analysis; 60.4% of patients had main-duct/mixed type, and 39.7% had branch-duct IPMN. The median cyst size was 2.65 cm, invasive cancer (IC) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) was present in 42% (n = 136); 68.9% of patients with high-risk, 40.0% of patients with worrisome, and 24.6% of patients with low risk features exhibited HGD/IC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only 1 of 3 high-risk features and 2 of 7 worrisome features predicted the presence of HGD/IC. Positive predictive values for HGD/ IC in patients with obstructive jaundice and lymphadenopathy were 0.83 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.91), respectively. In the absence of high-risk features, HGD/IC was still present in 57.4% of patients with 2 or more worrisome features. Regression analysis demonstrated that each additional worrisome factor present was additive in predicting HGD/IC in a linear fashion (odds ratio 1.39; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.80; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

These data demonstrate that the current consensus guidelines for surgical resection of IPMN may not adequately stratify and identify patients at risk for having HGD or invasive cancer. Patients with multiple worrisome features, in the absence of high-risk factors, should be considered for resection.

### Management of pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in an academic hospital (2005–2010): what follow-up for unoperated patients? [^115WExh9]. Pancreas (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are diagnosed frequently in asymptomatic patients. It is still not clear what follow-up is indicated for patients not undergoing surgical resection.

Methods

Review of all reports of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) from June 2005 to June 2010, identifying all patients diagnosed with IPMN; subsequent reconstruction of the initial therapeutic decision, indications for and adherence to scheduled follow-up, and IPMN evolution by morphology and by biology.

Results

Overall, 4943 MRCP reports were analyzed, identifying 234 patients with IPMN. Although 143 (61.1%) of these were comprised in Sendai criteria for resection, surgical resection was considered in only 42 (17.9%) patients. Of the remainder, 52 were not subjected to any control, 58 to a single short time check, 77 to MRCP-based regular annual follow-up, and 5 were treated for associated ductal adenocarcinoma. With a median follow-up of 39.5 months (range, 12–72), 37.6% of 125 patients in follow-up had a morphological evolution, but only 2.4% has developed a malignant IPMN. No deaths were recorded, directly related to IPMN, in all 187 conservatively managed patients.

Conclusions

In the analyzed series, fewer patients than expected underwent surgical resection, and only 67.2% undergo regular follow-up, but no more than 2.4% developed malignancy.

### Surveillance and outcomes of nonresected presumed branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a meta-analysis [^115Bsjpw]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines regarding the surveillance of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are controversial because of uncertain risk of malignancy, agnosticism regarding the use of endoscopic ultrasound, and their recommendation to stop surveillance after 5 years. We present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of malignancy and other end points and estimate the value of endoscopic ultrasound for surveillance.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE for studies with a cohort of patients with presumed branch-duct IPMN who initially were managed nonsurgically. Data regarding study characteristics, surveillance, and outcomes were extracted. Incidence rates of morphologic progression, malignancy, surgery, and death were calculated with a random effects model.

Results

Twenty-four studies with 3440 patients and 13,097 patient-years of follow-up were included. Rates of morphologic progression, surgery, malignancy, and death were 0.0379, 0.0250, 0.0098, and 0.0043 per patient-year, respectively. Endoscopic ultrasound was not associated with significantly different rates of these outcomes.

Conclusions

The risk of malignancy calculated in this study was low and in line with recent systematic reviews. Endoscopic ultrasound does not have marginal use in surveillance. Given the limitations of a systematic review of nonrandomized studies, further studies are needed to determine the optimal surveillance of branch-duct IPMNs.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^114LVFe9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

While surveillance of the majority of patients with IPMN is considered best practice, consensus regarding the duration of follow-up is lacking. This study assessed the survival rate and risk for progression of IPMN under surveillance.

Methods

All patients diagnosed with and surveyed for IPMN between January 2008 and December 2013 were identified and assigned to two groups: patients without indication for surgery (Group 1), and patients whose IPMN required surgery but were inoperable for general reasons (Group 2). Disease progression and survival data were compared between both groups.

Results

In total 503 patients were identified, of whom 444 (88.3%) were followed up. Group 1 included 395 patients, and Group 2 had 49. In Group 1, IPMN-specific 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 100, 100, and 94.2%, respectively. Four patients died of associated or concomitant pancreatic cancer, and 230 patients (58.2%) experienced disease progression. The 1-, 4-, 10-year cumulative risk for progression and for surgery was 11.2, 70.6, 97.5, and 2.9, 26.2, 72.1%, respectively. In Group 2, the 1-, 5-, 10-year IPMN-specific survival rate was 90.7, 74.8, and 74.8%, respectively.

Conclusions

This study confirmed the safety of surveillance for patients with IPMN who do not require surgery. However, the risk for disease progression and for surgery increases significantly over time. The study results support International and European guidelines not to discontinue IPMN surveillance and validate the European recommendation to intensify follow-up after 5 years. The fairly good prognosis of patients whose IPMN requires surgery but cannot undergo resection suggests a relatively indolent disease biology.

### Predictors of progression among low-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in a multicenter surveillance cohort [^111nvFi3]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Our aim was to identify baseline characteristics associated with disease progression and malignant transformation in low-risk suspected intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs).

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of prospectively maintained databases of pancreatic cysts at 3 international, academic institutions. Five hundred fifty-nine adult patients with clinically suspected asymptomatic IPMN evaluated by radiologic studies or endoscopic ultrasound between 2003 and 2013 without worrisome features and under surveillance for 12 months or longer were included. We evaluated the relationship of baseline demographics and cyst features to disease progression (size increase, development of worrisome features, or high-grade dysplasia/cancer).

Results

After a median of 44 months follow-up, 269 (48%) patients experienced cyst size increase, 68 (12%) developed worrisome features, and 11 (2%) developed high-grade dysplasia/cancer. In multivariable Cox-regression analysis, no baseline characteristics were associated with size increase. An initial cyst size of 2 cm or greater, multifocality, history of prostate cancer, and smoking were the strongest predictors of development of new worrisome features. Univariable analysis found male sex, diabetes, and recent weight loss associated with development of high-grade dysplasia/cancer.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates that low-risk suspected IPMNs carry a small but clinically relevant risk of disease progression and provides data on baseline characteristics that may help in risk stratification.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111k92mz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Currently, IPMNs represent the most promising opportunity for the prevention of pancreatic cancer through the establishment of surveillance programs and the treatment of precancerous lesions. However, surveillance of patients with IPMN incurs high healthcare costs and bears the risk for overtreatment or undertreatment of patients affected by the disease. For this reason, analysis of large series is needed to clarify the value and safety of patient surveillance.

The main purpose of this study was to analyze the survival rate and risk for progression in a large series of patients who are under surveillance for IPMN that according to current guidelines does not require surgical resection. The secondary purpose of the study was to analyze the safety of conservative management and the need for long-term follow-up of this patient group.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^1172dZxP]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts focuses on adult patients with cysts detected by radiology and uses the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework phrased in the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format. The scope pertains only to asymptomatic pancreatic neoplastic cysts, does not evaluate the impact of symptoms, and excludes solid papillary neoplasms, cystic degeneration of adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) without side branch involvement. Incidental identification is common with modern imaging, and subsequent evaluations and interventions can be invasive, expensive, and harmful. Management emphasizes identifying the small minority of cysts with early invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) so that appropriately timed surgical resection can reduce mortality, while acknowledging that surgery is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality. Common diagnostic tools — including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — have suboptimal sensitivities and specificities for identifying patients at highest risk. For each PICO statement, both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation are provided, with quality described on a 4-point scale from high to very low.

### Development of a blood-based extracellular vesicle classifier for detection of early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^111eE2ae]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer was the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States in 2022 with 49,830 deaths; an estimated 62,210 additional Americans were diagnosed during this time, and 75% of these patients will not survive beyond 12 months of the initial diagnosis. By 2030, pancreatic cancer is expected to surpass colorectal cancer in becoming the second leading cause of death. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent type, accounting for greater than 90% of all pancreatic cancer malignancies.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPTF) does not endorse screening for pancreatic cancer for the average-risk population but does recommend surveillance for patients at high risk due to inherited genetic syndromes (e.g. Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis) or with a familial history of pancreatic cancer. Other known PDAC risk factors that have not been supported for surveillance by the USPTF include new-onset diabetes (NOD) in adults over 50 years old, pathogenic germline mutations (ATM, BRCA1/2, CDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, STK11, TP53), obesity, age, and pancreatic cysts such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). For patients with a pathogenic germline mutation, current International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) guidelines indicate that these patients should undergo pancreatic surveillance only if there is also familial history of PDAC. Interestingly, 78–91% of the PDAC patients who carry these mutations do not have the family history and thus are not recommended for PDAC surveillance by most current professional society guidelines; nevertheless, these patients still possess an elevated disease risk.

### Meta-analysis of mortality in patients with high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms under observation [^116bcVp2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although consensus guidelines suggest that patients with high-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) should have surgery, a non-operative strategy is often selected in patients who are poor surgical candidates. The aim was to determine the risk of disease-related death from IPMN in patients with worrisome features or high-risk stigmata who were kept under observation.

Methods

A PubMed literature search was undertaken of articles published from August 1992 to June 2016 (updated October 2017). The methodology was developed from PRISMA and MOOSE checklists. Incidence proportions and rates of overall and IPMN-related deaths were calculated, with subgroup analyses for main-duct/mixed-type and branch-duct IPMNs. Quality of the studies, publication bias and heterogeneity were explored.

Results

Six studies reported data on overall mortality and eight described disease-specific mortality for 556 patients during follow-up ranging from 24·9 to 60·0months. Pooled rates of overall and IPMN-related mortality were 30·9 (95 per cent c.i. 19·6 to 45·1) and 11·6 (6·0 to 21·2) per cent respectively. The pooled incidence rate for overall mortality was substantially higher than that for IPMN-related mortality: 78 (95 per cent c.i. 44 to 111) and 23 (9 to 37) per 1000 patient-years respectively. The pooled incidence rate for disease-specific mortality was considerably lower for branch-duct than for main-duct or mixed-type IPMNs: 5 (0 to 10) and 32 (12 to 52) per 1000 patient-years respectively.

Conclusion

In patients unfit for surgery, IPMN-related mortality among patients with worrisome features and high-risk stigmata is low, and the risk of death from other causes much higher.

### Editorial: stopping pancreatic cyst surveillance? [^1149sYWx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with pancreatic cysts, especially presumed branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (BD-IPMNs), remains a challenge. BD-IPMNs carry a very low risk of malignancy and occur in predominantly older individuals who often die from causes not related to their pancreatic disease. The specific decision to stop surveillance of presumed low risk BD-IPMNs (those without either worrisome features (WF) or high risk stigmata (HRS)) is controversial, and needs to balance the real risk of malignancy or developing malignancy and IPMN-related mortality, with the patient's life expectancy, quality of life expectations, and mortality from non-pancreatic-related causes. With improved life expectancy, improved survival from non-pancreatic malignancies, rising health costs, and growing detection of ever smaller presumed BD-IPMNs, this issue is becoming ever more critical.

### Association between pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and extrapancreatic malignancies [^116KqjTd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The association between pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and extrapancreatic neoplasms (EPNs) is controversial. We performed a multicenter observational study to assess the incidence of EPNs after an IPMN diagnosis.

Methods

1340 patients with IPMNs were evaluated from 2000 through 2013 at 4 academic institutions in Europe for development of EPN. To estimate the actual incidence of EPN, we excluded patients with an EPN previous or synchronous to the IPMN, and patients who had been followed for less than 12 months, resulting in a study population of 816 patients. The incidence of EPN was compared with sex-specific, age-adjusted European cancer statistics; the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), and the 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence rates were calculated.

Results

A total of 290/1340 patients had a history of EPN (prevalence of 21.6%). In this subgroup of patients, the IPMN was discovered incidentally in 241. Among the 816 patients included in the incidence analysis, 50 developed an EPN after a median time of 46 months from study enrollment. The incidence of any EPN was not greater in patients with than without IPMN with a SIR of 1.48 (95% confidence interval, 0.94–2.22) in males and of 1.39 (95% CI 0.90–2.05) in females. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence rates for development of EPN in patients with IPMN were 7.9% and 16.6% in men, and 3.4% and 23.1% in women.

Conclusions

Patients with IPMN do not have a significantly higher incidence of EPNs than the general European population. It might not be necessary to screen patients with IPMN for EPN.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: multicentre study [^114CtJmJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the general population, the prevalence of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas is around 8 per cent. Most lesions are branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are usually detected incidentally. They have a more indolent behaviour than mixed-type or main-duct IPMNs. In 2006, international consensus guidelinesincorporated non-operative management for low-risk asymptomatic IPMNs less than 30 mm in size, with negative cytology, and without nodules and main pancreatic duct (MPD) dilatation. Updates of the guidelines in 2012and 2017introduced two categories of risk for malignancy, namely worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS), and surveillance was recommended for BD-IPMNs lacking these features. A similar approach was proposed in the 2018 European guidelines, and has been validated by different studies. Internationaland Europeanguidelines propose a different surveillance schedule for low-risk BD-IPMNs, but they are concordant in supporting lifetime observation unless patients become unfit for surgery. A more liberal approach has been suggested by the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines, which include discontinuation of surveillance after 5 years in the absence of significant changes. Although lifetime surveillance is costly, a general recommendation for discontinuation after 5 years may be inappropriate. Therefore, studying the progression of low-risk BD-IPMN is clinically relevant for a better definition of surveillance timing and possible discontinuation in selected patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMNs, to identify risk factors for the development of WF/HRS and pancreatic malignancies, and to eventually define a subgroup of patients at low or no risk of progression over time.

### Time to progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from low-to-high tumour stages [^1129D3FQ]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma usually present with advanced-stage cancers, have rapidly progressive disease and a poor prognosis. For this reason, pancreatic screening studies have evaluated the utility of using endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/MR cholangiopancreatography-based screening for individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer in multiple first-degree relatives to try and detect asymptomatic early pancreatic cancers and precancerous lesions. There is a high prevalence of precancerous lesions among patients who meet criteria for undergoing pancreatic screening. These lesions include intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) typically identified as pancreatic cysts, and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) generally identified only after pathological examination of the resected pancreas. Pancreatic screening protocols base their recommendations for surveillancelargely on the characteristics of the pancreatic cysts identified by screening and on the overall experience of following patients with incidentally-detected pancreatic cysts, despite evidence that most pancreatic cancers are thought to arise from undetected PanIN rather than from cysts, even in participants who are candidates for pancreatic screening. An important goal of pancreatic screening is to identify and treat any pancreatic cancers that develop while they are still small and confined to the pancreas and ideally to identify and treat carcinoma in situ (ie, lining pancreatic cystic neoplasms or as PanIN-3 lesions) before invasive pancreatic cancer develops. Pancreatic cysts with suspicious features can be imaged and sampled directly, but tests to detect PanIN-3 lesions such as by sampling secretin-stimulated pancreatic fluid are still investigational.

### Number of worrisome features and risk of malignancy in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^1173uqXX]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2017 revised International Association of Pancreatology guidelines for management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) describe worrisome features (WF) and high-risk stigmata (HRS), recommending resection in the latter and further work-up and close surveillance for patients with WF. The effect of multiple WF on the likelihood of malignancy has not been evaluated.

Study Design

Eight hundred ten patients who underwent pancreatic resection for IPMN in 2 tertiary referral centers were identified from prospective institutional databases. Patients were retrospectively categorized into subgroups according to the number of WF or HRS and presence of malignancy, defined as high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or invasive cancer on final pathology.

Results

Three hundred seventy-nine (47%) patients had HRS, 370 (46%) had 1 or more WF, and 61 patients (7%) had neither. Malignancy was present in 70% (n = 267) of patients with HRS and in 30% (n = 127) of those with WF. Only 3 of 61 patients without WF/HRS had malignancy, and all only in the form of HGD. The risk of malignancy increased in a stepwise fashion with the number of WF, to 22%, 34%, and 59% with 1, 2, and 3 WF, respectively (p = 0.001), and reached 100% in patients with 4 or more WF. Although the relative risks differed for particular WF, the areas under the curve were not statistically different.

Conclusion

We confirm that presence of HRS in IPMN is associated with a very high likelihood of malignancy. The presence of a single WF has a malignancy risk of 22%, and additional WF increase this risk significantly. When 3 or more WF are present, the risk is similar to that of HRS.

### Diminished immune surveillance during histologic progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms offers a therapeutic opportunity for cancer interception [^114v5TAD]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are well-recognized cystic precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Current standard-of-care guidelines for patients with pancreatic cyst recommend either surgical excision of the lesions or longitudinal passive surveillance using radiology and cyst fluid biomarkers. In this study, we interrogated alterations within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of IPMNs of varying histologic grades. Our findings demonstrate that diminished immune surveillance is a feature of high-grade IPMNs (HG-IPMN), and that such attenuation is also seen within the TIME of "progressor" low-grade IPMNs (IPMN) present within the vicinity of synchronous HG-IPMN. These findings provide a basis for initiating interception trials using vaccines or immune checkpoint inhibitors that can enhance or sustain immune surveillance within TIME of IPMN, and potentially block progression to invasive neoplasia.

Pancreatic cyst surveillance for presumed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) when size is less than 2 cm is structured by size: For " < 1 cm", perform "MRI* q2 years × 4 years", with "Stable size and appearance" leading to "Consider lengthening of interval imaging", while "Increase in cyst size" leads to "Consider shorter interval with MRI or EUS ± FNA within 6 months" followed by "MRI in 1 year and then return to original surveillance based on cyst size". For "1–2 cm", obtain "MRI* q1 years × 3 years" and, if "Stable size and appearance", proceed to "MRI q2 years × 4 years" and "If stable, consider lengthening of interval", whereas "Increase in cyst size" again leads to "Consider shorter interval with MRI or EUS ± FNA within 6 months". Surveillance notes specify "Surveillance should preferably be performed with same imaging modality in attempt to capture consistency in size measurements".

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: current understanding and future directions for stratification of malignancy risk [^111YcnWJ]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) has been increasing over the past decade, mainly owing to increased awareness and the increased use of cross-sectional imaging. The Sendai and Fukuoka consensus guidelines provide us with clinical management guidelines and algorithms; however, the clinical management of IPMNs continues to be challenging. Our incomplete understanding of the natural history of the disease, and the events and pathways that permit progression to adenocarcinoma, result in difficulties predicting which tumors are high risk and will progress to invasive disease. In this review, we summarize the current management guidelines and describe ongoing efforts to more clearly stratify IPMNs by risk of malignancy and identify IPMNs with malignant potential or ongoing malignant transformation.

Pancreatic cyst surveillance for presumed intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) when size is 2–3 cm or larger includes closer follow-up and multidisciplinary input: For "2–3 cm", use "MRI* or EUS q6–12 months for 3 years"; if "Stable size and appearance", continue with "MRI q1 years × 4 years" and "If stable, consider lengthening of interval", while "Increase in cyst size" directs to "Refer to multidisciplinary group and consider EUS ± FNA". For " > 3 cm", "Consider referral to multidisciplinary group and MRI* alternating with EUS q6 months × 3 years"; if "Stable size and appearance", continue with "MRI alternating with EUS q year × 4 years" and "If stable, consider lengthening of interval", while "Increase in cyst size" leads to "Refer to multidisciplinary group and consider EUS ± FNA".

### Surveillance of pancreatic branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm… [^114Cmofq]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eTable 1. Comparison Between Benign and Malignant Lesions in the Surgery Cohort Data Sharing Statement IPMN indicates intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Question What is the optimal surveillance interval of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas, and who would be a candidate for discontinuation of surveillance. Objective To determine the optimal surveillance protocol for IPMN and propose which patients may be exempted from surveillance. Design, Setting, and Participants. Results Of the 3656 patients with BD-IPMN in the analytic sample, 172 were confirmed to have malignant lesions through surgery. Conclusions These findings suggest that BD-IPMN surveillance may depend on the size of the cyst and morphologic changes at the initial 6-month follow-up.

For patients with small cysts with no morphologic changes during the initial 5-year surveillance period, surveillance may be discontinued for those unfit for surgery or who have a limited life expectancy of 10 years or less. Resection is recommended for main duct IPMN because of its high malignant potential. On the other hand, a watch-and-wait strategy may be offered to the majority of patients with branch duct IPMN without high-risk stigmata. 1 However, BD-IPMN requires continuous follow-up because of its reported annual malignant conversion rate of 1% to 3%. 2–6. Branch duct IPMN was diagnosed when typical features, including a pleomorphic shape, clubbed or finger-like appearance, and definite pancreatic ductal communication, were observed on imaging. 10 Most patients underwent CT and MRI during surveillance. Endoscopic ultrasonography was performed to evaluate suspicious mural nodules or cyst wall thickening for patients with WFs.

Although most cases of BD-IPMN are indolent and dormant, some cysts develop malignant features. The findings from this cohort study suggest that the surveillance protocol should be customized based on morphologic changes and malignant conversion according to cyst size. We recommend 1. 5-, 1-, and
0. 5-year surveillance intervals for surveillance of BD-IPMN cysts smaller than 20 mm, 20 to 30 mm, and 30 mm or larger, respectively, after an initial 6-month follow-up.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^115xyV34]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Comment

As reported in these studies, there is a non-zero risk of developing suspect features or a pancreatic cancer even after 5 years of surveillance. For that matter, there is a risk of developing pancreatic cancer in a remnant gland even after resection of an IPMN. Thus, one can consider IPMN as a field defect in the gland. Therefore, it is not possible to currently support the recommendation to discontinue surveillance in presumed BD-IPMNs that are stable for 5 years. Further research will be needed to provide suitable targets for surveillance discontinuation, although the data do support extending the time interval between scans once stability has been determined, and potentially focusing surveillance on certain age groups at diagnosis.

### The efficacy of pancreatic juice cytology with liquid-based cytology for evaluating malignancy in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^1177RQme]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The increased detection of pancreatic cysts due to improvements in imaging studies has led to a surge in interest in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Most IPMNs are benign, but some can progress to malignant IPMNs. However, it remains difficult to distinguish malignant IPMN from benign IPMN.

According to the international consensus guidelines for IPMN revised in 2017, high-risk stigmata (HRS) were considered a recommended indicator for resection, and worrisome features (WF) were considered a recommended indicator for further examinations. However, the rate of malignant IPMN in patients with HRS and WF were reported to be 49–57% and 16–27%, respectively. Although the presence of mural nodules (MN) on endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has been shown to be a good predictor of malignant branch duct IPMN (BD-IPMN), about 10% of malignant BD-IPMNs have been reported in patients without MN. As mentioned above, the diagnostic ability of the imaging studies for malignant IPMN is limited.

### Older age as a worrisome feature in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: a long-term surveillance study [^114AtmrQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aging has been implicated in the development of various cancer types. No study has specifically investigated age at intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) diagnosis in relation to the long-term risk of pancreatic carcinogenesis.

Methods

Within a prospective cohort of 4,104 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cysts, we identified 3,142 patients with IPMNs and examined an association of age at IPMN diagnosis with the incidence of pancreatic carcinoma. Using the multivariable competing-risks proportional hazards regression model, we estimated subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic carcinoma incidence according to age at IPMN diagnosis.

Results

During 22,187 person-years of follow-up, we documented 130 patients diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma (64 with IPMN-derived carcinoma and 66 with concomitant ductal adenocarcinoma). Older age at IPMN diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer incidence (Ptrend = 0.002). Compared with patients younger than 55 years, patients aged 55–64, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years had adjusted SHRs of 1.80 (95% CI, 0.75–4.32), 2.56 (95% CI, 1.10–5.98), and 3.31 (95% CI, 1.40–7.83), respectively. Patients aged 70 years and older had a numerically similar adjusted SHR compared with patients younger than 70 years with worrisome features defined by the international consensus guidelines (1.73 [95% CI, 1.01–2.97] and 1.66 [95% CI, 0.89–3.10], respectively).

Discussion

Older patients with IPMNs were at a higher risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma during surveillance. Surgically fit elderly patients may be good candidates for periodic surveillance aimed at a reduction of pancreatic cancer-related deaths.

Group 2: Patients Under Surveillance Due to General Contraindications for Surgery

Forty-nine patients with an IPMN that fulfilled the criteria for surgical resection according to the guidelines, but who were not fit for surgery or objected to surgery, were followed-up during the study period. Median patient age was 75.1 (range 50–93) years. Twenty-seven (55.1%) were males and 22 (44.9%) females. The median follow-up time was 775 (range 90–2190) days. The tumor features that represented a surgical indication were main-duct IPMN in 13 patients (26.5%), mixed-type IPMN in 27 (55.1%), branch-duct IPMN with a diameter > 40 mm in 6 (12.3%), and branch-duct IPMN with worrisome radiological features in 3 (6.1%). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rate for these patients was 74.8, 40.6, and 40.6%, respectively (Fig. 3 a). The IPMN-specific 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 90.7, 74.8, and 74.8%, respectively (Fig. 3 b).

### Adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111rFPZ7]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are mucin-producing epithelial neoplasms of the pancreas originating from the main pancreatic duct and/or one or more of its tributaries. The worldwide prevalence of incidentally detected IPMNs is rising secondary to the widespread utilisation of cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Historical concerns regarding the likely overestimated malignant potential of IPMNs meant indiscriminate resection. However, through experience and an improved understanding of the pathophysiology, IPMNs are now understood to be a spectrum of disease whereby low-risk selected patients perform well when a conservative surveillance approach is employed. Indeed, IPMNs are distributed into low-grade dysplasia, intermediate-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and invasive carcinoma. High-risk clinical and radiological stigmata considered as predictors of high-grade dysplasia or invasive carcinoma include obstructive jaundice, enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm, and main pancreatic duct (MPD) ≥ 10 mm, while worrisome features include cyst ≥ 3 cm, enhancing mural nodule < 5 mm, MPD 5–9 mm, abrupt change in MPD diameter with distal pancreas atrophy, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA 19–9, and cyst growth of > 5 mm/2 year.

Patients deemed to be at high risk would undergo pancreatic resection; however, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy is not standardised in patients with invasive IPMNs (IIPMNs) on post-operative histology. While the European Study Group on Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms recommended adjuvant chemotherapy for IIPMNs with or without lymph node involvement, the revised Fukuoka consensus guidelines made no recommendations on adjuvant chemotherapy. Currently, there remain no quantitative data to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and prior systematic review is limited to narrative synthesis of historic literature. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to review the survival outcome of adjuvant chemotherapy compared to surgery alone for the treatment of patients with IIPMNs who underwent pancreatic resection and to identify pathologic features that may predict survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

### The management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^111AuxN8]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are mucinous cystic tumors of the pancreas, which were first classified into a unified diagnosis by the World Health Organization in 1996. These lesions originate from the cells of the pancreatic ductal system and may grossly or microscopically involve the pancreatic ducts in a diffuse or multifocal fashion. As experience with IPMN increases, it is becoming more evident that this process presents as a spectrum of neoplasia with significant variation regarding the clinical and radiologic presentation, malignant potential, and disease-specific outcome. IPMN encompasses a spectrum of precursor lesions, from adenoma to intraductal carcinoma to invasive cancer, with molecular data supporting the premise that this dysplastic process has the potential to progress from low-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma. Controversy over the management of IPMN exists because of the difficulty in obtaining a preoperative histologic diagnosis, the broad spectrum of neoplasia, the lack of understanding as to the frequency and time to malignant progression. This article describes the radiologic and histopathologic classification system of IPMN; the biologic behavior of these lesions, and the diagnostic testing most commonly used, and discusses the current treatment controversies.

### Multiple small "imaging" branch-duct type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) in familial pancreatic cancer: indicator for concomitant high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia? [^117PbAMR]. Familial Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Most screening programs for familial pancreatic cancer are currently based on endoscopic ultrasonography and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cystic lesions, especially those suspicious for small intraductal pancreatic mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the branch ducts, can be visualized in up to 40% of individuals at risk, but their pathological importance in the setting of FPC is yet not well established. Individuals at risk from a prospective screening program for familial pancreatic cancer with small "imaging" IPMNs of the branch-duct type (BD-IPMN) who underwent pancreatic resection were analysed regarding clinico-pathological data and the locations of pancreatic lesions. Five of 125 individuals at risk who underwent screening had multiple small (size 2–10 mm) unicystic lesions and/or multicystic single lesions in the pancreatic body and tail suspicious for BD-IPMNs upon MRI imaging and decided to undergo surgical resection after interdisciplinary counselling, although none fulfilled the consensus criteria for IPMN resection. Histological examination revealed BD-IPMNs with low or moderate dysplasia of the gastric type in combination with multifocal PanIN2 and PanIN3 lesions in 4 individuals. The remaining patient had only tiny ductectasias in the pancreatic tail with multifocal PanIN 2 lesions in the entire gland and one PanIN3 lesion in the pancreatic head. Intriguingly, the location of the most dysplastic histological lesions (PanIN3) did not correspond to the preoperatively detected lesions and were not visible in preoperative imaging. In the setting of FPC, the presence of multiple small "imaging" BD-IPMNs may indicate the presence of high-grade PanIN lesions elsewhere in the pancreas.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111jk4r4]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

A limitation of our study is the relatively small number of patients with a long (more than 5 years) follow-up. As a consequence, the study results do not represent strong evidence on which recommendations for follow-up after 10 years could be based. Nonetheless, the results of this study support long-term follow-up rather than surveillance limited to 5 years. Although comparison of existing guidelines is beyond the scope of this study, it is important to note that a significant number of patients whose IPMN progressed during the study period to the point of requiring surgery would not have been identified if follow-up had been performed according to the ASA guidelines. The related problems of societal costs associated with this strategy require further investigation, especially considering the high prevalence of IPMN in the general population. New biomarkers and/or less expensive surveillance modalities will probably partially overcome this problem in the near future. Finally, our study confirmed previous reports that patients with an IPMN that formally requires surgery but who cannot be operated because of general contraindications, have a relatively high IPMN-specific survival. This observation opens a new field of potential investigation, exploring for example whether these patients would benefit from treatment with ablative techniques or similar modalities for symptomatic palliation.

### A tug-of-war in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms management: comparison between 2017 international and 2018 European guidelines [^115hNFHv]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

2017 International and 2018 European guidelines are the most recent guidelines for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms management.

Aim

to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these guidelines in identifying malignant IPMN.

Methods

data from resected patients with IPMN were collected in two referral centers. Features of risk associated to cancerous degeneration described in International and European guidelines were retrospectively applied. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value in detecting malignant disease were calculated.

Results

the study includes 627 resected patients. European guidelines suggest resection in any patient with at least one feature of moderate-risk. International guidelines suggest that patients with moderate-risk features undergo endoscopic ultrasound before surgery. European guidelines had a higher sensitivity (99.2% vs. 83%) but a lower positive predictive value (59.5% vs. 65.8%) and Specificity (2% vs. 37.5%). European guidelines detected almost all malignancies, but 40% of resected patients had low-grade dysplasia. 297 patients underwent endoscopic ultrasound before surgery. 31/116 (26.7%) tumors radiologically classified as "worrisome features" were reclassified as "high-risk stigmata" by endoscopic ultrasound and 24/31 were malignant IPMN.

Conclusions

European and International guidelines have a relatively low diagnostic accuracy, being European guidelines more aggressive. Endoscopic ultrasound can improve guidelines accuracy in patients with moderate-risk features.

### Multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas [^114eKZvM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have gained recognition in recent years as premalignant precursors to pancreatic cancer that enable early detection and often are found incidentally at imaging. Accurate diagnosis and optimal, finely tuned management of these lesions are important and require collaboration across various disciplines, including radiology, endoscopy, surgery, and pathology. Several imaging modalities can visualize these lesions adequately, each with specific advantages and disadvantages. Multidetector computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are generally the first-line imaging modalities; endoscopic imaging such as endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are beneficial when the former 2 modalities are equivocal. Surgical candidates generally include patients with main duct lesions or branch duct lesions greater than 3 cm or any possessing a solid component. A management algorithm indicating when surgery should be pursued is proposed. For nonsurgical and postsurgical patients, follow-up management is important to monitor growth and recurrence, and risks from repeated radiation exposure should be taken into account. Furthermore, issues of multifocality and increased predisposition of the pancreas to ductal adenocarcinoma must be addressed at follow-up evaluation. A follow-up management algorithm also is proposed in this review.

2017 International Association of Pancreatology (IAP): Revisions of International Consensus Fukuoka Guidelines for the Management of IPMNs of the Pancreas

The original 'Sendai' guidelines on the management of IPMNs and MCNs were created by the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) at the 11th Congress of the IAP in Sendai, Japan, and published in 2006. These were consensus guidelines related to the classification, preoperative evaluation, surgical indications, resection technique, histology, and surveillance of IPMNs and MCNs. Subsequently, these recommendations were updated in 2012 in Fukuoka, Japan, and again in 2017. The latest version of the IAP guidelines distinguished operative criteria for branch duct IPMNs (BD-IPMNs), as it built upon the classifications of 'worrisome features' and 'high-risk features'. Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) were excluded from this 2017 revision.

In this updated version of the Fukuoka guidelines, as they are called, the framework of recommendations follows that of prior iterations of the IAP guidelines. Namely, the expert consensus provides recommendations on the classification, preoperative evaluation, surgical indications, methods of resection and other treatments, histological aspects, and surveillance of IPMNs.

2018 European Study Group on Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas: European Evidence-Based Guidelines on Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms

These guidelines were established as a joint initiative of several European scientific societies for the management of PCNs. This rendition of the European guidelines replaced the prior European consensus statement guidelines on PCN published in 2013.

A methodology committee consisting of gastroenterologists, surgeons, radiologists, oncologists, endoscopists, and basic scientists was compiled. Subsequently, systematic reviews were performed by experts in their respective topic areas to encompass all the available evidence regarding predetermined clinical questions. This literature search only included randomized trials, observational cohort studies with more than 20 patients, and systematic reviews on PCN. Following this systematic review of the literature, recommendations were established by expert consensus and supplemented with ratings for the quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. Statements regarding the strength of the recommendation were added. To finalize the guidelines, these recommendations were reviewed at a plenary meeting of the European Study Group on Cystic Tumors of the Pancreas, and at least 75% consensus was required to establish the recommendation.

Guideline Comparisons for Surveillance and Operative Intervention

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^113fRG8n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-operative Surveillance

For non-operative surveillance, all three sets of guidelines state that MRI is the preferred modality over CT because MRI does not expose patients to radiation and is better able to confirm the structural relationship between the cyst and pancreatic duct.

At baseline, the revised Fukuoka guidelines suggest that BD-IPMN patients without high-risk stigmata or worrisome features (> 3 cm, enhancing mural nodularity or cyst wall, main duct dilation, stricture, lymphadenopathy, elevated CA19–9, significant growth rate, jaundice, or symptoms) undergo short interval (3–6 months) pancreatic MRI/MRCP or CT to confirm stability. However, unlike the European and AGA guidelines, the revised Fukuoka guidelines provide recommendations on subsequent surveillance according to cyst size, as summarized in Table 1.

For patients without an indication for immediate resection, the European guidelines recommend a 6-month follow-up the first year, with subsequent annual follow-ups as long as no risk factors are present that would prompt surgery. In addition, in patients with only relative indications for resection, older patients, and those with severe comorbidity, continual 6-month follow-up is suggested.

In cases where there are not indications for resection, the AGA guidelines recommend that patients with cysts < 3 cm without a solid component or dilated pancreatic duct receive MRI surveillance in 1 year, followed by every 2 years, for a total period of 5 years if there are no changes in size or characteristics. The recommendation of the AGA guidelines to stop surveillance after 5 years is different from the European and revised Fukuoka guidelines, which suggest indefinite surveillance of IPMNs as long as the patient is fit for surgery because the risk of IPMN progression increases over time.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^116nMNyx]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

This study was based on a prospectively collected cohort of patients who were diagnosed with IPMN at the Pancreas Unit at Karolinska University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2013. Also included were patients who were surveyed during the study period but whose diagnosis of IPMN had been established before January 2008. An absolute inclusion criterion for the study cohort was a diagnosis of IPMN based on cytological confirmation and/or radiological demonstration of a cystic lesion that communicated with the main pancreatic duct.

Data were retrospectively analyzed after approval from the local Ethical Committee was obtained. All patients were managed according to the Sendai criteria(until October 2011) and the European guidelines criteria(from November 2011). Excluded from the series were patients with an IPMN that fulfilled the criteria for resection and underwent surgery directly after discussion at the multidisciplinary conference. Further excluded were patients who were diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic IPMN-associated cancer. The remaining patients were assigned to two groups. Patients who were enrolled in the surveillance program in accordance with the Sendai criteria (until October 2011) or the European guidelines (from November 2011) formed Group 1. Group 2 included patients who were not eligible for surgery for general reasons and therefore remained under follow-up, although their IPMN fulfilled indications for surgery.

Indications for Surgery

Until November 2011, we used the indications for surgery in patients with IPMN as suggested by the Sendai criteria. When the European guidelines were published in November 2011, the recommendations of these guidelines were adopted by our hospital. In patients with BD-IPMN, surgery was indicated in case of symptomatic disease (jaundice, acute pancreatitis related to IPMNs) and/or in case one or multiple of the following features were detected: maximum cyst diameter ≥ 4 cm, mural nodules, rapid increase in cyst size, elevated serum levels of Ca 19–9. Patients with a main pancreatic duct > 6 mm were considered being affected by MD-IPMN and represented a surgical indication.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on screening for pancreatic cancer in individuals with genetic susceptibility: methodology and review of evidence [^115viCSo]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2022). High credibility.

Screening targets and surgical yield categorization — Panel members agreed that resectable or borderline-resectable pancreatic cancers were potentially curable and therefore appropriate targets for screening, noting that previous guidelines had considered only stage 1 pancreatic cancer to be the primary target for screening. The panel stated that their present definition of resectable or borderline-resectable pancreatic cancer (T1–3 and/or N0–2) may underestimate the positive impact of screening because some patients with even locally unresectable disease like T4 cancers may be downstaged with chemoradiation therapy to allow for surgical resection, and that surgical treatment may also be beneficial for selected patients with oligometastatic cancers. The panel questioned whether resections for precursors such as low-grade IPMN should be categorized as a harm of screening, while some panelists stated that in selected young patients, given their long life expectancy, resection of even low-grade IPMNs may be appropriate to prevent malignant transformation in the future. The panel suggested an alternative approach to categorizing surgery based on surgical pathology findings: high-yield surgery; cancer, high-grade IPMN, or high-grade PanIN; intermediate-yield surgery: precancerous precursors like IPMN or PanIN lesions other than high-grade lesions; and low-yield surgery: non-neoplastic lesions like serous cystadenoma or pseudocysts, and also recommended that harms of screening should include failure of screening, recognizing that this was not reported in most studies. The panel noted that a significant number of low-yield surgeries were performed for pancreatic cysts and suggested that the low accuracy of preoperative tests in distinguishing between malignant and benign pancreatic cysts may explain several low-yield surgeries, and that in previous years even small branch-duct IPMNs were believed to have significant malignant potential in high-risk individuals, and surgery for such patients was recommended.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^114wMPXZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst management — patients who should have no further evaluation include those for whom Patients who are not medically fit for surgery should not undergo further evaluation of incidentally found pancreatic cysts, irrespective of cyst size (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) and asymptomatic cysts diagnosed as pseudocysts on initial imaging and clinical history or as serous cystadenomas do not require treatment or further evaluation (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Supporting risk data in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) cohorts show that among 725 patients 55% underwent resection and 45% underwent surveillance; after a median follow-up of 5 years, 24% of the patients had died and 78% of the deaths were not related to IPMNs, with the chance of a non-IPMN-related death within 3 years of diagnosis 11-fold higher for patients with a CACI of 7 or more and the median survival time for patients with a CACI score of ≥ 7 43 months. An additional series of 793 patients with IPMN reported that during a median follow-up of 50 months, 15% died, with causes of death pancreatic cancer in 26%, extrapancreatic cancer in 38%, other diseases in 32%, and unknown in 3.4%.

### Survival analysis and risk for progression of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia of the pancreas (IPMN) under surveillance: a single-institution experience [^111RBbVg]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study represents one of the largest, single-institution analysis of the results of a surveillance program for patients with IPMN, who were managed according to current guidelines. Our study was one of the few to report on the outcome of patients whose IPMN required resection but who could not undergo surgery due to general contraindications. The study results support the recommendations of current guidelines by demonstrating that the majority of patients with branch-duct IPMN (78.5% in this study) can be managed safely with a conservative approach. The mortality rate due to the development of IPMN-associated cancer or concomitant pancreatic cancer separate from the IPMN is 1% in the cohort of patients who were under surveillance as recommended by the guidelines. This does not exceed the mortality rate associated with pancreatic surgery, even in the most experienced centers. Interestingly, the cumulative risk for IPMN progression increased over time and was 70% at 5 years and 97.5% at 10 years from the time of detection of the IPMN. Even the cumulative risk for progression to an IPMN that required surgery increased continuously and reached 26% at 5 years and 72.1% at 10 years of follow-up. Interestingly, the percentage of patients with an IPMN that developed features requiring surgery increased significantly also after 5 years of follow-up. The median time from first diagnosis of an IPMN (not requiring resection) to surgery was 48 months. The final histology of IPMNs that progressed and required surgery confirmed that the large majority of these lesions (85.4%) represented a true surgical indication, either with respect to the IPMN type (main-duct or mixed-type) or the grade of dysplasia (high-grade dysplasia to invasive carcinoma). This indicates that the detection of changes in cyst characteristics or in patient symptoms is indeed more predictive than a simple "one shot" evaluation at the time of first diagnosis. The observations in this study demonstrate that progression of IPMNs that do not fulfill criteria for surgery to lesions that require resection can occur even after 5 years or more following diagnosis. These observations validate and support the recommendations of the European and International guidelines regarding the necessity of a life-long follow-up of these patients. Moreover, the findings of the current study do not support the recent statement from the American Gastroenterological Association (ASA), which suggests that surveillance does not need to be continued for cysts without significant change after 5 years of follow-up. Considering that both the risk for progression and the risk for surgery gradually increase over time, our results support also the recommended strategy of a low frequency of control investigations in the initial years of the screening program, followed by an intensified protocol after 5 years. The results of this study further show that radiological prominence of the main pancreatic duct (diameter ≥ 6 mm) is associated with an increased risk for progression. This observation confirms the importance and prognostic significance of even mild pancreatic duct dilatation, as recently reported by Hackert et al. and stated by the European guidelines. Furthermore, the current analysis shows that localization of an IPMN in the pancreatic head also is associated with an increased risk for progression. This finding seems to confirm previous observations by Ammori et al.

### Magnetic resonance imaging short protocols for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) surveillance: the time has come [^116RvL1G]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

To analyze the diagnostic performance of three short magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols for the follow-up of pancratic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN).

Methods

Follow-up MRI examinations of 287 patients with IPMN performed in two centers were retrospectively retrieved. Four MRI protocols were identified as follows: T1-weighted (T1w), T2-weighted (T2w), and MRCP sequences (protocol 1); T1w, T2w, MRCP, and diffusion-weighted (DWI) sequences (protocol 2); T1w, T2w, MRCP, and post-contrast T1w-sequences (protocol 3); and a comprehensive protocol including all previous sequences (protocol 4). Three radiologists with different experience in abdominal imaging expressed their opinion upon the optimal patient's management upon the evaluation of each protocol. Intra-and inter-observer agreement and concordance with the clinical decision expressed by a pancreatic surgeon were calculated with Cohen's kappa test.

Results

223 patients were included (66 ± 10 years; 92 men, 131 women). 143 patients had branch-duct-IPMNs, 25 main-duct-IPMNs and 55 mixed-type-IPMNs. 79 patients underwent surgery, resulting in 52 high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and 27 low-grade dysplasia (LGD). Concordance for the expert reader between protocols 1, 2 and 3 and the actual clinical decision were 0.63, 0.72, and 0.74 respectively (95% CI, 0.53–0.73, 0.63–0.81, and 0.65–0.83). Inter-observer agreement between reader 1 and reader 2, reader 1 and reader 3, and reader 2 and reader 3 were: 0.71, 0.50, and 0.75 for protocol 1 (95% CI, 0.63–0.81, 0.40–0.60, and 0.66–0.84);0.68, 0.54, and 0.84 for protocol 2 (95% CI, 0.59–0.77, 0.44–0.64, and 0.76–0.91); and 0.77, 0.65, and 0.86 for protocol 3 (95% CI, 0.69–0.86, 0.55–0.74, and 0.80–0.93).

Conclusions

Short MRI protocol is suitable for IPMN surveillance.

### Cytology from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the evaluation of invasive pancreatic head intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm: a necessity? [^113Nux5b]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract 266 Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brushing/fluid sampling has historically been the standard to establish invasive transformation of pancreatic head intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. More recently, endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration has been employed for this purpose. We hypothesized that for patients with invasive IPMN, in the era of EUS FNA, there is no additional benefit of ERCP brushing/fluid sampling. Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients who underwent surgical resection for IPMN at a single academic center was performed. Patients with invasive pancreatic head IPMN on surgical pathology were included. Cytopathology was considered positive if it showed adenocarcinoma or markedly atypical cells. Results: Of the 74 patients with invasive IPMN, 55 had a pancreatic head neoplasm.

Preoperatively, 4 patients had neither EUS nor ERCP, 27 had only 1 endoscopic study, and 24 had both EUS and ERCP. In 11 patients with EUS, 8 had positive FNA. In 16 patients with ERCP, 5 had positive cytology resulting in 31% sensitivity. Further analysis revealed 29% and 33% sensitivity for brushing and fluid sampling, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with invasive pancreatic head IPMN, sensitivity of ERCP cytology for cancer detection was poor, making an impact on diagnosis in only 2/55 patients. EUS FNA was performed in 75% patients regardless of ERCP cytology results. Aside from the therapeutic impact of ERCP, its cytological role is limited, resulting in unnecessary and potentially avoidable cost.

### Diagnosis and management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia [^112fHYJz]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) encompasses a spectrum of neoplastic change in the epithelial lining of the pancreatic duct. As such, it is difficult to predict the presence of malignancy, and pancreatic resection is established as the only effective treatment for IPMN. There is controversy about the natural history, evaluation, surgical management and surveillance of IPMN; as IPMN is being increasingly recognized, this controversy is being brought to the forefront of clinical practice. This review presents pooled surgical data, future directions and a proposed algorithm for the management of patients with IPMN.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and pancreatic cancer: opportunity knocks twice [^116BLZWn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cystic lesions are widely recognized as harbingers of pancreatic cancer. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is the most common type of cystic lesion, offering promising avenues for early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Although IPMN has a well-established malignant potential, the wide variation in cancer risk necessitates prolonged surveillance for most patients. There is an unmet need to optimize surveillance strategies for patients with IPMNs to address the rising global mortality associated with pancreatic cancer and to balance early cancer detection against healthcare resource allocation. While published guidelines outline common risk factors for carcinoma derived from IPMN, the resource-intensive nature of surveillance underscores the need for more granular management strategies-a need not yet reflected in current recommendations. Moreover, it is important to appreciate that patients with IPMNs also face an elevated risk of developing pancreatic carcinoma arising concomitantly with IPMN. This type of carcinoma presents unique challenges for surveillance but also offers novel opportunities for the timely identification of incident pancreatic cancer. Recent advances in diagnostic modalities, including EUS-guided biomarker analysis and artificial intelligence-based image analysis, hold promise for improving risk stratification and carcinoma diagnosis. This review highlights current evidence and future perspectives on the clinical management of patients with IPMNs, with a particular focus on the dual opportunities for surveillance. Optimizing strategies for the early detection of both carcinoma derived from IPMN and carcinoma concomitant with IPMN has the potential to meaningfully reduce the burden of pancreatic cancer.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms: have IAP consensus guidelines changed our approach? results from a multi-institutional study [^114Kb6Ex]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the influence of consensus guidelines on the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and the subsequent changes in pathologic outcomes.

Background

Over time, multiple guidelines have been developed to identify high-risk IPMN. We hypothesized that the development and implementation of guidelines should have increased the percentage of resected IPMN with high-risk disease.

Methods

Memorial Sloan-Kettering (MSK), Johns Hopkins (JH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) databases were queried for resected IPMN (2000–2015). Patients were categorized into main-duct (MD-IPMN) versus branch-duct (BD-IPMN). Guideline-specific radiographic/endoscopic features were recorded. High-risk disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma. Fisher's exact test was used to detect differences between institutions. Logistic regression evaluated differences between time-points [preguidelines (pre-GL, before 2006), Sendai (SCG, 2006–2012), Fukuoka (FCG, after 2012)].

Results

The study included 1210 patients. The percentage of BD-IPMN with ≥ 1 high-risk radiographic feature differed between centers (MSK 69%, JH 60%, MGH 45%; P < 0.001). In MD-IPMN cohort, the presence of radiographic features such as solid component and main pancreatic duct diameter ≥ 10mm also differed (solid component: MSK 38%, JH 30%, MGH 18%; P < 0.001; duct ≥ 10mm: MSK 49%, JH 32%, MGH 44%; P < 0.001). The percentage of high-risk disease on pathology, however, was similar between institutions (BD-IPMN: P = 0.36, MD-IPMN: P = 0.48). During the study period, the percentage of BD-IPMN resected with ≥ 1 high-risk feature increased (52% pre-GL vs 67% FCG; P = 0.005), whereas the percentage of high-risk disease decreased (pre-GL vs FCG: 30% vs 20%). For MD-IPMN, there was not a clear trend towards guideline adherence, and the rate of high-risk disease was similar over the time (pre-GL vs FCG: 69% vs 67%; P = 0.63).

Conclusion

Surgical management of IPMN based on radiographic criteria is variable between institutions, with similar percentages of high-risk disease. Over the 15-year study period, the rate of BD-IPMN resected with high-risk radiographic features increased; however, the rate of high-risk disease decreased. Better predictors are needed.

### European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms [^112RxEmR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Table 2
Risk of high-grade dysplasia or malignancy according to dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in IPMN

Follow-up of BD-IPMN is required as progression of disease is expected in about 10–15% of patients during 3–5 years of follow-up. Surveillance should also include the entire pancreatic gland because of an increased risk of new-onset cancer. In patients with MD-IPMN and those with mixed-type (MT)-IPMN several factors may predict progression during surveillance (eg, diffuse MPD dilatation, serum CA 19–9, serum alkaline phosphatase, and absence of extrapancreatic cysts).

4.2 What are the clinical implications of the presence of potential risk factors, including morphological features, with regard to determining follow-up investigations, and the decision to proceed with surgical resection

For patients with an IPMN without an indication for operative intervention, routine follow-up is recommended. A 6-month follow-up in the first year, and yearly follow-up thereafter is adequate when no risk factors are present that establish an indication for surgery. Changes in clinical symptoms should trigger investigations (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

For patients with relative indication for surgery (see statement 4.12), the 'elderly', and those affected by severe comorbidity, a 6-month follow-up is recommended. (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

In young individuals, the risk of malignancy and surgery has to be balanced against the burden of lifelong follow-up. However, after partial pancreatectomy for IPMN lifelong follow-up is still indicated. Resection therefore does not eliminate the need for regular follow-up screening.

4.3 Is there a certain size cut-off point for resecting an IPMN regardless of the absence of clinical symptoms or (other) risk factors? Is age of the patient a co-factor that should be analysed to define better management strategy?

Patients with IPMNs > 40 mm have an increased risk of harbouring malignancy (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

Several studies including both surgically resected or observed IPMN have reported an increased risk of malignancy ranging from 12% to 47% in cases of a cyst ≥ 30 mm. In some of these series, the risk of malignancy produced by cyst size was stratified by the presence of other features for malignancy, indicating that cyst size alone is not an appropriate indication for surgery since the risk of malignancy is actual but low. If multiple risk factors are present the sensitivity to detect malignancy increases.

Indications for Surgery

The indications for surgery in these guidelines are listed in detail in Table 1. For main duct IPMN (MD-IPMN), the recommendation from the IAP guidelines is surgical resection for all surgical candidates with main pancreatic duct diameter > 10 mm, jaundice, or mural nodules; however, the European guidelines recommend that all patients with MD-IPMN should undergo resection if they are fit for surgery. Both the European and IAP guidelines describe the value of frozen section biopsies to determine the extent of resection. In both guidelines, additional resection is warranted to obtain a negative margin if invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia is found at the initial resection margin, whereas further resection is not necessary if low-grade dysplasia is discovered at the margin.

From the AGA guidelines, the general indications for surgery for asymptomatic pancreatic cysts include both a solid component and a dilated pancreatic duct and/or concerning features on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA). The concerning features on EUS/FNA include solid component, dilated duct, or positive cytology. Because the presence of these concerning features increases the risk for malignancy, surgery is recommended for these patients as it would reduce the risk of mortality from carcinoma. In addition, AGA guidelines suggest that surgical candidates be referred to centers that have demonstrated expertise in pancreas surgery in order to decrease immediate postoperative mortality and optimize long-term survival.

For BD-IPMN, a generally conservative management strategy is suggested in the IAP guidelines for patients without features that predict invasive carcinoma or high-grade dysplasia. The IAP guidelines also describe the absolute indications for resection of BD-IPMNs, which are positive cytology for high-grade dysplasia and the presence of mural nodules ≥ 5 mm. Notably, cyst size alone is not considered an appropriate parameter to indicate surgery; however, cysts > 2 cm in patients < 65 years of age are considered as candidates for resection given the lifelong cumulative risk of high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. The European guidelines share the same absolute indications as the IAP guidelines in addition to the presence of jaundice and solid mass. Relative indications for surgery listed in the European guidelines prompt consideration of surgery, while the equivalent worrisome features in the IAP guidelines require EUS to be performed, and only to consider surgery if specific features are present (Table 1).

### Pancreatic cysts suspected to be branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm without concerning features have low risk for development of pancreatic cancer [^111Msu52]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is usually discovered at advanced stage and there are no screening or surveillance strategies proven to reduce risk. Pancreatic cysts have been targeted for intervention since mucin-producing cysts are associated with a risk of progression to adenocarcinoma over time. Though pancreatic cysts are easily identified on cross-sectional imaging, most types pose no risk of malignant degeneration. With trending use and improvements in imaging, incidental pancreatic cysts have been increasingly detected, occurring in 2.4–14.4% of the general population. The minority of these cysts are easily and accurately distinguished using clinical and radiographic features such as main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (MD-IPMN) and high-risk (≥ 3 cm in size) mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) perform poorly in discerning cyst type for the majority of cysts, with accuracy of diagnosis < 50%. Many are presumably neoplastic cysts such as branch duct (BD)-IPMN or small MCN whose natural history and risk for progression to adenocarcinoma are poorly understood. Resection is reserved for symptomatic or probable malignant cysts with features as suggested per Fukuoka criteria and the 2015 AGA guidelines on diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts. Surgical resection of pancreatic cysts carries a morbidity of 35% and mortality of 1%. Thus, non-operative management in most cases is reasonable as transformation of pancreatic cysts into adenocarcinoma appears to be a rare event (33.2 events per 100,000). The challenge is discerning BD-IPMN with highest malignant potential that warrant operative management from those that can be safely entered into a surveillance program, thereby minimizing risks to this patient population.

### Can long-term follow-up strategies be determined using a nomogram-based prediction model of malignancy among intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas? [^11547X2h]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study investigated whether a risk assessment nomogram can predict the malignant potential of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and provide valuable information for the follow-up and counseling strategies of such patients.

Methods

We studied 126 of 589 patients with IPMN who were followed up for at least 36 months with annual endoscopic ultrasonography. We analyzed scores derived from our nomogram, incorporating the parameters of sex, lesion type, mural nodule height, and pancreatic juice cytology determined at the initial IPMN evaluation.

Results

The rate of malignant IPMNs was 5.5% (7/126). The initial average nomogram score was 19.8 (range, 0–55), and the final follow-up average was 23.8 (range, 0–109). When a cutoff score was set at 35 points, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the nomogram to assess malignancy risk were 87.5%, 96.6%, and 96%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of malignant IPMN prediction during follow-up was 0.865.

Conclusions

The ability of the nomogram to predict malignancy in patients with IPMN was validated. Our findings can suggest that a follow-up for patients at high and low risk for cancer progression could be scheduled every 3 to 6 and 12 months, respectively.

### Aspects and outcomes of surveillance for individuals at high-risk of pancreatic cancer [^115P4UGq]. Familial Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)

IPMNs are macroscopic lesions that develop within the pancreatic ductal system. These lesions are characterized by their cystic nature, mucin secretion and are less common than PanINs. Studies on HRIs indicate that cystic lesions, particularly branch-duct (BD) type IPMN, are the most commonly diagnosed abnormalities during pancreatic cancer surveillance. This occurrence is not unusual, considering the high prevalence of IPMNs, which can reach up to 11.3–25% among the general population aged ≥ 55 years and increases with age. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that among HRIs, the cumulative incidence of IPMNs is even higher, exceeding 46%. Like PanINs, IPMNs are recognized as precancerous lesions and only a minority progress into PDAC. The ones that do progress, advance from low-grade IPMN to PDAC in approximately 6 years. The rate of progression is associated to the location of the lesion. Based on their location, IPMNs can be categorized into three groups: main duct (MD), branch duct (BD), and mixed type (MT) involving both locations. Individuals with MD and MT-IPMNs have a relative or absolute indication for surgery in the presence of specific risk factors, as outlined in the European evidence-based guidelines.

Also, BD-IPMN do not immediately warrant surgery according to guidelines due to their lower malignant potential. Surgical indications for BD-IPMNs include the presence of jaundice or high-risk features, such as dilatation of the main pancreatic duct or enhancing mural nodules. Notably, a study revealed that there is an elevated likelihood of IPMNs progressing to PDAC among HRIs. Therefore, despite acknowledging the low progression rate of BD-IPMN, ongoing surveillance of these lesions remains essential in HRI. In relation to this, a multicenter observational study among HRIs found that BD-IPMNs without any worrisome features or high-risk stigmata showed no difference in the risk of developing PDAC after 5 years of surveillance compared to the general population, depending on age and cyst size.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas as the main focus for early detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^111jDeT7]. Pancreas (2018). Low credibility.

For early detection of pancreatic cancer, interests are now focused on the detection of high-risk individuals to undergo screening examinations. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a unique dual precursor of pancreatic cancer, characterized by progression to invasive cancer and the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma either concomitantly (synchronous occurrence) or even after resection of IPMN (metachronous occurrence). Careful examination and surveillance of patients with IPMN may therefore lead to early detection of pancreatic cancer. By reviewing only reports describing detailed breakdown of the morphological types of IPMN and numbers of patients with noninvasive and invasive carcinoma in each type, the rough frequencies of noninvasive carcinoma in main duct IPMNs and branch duct IPMNs (BD-IPMNs) are 20% and 10%, respectively, and those of invasive carcinoma are 40% and 13%, respectively. Roughly 5% of all patients with IPMN had concomitant adenocarcinoma. The real frequency of carcinoma in BD-IPMNs would be far lower because most patients with small asymptomatic BD-IPMNs do not undergo resection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm can be the main focus for early detection of pancreatic cancer to achieve favorable prognosis after surgical resection. The optimal protocol for surveillance and method for early detection of pancreatic cancer are to be determined.

Abstract

Background

Different surveillance strategies for patients with low-risk branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPMN) have been described. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMN, and to identify risk factors for the development of worrisome features (WF)/high-risk stigmata (HRS) and of pancreatic malignancies.

Methods

This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients with BD-IPMN who were under active surveillance between January 2006 and December 2015. Patients were eligible if they had a low-risk lesion and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Outcomes were development of WF/HRS or cytologically/histologically confirmed malignant IPMN.

Results

Of 837 patients included, 168 (20 per cent) developed WF/HRS. At the end of the observation time, 132 patients (79 per cent) with WF/HRS were still under surveillance without progression to pancreatic cancer. Factors associated with the development of WF or HRS in multivariable analysis included localized nodules (versus diffuse: hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95 per cent c.i. 0.26 to 0.68), cyst size 15–19 mm (versus less than 15 mm: HR 1.88, 1.23 to 2.87) or at least 20 mm (versus less than 15 mm: HR 3.25, 2.30 to 4.60), main pancreatic duct size over 3 mm (versus 3 mm or less: HR 2.17, 1.41 to 3.34), and symptoms at diagnosis (versus no symptoms: HR 2.29, 1.52 to 3.45). Surveillance in an endoscopy-oriented centre was also associated with increased detection of WF or HRS (versus radiology-oriented: HR 2.46, 1.74 to 3.47).

Conclusion

Conservative management of patients with low-risk BD-IPMN is safe and feasible.

### The effectiveness of endoscopic ultrasonography findings to distinguish benign and malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^112gsxS1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite decades of research, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains the most aggressive solid malignancy with a 5-year survival of only 9%. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a well-documented precancerous lesion of PDAC. Probably due to the growing use of imaging examinations, patients with pancreatic cysts are increasingly detected, and IPMN accounted for 25%–38% of those cysts. Histopathologically, IPMN was classified into low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and invasive carcinoma (IC) according to the Baltimore Consensus. Different histological types of IPMN differ dramatically in prognosis and require different clinical management. It is reported that IPMN has an overall risk of developing PDAC of 2.8%, but high-risk IPMN (with dilated main pancreatic duct (MPD) or mural nodules) had a 5-year malignancy risk of 9.77%. Some clinical features and cysts features are associated with malignant IPMN, but it remains challenging to accurately categorize IPMN before surgery.

The revised Fukuoka Guideline recommended that IPMN with "high-risk stigmata" were indicated for surgical resection, while IPMN with "worrisome features" should undergo further evaluations, especially endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), to determine the optimal therapeutic regimen. Similarly, the European Guideline and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Guideline recommended surgery for those patients with positive cytology on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), a solid component (mural nodule) or a dilated MPD. All three abovementioned guidelines emphasized the pivotal role of EUS in the evaluation of IPMN. The sensitivity and specificity of EUS ± FNA to diagnose malignant IPMN was 67.0%–75.6% and 70.0%–94.1%, respectively.

### Assessment of a revised management strategy for patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms involving the main pancreatic duct [^117D64pF]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

According to the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines, the diagnostic criterion of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) involving the main duct (MD IPMNs) or the main and branch ducts (mixed IPMNs) of the pancreatic system is a main pancreatic duct (MPD) diameter of 5.0 mm or greater on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, surgical resection is recommended for patients with an MPD diameter of 10.0 mm or greater, which is characterized as a high-risk stigma. An MPD diameter of 5.0 to 9.0 mm is not an indication for immediate resection.

Objectives

To determine an appropriate cutoff (ie, one with high sensitivity and negative predictive value) of the MPD diameter on CT or MRI as a prognostic factor for malignant disease and to propose a new management algorithm for patients with MD or mixed IPMNs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included 103 patients who underwent surgical resection for a preoperative diagnosis of MD or mixed IPMN and in whom IPMN was confirmed by surgical pathologic findings at a single institution from July 1, 1996, to December 31, 2015.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Malignant disease was defined as high-grade dysplasia or invasive adenocarcinoma on results of surgical pathologic evaluation. An appropriate MPD diameter on preoperative CT or MRI to predict malignant disease was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The prognostic value of the new management algorithm that incorporated the new MPD diameter cutoff was evaluated.

Results

Among the 103 patients undergoing resection for an MD or mixed IPMN (59 men [57.3%]; 44 women [42.7%]; median [range] age, 71 [48–86] years), 64 (62.1%) had malignant disease. Diagnostic accuracy for malignant neoplasms was highest at an MPD diameter cutoff of 7.2 mm (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59–0.81). An MPD diameter of 7.2 mm or greater was also an independent prognostic factor for malignant neoplasms (odds ratio, 12.76; 95% CI, 2.43–66.88; p = 0.003) on logistic regression analysis after controlling for preoperative variables. The new management algorithm, which included an MPD diameter of 7.2 mm or greater as one of the high-risk stigmata, had a higher sensitivity (100%), negative predictive value (100%), and accuracy (66%) for malignant disease than the 2012 version of the International Consensus Guidelines (95%, 57%, and 63%, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this single-center, retrospective analysis, an MPD diameter of 7.2 mm was identified as an optimal cutoff for a prognostic factor for malignant disease in MD or mixed IPMN. These data support lowering the accepted criteria for MPD diameter when selecting patients for resection vs surveillance so as not to overlook cancer in IPMN.

### The revised kyoto criteria and risk of malignancy among patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^117Cty18]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The revised Kyoto guidelines have a new catalog of high-risk stigmata and worrisome features for the risk stratification of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). We aimed to validate the stratification system in terms of short- and long-term risks of pancreatic carcinoma.

Methods

We included 3336 patients diagnosed with IPMNs in 2000–2021 and examined short-term (≤ 6 months) and long-term risks of pancreatic carcinoma diagnosis. We used the multivariable competing-risks proportional hazards regression model to calculate subdistribution hazard ratios for long-term incidence of pancreatic carcinoma with adjustment for potential confounders.

Results

In short-term analyses, pancreatic carcinomas were prevalent predominantly in IPMNs with high-risk stigmata (49% vs 1.3% and 0.05% in IPMNs with worrisome features and no risk factors, respectively). In long-term analyses of worrisome features, the main pancreatic duct diameter of 5–9.9 mm, acute pancreatitis, and IPMN growth rate of 2.5 mm/y were associated with a high incidence with multivariable subdistribution hazard ratios of 3.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.04–5.89), 5.65 (95% CI, 1.86–17.2), and 3.83 (95% CI, 2.14–6.86), respectively. An increasing number of worrisome features at baseline was associated with a higher prevalence and incidence of pancreatic carcinoma (P trend < .001). Patients with 1, 2, and 3–4 worrisome features had multivariable subdistribution hazard ratios for pancreatic cancer incidence of 1.43 (95% CI, 0.93–2.19), 2.17 (95% CI, 1.17–4.05), and 10.1 (95% CI, 4.20–24.5), respectively (vs no positive feature).

Conclusions

The revised Kyoto criteria stratify IPMN patients well in terms of the short- and long-term risks of pancreatic carcinoma diagnosis, potentially informing personalized patient management.

### Controversies in the management of pancreatic IPMN [^1121juPE]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Although considerable progress has been made in our understanding of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas, some issues still remain to be resolved. Uncertainty exists regarding the classification of IPMNs. The necessity of the mixed-type category of IPMN and whether such lesions should be defined radiographically or histologically needs to be determined. The preoperative distinction of branch duct IPMNs from nonmucinous cysts should be further investigated so that potentially malignant lesions can be identified and management strategies guided effectively. The role and safety of cystic fluid analysis remains to be clarified in this context. With regard to the diagnosis of malignancy in branch duct IPMNs, criteria for identifying malignancy need to be re-evaluated. The presence of mural nodules is a very reliable predictor; however, controversy exists over the value of size as a reliable indicator. Criteria with increased specificity are needed, perhaps including histological subtype of lesion, to reduce the false-positive rate of the present criteria. Finally, the best modality and interval for surveillance of branch duct IPMNs requires determination because of its significance in terms of malignant transformation, development of distinct ductal adenocarcinoma and disease recurrence after resection.

Increased surveillance and referral criteria for IPMNs or MCNs: patients with new onset or worsening diabetes mellitus or a rapid increase in cyst size (of > 3 mm/year) during surveillance may have an increased risk of malignancy and should undergo a short-interval MRI or EUS-FNA (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Patients with any of the following features should undergo EUS ± FNA and/or be referred to a multidisciplinary pancreatic group for further evaluation (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence): symptoms or signs including jaundice secondary to the cyst, acute pancreatitis secondary to the cyst, or significantly elevated serum CA 19–9; imaging findings including a mural nodule or solid component, dilatation of the main pancreatic duct of > 5 mm, focal duct dilation concerning for main duct IPMN or an obstructing lesion, or IPMNs or MCNs measuring ≥ 3 cm in diameter; or the presence of high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer on cytology.

### Outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for invasive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm compared with de novo pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^116HvQop]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

With the increasing resolution of modern imaging devices, incidental diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous cystic neoplasms (IPMN) has become common in clinical practice. Due to the risk of degeneration to invasive adenocarcinoma, surgical resection of high-risk IPMNs is often indicated. Unfortunately, the presentation of IPMNs ranges from main duct IPMNs with 'high-risk stigmata' and a high risk of invasive degeneration, to small secondary duct cysts with no 'worrisome features' and a low risk of progression. This high variability of risk in IPMNs makes the correct indication for surgical resection one of the challenges in the management of these tumors. - The optimal management of patients affected by an invasive IPMN (I-IPMN) is currently debated. I-IPMNs are a specific type of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising from an IPMN precursor lesion, and there is controversial evidence of a more favorable oncological outcome of these tumors after surgical resection when compared with de novo pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Nonetheless, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, do not acknowledge I-IPMNs as a separate entity from PDAC but limit the mention of IPMNs as precursor lesions for pancreatic cancer. When facing an IPMN with a known invasive component, it is currently recommended that both medical and surgical treatment do not differ from the management of PDACs, but data on the effects of chemotherapy on I-IPMN are scarce.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognosis of resected I-IPMNs compared with de novo PDAC, and to assess the response of I-IPMNs to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with de novo PDAC.

### Recurrent intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas mimicking ampullary cancer [^117KHYQS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas are cystic precursor lesions characterized by multiple occurrences in the same pancreas. After partial pancreatectomy for IPMNs, the remnant pancreas still remains at risk for secondary lesions, despite the negative surgical margin. Although several studies have reported that some patients developed metachronous/recurrent IPMNs in the remnant pancreas, IPMN resembling an ampullary tumor is extremely rare, because IPMNs arise from the epithelial cells in the pancreatic ductal systems. In addition, an adequate surveillance protocol after partial pancreatectomy for IPMNs has yet to be established.

Here we report on a rare patient who developed recurrent IPMNs mimicking ampullary cancer, detected not by cross-sectional imaging study surveillance, but by an endoscopic procedure.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas: reporting clinically relevant features [^113p8zyx]. Histopathology (2017). Low credibility.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas can exhibit a wide spectrum of macroscopic and microscopic appearances. This not only causes occasional difficulties for the reporting pathologist in distinguishing these tumours from other lesions, but is also relevant clinically. As evidence accumulates, it becomes clear that multiple macroscopic and histological features of these neoplasms are relevant to the risk for malignant transformation and, consequently, of prime importance for clinical patient management. The need for detailed reporting is therefore increasing. This review discusses the panoply of gross and microscopic features of IPMN as well as the recommendations from recent consensus meetings regarding the pathology reporting on this tumour entity.

### Are clinical guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms followed? a single-center analysis [^111YNs9b]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine how frequently guidelines for the management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are followed and establish factors associated with failure.

Methods

Four hundred forty-five patients with radiographic diagnosis of IPMN 1 cm or greater between January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2013 were included. We defined failure of guideline adherence if the following occurred: (a) failure of acknowledgment of IPMN, (b) failure to undergo endoscopic ultrasound, (c) failure to undergo resection, or (d) failure to undergo at least 1 surveillance image within 2 years after diagnosis.

Results

Failure of guideline adherence was observed in 58% of patients and evident across all the respective criteria (A: 38%, B: 25%, C: 29%, D: 33%). Age older than 68 years (P < 0.01), American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher (P < 0.0001), benign findings on imaging (P < 0.0001), and major comorbid conditions (P < 0.01) were factors associated with higher rate of failure to compliance. On multivariate logistic regression, American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or higher and benign features were associated with 4.0 times (95% confidence interval, 2.02–8.06) and 2.6 times (95% confidence interval, 1.60–4.07) higher odds of failure to compliance with guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compliance with clinical guidelines for the management of IPMN is poor. Socioeconomic factors do not seem to create a disparity to care. However, many patients with IPMN have other medical diagnoses that take priority over IPMN surveillance and treatment.

### International cancer of the pancreas screening (CAPS) consortium summit on the management of patients with increased risk for familial pancreatic cancer [^114XPvb2]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

When should surgery be performed? What type of surgery should be performed?

Screening should only be offered to individuals who are candidates for surgery (agree 75.5%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Pancreatic resections should be performed at high-volume specialty centres (agree 100%, grade moderate, 'do it'). Determining when surgery is required for pancreatic lesions is difficult and is best individualised after multidisciplinary assessment, preferably within research studies.

There is little consensus about which lesions detected by screening require surgery. The few published reports are based on limited numbers of patients. Because of the risks of pancreatectomy, prophylactic surgery is not recommended for asymptomatic HRIs without an identifiable lesion. When indicated, pancreatic surgery is best performed at a high-volume specialty centre. Multiple studies have shown volume directly correlates with outcomes.

Unambiguous solid lesions (≥ 1 cm, or seen by multiple imaging modalities) are ominous and the threshold for removing them is much lower. There was no consensus as to whether any indeterminate solid lesions detected by EUS should be resected (Appendix).

The majority of cystic lesions detected by screening appear to be low-risk branch-duct IPMNs (table 1). The Sendai international consensus guidelines have been developed and updatedto help stratify patients with an IPMN as low risk versus high risk for either developing or currently harbouring a malignancy. In subjects with suspected BD-IPMNs, resection is considered if the patient has symptoms attributable to the cyst(s), if the cysts are > 3 cm in size, or if the cysts contain mural nodules. Logic would dictate that if these are the recommendations for subjects without a strong family history of PC, then these thresholds for resection should be either the same or lower in subjects with a strong family history. There was no consensus on the size criterion for resection of suspected BD-IPMNs or other cysts in HRIs but the majority agreed that surgery should be considered for suspected BD-IPMNs which were ≥ 2 cm (Appendix). Pathologically confirmed PanIN-3 lesions have been found in the pancreata of individuals who had resections of IPMNs smaller than 1 cm. High-grade dysplasia and main-duct involvement have been identified at resection of some individuals who had surgery for one or more small (< 3 cm) BD-IPMNs. However, there is insufficient evidence to lower the threshold criteria for surgery for patients with lesions identified during pancreatic screening.

### The landmark series: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas-from prevalence to early cancer detection [^1168Vjfv]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

This article is structured as a toolkit of relevant landmark articles essential to current intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) care. Four elements will be highlighted. First, the studies quantifying the prevalence of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) and IPMNs in the general population are addressed. No longer considered a rare disease, providing an accurate estimate of the numbers of patients with IPMN frames the relevance of the topic. Since the definition and classification of IPMN was not formally adopted by the World Health Organization until 1996, modern-era studies have been selected. Second, the main clinical management guidelines are discussed in context. A concise description of the methodology used to develop the recommendations in each guideline is given, followed by direct comparison of management strategies in the different guidelines. Third, the evidence on surveillance discontinuation is discussed. The reason for highlighting this ongoing and timely debate is that non-resected IPMNs are currently considered for lifelong surveillance. Given the high prevalence of IPMNs and length of surveillance, the burden on patients and the health care system worldwide demands a reassessment of surveillance discontinuation for specific subsets of IPMNs. Fourth, due to the limitations and low specificity of current guidelines to identify appropriate patients for pancreatic resection more accurately, the main studies on new cyst biomarker panels to predict IPMNs at high-risk for cancer are discussed. The goal of molecular diagnostics of cyst fluid aims to reduce the number of unnecessary resections that are performed every year, while also providing information on the malignant potential of lesions under surveillance. A final comment on the role of the immune system in IPMN progression is given, as opportunities for early immunotherapeutic intervention could change the course of this disease.

### Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas [^112Qi5Cp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The incidence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas has been rising in the past 2 decades, driven mainly by the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. IPMNs are intraductal mucin-producing neoplasms that involve the main pancreatic duct or its side branches and lack the ovarian stroma typically seen in mucinous cystic neoplasms. The International Association of Pancreatology released consensus guidelines in 2006 and 2012 providing clinical algorithms based on IPMN features and risk of malignancy. In this article, we review the different classifications of IPMNs, their natural history, and clinical management and address recent controversies in the literature.

### Identification of patients with branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and very low risk of cancer: multicentre study [^114dQ4fY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Different surveillance strategies for patients with low-risk branch-duct (BD) intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPMN) have been described. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of low-risk BD-IPMN, and to identify risk factors for the development of worrisome features (WF)/high-risk stigmata (HRS) and of pancreatic malignancies.

Methods

This was a multicentre retrospective study of patients with BD-IPMN who were under active surveillance between January 2006 and December 2015. Patients were eligible if they had a low-risk lesion and had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Outcomes were development of WF/HRS or cytologically/histologically confirmed malignant IPMN.

Results

Of 837 patients included, 168 (20 per cent) developed WF/HRS. At the end of the observation time, 132 patients (79 per cent) with WF/HRS were still under surveillance without progression to pancreatic cancer. Factors associated with the development of WF or HRS in multivariable analysis included localized nodules (versus diffuse: hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95 per cent c.i. 0.26 to 0.68), cyst size 15–19mm (versus less than 15mm: HR 1.88, 1.23 to 2.87) or at least 20mm (versus less than 15mm: HR 3.25, 2.30 to 4.60), main pancreatic duct size over 3mm (versus 3mm or less: HR 2.17, 1.41 to 3.34), and symptoms at diagnosis (versus no symptoms: HR 2.29, 1.52 to 3.45). Surveillance in an endoscopy-oriented centre was also associated with increased detection of WF or HRS (versus radiology-oriented: HR 2.46, 1.74 to 3.47).

Conclusion

Conservative management of patients with low-risk BD-IPMN is safe and feasible.

Background

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are well-established pancreatic precancerous lesions. Indications for resection are outlined in the 2012 International Consensus Guidelines (ICG). Because of the low specificity of the ICG, many patients will undergo potentially unnecessary surgery for nonmalignant IPMNs. Several retrospective studies have reported that positron emission tomography (PET) with CT (PET/CT) is highly sensitive and specific in detecting malignant IPMNs. We hypothesized that PET/CT complements the ICG in identification of malignant IPMNs.

Study Design

From 2009 to 2013, patients with a suspected clinical or cytopathologic diagnosis of IPMN were prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial at a single center. Results of preoperative PET/CT on determination of IPMN malignancy (ie, high-grade dysplastic and invasive) was compared with surgical pathology. PET/CT uptake was considered increased if the standardized uptake value was ≥ 3.

Results

Of the 67 patients enrolled, 50 patients met all inclusion criteria. Increased PET/CT uptake was associated with significantly more malignant and invasive IPMNs (80% vs 13%; p < 0.0001 and 40% vs 3%; p = 0.004). When patients were divided into branch duct and main duct IPMNs, increased PET/CT uptake was also associated with more malignancy (60% vs 0%; p = 0.006 for branch duct IPMN and 100% vs 23%; p = 0.003 for main duct IPMN). Patients with ICG criteria (eg, worrisome features and high-risk stigmata) and increased PET/CT uptake had more malignant and invasive IPMNs than patients with ICG criteria, but no increased uptake (78% vs 17%; p = 0.001 and 33% vs 3%; p = 0.03). The sensitivity and specificity of the ICG criteria for detecting malignancy were 92% and 27%, respectively, and PET/CT was less sensitive (62%) but more specific (95%). When PET/CT was added to ICG criteria, the association resulted in 78% sensitivity and 100% specificity.

Conclusions

The addition of PET/CT to preoperative workup improves the performance of the ICG for predicting malignant risk in patients with IPMN.

### Increased prevalence of colorectal neoplasia in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^111b7Qo1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The key finding suggests a strong association between CRC and advanced polyps and IPMN. This aspect is essential and relevant for surveillance programs and has been analyzed in very few studies. Pancreatic-oriented imaging modalities may misdiagnose and underestimate the prevalence of colorectal polyps, considering their low sensitivity for colonic luminal findings. Therefore, we relied on endoscopic findings, as colonoscopy is the gold standard for colorectal polyp identification. Kato et al. suggested that EPMs are more frequent in malignant (7/14, 50.0%) than in benign (8/36, 21.6%) IPMN patients. We assessed the presence of worrisome features and/or high-risk stigmata, which are known as risk factors for cyst's malignant development, in respect to the relevant colonoscopy findings, but found no such association. However, the number of IPMN cysts having worrisome features/high-risk stigmata was too small to reach a statistical significance.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that among patients with IPMN, there is a significantly increased prevalence of CRC and advanced colorectal polyps compared to average risk population. Further work is needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiology of these findings. Currently, there are no specific guidelines regarding the extent of colorectal screening programs for patients with pancreatic cysts. We suggest that patients with IPMNs be classified as a high-risk population for colorectal malignancy and offered a more rigorous colorectal surveillance program. The intensity of such a program should be determined by further studies.

### Health-related quality of life and anxiety levels among patients under surveillance for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [^114zoLKg]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Because of the premalignant nature of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), patients should undergo surveillance as long as they remain fit for surgery. This surveillance, with imaging and laboratory tests every 6 to 12 months, is expensive and may psychologically burden patients. This study aimed to determine the effects of IPMN surveillance on patients´ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and anxiety levels.

Methods

We included a random subgroup of all IPMN patients undergoing a follow-up check-up at Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) between August 2017 and November 2018. Patients were asked to complete the 15D HRQoL and state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaires just before and three months after an IPMN control.

Results

Among 899 patients in IPMN follow-up, 232 participated. The 15D HRQoL results showed differences in some IPMN patients' 15 analyzed dimensions compared to a sex- and age-standardized general population cohort, but the clinical relevance of these differences appear doubtful. We detected no significant difference in the anxiety levels determined using the STAI questionnaires before or three months after the IPMN control.

Conclusion

Surveillance should be less harmful than the risk of disease. Among our patients, the recommended IPMN follow-up carried minimal negative impact on patients' HRQoL or anxiety levels. This result is important, because the number of patients under IPMN surveillance is rapidly increasing and the cancer risk among the majority of these patients remains small.

Trial registration: The Surgical Ethics Committee of Helsinki University Hospital approved this study (Dnro HUS 475/2017) and it was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03131076) before patient enrollment began.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114LigrQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Premalignant pancreatic tumors — mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic lesions often incidentally discovered; lesions involving the main duct have a higher malignant potential than those in the branches, with the risk of malignancy being around 62%, and the risk of malignancy in MCNs is < 15%. An international group of experts has established guidelines for IPMNs and MCNs; the international group strongly recommends resection in fit patients with main-duct IPMNs ≥ 10 mm, while for branch-duct IPMNs surveillance is considered an appropriate option in patients who are older or ineligible for resection or for cysts lacking high-risk stigmata. Branch-duct IPMNs that have an enhancing mural nodule ≥ 5 mm or are in the head of the pancreas causing obstructive jaundice should be considered for resection in patients who can undergo surgery; patients with resected IPMNs are followed with imaging studies to identify recurrences, and for MCNs the international group recommends resection for all patients who can undergo surgery.

### Increased prevalence of colorectal neoplasia in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [^116xUBN2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

The association between intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyps is controversial.

Objectives:

To compare the prevalence of CRC and colorectal polyps among patients with IPMN and matched average risk individuals.

Methods:

A match cross-sectional historical study comparing colonoscopy findings of 310 patients with IPMN cysts who underwent at least one colonoscopy examination from 2004 through 2019, with 310 age- and gender-matched average risk participants who underwent a screening colonoscopy. CRC and polyps were assessed in both groups. The prevalence and odds ratio were calculated.

Results:

CRC was diagnosed in 16 of 310 patients with IPMN (5.2%), and at least one polyp was detected in 96 patients (31%). The prevalence of CRC was greater among patients with IPMN than in matched individuals [5.2% versus 1.3%, p = 0.012, prevalence odds ratio (POR) 4, confidence interval (CI) 1.29–16.44]. The overall prevalence of polyps was not higher among patients with IPMN than in matched individuals (31% versus 26.8%, p = 0.291, POR 1.22, CI 0.85–1.76). However, the prevalence of colorectal adenomas with high-grade dysplasia was higher in patients with IPMN than in matched individuals (4.2% versus 1%, p = 0.02, POR 4.33, CI, 1.19–23.7). The prevalence of large polyps (i.e. more than 20 mm in size) was also greater in patients with IPMN than in matched individuals (6.1% versus 1.9%, p = 0.011, POR 3.6, CI, 1.29–12.40).

Conclusion:

Patients with IPMN have a significantly higher prevalence of CRC and advanced polyps than the average risk population. In view of our findings, we suggest that once the diagnosis of IPMN is made, special consideration of CRC should be undertaken.
