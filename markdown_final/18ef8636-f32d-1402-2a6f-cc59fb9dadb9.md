## Question

How did AMACING statistically support that omitting prophylactic IV hydration was noninferior to hydration?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the AMACING trial statistically supported that omitting prophylactic IV hydration was noninferior to hydration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and noninferiority framework. Then, I should verify the primary endpoint definition and the prespecified noninferiority margin. Next, I will check the observed event rates and the absolute risk difference with its confidence interval. After that, I need to confirm how the one-sided 95% CI was used to test noninferiority and whether both ITT and per-protocol analyses aligned. Finally, I will consider secondary outcomes, safety, and the long-term data to ensure the conclusion is robust and clinically meaningful.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and analytic framework. AMACING was a prospective, randomized, phase 3, parallel-group, open-label, noninferiority trial in high-risk patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² undergoing elective iodinated contrast procedures, comparing no prophylaxis versus guideline-recommended IV hydration, with both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses prespecified, which is appropriate for a noninferiority study [^115VW15x] [^116GqSuw].

> I need to verify the primary endpoint and the noninferiority margin. The primary outcome was contrast-induced nephropathy defined as a greater than 25% increase in serum creatinine or an absolute increase of 44 μmol/L within 2–6 days of contrast, and the prespecified noninferiority margin was 2.1% on the absolute risk difference, chosen based on prior literature and clinical judgment to represent an acceptable loss of effectiveness if hydration were omitted [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

> Next, I should review the observed event rates and the absolute risk difference. In the ITT analysis, CIN occurred in 8 of 307 patients (2.6%) in the no-prophylaxis group versus 8 of 296 patients (2.7%) in the IV hydration group, yielding an absolute risk difference of −0.10% with a one-sided 95% CI of −2.25% to 2.06%, and a one-tailed p value of 0.4710, indicating noninferiority by the prespecified criterion [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how the one-sided confidence interval supports noninferiority. Noninferiority is established when the upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI for the difference (no hydration minus hydration) does not exceed the prespecified margin of 2.1%; here, the upper bound is 2.06%, which is below 2.1%, so the trial meets the noninferiority criterion, and this interpretation is consistent with standard noninferiority logic and CONSORT-aligned reporting [^115VW15x] [^111gy7ms].

> I should double-check that both ITT and per-protocol analyses were concordant. The trial reported both ITT and PP analyses, and both supported noninferiority, which strengthens internal validity; importantly, the ITT analysis is typically more conservative in noninferiority settings, so concordance between ITT and PP increases confidence in the conclusion [^115VW15x] [^113GnTM6].

> Next, I should review secondary and safety outcomes to ensure the conclusion is clinically balanced. There was no significant difference in longer-term renal function decline or dialysis at 35 days, and importantly, 18 of 328 patients (5.5%) in the hydration arm experienced complications such as symptomatic heart failure, whereas there were zero hydration-related complications in the no-prophylaxis arm, reinforcing that omitting hydration did not increase harm and may reduce adverse events [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

> Let me consider the long-term follow-up to ensure durability. One-year outcomes showed no significant differences in dialysis or mortality between groups, and a five-year analysis likewise found no disadvantage to withholding prophylaxis, supporting the durability and external validity of the noninferiority finding in this elective, moderate CKD population [^112sV6KY] [^115vb7Qn].

> But wait, what if the margin was too permissive or the event rates too low to detect a difference. The 2.1% absolute margin was prespecified and aligns with contemporary noninferiority practice, and the observed event rates were low and similar between arms, which actually makes the noninferiority finding more robust; moreover, the trial's population and procedures reflect real-world elective practice, enhancing applicability despite being single-center [^115VW15x].

> In summary, AMACING statistically supported noninferiority by demonstrating that the absolute risk difference in CIN was −0.10% with a one-sided 95% CI upper bound of 2.06%, which lies below the prespecified 2.1% noninferiority margin, with concordant results in ITT and PP analyses and no signal of increased harm in either short- or long-term outcomes, thereby establishing that omitting prophylactic IV hydration is noninferior to hydration in this setting [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW] [^112sV6KY].

The AMACING trial used a **noninferiority design** with a prespecified margin of 2.1% to test whether omitting prophylactic IV hydration was noninferior to standard hydration in patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² undergoing elective contrast procedures. The primary outcome — contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) — occurred in 2.6% with no hydration vs 2.7% with hydration, yielding an absolute difference of −0.1% and a one-sided 95% CI of −2.25% to 2.06%. Because the upper bound of the CI did not exceed the 2.1% margin, **noninferiority was established**. The trial also found fewer hydration-related complications and lower costs with no hydration, supporting the conclusion that omitting hydration is safe and cost-saving in this population [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

## Trial design and statistical framework

- **Design**: Prospective, randomized, phase 3, parallel-group, open-label, noninferiority trial.
- **Population**: 660 patients aged ≥ 18 years with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² undergoing elective iodinated contrast procedures.
- **Interventions**: No prophylaxis vs standard IV hydration (0.9% NaCl).
- **Primary outcome**: CIN defined as a > 25% increase in serum creatinine or > 44 μmol/L within 2–6 days of contrast.
- **Noninferiority margin**: 2.1% (absolute risk difference), prespecified based on prior literature and clinical judgment [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

---

## Statistical analysis and results

- **Intention-to-treat analysis**: CIN occurred in 8/307 (2.6%) with no hydration vs 8/296 (2.7%) with hydration.
- **Absolute risk difference**: −0.1% (one-sided 95% CI −2.25% to 2.06%).
- **Noninferiority test**: The upper bound of the one-sided 95% CI (2.06%) did not exceed the 2.1% margin, establishing noninferiority (one-tailed p = 0.4710) [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].
- **Per-protocol analysis**: Consistent with ITT, supporting robustness [^115VW15x].

---

## Clinical implications and safety outcomes

- **Complications**: 5.5% with hydration vs 0% with no hydration (e.g. heart failure, electrolyte disturbances).
- **Dialysis and mortality**: No dialysis or related deaths within 35 days in either group.
- **Cost**: €792 vs €1,455 per patient, favoring no hydration [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Single-center**: May limit generalizability.
- **Open-label**: Potential bias, though outcomes were objectively measured.
- **Population**: eGFR 30–59 only; results do not apply to eGFR < 30 or dialysis patients [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

---

## Conclusion

The AMACING trial **established noninferiority** of omitting prophylactic IV hydration versus standard hydration in patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² undergoing elective contrast procedures, using a prespecified 2.1% margin and demonstrating similar CIN rates with fewer complications and lower costs. This supports guideline shifts away from routine hydration in this population [^115VW15x] [^11628zzW].

Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Intravenous saline is recommended in clinical practice guidelines as the cornerstone for preventing contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with compromised renal function. However, clinical-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this prophylactic hydration treatment in protecting renal function has not been adequately studied in the population targeted by the guidelines, against a group receiving no prophylaxis. This was the aim of the AMACING trial.

Methods

AMACING is a prospective, randomised, phase 3, parallel-group, open-label, non-inferiority trial of patients at risk of contrast-induced nephropathy according to current guidelines. High-risk patients (with an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 30–59 mL per min/1.73 m²) aged 18 years and older, undergoing an elective procedure requiring iodinated contrast material administration at Maastricht University Medical Centre, the Netherlands, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous 0.9% NaCl or no prophylaxis. We excluded patients with eGFR lower than 30 mL per min/1.73 m², previous dialysis, or no referral for intravenous hydration. Randomisation was stratified by predefined risk factors. The primary outcome was incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase in serum creatinine from baseline of more than 25% or 44 μmol/L within 2–6 days of contrast exposure, and cost-effectiveness of no prophylaxis compared with intravenous hydration in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. We measured serum creatinine immediately before, 2–6 days, and 26–35 days after contrast-material exposure. Laboratory personnel were masked to treatment allocation. Adverse events and use of resources were systematically recorded. The non-inferiority margin was set at 2.1%. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02106234.

Findings

Between June 17, 2014, and July 17, 2016, 660 consecutive patients were randomly assigned to receive no prophylaxis (n = 332) or intravenous hydration (n = 328). 2–6 day serum creatinine was available for 307 (92%) of 332 patients in the no prophylaxis group and 296 (90%) of 328 patients in the intravenous hydration group. Contrast-induced nephropathy was recorded in eight (2.6%) of 307 non-hydrated patients and in eight (2.7%) of 296 hydrated patients. The absolute difference (no hydration vs hydration) was -0.10% (one-sided 95% CI -2.25 to 2.06; one-tailed p = 0.4710). No hydration was cost-saving relative to hydration. No haemodialysis or related deaths occurred within 35 days. 18 (5.5%) of 328 patients had complications associated with intravenous hydration.

Interpretation

We found no prophylaxis to be non-inferior and cost-saving in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy compared with intravenous hydration according to current clinical practice guidelines.

Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study AMACING was published by Estelle C Nijssen and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Contrast-induced nephropathy. In the AMACING study, the trial question was: is no prophylaxis noninferior to intravenous prophylactic hydration treatment in patients at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy? In the AMACING study, the study design was: single center, open label, RCT. In the AMACING study, the population was: 660 patients (253 female, 407 male). The inclusion criteria were high-risk patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing an elective procedure requiring iodinated contrast material administration. The key exclusion criteria were eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; previous dialysis; no referral for intravenous hydration. In the AMACING study, the interventions were: n = 332 no prophylaxis (no intravenous prophylactic hydration) n = 328 prophylactic hydration (prophylactic intravenous hydration with normal saline). In the AMACING study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in contrast-induced nephropathy (2.6% vs. 2.7%; ARD -0.1, 95% CI -2.25 to 2.06). In the AMACING study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in cost-effectiveness (792 EUR vs. 1455 EUR; AD -663 EUR, 95% CI -1234 to -191) No significant difference in renal function decline of > 10 eGFR at 26–35 days (4.2% vs. 2.7%; AD 1.5%, 95% CI -1.6 to 4.68) No significant difference in renal function decline to eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² at 26–35 days (2.3% vs. 2.7%; AD -0.4%, 95% CI -3.07 to 2.3). In the AMACING study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in death, hyponatremia, and arrhythmia. significant difference in symptomatic HF (0% vs. 4%). In the AMACING study, the conclusion was: in high-risk patients aged ≥ 18 years undergoing an elective procedure requiring iodinated contrast material administration, no prophylaxis were noninferior to prophylactic hydration with respect to a contrast-induced nephropathy.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^112sV6KY]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline (AMACING) trial was to evaluate non-inferiority of no prophylaxis compared to guideline-recommended prophylaxis in preventing contrast induced nephropathy (CIN), and to explore the effect on long-term post-contrast adverse outcomes. The current paper presents the long-term results.

Methods

AMACING is a single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors, undergoing elective procedures requiring intravenous or intra-arterial iodinated contrast material. Exclusion criteria were eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², dialysis, no referral for prophylaxis. The outcomes dialysis, mortality, and change in renal function at 1 year post-contrast were secondary outcomes of the trial. Subgroup analyses were performed based on pre-defined stratification risk factors. AMACING is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02106234.

Findings

From 28,803 referrals, 1120 at-risk patients were identified. 660 consecutive patients agreed to participate and were randomly assigned (1:1) to no prophylaxis (n = 332) or standard prophylactic intravenous hydration (n = 328). Dialysis and mortality data were available for all patients. At 365 days post-contrast dialysis was recorded in two no prophylaxis (2/332, 0.60%), and two prophylaxis patients (2/328, 0.61%; p = 0.9909); mortality was recorded for 36/332 (10.84%) no prophylaxis, and 32/328 (9.76%) prophylaxis patients (p = 0.6490). The hazard ratio was 1.118 (no prophylaxis vs prophylaxis) for one-year risk of death (95% CI: 0.695 to 1.801, p = 0.6449). The differences in long-term changes in serum creatinine were small between groups, and gave no indication of a disadvantage for the no-prophylaxis group.

Interpretation

Assuming optimal contrast administration, not giving prophylaxis to elective patients with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is safe, even in the long-term.

2.4 Outcomes

Clinical outcomes at one-year post-contrast exposure were pre-defined secondary outcomes of the AMACING trial. The main one-year outcomes were incidences of dialysis and all-cause mortality within 365 days post-contrast administration. Long-term change in renal function was analysed by comparing mean serum creatinine, mean change in serum creatinine from baseline, and incidence of major renal adverse events. Major renal adverse events were defined as 1. renal failure (defined as eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²); 2. renal decline with more than 10 eGFR units; 3. renal decline to eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; 4. a combination of the latter two.

Change in renal function over time was evaluated at 2 to 6 days, 26 to 35 days and one-year post-contrast exposure. Where a value at one year post-contrast exposure was unavailable, the available value closest to 365 days post-contrast was used, with a maximum allowable range of 180 to 450 days. For patients receiving dialysis, last known serum creatinine in absence of dialysis was recorded.

2.5 Statistical Analysis

The sample size was based on detection of non-inferiority of no prophylaxis compared to standard prophylaxis with respect to the primary outcome CIN/CI-AKI. Based on the literature, the expected proportion of patients with CIN/CI-AKI after prophylaxis was 2.4%, and the non-inferiority margin was set at 2.1%, the power at 80% and (one-sided) alpha at 5%. Details are published elsewhere. In absence of available data on incidences, it was not possible to predefine non-inferiority margins for the secondary outcomes as is explained in the discussion. Such margins must be defined in terms of demonstrating that part of the effect of prophylactic intravenous hydration will be retained. However, trials evaluating the effect on 1 year morbidity and mortality after contrast administration are not available in the literature.

4 Discussion

The differences in the secondary outcomes one-year dialysis, one-year mortality, long-term change in serum creatinine from baseline, or renal events between no prophylaxis and intravenously hydrated groups were small and not significant, and did not show a consistent disadvantage for the no prophylaxis group. Subgroup analyses yielded consistently small differences in one-year dialysis and mortality between the intravenously hydrated and no prophylaxis patients (with vs without diabetes; eGFR 30–44 vs 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2; intra-arterial vs intravenous contrast administration; interventional vs diagnostic procedures).

In non-inferiority trials, 95% confidence intervals around the absolute differences between randomised groups are used to decide whether unacceptable loss of effectiveness can be excluded. This unacceptable loss has to be pre-defined by the non-inferiority margin. However, it was not possible to set such margins for the secondary outcomes. What is an acceptable or unacceptable loss in effectiveness can only be judged when the degree of prevention of prophylactic intravenous hydration is known. A prerequisite is therefore the availability of good historical data from previous trials comparing standard care with placebo (or no prophylaxis). Such trials evaluating long-term effects are not available in literature. Without non-inferiority margins definite conclusions on non-inferiority with respect to long-term outcomes cannot be made. However, the extremely small absolute differences observed suggest that there are no substantial negative consequences of withholding prophylaxis, especially considering the observed 5.5% complications incurred by the prophylactic treatment. Similar trials with much larger sample sizes would give more certainty, but it is unlikely that these will be carried out, especially considering the logistic and financial requirements of such trials.

Continuous data is reported as mean (standard deviation, SD), or median (interquartile range, IQR), and categorical data is presented as absolute numbers and percentages. The results are given as absolute differences with two-sided 95%/one-sided 97.5% confidence intervals (CI). We can have 97.5% confidence that an increase in unfavourable clinical outcomes (no prophylaxis minus prophylaxis) will not exceed the upper limit of the confidence intervals.

For comparison of categorical variables between the no prophylaxis and intravenously hydrated groups, the Chi square test was used to test for statistical differences. Differences in mean values of continuous variables were assessed using the Student's t test for independent samples. Survival analyses were used (Kaplan Meier and Cox regression) to evaluate whether deaths occurred earlier in the no prophylaxis group than in the intravenously hydrated group. A hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Between-group difference in (change in) serum creatinine over time was evaluated by using a linear mixed model, which accounts for correlation between repeated measurements as well as for missing values.

Pre-planned subgroup analyses were done within pre-specified subgroups: diabetes (yes vs no), renal function (eGFR 30–44 vs 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2), contrast administration route (intra-arterial vs intravenous), and procedure type (interventional vs diagnostic). To test for differences in treatment effect between the various subgroups, p values for interaction were derived from multivariable logistic regression models including treatment, covariate coding for subgroup level, and an interaction term.

p values of 0.05 and lower were considered to indicate statistical significance. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were done.

Analyses were done with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (version 23; IBM Corp. Armonk, N.Y. USA) and STATA (version 13.1).

### Long-term safety of withholding standard prophylaxis in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^111CUFuz]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ESUR contrast media guideline recommendations regarding the prevention of post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) were last updated in 2018. A major change in recommendations was withholding standard prophylactic intravenous hydration for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 30 ml/min/1.73 m². Other international guidelines, including the American College of Radiology guidelines, followed with similar changes. The decision was mainly based on expert opinion, indirect evidence in literature, and one randomised controlled trial (the AMACING trial). This single-centre non-inferiority trial assessed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of guideline-recommended standard prophylactic intravenous hydration in elective patients with eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors such as old age, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, who were considered to be at high risk of PC-AKI at the time. To date, this remains the only sizeable randomised controlled trial evaluating guideline-recommended standard prophylaxis against a control group receiving no prophylaxis.

Details of methods and primary outcomes of the AMACING trial are published elsewhere. Participants were randomised to receive either standard care prophylactic intravenous hydration (n = 328) or no prophylaxis (n = 332; see Table 1 for baseline characteristics). All patients included in the trial received intravascular non-ionic iodinated contrast material during an elective intravenous or intra-arterial procedure (contrast-enhanced computed tomography, coronary catheterisation, percutaneous intervention, etc.), and all patients signed informed consent.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^115BU6Af]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence for prevention of CIN/CI-AKI by the recommended prophylactic treatment is scarce, as it had not previously been properly evaluated in the population targeted by the guidelines and against a group not receiving prophylaxis. Clinical trials on the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy are manifold, but most focus on comparing one form of intravenous prophylaxis with another. Only relatively recently were randomised trials published in which a group not receiving any prophylaxis was included. Four such trials, comparing prophylactic intravenous hydration to a group not receiving any prophylaxis, were published in 2014 and 2015. Two of these were done in the acute setting of primary percutaneous intervention in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Both found significantly lower incidences of CIN/CI-AKI after prophylaxis (22/108 vs 38/108 18 and 22/204 vs 43/204). One of these trials reported less in-hospital mortality for the prophylaxis group (3/108 vs 10/108), whereas the other found no difference between groups. A third trial was done in the setting of computed tomography for suspected pulmonary embolism, and no prophylaxis was found to be non-inferior to prophylactic intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate (CIN/CI-AKI 5/70 vs 6/65). The fourth trial was done in normal and chronic kidney disease hospitalised patients with computed tomography, and found no difference in efficacy between pre-hydration with sodium bicarbonate and no prophylaxis (CIN/CI-AKI 3/43 vs 4/44). The reports do not go beyond in-hospital outcomes. In patients at risk, post-contrast increased risk of dialysis and mortality in the long term is consistently reported, and it is unknown whether prophylactic intravenous hydration mitigates these.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^113ai4X7]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

Efficacy of guideline-recommended prophylactic intravenous hydration cannot be determined form the above reports, because the trials were small and/or done in the acute setting, where other factors such as haemodynamic instability play a role. Furthermore, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m² were included, and these are not considered to be at high risk of post-contrast adverse events.

In 2017 the results on the primary outcome of A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline (AMACING) trial were published. The aim was to evaluate efficacy of prophylaxis according to clinical guidelines in the prevention of post-contrast adverse outcomes in elective patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors for CIN/CI-AKI. All elective procedures requiring iodinated contrast material administration from all specialties over a two-year period were screened for the trial, and 48% of participants received intra-arterial 52% intravenous iodinated contrast administration. Not giving prophylaxis was found to be non-inferior to standard prophylaxis with normal saline: CIN/CI-AKI 8/296 vs 8/307, no haemodialysis or related deaths occurred within 35 days, and 5.5% of intravenously hydrated patients suffered complications such as heart failure from the prophylactic treatment.

CIN/CI-AKI itself being asymptomatic, the concern is that post-contrast acute renal injury might result in higher rates of mortality and renal function decline in the long term. Prophylaxis is recommended by clinical practice guidelines to prevent such. Furthermore, renal reserve may be affected even in those without defined CIN/CI-AKI, or CIN/CI-AKI may go undetected for other reasons. In evaluating efficacy of guideline-recommended prophylaxis therefore, analysis of long-term mortality and renal function data of all patients with and without prophylaxis and with or without CIN/CI-AKI is imperative. The current paper presents the one-year follow-up results of the AMACING trial: the secondary trial outcomes renal function decline, dialysis, and mortality.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^115Pbe8a]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

The AMACING trial was about guideline efficacy, not about the (risk of) CIN/CI-AKI. Whether CIN/CI-AKI is synonymous to renal damage and whether all renal damage is reflected in CIN/CI-AKI incidence cannot be answered from our data. However, the analyses were done amongst all patients, including any patients in whom CIN/CI-AKI may have gone undetected, and reflect efficacy of prophylaxis in reducing adverse post-contrast outcomes.

Earlier randomised controlled trials with a group randomised to receive no prophylaxis included patients with normal renal function, were done in the acute setting in specific specialties and specific procedures, and long-term outcomes were not reported. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first systematic report of long-term post contrast adverse outcomes in this elective population with chronic kidney disease, especially with a large group of patients randomised to receive no prophylaxis. The AMACING trial participants all have eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m² combined with risk factors (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, old age, anaemia, nephrotoxic medication), are from miscellaneous specialties in the elective setting, and received either intravenous (52%) or intra-arterial (48%) iodinated contrast material. Furthermore, all elective procedures with either intravenous or intra-arterial iodinated contrast material administration were screened for inclusion in this trial, and the results therefore reflect daily clinical practice in the elective setting.

### Long-term safety of withholding standard prophylaxis in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^116B1ahL]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the latest ESUR contrast media guidelines, standard prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the absence of solid evidence, guideline updates are often based on indirect evidence and expert opinion. Likewise, evidence supporting the withdrawal of standard prophylaxis in moderate CKD patients was scarce and mostly indirect, but did include one randomised controlled trial evaluating guideline-recommended standard prophylactic intravenous hydration against a group receiving no prophylaxis (A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline (AMACING) trial). Since then, benefits of the updated guideline recommendation for patient and hospital burden have been numerated and were shown to be substantial. The current special report provides data on long-term safety from the AMACING randomised controlled trial. KEY POINTS:
- In the latest version of ESUR clinical practice guidelines for safe use of contrast media, standard prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with moderate chronic kidney disease.
- Benefits of this change in recommendations for patient and hospital burden have been numerated. The current report provides data on long-term safety from the AMACING randomised controlled trial.
- No disadvantage of withholding prophylaxis could be discerned. Results suggest that, in this population, underlying disease is more relevant for survival and prognosis than contrast administration itself.

### Prophylactic intravenous hydration to protect renal function from intravascular iodinated contrast material (AMACING): long-term results of a prospective, randomised, controlled trial [^1154TUaQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), also known as contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), is marked by a decline in renal function typically occurring 2 to 5 days after intravenous or intra-arterial iodinated contrast material administration. This phenomenon primarily affects patients whose renal function is already compromised. It usually resolves spontaneously, leaving no lasting effects, but is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. No treatment for CIN/CI-AKI exists, therefore the focus lies on prevention.

Guidelines on the use of intravascular iodinated contrast material administration exist in most countries and are implemented in most hospitals. They generally recommend intravascular volume expansion with isotonic saline as standard prophylaxis for those considered at risk of CIN/CI-AKI. This recommendation has far-reaching consequences for patient, hospital, and health care budgets, because the peri-procedural prophylactic treatment requires hospitalisation for up to 24 h. Furthermore, the impact is substantial given the estimated > 75 million procedures with intravascular iodinated contrast material done worldwide annually.

### Impact on clinical practice of updated guidelines on iodinated contrast material: CINART [^1115Aogo]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Guidelines on safe use of iodinated contrast material recommend intravenous prophylactic hydration to prevent post-contrast adverse (renal) effects. The AMACING (A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline) trial showed that standard prophylaxis was not effective in the majority of patients targeted by the guidelines, a result which was confirmed by 1-year follow-up data. Benefits of standard prophylactic intravenous hydration, such as a reduction in post-contrast acute kidney injury and/or long-term adverse effects, were not found. The main differences between randomised groups with and without prophylaxis were rates of complications after prophylaxis (5.5% vs 0.0%) and costs (€1455 vs €792). The latter difference was mainly due to the hospitalisation required for prophylaxis, which is also the main burden for patients and hospitals associated with prophylaxis.

Recently guidelines have been updated, and standard prophylaxis is no longer routinely recommended for patients like those who participated in the AMACING trial (i.e. with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m 2 combined with risk factors). The changes in the recommendations on standard prophylaxis for elective patients in the Dutch (The Radiological Society of The Netherlands, NVvR) and European (European Society of Urogenital Radiology, ESUR) guidelines are summarised in Table 1.

### Evaluation of safety guidelines on the use of iodinated contrast material: conundrum continued [^116TiGGA]. Investigative Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recently, safety guidelines for the use of intravascular iodinated contrast material have been updated, and the recommended threshold for giving prophylaxis to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has been reduced to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m. Data on this population in the context of CIN, especially evidence for efficacy of the recommendation of prophylactic intravenous hydration, are lacking. The aim of the current study was to test implicit assumptions underlying the guideline update: (1) patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m, as opposed to former high-risk patients with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m, are at high risk of CIN and other unfavorable outcomes after intravascular iodinated contrast material administration; (2) prophylactic intravenous hydration mitigates this risk; and (3) the risk of administering prophylactic intravenous hydration does not outweigh the positive preventive effect.

Materials and Methods

Retrospectively, data were collected from all patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m referred for an elective procedure with intravascular iodinated contrast material administration and excluded from the AMACING trial (A MAastricht Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Guideline trial). We compared these patients with those prospectively included in the AMACING trial (with eGFR 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m and risk factors). Main outcomes were CIN (defined as an increase in serum creatinine by more than 25% or 44 μmol/L within 2–6 days postcontrast exposure), dialysis and mortality within 35 days postcontrast exposure, and complications of prophylactic intravenous hydration.

Results

A total of 28,803 patients referred for an elective procedure with intravascular iodinated contrast administration were prospectively screened for inclusion in the AMACING trial. One hundred fifty-seven (0.5%) patients had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m, and 155 received intravascular iodinated contrast material. Standard prophylaxis was given to 119/155 of these patients. Data on 2- to 6-day serum creatinine, 35-day dialysis 35-day mortality, and complications of prophylactic intravenous hydration were available for 59/119 (50%), 118/119 (99%), 119/119 (100%), and 119/119 (100%) standard prophylaxis patients, respectively. Incidences in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m versus AMACING patients are as follows: CIN 13.6% versus 2.7% (P = 0.0019); 35-day dialysis 0.9% versus 0.0% (P = 0.2646); 35-day mortality 9.2% versus 0.0% (P < 0.0001); complications of prophylactic intravenous hydration 5.9% versus 5.5% (P = 0.8529).

Conclusions

Postcontrast incidences of CIN and mortality at 35 days are significantly higher in the population with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m than in the former high-risk population with eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m, even after prophylactic intravenous hydration. The risk of complications of prophylactic intravenous hydration is similar and substantial in both populations. Obtaining evidence from a randomized trial that efficacy of prophylactic intravenous hydration outweighs the risk of complications is important but may not be feasible.

### Long-term safety of withholding standard prophylaxis in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [^115vb7Qn]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Change in eGFR from baseline at 5 years post-contrast in the standard prophylaxis (H+) and no prophylaxis (H−) groups of the AMACING randomised controlled trial (RCT). eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate. Median change in eGFR was − 2.4 ml/min/1.73 m² (IQR − 10.9 to 5.8) for the H+ group and − 0.5 ml/min/1.73 m² for the H− group (IQR − 8.8 to 8.6, p = 0.051)

All in all, no disadvantage of withholding prophylaxis could be discerned. These results confirm that the relevant update in the ESUR contrast media guideline is not only beneficial in terms of patient and hospital burden, it is also safe. The high overall mortality, of which only a tiny portion was related to renal function and most was related to cancer and cardiovascular disease, suggests that in this population, despite the elective setting, underlying disease and thus contrast procedure indication is more relevant for survival and prognosis than contrast administration itself.

The next step in this field would be to evaluate the remaining advice on the prevention of PC-AKI for patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/m², for whom standard prophylaxis is still recommended. However, this is a difficult task due to the relative scarcity of patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/m² (elective procedures yield only 0.5% such patients) and their fragility (for example, incidences of 1-month post-contrast mortality and dialysis are approximately 8% and 2%).

Conclusions

Prophylaxis with PO hydration is at least as effective as IV hydration in preventing CIN in patients with both CKD and normal kidney function. PO hydration is cheaper and more easily administered than IV hydration, and might be more acceptable to the patients and cost-effective.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^114Uy9ta]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous volume expansion versus oral hydration for prevention of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI): IV volume expansion reduces the risk of AKI but oral fluid administration does not, and a single meta-analysis included 513 patients in six trials comparing IV saline (five trials utilizing isotonic [0.9%] saline and one trial utilizing 0.45% saline) to various oral regimens. In the only study directly comparing IV isotonic saline to unrestricted oral fluids, only one patient (3.7%) in the saline group developed CA-AKI (defined as an increase in serum creatinine [sCr] by 0.5 mg/dl within 48 hours) versus nine patients (34.6%) with oral hydration (p = 0.005), and the study was terminated early after only 53 patients were enrolled; however, the strength of evidence was Very low and showed no change in incidence when comparing IV isotonic saline to oral mineral water, IV sodium bicarbonate, oral sodium bicarbonate, and water. In one non-inferiority trial there was no significant difference in AKI incidence 2–5 days after receiving contrast (Oral: 4.8% vs. IV: 3.1%; 95% CI: -4.2 to 7), and based on this data, neither oral hydration nor oral sodium loading should be considered adequate as the primary means of prophylaxis in individuals at high-risk for CA-AKI.

### Effect of No prehydration vs sodium bicarbonate prehydration prior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography in the prevention of postcontrast acute kidney injury in adults with chronic kidney disease: the kompas randomized clinical trial [^117EFRGd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Prevention of postcontrast acute kidney injury in patients with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) by means of prehydration has been standard care for years. However, evidence for the need for prehydration in this group is limited.

Objective

To assess the renal safety of omitting prophylactic prehydration prior to iodine-based contrast media administration in patients with stage 3 CKD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Kompas trial was a multicenter, noninferiority, randomized clinical trial conducted at 6 hospitals in the Netherlands in which 523 patients with stage 3 CKD were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive no prehydration or prehydration with 250 mL of 1.4% sodium bicarbonate administered in a 1-hour infusion before undergoing elective contrast-enhanced computed tomography from April 2013 through September 2016. Final follow-up was completed in September 2017. Data were analyzed from January 2018 to June 2019.

Interventions

In total, 262 patients were allocated to the no prehydration group and 261 were allocated to receive prehydration. Analysis on the primary end point was available in 505 patients (96.6%).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the mean relative increase in serum creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline (noninferiority margin of less than 10% increase in serum creatinine level). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of postcontrast acute kidney injury 2 to 5 days after contrast administration, mean relative increase in creatinine level 7 to 14 days after contrast administration, incidences of acute heart failure and renal failure requiring dialysis, and health care costs.

Results

Of 554 patients randomized, 523 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The median (interquartile range) age was 74 (67–79) years; 336 (64.2%) were men and 187 (35.8%) were women. The mean (SD) relative increase in creatinine level 2 to 5 days after contrast administration compared with baseline was 3.0% (10.5) in the no prehydration group vs 3.5% (10.3) in the prehydration group (mean difference, 0.5; 95% CI, -1.3 to 2.3; P < .001 for noninferiority). Postcontrast acute kidney injury occurred in 11 patients (2.1%), including 7 of 262 (2.7%) in the no prehydration group and 4 of 261 (1.5%) in the prehydration group, which resulted in a relative risk of 1.7 (95% CI, 0.5–5.9; P = 0.36). None of the patients required dialysis or developed acute heart failure. Subgroup analyses showed no evidence of statistical interactions between treatment arms and predefined subgroups. Mean hydration costs were €119 (US $143.94) per patient in the prehydration group compared with €0 (US $0) in the no prehydration group (P < .001). Other health care costs were similar.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with stage 3 CKD undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography, withholding prehydration did not compromise patient safety. The findings of this study support the option of not giving prehydration as a safe and cost-efficient measure.

### Systematic oral hydration with water is similar to parenteral hydration for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy: an updated meta-analysis of randomised clinical data [^111CQgow]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Comparison with other meta-analysis

There were two meta-analyses published so far which included six trials. Our study is more representative of a comparison of PO and IV hydration regimens since we excluded two trials as they did not meet our inclusion criteria, as the patients received additional treatments along with hydration but were included in the prior analyses. PREPARED trialwas excluded as the PO hydration arm received additional IV hydration with half normal saline and RCT by Lawlor et al was excluded since they administered N -acetyl cysteine in addition to the hydration regimen. One additional randomised trial has been published since the prior meta-analysis. We have also performed the subgroup analysis of patients with normal kidney function and CKD at enrolment and calculated the SMD for change in creatinine along with a meta-regression to study the heterogeneity across the studies.

Hydration in general has been accepted as the cornerstone to prevent CIN; however, there is no consensus regarding the mode of administration. As illustrated in ours and prior meta-analyses, PO fluids are as effective as IV fluids. However, the data is based on only a few small studies with some inherent bias which is limiting their ability to change the practice. Hence, larger multicentre and higher quality randomised clinical trials are necessary to change the practice. In modern medicine, with an evolving number of diagnostic studies that depend on iodinated contrast along with an increasing number of complex high-risk patients, CIN is becoming a common cause of iatrogenic harm, so much so that even small improvements would lead to large reductions in CIN and thus better patient care. Similarly, costs of hospitalisations, nursing care and IV medication are increasing and since PO hydration has similar efficacy to IV fluids in preventing CIN, its wide-spread acceptance will have a greater impact on procedural costs.

3and suggest that independent of the amount of hydration received, frequent visits and assessments by research nurses may result in significant improvement in the perception of overall benefit, to the extent that it may even overshadow the biomedical effect of hydration. One possible way to circumvent the potential dramatic effect of nursing interventions may be by training family members to administer fluids and limiting the frequency of phone calls and assessments to the first and last day of study. In addition to our clinical findings reported here, we were also able to collect patient and family perceptions of hydration, which we published recently. 38–40We observed a significant deterioration in MDAS and RASS scores for both groups. This is not surprising given the trajectory of illness and the fact that we excluded patients with delirium upfront.

Interestingly, we observed a trend for lesser decline in the hydration group and significant worsening of nighttime NuDesc scores in the placebo group. Future studies may need to include patients with delirium, who may actually benefit the most from hydration. This could be done by either obtaining informed consent before this complication occurs or by using proxy consent.

Clinical scenario and hydration protocols of included trials

Table 2
Characteristics of the included randomised clinical trials

The incidence of CIN was 7.7% and 8.2% in the IV and PO arms, respectively, with a pooled RR of 0.97 (95% CI 0.36 to 2.94), which was not statistically significant (p = 0.95; I² = 48%) (figure 4). In view of the moderate heterogeneity, we conducted a subgroup analysis to examine the incidence of CIN separately in patients with CKD and normal kidney function and there was no statistical difference on either groups (figure 4). Among these, four studies with 324 patients were conducted exclusively in patients undergoing coronary procedures and there was no significant difference in the incidence of CIN in the IV versus PO arm (8.2% vs 9.6%, respectively; RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.27 to 4.8; p = 0.8; I² = 60%). Three studies with 275 participants reported changes in serum creatinine at 48–72 h. Patients receiving PO hydration had a statistically significant lower rise in serum creatinine compared with the IV hydration group with a pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of 0.04, (95% CI 0.03 to 0.06; p < 0.001; I² = 62%) (figure 5). Four studies with 428 participants reported the requirement of dialysis and no patients in either arm required dialysis after the index procedure. There appears to be no heterogeneity across studies evaluating PO versus IV hydration with respect to specific characteristics included in the meta-regression (table 3). No publication bias was found in this analysis with a bias coefficient of 0.97 (95% CI −10.59 to 12.53; p = 0.8) (figure 2).

Isotonic normal saline is known to be more protective in the prevention of CIN than an equivalent amount of hypotonic saline, and all the trials in our analysis used normal saline for IV hydration but different regimens. Cho et al administered a bolus of IV normal saline solution over 1 h prior to contrast administration, while others used a continuous regimen of IV fluids beginning 6 hor 12 hprior to the procedure. The PO hydration protocol varied greatly, with no two trials having a similar PO regimen. Except for Trivedi et al, who recommended unrestricted PO fluids, all other trials had prespecified outpatient PO regimens. Dussol et al used salt tablets (1 g/10 kg of body weight/day) for 48 h before procedure; Wrobel et al administered mineral water (1 mL/kg/h) starting 6–12 h before, during and 12 h after procedure while Cho et al recommended at least 1100 mL of regular water with 500 mL 4 h prior to and 600 mL after the procedure; and Kong et al recommended 2000 or 2500 mL of water with at least 2000 mL of hydration postprocedure (table 1).

### Exploring the effect of differing centre hydration and anti-emetic policies on acute gastrointestinal and renal toxicities in the De-ESCALaTE trial [^112seKWH]. BJC Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design

The De-ESCALaTE trial was an international, unblinded, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy (70 Gy in 35 fractions) with either three doses of IV cisplatin 100 mg/m² on days 1, 22 and 43 of radiotherapy (control) or IV cetuximab 400 mg/m² loading dose one week prior to radiotherapy followed by seven weekly infusions of 250 mg/m² during radiotherapy (intervention).

Patients

Patients were recruited by their treating clinicians and all provided written informed consent. Study participants had to be low-risk HPV + OPC, non-smokers or had a lifetime self-reported smoking history of < 10 pack-years, and had a tumour sample that was positive on p16 immunohistochemistry. Patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0 or 1, and adequate renal, haematological and hepatic function for cisplatin-based, curative chemoradiotherapy. In addition, only patients who were eligible for De-ESCALaTE and had received at least one cycle of cisplatin were included in this analysis.

### Tailored versus standard hydration to prevent acute kidney injury after percutaneous coronary intervention: network meta-analysis [^111rks54]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity Analysis

Although trial design was somewhat homogeneous across most included studies, the work by Maioli et al, who compared BIVA‐guided versus a fixed hydration strategy, differed significantly. Specifically, patient volume status was evaluated before randomization, and only subjects with low total body water (as assessed noninvasively with BIVA) were considered eligible to take part in the study and subsequently randomly assigned to receive a standard or a high‐volume hydration regimen. Consequently, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding this study. Effect estimates and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values did not substantially change compared with the primary analysis: UFR‐guided and CVP‐guided hydration were still more efficacious in CI‐AKI prevention than fixed hydration (OR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.19–0.54] and OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21–0.97], respectively). Similarly, no differences were found across any comparison in terms of pulmonary edema. Sensitivity analyses league tables are shown in Table S4.

Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) prophylaxis during angiography — intravenous (IV) sodium bicarbonate versus isotonic crystalloid: In a 2x2 factorial randomized trial of 4,993 patients with diabetes mellitus with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m² or without diabetes and an eGFR < 45 mL/minute/1.73 m² undergoing coronary or non-coronary angiography, CA-AKI occurred in 9.5% with isotonic sodium bicarbonate versus 8.3% with isotonic saline, and the primary endpoint at Day 90 occurred in 4.4% versus 4.7%; additionally, one RCT showed no difference in CA-AKI incidence between IV balanced salt solution and IV isotonic saline. The 2019 Work Group concluded that there was a potential risk of harm associated with sodium bicarbonate administration as well as risk of compounding errors and increased cost without evidence of benefit and recommends volume expansion with IV isotonic crystalloid solutions, when appropriate.

### A comparison between dexamethasone and methylprednisolone for vomiting prophylaxis after tonsillectomy in inpatient children: a randomized trial [^115J7mrQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The frequent incidence of postoperative vomiting in children undergoing tonsillectomy, in addition to the occurrence of severe pain, may delay postoperative oral intake and lead to increased risk of dehydration. Thus, prophylactic therapy is indicated in this high-risk group. Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone, have anti-inflammatory and antiemetic properties with dexamethasone being frequently used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone should be noninferior to dexamethasone for the prevention of vomiting in children after tonsillectomy.

Methods

We designed a randomized double-blind trial to compare the efficacy of a single prophylactic dose of 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone with a dose of 2.5 mg/kg methylprednisolone on the incidence of postoperative vomiting during the first 24 hours (primary outcome) in children undergoing total or partial tonsillectomy with a noninferiority margin set at 9%. One hundred sixty children undergoing total or partial tonsillectomy under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive either IV dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg (n = 79) or methylprednisolone 2.5 mg/kg (n = 81) after induction of anesthesia. Secondary analysis of all studied outcomes was also performed according to the type of surgery.

Results

An intention-to-treat analysis showed an overall incidence of vomiting of 30% in the dexamethasone group and of 22% in the methylprednisolone group (difference: 8%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -5% to 21%). A per protocol analysis showed an incidence of vomiting of 32% and 23%, respectively (difference: 9%, and 95% CI of the difference: -5 to 23%, P(sup) = 0.28). The time and quality of oral intake and the duration of IV hydration, as well as pain and satisfaction scores and the need for analgesics, were similar between the 2 groups. The incidence of vomiting was also similar in patients who had total versus partial tonsillectomy; however, time to first oral intake, duration of IV hydration, and the need for analgesics were less with better satisfaction scores in partial versus total tonsillectomy patients.

Conclusion

Methylprednisolone is at worst 5% less effective than dexamethasone by the intention-to-treat analysis, and by the per protocol analysis. Thus, it is noninferior to dexamethasone in preventing vomiting after tonsillectomy in children.

### Systematic oral hydration with water is similar to parenteral hydration for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy: an updated meta-analysis of randomised clinical data [^1136twcF]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study selection

This meta-analysis was designed in accordance with the principles set by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), using the terms "oral" "intravenous" "hydration" and "contrast induced nephropathy". There were no limitations applied for the search criteria. References from original and review articles were hand-searched for additional studies.

Two authors (SKA and GNN) independently reviewed all identified publications and abstracts for analysis based on predetermined inclusion criteria. These inclusion criteria were (1) randomised clinical trials; (2) head-to-head comparison between PO and IV hydration; (3) outcomes of interest included development of CIN or change in creatinine and (4) no additional treatments in either arm. Studies were retrieved and references were reviewed using the title and abstract for their relevance. After the initial screening step, studies that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved in full and included in the analysis if they met the inclusion criteria. Conflicts were resolved by consensus and the help of a third reviewer (AMB).

The primary outcome of the study was to determine the efficacy of PO hydration in preventing CIN in comparison to IV hydration. Secondary outcomes included changes in creatinine at 48–72 h of contrast exposure and the requirement for renal replacement therapy.

Data extraction

Information regarding study characteristics, demographics, publication year, patient characteristics, type of procedure, contrast type and volume, PO and IV hydration regimen, and clinical outcomes including CIN and creatinine level after 48–72 h of the index procedure was recorded in a standardised Microsoft Excel sheet. We also collected information on the randomisation method, allocation concealment and blinding.

### Systematic oral hydration with water is similar to parenteral hydration for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy: an updated meta-analysis of randomised clinical data [^111ZHnKv]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is the third most common cause of hospital-acquired kidney injury and is related to increased long-term morbidity and mortality. Adequate intravenous (IV) hydration has been demonstrated to lessen its occurrence. Oral (PO) hydration with water is inexpensive and readily available but its role for CIN prevention is yet to be determined.

Methods

PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL) databases were searched until April 2015 and studies were selected using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. All randomised clinical trials with head-to-head comparison between PO and IV hydration were included.

Results

A total of 5 studies with 477 patients were included in the analysis, 255 of those receiving PO water. The incidence of CIN was statistically similar in the IV and PO arms (7.7% and 8.2%, respectively; relative risk 0.97; 95% CI 0.36 to 2.94; p = 0.95). The incidence of CIN was statistically similar in the IV and PO arms in patients with chronic kidney disease and with normal renal function. Rise in creatinine at 48–72 h was lower in the PO hydration group compared with IV hydration (pooled standard mean difference 0.04; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.06; p < 0.001; I² = 62%).

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis shows that systematic PO hydration with water is at least as effective as IV hydration with saline to prevent CIN. PO hydration is cheaper and more easily administered than IV hydration, thus making it more attractive and just as effective.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^116rEC4q]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

We searched MEDLINE using the search terms "noninferiority", "noninferior", "non-inferiority", and "non-inferior" combined with the name of the journals as recognized by MEDLINE and published between June 1, 2011, and November 1, 2016. We limited our search to the five highest-impact general medical journals in order to focus on the most widely cited and possibly highest-quality articles. – We reviewed the resulting abstracts to identify articles that met our inclusion criteria: prospective, parallel-group randomized controlled trials where the primary outcome was tested using a noninferiority hypothesis. We then reviewed the full manuscripts and excluded trials that had a cluster-randomized design, trials where the data were incomplete or could not be summarized, those that used a Bayesian methodology, and those that did not use an AC (e.g. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-mandated placebo-controlled post-approval safety studies). One author (SKA) abstracted the data from the trials into a standardized form and employed a system of redundant checks to ensure data accuracy. Another author (AMH) checked a sample of the data to ensure accuracy. We tabulated basic data about the trial including methodological and statistical design as reported. In trials where more than one analysis was reported (e.g. intention-to-treat [ITT], per-protocol [PP], as-treated [AT]), we determined whether the results differed depending on the analytical method.

We characterized trial results in terms of the point estimate and confidence intervals in accord with Figure 1 of the CONSORT statement, using a 95% two-sided confidence interval, calculated from the raw numbers provided in the manuscript, and coded the trial authors' conclusions regarding declarations of noninferiority, superiority, inferiority, or inconclusive results, and whether they differed from CONSORT. We used the first outcome mentioned in the manuscript as the primary outcome for our data set when multiple outcomes were reported. Some trials compared multiple interventions, e.g. multiple doses of a new drug against one AC group, and we considered these to represent separate comparisons. In determining whether justification for the selection of a delta value was presented, we coded trials as having "none" if no mention whatsoever was made as to how it was selected, "abstract" if some mention was made but it was vague or irreproducible, and "concrete" if an explicit reproducible justification was provided.

### Study details | A maastricht contrast-induced nephropathy… [^114ExtC6]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Indeed, zero incidence of dialysis and mortality is consistently reported after intravenous contrast administration, even in patients with severe renal insufficiency and in absence of prophylactic treatment. Since intravenous contrast administration procedures make up more than an estimated 70% of all contrast procedures this implies that prophylactic intravenous hydration is superfluous in the majority of patients currently receiving it. This patient population is also the larger proportion of patients to be included in our randomized controlled trial
- an estimated 75%
- who are therefore not thought to incur any risk from participation and not receiving prophylactic intravenous hydration.

In a recent Dutch study on CIN, 35 of 454 patients at risk of CIN according to current guidelines did not receive prophylactic intravenous hydration; yet the incidence of CIN in this subgroup was not significantly higher than that found in the population having received prophylactic treatment. Furthermore, in studies including patients receiving contrast material without prophylactic intravenous hydration, and having severely diminished renal function, low CIN incidences were seen, and zero long term adverse effects were reported. A study performed in a Dutch hospital using Dutch CIN prevention guidelines reported an incidence of serious complications of intravenous hydration of 1. 4% in hydrated patients.

The incidence of clinically relevant events after CIN is < 1% when monomeric non-ionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast material is used, thus putting the appropriateness of the prophylactic treatment to question, and highlighting the importance of its evaluation against a proper control group not receiving intravenous hydration. The AMACING study will be pivotal in deciding the future role of prophylactic intravenous hydration in routine clinical practice. Considering the potential benefits of the results of this study to a large population
- who are perhaps burdened with unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments
- and the potential benefits to our health care system in terms of efficiency and costs, we believe the risk for all patients included in this RCT is acceptable.
- at risk of developing CIN according to the CBO prevention guidelines and referred for prophylactic intravenous hydration. [the 4 high risk groups according to the guidelines are: 1.

### A randomized comparison of 1-h sodium bicarbonate hydration versus standard peri-procedural saline hydration in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing intravenous contrast-enhanced computerized tomography [^116G9ksm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend saline hydration for prophylaxis of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing intravenous contrast media-enhanced CT (CE-CT). The safety and efficacy of a brief hydration protocol using sodium bicarbonate in this population is unknown. We analysed whether 1-h sodium bicarbonate hydration prior to CE-CT is non-inferior to saline hydration prior to and after CE-CT in CKD patients.

Methods

We performed an open-label multicentre randomized trial. Patients were randomized to 250 mL of 1.4% sodium bicarbonate hydration prior to CE-CT or 1000 mL of 0.9% saline hydration prior to and, once again, after CE-CT. Primary outcome was the relative increase in serum creatinine 48–96 h post-CE-CT. Secondary outcomes were incidence of CI-AKI [serum creatinine increase > 25%/ > 44 µmol/L (0.5 mg/dL)], recovery of renal function, the need for dialysis and 2-month hospital costs.

Results

Five hundred and seventy adult CKD patients undergoing CE-CT were randomized between 2010 and 2012, of whom 548 were included in the intention-to-treat population. Mean relative serum creatinine increase was 1.2% for sodium bicarbonate and 1.5% for saline (mean difference -0.3%; 95% confidence interval -2.7 to 2.1, P-value for non-inferiority < 0.0001). CI-AKI occurred in 22 patients (4.1%); 8 (3.0%) randomized to sodium bicarbonate versus 14 (5.1%) to saline (P = 0.23). Renal function recovered in 75 and 69% of CI-AKI patients, respectively (P = 0.81). No patients developed a need for dialysis. Mean hydration costs per patient were €224 for the sodium bicarbonate and €683 for the saline regime (P < 0.001). Other healthcare costs were similar.

Conclusions

Short hydration with sodium bicarbonate prior to CE-CT was non-inferior to peri-procedural saline hydration with respect to renal safety and may result in healthcare savings.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^114LyZvy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Plot of 151 comparisons of absolute risk differences as a function of the log of the total number of patients analyzed in the trial, color coded by the interpretation of the results as recommended by CONSORT. See text for details.

Figure 4
Plot of 151 comparisons with a calculable absolute risk difference as in Figure 3, but with statistically significant results in favor of active control (AC), coded as inconclusive or noninferior in Figure 3, denoted by red in Figure 4.

In five of the comparisons where the authors used an alpha threshold less stringent than a two-sided 0.05 equivalent, our use of a two-sided 95% confidence interval changed the conclusions. In each of these cases, the more stringent confidence interval made the result less favorable for the NT. In one trial, use of a two-sided 95% confidence interval changed the result from superior to noninferior. In three trials, the use of a two-sided 95% confidence interval caused a change in the classification of the result from scenario 6 (inconclusive) to scenario 7 (the NT is statistically significantly worse but the result is deemed inconclusive), and in one trialit changed a scenario 3 (noninferior) to scenario 7 (inconclusive). In all these instances, it was the change from a one-sided to a two-sided confidence interval that changed the categorization of the result, rather than increased stringency from the use of a smaller one-sided alpha value. In the most extreme case (antibiotics vs. appendectomy for acute appendicitis), the use of a one-sided confidence interval concealed a large and highly statistically significant result in favor of the AC (absolute difference = 27%; 95% CI 21.3–32.9%). Two other trials had statistically significant results favoring the AC by 7% or more that were concealed by the CONSORT interpretative framework.

### Interpreting the results of noninferiority trials-a review [^111gy7ms]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Noninferiority extends these possibilities by determining if the new treatment is "not substantially worse" than the standard treatment based on the confidence interval of this difference not including a predefined unfavourable difference in outcomes — the noninferiority margin. In the literature, noninferiority has sometimes been used when the difference between two treatments is inconclusive without reference to a noninferiority margin. Such use is inappropriate. An inconclusive outcome simply means that no statistically significant difference was seen between the two treatments. If the trial was underpowered the actual difference might still be substantial. It is important to recognise that a further requirement for inferiority is that the confidence interval excludes the predefined noninferiority margin. This guarantees that with high confidence (usually 95%) the new treatment is not substantially worse than the standard treatment (i.e. not worse by as much as the predefined amount). Thus for a noninferiority margin of 10%, a treatment that was 3% worse with a 95% confidence interval of 15% worse to 9% better cannot be said to be noninferior (because it could be as much as 15% worse). However, if the confidence interval was from 7% worse to 1% better, it would be considered noninferior for this noninferiority margin, even though it is statistically significantly worse (the 95% confidence interval excludes no difference). Thus, while an inconclusive finding does not directly provide any information on the performance of the two treatments, a noninferior finding implies that compared with the standard treatment, the new treatment is at most worse by no more than a predefined amount. If the new treatment has other benefits, such as fewer side effects, lower cost, or ease in delivery, this may be acceptable.

### Reducing inferiority in the design, conduct, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^113MqM7n]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The current approach to noninferiority may itself be inferior at present. As has been recommended in the past, composite endpoints with diverging responses in individual components to pharmacologic or device therapy are not appropriate (eg, combing bleeding and efficacy endpoints) as they drive the result to noninferiority while masking important differences in the safety and efficacy of the strategies. Just as clinicians and patients do in their decision-making, safety and efficacy data should be considered separately, and decisions should be based upon the totality of what are often divergent data. Rather than using noninferiority, superiority in safety (bleeding) of a new strategy could be established, and broader, more well powered patient centric endpoints such as death and hospitalization could be used to assess efficacy. Careful monitoring of event rates is warranted, and should they be lower than expected, sample sizes could be increased, or patient risk could be increased. Given the frequency with which noninferiority trials may be underpowered and no longer statistically significant when analysis is based upon actual event rates, regulators, journal editors, trialists and clinicians should require that both an absolute and a relative margin be assessed before a therapy is truly deemed to be noninferior to another. If there are concerns regarding the magnitude of missing data, tipping analyses should be performed to assess the robustness of the non-inferiority findings. These modifications may represent a superior approach to the current deficiencies in noninferiority trials.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^116x6u5s]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In determining whether the NT had advantages that justified its evaluation using a noninferiority design, we coded trials as having "none" if no advantages were mentioned nor could they be inferred, "inferred" if none were reported but they could be inferred, and "explicit" if the purported advantages of the NT were explicitly stated in the manuscript. Because we were interested in the numerical statistical design features of the trials, we did not perform a subjective quality analysis as is done in a traditional meta-analysis. Likewise, because of highly variable reporting of sponsor and funding sources, and the investigators' independence from them or lack thereof, we did not abstract these data.

Summary statistics are presented for abstracted values. Chi-square and Student's t tests were used for exploratory analyses. Stata version 14 software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used for all analyses, including recalculation of two-sided 95% confidence intervals.

### Efficacy of hydration combined with rectal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) versus NSAIDs alone for the prevention of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115eYSWT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of pharmacological prophylaxis for PEP, NSAIDs are currently the most widely and evidence-based method. A landmark study conducted by Elmunzer et al. in 2012 provided strong evidence supporting the efficacy of rectal NSAIDs in preventing PEP, corroborating findings from numerous prior randomized controlled trials. The administration of a 100 mg suppository of indomethacin or diclofenac rectally within 30 min prior to the procedure has since become the standard of care, and is recommended by all major international professional societies.

Previous studies have suggested that NSAIDs may prevent PEP by inhibiting prostaglandins and phospholipase A2, both of which are considered to play key roles in the pathogenesis of PEP. In contrast, the mechanism of hydration is believed to involve improvement of pancreatic microcirculation. Makhzangy et al. proposed that intravenous fluid administration can replenish intravascular volume, reduce drug concentrations in the blood, and enhance tissue perfusion, thereby preventing systemic inflammatory response syndrome, multiple organ failure, and reducing mortality. Therefore, hydration and rectal NSAIDs exert their prophylactic effects against PEP through fundamentally different mechanisms. Currently, there is no clear evidence or rationale to suggest that their effects negate one another. Our meta-analysis showed that although the combination did not reach statistical significance compared to NSAIDs alone, it was associated with a lower incidence of PEP.

### Meta-analysis: effectiveness of drugs for preventing contrast-induced nephropathy [^116Kb3fL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

N-Acetylcysteine, theophylline, and other agents have shown inconsistent results in reducing contrast-induced nephropathy.

Purpose

To determine the effect of these agents on preventing nephropathy.

Data Sources

Relevant randomized, controlled trials were identified by computerized searches in MEDLINE (from 1966 through 3 November 2006), EMBASE (1980 through November 2006), PubMed, Web of Knowledge (Current Contents Connect, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, and ISI Proceedings for the latest 5 years), and the Cochrane Library databases (up to November 2006). Databases were searched for studies in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials that administered N-acetylcysteine, theophylline, fenoldopam, dopamine, iloprost, statin, furosemide, or mannitol to a treatment group; used intravenous iodinated contrast; defined contrast-induced nephropathy explicitly; and reported sufficient data to construct a 2 x 2 table of the primary effect measure.

Data Extraction

Abstracted information included patient characteristics, type of contrast media and dose, periprocedural hydration, definition of contrast-induced nephropathy, and prophylactic agent dose and route.

Data Synthesis

In the 41 studies included, N-acetylcysteine (relative risk, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.44 to 0.88]) and theophylline (relative risk, 0.49 [CI, 0.23 to 1.06]) reduced the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy more than saline alone, whereas furosemide increased it (relative risk, 3.27 [CI, 1.48 to 7.26]). The remaining agents did not significantly affect risk. Significant subgroup heterogeneity was present only for N-acetylcysteine. No publication bias was discerned.

Limitations

All trials evaluated the surrogate end point of contrast-induced nephropathy as the primary outcome. The lack of a statistically significant renoprotective effect of theophylline may result from insufficient data or study heterogeneity. True study quality remains uncertain.

Conclusion

N-acetylcysteine is more renoprotective than hydration alone. Theophylline may also reduce risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, although the detected association was not significant. Our data support the administration of N-acetylcysteine prophylaxis, particularly in high-risk patients, given its low cost, availability, and few side effects.

### Carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients with renal impairment: pharmacokinetics and safety [^1155vSgA]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Study design and drug dosing

Carfilzomib was administered by IV infusion over 2–10 min on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of a 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles. The dose of carfilzomib in Cycle 1 was 15 mg/m². If this dose was tolerated, it was increased to 20 mg/m² at Cycle 2, and to 27 mg/m² at Cycle 3 and for all subsequent cycles as tolerated. Patients who experienced an adverse event (AE) were permitted a one-level dose reduction of carfilzomib (for example, from 27 mg/m 2 to 20 mg/m 2); after 1 cycle at the lower dose and resolution of the AE, the previous dose could be resumed. If toxicity continued or recurred, the patient was either permitted a second dose reduction or was discontinued from the study at the discretion of the treating physician and the study medical monitor. Patients who discontinued treatment were followed for 2 years for survival and disease status unless they withdrew consent. Patients in whom there was continuing clinical benefit after 12 cycles could receive additional treatment with carfilzomib in a separate extension study (PX-171-010, NCT00884312).

On the basis of findings from earlier phase 1 and phase 2 studies, dexamethasone 4 mg was administered before carfilzomib dosing during Cycle 1 and could be continued in subsequent cycles if treatment-related fever, chills, and/or dyspnea were observed. In addition, patients with less than partial response (PR) after Cycle 2 or less than complete response after Cycle 4 were eligible to receive dexamethasone 20 mg before each dose of carfilzomib to improve response; prophylactic antiviral therapy was also added in these patients. In addition, all patients were required to be well hydrated before dosing with carfilzomib. They were encouraged to consume at least 30 ml/kg/day orally for 48 h before carfilzomib dosing in all cycles; in addition, 250–500 mL of IV fluid were administered before and after each carfilzomib dose during Cycle 1. Hydration could be adjusted in patients on dialysis according to their hydration status. Optional allopurinol was provided to patients considered at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. Patients could receive red blood cell transfusions or supportive care with erythropoietin or darbepoetin in accordance with institutional guidelines.

Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality

Once papers were agreed for inclusion for each PICO, papers were independently analyzed by two group members (excluding any authors of the paper). Each member extracted key data and summarized the main findings in a standardized data extraction form, according to the study design. Concurrently the same two reviewers assessed the risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials and to the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for cohort studies. In case of disagreement, differences in assessment were resolved via discussion, involving the group leader(s) if required.

Data analysis

When appropriate, data were combined statistically in a meta-analysis. To be combined the data had to meet the following criteria: (1) more than one study; (2) the combined studies were of one study design either randomized trials or observational studies; (3) the population and the intervention were sufficiently similar; (4) the outcomes were the same, or for continuous outcome variables, data on the distribution of the variable was available; (5) the risk of bias was not considered critical according to the SIGN grading system. If two or more groups of patients in a same study were independent, we analyzed each sample as an independent study. Two biostatisticians (AB, JJP) conducted the meta-analyses, but did not participate in development of the recommendations or the voting process.

To compare experimental and control groups of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), we calculated the effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals using the mean difference for quantitative endpoints and odds ratio for qualitative endpoints, weighted by the inverse of the variance. The analyses were performed using a random effects model. The heterogeneity of outcomes was determined using chi-squared and Higgins I² tests: a p -value < 0.05 or an I² ≥ 50% indicated significant heterogeneity. If the heterogeneity was significant and the conditions for the validity of the analysis were verified, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results, excluding the most influential studies. The publication bias was explored for meta-analyses with four or more included studies using the funnel plots.

A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant; all p values were two-tailed. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager software (RevMan, Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).

### Making sense of noninferiority: a clinical and statistical perspective on its application to cardiovascular clinical trials [^116aR5H6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Active control noninferiority trials are being used with increasing frequency in new drug or device development when standard placebo-controlled trials are considered unethical. Nevertheless, the design and analysis of these trials are founded on a number of assumptions and arbitrary criteria that are generally not well understood or justifiable. Trials designed to show noninferiority require an appropriate reference population, a proven active control and dose, an appropriate margin of noninferiority that is clinically relevant and statistically justifiable, a high level of adherence to treatment, and adequate statistical power to reliably conclude that a treatment is truly noninferior and therefore effective. Accordingly, if noninferiority trials are to be applied to clinical and regulatory decisions regarding the marketing and use of new treatments, the assumptions must be made explicit and their influence on the resultant conclusions must be assessed rigorously. When conservative criteria were applied to each of the key assumptions underlying 2 representative noninferiority trials, they materially undermined the conclusions regarding noninferiority failing to confirm reported conclusions regarding noninferiority despite enthusiastic dissemination and acceptance of the results. Because the clinical, regulatory, and economic impact of active control noninferiority trials is substantial, robust criteria should be used routinely in their design, analysis, and interpretation to reach their intended objectives and to keep them from becoming wasted efforts.

### Effect of dilute apple juice and preferred fluids vs electrolyte maintenance solution on treatment failure among children with mild gastroenteritis: a randomized clinical trial [^1118D7SA]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Gastroenteritis is a common pediatric illness. Electrolyte maintenance solution is recommended to treat and prevent dehydration. Its advantage in minimally dehydrated children is unproven.

Objective

To determine if oral hydration with dilute apple juice/preferred fluids is noninferior to electrolyte maintenance solution in children with mild gastroenteritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, single-blind noninferiority trial conducted between the months of October and April during the years 2010 to 2015 in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Study participants were children aged 6 to 60 months with gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive color-matched half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids (n = 323) or apple-flavored electrolyte maintenance solution (n = 324). Oral rehydration therapy followed institutional protocols. After discharge, the half-strength apple juice/preferred fluids group was administered fluids as desired; the electrolyte maintenance solution group replaced losses with electrolyte maintenance solution.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of treatment failure defined by any of the following occurring within 7 days of enrollment: intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, subsequent unscheduled physician encounter, protracted symptoms, crossover, and 3% or more weight loss or significant dehydration at in-person follow-up. Secondary outcomes included intravenous rehydration, hospitalization, and frequency of diarrhea and vomiting. The noninferiority margin was defined as a difference between groups of 7.5% for the primary outcome and was assessed with a 1-sided α = .025. If noninferiority was established, a 1-sided test for superiority was conducted.

Results

Among 647 randomized children (mean age, 28.3 months; 331 boys [51.1%]; 441 (68.2%) without evidence of dehydration), 644 (99.5%) completed follow-up. Children who were administered dilute apple juice experienced treatment failure less often than those given electrolyte maintenance solution (16.7% vs 25.0%; difference, -8.3%; 97.5% CI, -∞ to -2.0%; P < .001 for inferiority and P = 0.006 for superiority). Fewer children administered apple juice/preferred fluids received intravenous rehydration (2.5% vs 9.0%; difference, -6.5%; 99% CI, -11.6% to -1.8%). Hospitalization rates and diarrhea and vomiting frequency were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration, initial oral hydration with dilute apple juice followed by their preferred fluids, compared with electrolyte maintenance solution, resulted in fewer treatment failures. In many high-income countries, the use of dilute apple juice and preferred fluids as desired may be an appropriate alternative to electrolyte maintenance fluids in children with mild gastroenteritis and minimal dehydration.

### How to use a noninferiority trial: users' guides to the medical literature [^115S92WN]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical investigators are increasingly testing treatments that have the primary benefit of decreased burden or harms relative to an existing standard. The goal of the resulting randomized trials — called noninferiority trials — is to establish that the novel treatment's effectiveness is not substantially less than the existing standard. Conclusions from these trials are, however, based on noninferiority thresholds specified by authors whose judgments may not coincide with those of patients and clinicians. This article highlights issues related to validity, interpretation, and applicability of results specific to noninferiority trials. Suboptimal administration of standard treatment or exclusive reliance on the analyze-as-randomized approach that is standard for conventional superiority trials may produce misleading results in noninferiority trials. Clinicians should judge whether the novel treatment's impact on effectiveness outcomes — the prime reason for wanting to prescribe it — is sufficiently close to that of standard treatment that they are comfortable substituting it for the existing standard. Trading off desirable and undesirable consequences is an individual decision: given the benefits of a novel treatment, some patients may perceive the uncertainty regarding a reduction in treatment effectiveness as acceptable while others may not.

### A randomized clinical trial of recombinant human hyaluronidase-facilitated subcutaneous versus intravenous rehydration in mild to moderately dehydrated children in the emergency department [^114cKHY8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Alternative treatment of dehydration is needed when intravenous (IV) or oral rehydration therapy fails. Subcutaneous (SC) hydration facilitated by recombinant human hyaluronidase offers an alternative treatment for dehydration. This clinical trial is the first to compare recombinant human hyaluronidase-facilitated SC (rHFSC) rehydration with standard IV rehydration for use in dehydrated children.

Objective

This Phase IV noninferiority trial evaluated whether rHFSC fluid administration can be given safely and effectively, with volumes similar to those delivered intravenously, to children who have mild to moderate dehydration.

Methods

The study included mild to moderately dehydrated children (Gorelick dehydration score) aged 1 month to 10 years. They were randomized to receive 20 mL/kg of isotonic fluids using rHFSC or IV therapy over 1 hour and then as needed until clinically rehydrated. The primary outcome was total volume of fluid administered (emergency department [ED] plus inpatient hospitalization). Secondary outcomes included mean volume infused in the ED alone, postinfusion dehydration scores and weight changes, line placement success and time, safety, and provider and parent/guardian questionnaire.

Results

148 patients (mean age, 2.3 [1.91] years]; white, 53.4%; black, 31.8%) were enrolled in the intention-to-treat population (73 rHFSC; 75 IV). The primary outcome, mean total volume infused, was 365.0 (324.6) mL in the rHFSC group over 3.1 hours versus 455.8 (597.4) mL in the IV group over 6.6 hours (P = 0.51). The secondary outcome of mean volume infused in the ED alone was 334.3 (226.40) mL in the rHFSC group versus 299.6 (252.33) mL in the IV group (P = 0.03). Dehydration scores and weight changes postinfusion were similar. Successful line placement occurred in all 73 rHFSC-treated patients and 59 of 75 (78.7%) IV-treated patients (P < 0.0001). All IV failures occurred in patients aged < 3 years; rHFSC rescue was successful in all patients in whom it was attempted. Both treatments were well tolerated. Clinicians rated fluid administration as easy to perform in 94.5% (69 of 73) of the rHFSC group versus 65.3% (49 of 75) of the IV group (P < 0.001). Parents/caregivers were satisfied or very satisfied with fluid administration in 94.5% (69 of 73) of rHFSC-treated patients and 73.3% (55 of 75) of IV-treated patients.

Conclusions

In mild to moderately dehydrated children, rHFSC was inferior to IV hydration for the primary outcome measure. However, rHFSC was noninferior in the ED phase of hydration. Additional benefits of rHFSC included time and success of line placement, ease of use, and satisfaction. SC hydration facilitated with recombinant human hyaluronidase represents a reasonable addition to the treatment options for children who have mild to moderate dehydration, especially those with difficult IV access. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00773175.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^116GEycQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

In our study of 163 noninferiority trials with 182 noninferiority comparisons published in the five highest-impact general medicine journals during a recent 5-year period, we found that current interpretive recommendations lead to significant systematic and directional biases in the analysis and interpretation of noninferiority trials which almost always favor the experimental therapy. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to abstract raw data, calculate confidence intervals, categorize the results based on CONSORT, and explore whether and how deviation from the customary design parameters of superiority trials impacts the results and conclusions of noninferiority trials. This is important, since decisions about the use of new, often more expensive therapies increasingly rely on data from noninferiority trials. Most previous analyses of such trials have focused on quality and completeness of reporting of design parameters and results. We found that statistical design parameters (excluding justification for delta which is perennially deficient) and results were reported with near 100% completeness in the period we studied. However, despite nearly complete reporting, we found that the interpretation of the results of noninferiority trials can hinge critically on both the choice of design parameters and the method of drawing formal conclusions from the results. In our cohort, the use of CONSORT-recommended interpretation with 95% confidence intervals concealed statistically significant results that disfavored the NT in a substantial number of cases. The use of one-sided confidence intervals also concealed statistically significant results disfavoring the NT in a small number of comparisons. Contrary to the recommended preferential use of PP or AT analyses over ITT analyses, we found that the method of analysis seldom affected the results, and when it did, the ITT analysis was more conservative in four out of five trials. While the issues we describe each affect a minority of the trials we analyzed, the collective effect is substantial.

Figure 5
The effect of asymmetrical interpretation of noninferiority results. This schematic shows how the conclusions of a noninferiority trial will differ depending upon which agent, NT or AC, is assigned preferential status on the left of the interpretative diagram. The confidence intervals in this diagram are the mirror images of the confidence intervals in Figure 1, but the NT is now on the right, and AC is on the left (favored side) of the diagram. The absolute risk differences between NT and AC are the same as in Figure 1, and the diagram represents the interpretation that would result if the hypothesis were set up in reverse, to test the noninferiority of AC to NT. The top confidence interval shows a statistically significant difference favoring the new treatment, but instead of a conclusion of superiority (designation 1 in Fig. 1), the result is inconclusive because the upper bound of the confidence interval crosses delta. For the second and third confidence intervals, the conclusion of noninferiority does not change. For the fourth confidence interval, the prior designation 4 (NT is noninferior to AC) becomes a designation 1 (AC superior to NT). The designation of the fifth confidence interval does not change, but the sixth, previously designated inconclusive, becomes a noninferior result for AC. The seventh and eighth confidence intervals, previously showing inconclusive and inferior results for NT, are now designated superior results for AC. Note that the experimental results have not changed — only the assignment of one agent to preferential status on the left of the diagram. Among the eight confidence intervals, four conclusions are materially changed when preferential status is changed.

### Perspectives of US adults on antimicrobial trials with noninferiority designs [^114j5kod]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

New medical interventions are usually studied in trials evaluating improved efficacy vs current standards of care (superiority hypotheses). Increasingly, new medical interventions are studied using noninferiority (NI) hypotheses. It is statistically impossible to evaluate whether 2 interventions are identical; therefore, NI trials allow acceptable amounts of prechosen worse efficacy with new interventions compared with older, effective interventions, termed the NI margin, for patients with effective therapeutic options. NI is ethical when potentially worse efficacy is traded off for other hypothesized advantages (nonefficacy benefits).

International guidance states that NI margins should be acceptable to patients, yet NI margins are routinely chosen by investigators, pharmaceutical sponsors, and regulatory agencies. Despite calls for patient input on NI trials, little research exists on potential participants' views of NI trials and margins. This survey study asked US adults about acceptable amounts of worse efficacy and willingness to participate in NI trials of antimicrobials.

### Acetylcysteine for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy after intravascular angiography: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113roffE]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Contrast-induced nephropathy is an important cause of acute renal failure. We assess the efficacy of acetylcysteine for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy among patients undergoing intravascular angiography.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing prophylactic acetylcysteine plus hydration versus hydration alone in patients undergoing intravascular angiography. Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases. Our main outcome measures were the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy and the difference in serum creatinine between acetylcysteine and control groups at 48 h.

Results

Fourteen studies involving 1261 patients were identified and included for analysis, and findings were heterogeneous across studies. Acetylcysteine was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in five studies, and no difference in the other nine (with a trend toward a higher incidence in six of the latter studies). The pooled odds ratio for contrast-induced nephropathy with acetylcysteine relative to control was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.32–0.91, p = 0.02) and the pooled estimate of difference in 48-h serum creatinine for acetylcysteine relative to control was -7.2 μmol/L (95% CI -19.7 to 5.3, p = 0.26). These pooled values need to be interpreted cautiously because of the heterogeneity across studies, and due to evidence of publication bias. Meta-regression suggested that the heterogeneity might be partially explained by whether the angiography was performed electively or as emergency.

Conclusion

These findings indicate that published studies of acetylcysteine for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy yield inconsistent results. The efficacy of acetylcysteine will remain uncertain unless a large well-designed multi-center trial is performed.

Exploratory meta-regression did not identify any significant association between the reduction in CIN with NaHCO 3 and any of the baseline variables that were tested (baseline creatinine, NAC use, proportion of patients with diabetes, contrast volume). The eight published trials showed a stronger overall benefit of NaHCO 3 (OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.21–0.76, P = 0.005) compared with the nine unpublished studies (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.34–1.21, P = 0.168) (Figure 5). Furthermore within the published trials, those stopped early, demonstrated a much greater reduction in risk of CIN with NaHCO 3 (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.03–0.56, P = 0.007) compared with trials that completed enrolment as planned (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.28–1.0; P = 0.051). After exclusion of those two trials, the overall OR based on all other studies was 0.60 (95% CI 0.40–0.91; P = 0.016).

Across "Twenty-three published and unpublished trials with information on 3563 patients and 936 CI-AKI events", the pooled relative risk was "0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.86)", with significant heterogeneity, including differences between published and unpublished estimates: "RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.25–0.75) vs. 0.78 (95% CI 0.52–1.17)". Meta-regression indicated small, poorer-quality studies assessing outcomes soon after contrast were "more likely to suggest the benefit of bicarbonate (P < 0.05 for all)", and "No clear effects of treatment on the risk for dialysis, heart failure, and total mortality were identified".

### Interpreting the results of noninferiority trials-a review [^11123J5U]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Noninferiority trials are becoming increasing common, but are often poorly reported and misunderstood. A better understanding of the new components of a noninferiority trial and their interpretation is needed. Noninferiority trials are an extension of conventional superiority trials, which provide a basis for determining if a new treatment, which may have advantages other than efficacy, has sufficient efficacy to be useful in certain situations. A key feature is the need to specify a clinical noninferiority margin above which the lower boundary of the confidence interval for the difference between the new treatment and the conventional treatment must lie. In most cases a nontreated control arm is not included, and when the efficacy of the new treatment is less than that of the standard treatment, determining its efficacy versus no treatment can be a major challenge. Treatments meeting a clinical noninferiority requirement can be statistically significantly superior to standard treatment, of similar efficacy (i.e. no significant difference), or even significantly inferior in a conventional analysis. Noninferiority comparisons are an important addition to the reporting of clinical trials, but require prior consideration of several factors that conventional superiority analyses do not address.

### Noninferiority Randomized controlled trials [^116QgErP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

From 2005 to 2015, the publication of noninferiority trials increased by six-fold. Noninferiority trials assess whether a new treatment's efficacy is comparable with that of the standard of care and have several appeals. Noninferiority trials can evaluate for both noninferiority and superiority of a new treatment. In addition, multiple treatment modalities exist, and new treatments may be advantageous for reasons beyond efficacy. Common elements of trial design such as the research question, outcomes, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results differ meaningfully between noninferiority trials and superiority trials. The noninferiority margin, constancy assumption, and assay sensitivity are unique aspects of noninferiority trials. As with all randomized controlled trials, patient engagement in and reporting of noninferiority trials are also important. In this review, we discuss the methodological considerations and limitations of noninferiority trials.

### Assessing the justification, funding, success, and survival outcomes of randomized noninferiority trials of cancer drugs: a systematic review and pooled analysis [^111VepCQ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Data Extraction

Data were independently extracted from published reports by 2 of us (F. A.T. and E.H.J) and verified by a third author (B.G.), with discrepancies resolved through consensus of all authors. We collected year of publication, treatment setting, primary end point, sample size, blinding (ie, double blind or open label), funding (ie, public, industry, or mixed public and industry), and the authors' listed criteria for using a noninferiority design.

We judged whether the noninferiority design was justified for each trial. Noninferiority was considered justified if the intervention being tested provided at least 1 of the following benefits to patients: (1) less cost; (2) decreased frequency of administration; (3) increased ease of administration, such as noninjectable (eg, oral) vs injectable formulation; or (4) improved quality of life.

We also extracted information on the outcome of the trial in terms of whether noninferiority was achieved. A trial was considered successful if it achieved noninferiority based on its own criteria. For trials that achieved noninferiority, we checked if the intervention also proved superiority based on 95% CIs and whether the publication concluded superiority. For quality-of-life outcomes, we considered quality of life to be improved if the summary was statistically better; we did not examine each domain of the assessment tool separately. Finally, information on the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI for OS were extracted from the published reports for pooled analysis. If a CI different from a 95% CI was reported, we recalculated the CI to a 95% CI.

Statistical Analysis

The associations of the justification for using the noninferiority design and success in achieving noninferiority with the funding source were assessed using Fisher exact tests. The overall association of the trial drugs on OS was assessed by pooling the HRs across the trials using a random-effects meta-analysis to account for heterogeneity. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic (assumption of homogeneity was considered invalid for values of P < .10) and quantified using an I 2 test. Subgroup analyses were prespecified and included funding, blinding, and success. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 15 (StataCorp), and a 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy with sodium bicarbonate: a randomized controlled trial [^116yMpD9]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Contrast-induced nephropathy remains a common complication of radiographic procedures. Pretreatment with sodium bicarbonate is more protective than sodium chloride in animal models of acute ischemic renal failure. Acute renal failure from both ischemia and contrast are postulated to occur from free-radical injury. However, no studies in humans or animals have evaluated the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate for prophylaxis against contrast-induced nephropathy.

Objective

To examine the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate compared with sodium chloride for preventive hydration before and after radiographic contrast.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A prospective, single-center, randomized trial conducted from September 16, 2002, to June 17, 2003, of 119 patients with stable serum creatinine levels of at least 1.1 mg/dL (≥ 97.2 micromol/L) who were randomized to receive a 154-mEq/L infusion of either sodium chloride (n = 59) or sodium bicarbonate (n = 60) before and after iopamidol administration (370 mg iodine/mL). Serum creatinine levels were measured at baseline and 1 and 2 days after contrast.

Interventions

Patients received 154 mEq/L of either sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate, as a bolus of 3 mL/kg per hour for 1 hour before iopamidol contrast, followed by an infusion of 1 mL/kg per hour for 6 hours after the procedure.

Main Outcome Measure

Contrast-induced nephropathy, defined as an increase of 25% or more in serum creatinine within 2 days of contrast.

Results

There were no significant group differences in age, sex, incidence of diabetes mellitus, ethnicity, or contrast volume. Baseline serum creatinine was slightly higher but not statistically different in patients receiving sodium bicarbonate treatment (mean [SD], 1.71 [0.42] mg/dL [151.2 [37.1] micromol/L] for sodium chloride and 1.89 [0.69] mg/dL [167.1 [61.0] micromol/L] for sodium bicarbonate; P = 0.09). The primary end point of contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 8 patients (13.6%) infused with sodium chloride but in only 1 (1.7%) of those receiving sodium bicarbonate (mean difference, 11.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6%-21.2%; P = 0.02). A follow-up registry of 191 consecutive patients receiving prophylactic sodium bicarbonate and meeting the same inclusion criteria as the study resulted in 3 cases of contrast-induced nephropathy (1.6%; 95% CI, 0%-3.4%).

Conclusion

Hydration with sodium bicarbonate before contrast exposure is more effective than hydration with sodium chloride for prophylaxis of contrast-induced renal failure.

The final parameter evaluated was health care resource use for poorly controlled CINV over all cycles of chemotherapy. Over 495 cycles of chemotherapy supported by CINVANTI®, there were 22 instances where patients required hydration with IV fluids. In the IV EMEND® and generic fosaprepitant groups where 458 and 479 chemotherapy cycles were delivered, hydration was required in 18 and 16 occasions, respectively. In addition, there were 7 visits to emergency rooms for poorly controlled emesis in the CINVANTI® and 7 visits in the IV EMEND® group, compared to 5 visits in the generic control group. None of the differences in health care resource use for poorly controlled CINV reached statistical significance.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^111efgMu]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury — rationale and evidence for NAC in CI-AKI prophylaxis emphasize variable efficacy, dosing, and safety. NAC is noted as inexpensive and appearing safe, though it may affect myocardial and coagulation function, and i.v. NAC produced anaphylactoid reactions in up to 48% of participants with at least one death reported. A meta-analysis defined high-dose NAC as a daily dose greater than 1200 mg or a single periprocedural dose greater than 600 mg; one study's i.v. "high doses" were mostly 2 × 1200 mg per day for 2–3 days, and no FDA label is available for NAC as a preventive drug of AKI. For outcomes, there is no current evidence that either oral or i.v. NAC can alter mortality or need for RRT after contrast-media administration; overall in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with CI-AKI, defined as a 25% increase in SCr, than in those without CI-AKI (26% vs. 1%; P < 0.001), and in a three-arm trial thirteen patients (11%) in the control group died, as did five (4%) with standard–dose NAC and three (3%) with high-dose NAC. For CI-AKI incidence, results across trials were heterogeneous; in one study the risk for CI-AKI was reduced by 54.5% with standard-dose NAC and by 57.8% with high-dose NAC, whereas a large study was terminated early after enrolment of 487 patients for futility, and combination studies of NAC with bicarbonate administration have found a moderate benefit compared with NAC–saline.

### Rethinking noninferiority [^115TWBhj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The practical and ethical rationale for continued randomization

One could argue that the efficacy of a new therapy should be fully established before it is introduced into clinical practice. However, achieving this preapproval would require RCTs that are prohibitively large and costly, making it unfeasible for many companies. As demonstrated by our analysis of stent RCTs, the NI margins currently in use are much wider than what would be ideal, highlighting the need for continued evaluation after approval.

Unlike in superiority trials, where further randomization may become ethically questionable once a new treatment is proven to be more effective than its comparator, equipoise persists in NI trials because the new therapy has only been shown to be no worse than the standard within a predefined margin. This persistent equipoise allows for continued randomization, which is particularly relevant for therapies that do not offer substantial clinical advantages (such as better safety profile) over existing treatments.

By adopting a stepwise approval process for NI, regulatory agencies would foster a more rigorous approach to NI assessment, maintaining the feasibility of premarket clinical trials while ensuring patient safety by requiring further evidence before granting definitive approval to therapies with uncertain efficacy.

### Reappraisal of the efficacy of a simplified artesunate regimen in falciparum malaria [^113ua8Wa]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The interpretation of noninferiority also required a "per-protocol" (PP) analysis to move the lower confidence interval marginally inside delta (Figure 1). CONSORT guidelines do describe the use of alternative analyses in noninferiority trials but only in the context of checking for type I errors (false conclusions of noninferiority) sometimes resulting from intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses in this form of trial. This did not apply here because the ITT analysis did not show noninferiority. CONSORT counsels that all exclusions after randomization are troubling, because any erosion over the course of a trial from the initially unbiased groups can only harm the careful process of randomization. Postrandomization exclusions here appear to have involved arbitrary and/or potentially confounding rules. Adequate antimalarial treatment within 24 hours prior to admission was a prospectively defined exclusion criterion at trial registration, but, inexplicably, patients with quinine pretreatment up to 72 hours before study drug administration were actually removed for the PP analysis. Another reason for exclusion was a dosing error of > 10%, an inherently confounding step given that the 2 arms involved different numbers of doses before the primary efficacy endpoint. The number of exclusions in each arm is unfortunately not provided in the trial flow, so these were deduced from the percentage data: 7 patients in the standard 5-dose arm (all primary outcome successes) and 4 patients in the simplified 3-dose arm (2 successes, 2 failures) were excluded. Given this imbalance in exclusions (an indicator of potential bias in itself), the concerns regarding specific exclusion rules, and the difficulty in determining when such rules are stipulated, the PP analysis would be better labeled as a nonrandomized, observational comparison and the ITT analysis considered the primary analysis. ITT also provides a pragmatic assessment of efficacy under "real life" conditions.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^1117na26]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative carbohydrate drinks, intraoperative dextrose with dexamethasone, and early oral fluids — In postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) management, discrepant carbohydrate-drink findings may be due to differences in volume rather than a true protective effect of carbohydrates (C2). Intraoperative dextrose-containing fluids combined with dexamethasone are not protective against PONV compared to dual-agent prophylaxis (A3), with a trial of intraoperative 5% dextrose maintenance fluids noting a non-statistically significant increase in postoperative vomiting (POV) in the dextrose group. A small randomized controlled trial indicates that early oral fluid intake in the post-anesthesia care unit is preferable to restrictive intake for reducing opioid requirement and PONV (A3).

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112aqP81]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal hydration measures to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy are controversial.

Study Design

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using the MEDLINE database (1966 to January 2008), EMBASE (January 2008), and abstracts from conference proceedings.

Setting & Population

Adult patients undergoing contrast procedures.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate with hydration with intravenous normal saline for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy.

Intervention

Hydration with intravenous sodium bicarbonate with or without N-acetylcysteine versus hydration with normal saline with or without N-acetylcysteine.

Outcomes

Contrast-induced nephropathy, need for renal replacement therapy, and worsening of heart failure.

Results

Twelve trials (1,854 participants) were included. Sodium bicarbonate significantly decreased the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (12 trials, 1,652 patients; odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26 to 0.82; I2 = 55.9%) without a significant difference in need for renal replacement therapy (9 trials, 1,215 patients; OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.53; I2 = 0%), in-hospital mortality (11 trials, 1,640 patients; OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.69), or congestive heart failure compared with controls. Similar results were seen for the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy when sodium bicarbonate was compared with normal saline alone (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.77), but not when sodium bicarbonate/N-acetylcysteine combination was compared with N-acetylcysteine/normal saline combination (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.37). A subgroup analysis limited to published trials showed similar results (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.64; I2 = 63.3%), whereas unpublished studies showed a nonsignificant decrease (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.57; I2 = 25.9%) in risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.

Limitation

Publication bias and heterogeneity.

Conclusion

Hydration with sodium bicarbonate decreases the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in comparison to hydration with normal saline without a significant difference in need for renal replacement therapy and in-hospital mortality. Larger studies analyzing patient-centered outcomes are needed.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Effect of increased daily water intake in premenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections: a randomized clinical trial [^113jrqYk]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Increased hydration is often recommended as a preventive measure for women with recurrent cystitis, but supportive data are sparse.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake on the frequency of recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, controlled, 12-month trial at a clinical research center (years 2013–2016). Among 163 healthy women with recurrent cystitis (≥ 3 episodes in past year) drinking less than 1.5 L of fluid daily assessed for eligibility, 23 were excluded and 140 assigned to water or control group. Assessments of daily fluid intake, urinary hydration, and cystitis symptoms were performed at baseline, 6- and 12-month visits, and monthly telephone calls.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to drink, in addition to their usual fluid intake, 1.5 L of water daily (water group) or no additional fluids (control group) for 12 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measure was frequency of recurrent cystitis over 12 months. Secondary outcomes were number of antimicrobial regimens used, mean time interval between cystitis episodes, and 24-hour urinary hydration measurements.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the 140 participants was 35.7 (8.4) years, and the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes in the previous year was 3.3 (0.6). During the 12-month study period, the mean (SD) number of cystitis episodes was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5–1.8) in the water group compared with 3.2 (95% CI, 3.0–3.4) in the control group, with a difference in means of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.8; P < .001). Overall, there were 327 cystitis episodes, 111 in the water group and 216 in the control group. The mean number of antimicrobial regimens used to treat cystitis episodes was 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7–2.2) and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.3–4.0), respectively, with a difference in means of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.3–2.1; P < .001). The mean time interval between cystitis episodes was 142.8 (95% CI, 127.4–160.1) and 84.4 (95% CI, 75.4–94.5) days, respectively, with a difference in means of 58.4 (95% CI, 39.4–77.4; P < .001). Between baseline and 12 months, participants in the water group, compared with those in the control group, had increased mean (SD) urine volume (1.4 [0.04] vs 0.1 [0.04] L; P < .001) and voids (2.4 [0.2] vs -0.1 [0.2]; P < .001) and decreased urine osmolality (-402.8 [19.6] vs -24.0 [19.5] mOsm/kg; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Increased water intake is an effective antimicrobial-sparing strategy to prevent recurrent cystitis in premenopausal women at high risk for recurrence who drink low volumes of fluid daily.

### Reducing inferiority in the design, conduct, analysis, reporting, and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^1173qkpp]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Another current and particularly vexing issue complicating the design of noninferiority trials is the use of composite endpoints in which efficacy and safety endpoints may go in opposite directions fully or partially cancelling each other out and potentially biasing the results toward noninferiority and masking important differences in the separate endpoints of efficacy and safety. Examples include the composite endpoints of net clinical adverse events (NACE) and ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke plus systemic embolization (SE) which merge ischemic and bleeding endpoints in noninferiority trials. Based upon the "constancy assumption", the FDA has recommended that subsequent noninferiority trials preserve the design and methods of the original trial upon which the magnitude of benefit of the original therapy over placebo was measured. Because original trials of pharmacotherapy in atrial fibrillation used stroke/SE as the endpoint, subsequent trials have used the same endpoint to preserve the constancy of the endpoints and the margin of benefit of an original active treatment over "placebo".

### Prevention of contrast-induced AKI: a review of published trials and the design of the prevention of serious adverse events following angiography (PRESERVE) trial [^116AqXQD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI) is a common condition associated with serious, adverse outcomes. CI-AKI may be preventable because its risk factors are well characterized and the timing of renal insult is commonly known in advance. Intravenous (IV) fluids and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are two of the most widely studied preventive measures for CI-AKI. Despite a multitude of clinical trials and meta-analyses, the most effective type of IV fluid (sodium bicarbonate versus sodium chloride) and the benefit of NAC remain unclear. Careful review of published trials of these interventions reveals design limitations that contributed to their inconclusive findings. Such design limitations include the enrollment of small numbers of patients, increasing the risk for type I and type II statistical errors; the use of surrogate primary endpoints defined by small increments in serum creatinine, which are associated with, but not necessarily causally related to serious, adverse, patient-centered outcomes; and the inclusion of low-risk patients with intact baseline kidney function, yielding low event rates and reduced generalizability to a higher-risk population. The Prevention of Serious Adverse Events following Angiography (PRESERVE) trial is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial that will enroll 8680 high-risk patients undergoing coronary or noncoronary angiography to compare the effectiveness of IV isotonic sodium bicarbonate versus IV isotonic sodium chloride and oral NAC versus oral placebo for the prevention of serious, adverse outcomes associated with CI-AKI. This article discusses key methodological issues of past trials investigating IV fluids and NAC and how they informed the design of the PRESERVE trial.

### Assessing the justification, funding, success, and survival outcomes of randomized noninferiority trials of cancer drugs: a systematic review and pooled analysis [^116uvRBm]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

The criteria to define noninferiority among the trials in the cohort varied from 1.08 to 1.33 for the upper bound of the CI of the HR for OS, which means from an 8% to a 33% increase in the hazard of death was considered acceptable (noninferior) in these trials. Furthermore, in multiple cases, this upper limit was defined not for a 95% CI but for a 90% or even an 80% CI. As previous studies have shown, there are no set methods for determining limits defining noninferiority. We also found none of the 4 key justifications — lower toxic effects, lower cost, ease of administration, or better quality of life — for using noninferiority designs in approximately 40% of the cohort. Such benefits should be the primary rationale for a patient consenting to participate in a trial testing if a new treatment is not worse than the standard treatment by a prespecified margin.

### Tackling control risk problems in non-inferiority trials [^111xoDEq]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key messages

Investigators in non-inferiority trials should carefully consider the choice of the effect measure used to define the non-inferiority margin (eg, risk difference or risk ratio)
For unfavourable binary outcomes (eg, treatment failure), defining a non-inferiority margin with the risk difference rather than the risk ratio gives larger power for the same sample size and the same anticipated differences between randomised arms
For time-to-event outcomes, using the difference in restricted mean survival time usually gives larger power than using the hazard ratio
Investigators planning a trial should consider whether the non-inferiority margin or sample size, or both, should be adapted if the observed control risk differs markedly from that anticipated at the design stage, and how this adaptation can be done while retaining the integrity of the trial

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^117EUF9R]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) prophylaxis — evidence and conclusions: In studies where CI-AKI was defined as a relative increase in baseline serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥ 25% and/or an absolute increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dl (≥ 44.2 μmol/l) within 48 hours after contrast-media administration, a single-blind randomized trial in myocardial infarction found CI-AKI occurred in 14% with NAC versus 20% with placebo (P = 0.28) while oxidative stress markers were reduced by as much as 20% with NAC. A meta-analysis of high-dose NAC reported an odds ratio of 0.46 (95% CI 0.33–0.63) with a similar random-effects result (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.34–0.78). Another meta-analysis found that NAC with i.v. sodium bicarbonate reduced CI-AKI by 35% compared to other regimens (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.40–1.05) but did not significantly reduce renal failure requiring dialysis (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.16–1.41). In patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction (SCr ≥ 1.1 mg/dl [> 97.2 μmol/l] or a CrCl ≤ 60 ml/min) undergoing coronary angiography, protocols included 0.9% saline 1 ml/kg/h for 12 hours before and 12 hours after the procedure, and the rate of CI-AKI was lower with NAC plus high-dose saline than with high-dose saline alone. Overall, the benefit of NAC is characterized as not consistent or overwhelming, although oral NAC is noted to have a low risk of adverse events and usually a low cost.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^115Zx9JH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Noninferiority trials are used to compare a new therapy (NT) to an active control (AC) when the use of a placebo control is not ethically feasible. The prevalence of noninferiority trials is increasing, despite concerns about their validity owing to several design and interpretation controversies. Compared to superiority trials, the interpretation of noninferiority trials is less straightforward, and there is greater flexibility and variability in their design parameters. Little empirical research has evaluated how these unique features may affect the validity of noninferiority trial results and conclusions.

In 2006, the CONSORT [Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials] Group provided specific recommendations for the reporting of noninferiority and equivalence trials. Our Figure 1 is a simulacrum of the CONSORT schematic. As explained in the caption, asymmetry in interpretation using this schematic creates a potential bias in favor of the new or experimental therapy. The frequency with which biased interpretation results from this asymmetry is unknown.

Figure 1
Simulacrum of the CONSORT diagram for interpreting the results of noninferiority trials. According to CONSORT, noninferiority can be declared whenever the upper bound of the confidence interval of the difference between the two therapies does not include delta, as in scenarios 1–4. Whenever the upper bound of the confidence interval exceeds delta, as in scenarios 5–7, noninferiority cannot be declared, because the plausible values of the parameter include some values greater than delta. When both the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval exceed delta, the NT is declared inferior to the AC, as in scenario 8. Scenario 1 represents all situations in which the upper bound of the confidence interval is less than zero — that is, any statistically significant result favoring the NT garners a declaration of superiority for the NT. By contrast, in scenarios 4 and 7, where there is a statistically significant difference favoring the AC, the NT is not declared inferior in this schematic, but rather noninferior (scenario 4) or inconclusive (scenario 7). NT, new treatment; AC, active control; Δ, delta (the pre-specified margin of noninferiority).

### Interpretation and inference in noninferiority randomized controlled trials in drug research [^11626LfQ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Noninferiority (NI) trials in drug research are used for the purpose of demonstrating that a new treatment is not worse than a proven active comparator, thereby indirectly showing that the treatment is effective. This article explains and addresses the complications in the interpretation of NI trials that arise from the indirect comparison. On the basis of our review of 232 trials, we conclude that the interpretation and inference of NI trials are complicated, partly because of the incompleteness of the information.

### Rationale for and methods of superiority, noninferiority, or equivalence designs in orthopaedic, controlled trials [^114hTPEP]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

To provide value-based healthcare in orthopaedics, controlled trials are needed to assess the comparative effectiveness of treatments. Typically comparative trials are based on superiority testing using statistical tests that produce a p value. However, as orthopaedic treatments continue to improve, superiority becomes more difficult to show and, perhaps, less important as margins of improvement shrink to clinically irrelevant levels. Alternative methods to compare groups in controlled trials are noninferiority and equivalence. It is important to equip the reader of the orthopaedic literature with the knowledge to understand and critically evaluate the methods and findings of trials attempting to establish superiority, noninferiority, and equivalence.

Questions/Purposes

I will discuss supplemental and alternative methods to superiority for assessment of the outcome of controlled trials in the context of diminishing returns on new therapies over old ones.

Methods

The three methods-superiority, noninferiority, and equivalence-are presented and compared, with a discussion of implied pitfalls and problems.

Results

Noninferiority and equivalence offer alternatives to superiority testing and allow one to judge whether a new treatment is no worse (within a margin) or substantively the same as an active control. Noninferiority testing also allows for inclusion of superiority testing in the same study without the need for adjustment of the statistical methods.

Conclusions

Noninferiority and equivalence testing might prove most valuable in orthopaedic, controlled trials as they allow for comparative assessment of treatments with similar primary end points but potentially important differences in secondary outcomes, safety profiles, and cost-effectiveness.

### Empirical consequences of current recommendations for the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials [^113GnTM6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Numerous previous reports have examined the adequacy of reporting of noninferiority trials, and have focused consistently on the methodology for the selection of the delta margin. Le Henanff et al.(2006) reported significant deficiencies in the reporting of statistical design parameters, justification for the delta margin selected (only 20% of reports in their cohort), and reporting of analysis method, with only 43% reporting more than one method (e.g. ITT and PP). Wangge et al.(2010) found that justification for the delta margin had increased to 46%, but the percentage reporting both types of analysis had not changed. In 2016, Rehal et al.found that justification for the delta margin remained stubbornly anchored at 46%, with multiple methods of analysis reported in 54%. These reports also described the trial authors' selections regarding alpha and its sidedness; however, our report is the first to describe and quantify the empirical consequences of these selections. Other investigators have noted the potential advantages of preferential use of ITT analyses in noninferiority trials, but the only other empirical analysis of the ITT/PP difference included just 20 trials and found results that comport with ours, with the ITT analysis being more conservative.

### A case for using relative rather than absolute noninferiority margins in clinical trials [^112NC3Uk]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Debunking of 2 common arguments in favor of absolute noninferiority margins

# 1. Absolute risks are more interpretable: A common argument favoring the use of absolute noninferiority margins is that absolute risk differences are more clinically relevant and easier to interpret than relative risk differences. The common practice in clinical trials to derive the absolute margin as the expected event rate multiplied by the maximally acceptable relative risk directly contradicts this argument.

# 2. Absolute noninferiority margins have better statistical power: A common reason for ultimately using absolute rather than relative margins in noninferiority trials is the fact that for any given true event rate (ie, the population event rate or the event rate that would be observed if we enrolled an infinite number of patients from the intended study population), a trial that uses an absolute noninferiority margin will have better statistical power to show noninferiority than a trial that uses a relative noninferiority margin corresponding to the same difference. For example, if the true event rate in both the treatment arm and the control arm is 7.5% and patients are randomized 1:1 to treatment vs control, then a trial with an absolute margin of 3% will require 3,300 patients to achieve 90% power, whereas a trial with a relative margin of 1.4 will require 4,640 patients to achieve 90% power.

This apparent benefit of an absolute noninferiority margin is, however, an illusion related to the fact that if we were to conduct a large number of trials in which both treatment and control groups are sampled independently from populations with 7.5% event rates, then the relative difference would exceed 1.4 more often than the absolute difference would exceed 3%. Consider, for example, a trial in which the observed event rates are 6% in the control arm and 9% in the treatment arm. In this trial, the absolute difference is 3% and the relative risk is 1.5, but the observed risk difference corresponds to a 50% increased risk irrespectively. Rather than reverting to using an absolute noninferiority margin because the estimated sample size would be lower than if a corresponding relative margin was used, a more permissive relative margin should be allowed.

Neuberger review of the LCP. The Neuberger review noted that "most of the submissions to the Review from relatives and carers that were critical of the LCP made reference to hydration and nutrition". Moreover. Thus, 29% patients were receiving CAH "at the time of the patient's death" in 2013, whilst 43% patients were receiving CAH "in the last 24 hours before the patient's death" in 2016. This major change in practice does not relate to any new evidence, and undoubtedly reflects the widespread negative publicity around the LCP, and specifically the negative publicity around withholding/withdrawing CAH at the end-of-life. In terms of guidance, the NICE guideline on care of dying adults in the last days of life states that healthcare professionals should "discuss the risks and benefits of clinically assisted. hydration with the dying person and those important to them". However, the NICE guideline highlights the lack of evidence on CAH: "clinically assisted hydration may relieve distressing symptoms or signs related to dehydration but may cause other problems"; "it is uncertain if giving clinically assisted hydration will prolong life or extend the dying process";. "it is uncertain if not giving clinically assisted hydration will hasten death".

Table 1
Definition of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and incidence in the control group

The treatment effects for interventions evaluated in single trials were based on sample sizes < 500 and most demonstrated no statistically significant benefit. A single-blind trial in 260 patients with diabetes evaluated anisodamine versus hydration with saline and showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of CI-AKI; OR for CI-AKI = 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88, p = 0.02. Three trials of theophylline, two trials of trimetazidine and two trials of nicorandil also randomised < 500 patients. However, the trials of trimetazidine and nicorandil did show a statistically significant reduction in incidence of CI-AKI (trimetazidine OR for CI-AKI = 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71, p = 0.01; nicorandil OR for CI-AKI 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94, p = 0.03). The findings for these interventions are not considered further because of the low power of these RCTs.

### Assessment of noninferiority margins in cardiovascular medicine trials [^115rWXAm]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In evidence-based medicine, randomized controlled trials are critical for advancing science and informing clinical practice. However, several types of bias in trial design and conduction may affect their results and interpretation. Communicating the primary results of a trial at a large international medical conference with simultaneous or subsequent publication in a peer-reviewed medical Journal is another step where substantial bias may occur. For instance, the conclusions of a study may be intentionally or unintentionally interpreted and reported with positive connotations despite evidence of neutral or negative results.,

These issues can be even more challenging in the setting of a noninferiority design. Experts and regulatory authorities established some critical considerations in this scenario. The reporting and interpretation of noninferiority trials depend on rejecting or failing to reject a so-called "null hypothesis" (ie, arm A is inferior to arm B) and therefore accepting the corresponding "alternative hypothesis" (ie, arm A is inferior to arm B by less than a certain prespecified treatment effect, also known as noninferiority margin). In particular, the outcome of a noninferiority trial depends on where the CI of the effect size for a treatment or strategy lies around the noninferiority margin. Therefore, the choice of the margin represents a key issue for the validity and credibility of a noninferiority trial. To establish an accurate summary estimate of the treatment effect, regulators recommend that previous studies of the active control versus placebo are evaluated and, as appropriate, the effect size is obtained by pooling the available measures with meta-analytic methods, with the final aim to preserve more than a half of the putative effect of the active control versus placebo when selecting the noninferiority margin.

### Methodological and reporting quality of noninferiority randomized controlled trials comparing antibiotic therapies: a systematic review [^112x8YdU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotic noninferiority randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are used for approval of new antibiotics and making changes to antibiotic prescribing in clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review to assess the methodological and reporting quality of antibiotic noninferiority RCTs.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Food and Drug Administration drug database from inception until November 22, 2019, for noninferiority RCTs comparing different systemic antibiotic therapies. Comparisons between antibiotic types, doses, administration routes, or durations were included. Methodological and reporting quality indicators were based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines. Two independent reviewers extracted the data.

Results

The systematic review included 227 studies. Of these, 135 (59.5%) studies were supported by pharmaceutical industry. Only 83 (36.6%) studies provided a justification for the noninferiority margin. Reporting of both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were done in 165 (72.7%) studies. The conclusion was misleading in 34 (15.0%) studies. The studies funded by pharmaceutical industry were less likely to be stopped early because of logistical reasons (3.0% vs 19.1%; odds ratio [OR] = 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI].04-.37) and to show inconclusive results (11.1% vs 42.9%; OR = 0.17; 95% CI, .08-.33). The quality of studies decreased over time with respect to blinding, early stopping, reporting of ITT with PP analysis, and having misleading conclusions.

Conclusions

There is room for improvement in the methodology and reporting of antibiotic noninferiority trials. Quality can be improved across the entire spectrum from investigators, funding agencies, as well as during the peer-review process. There is room for improvement in the methodology and reporting of antibiotic noninferiority trials including justification of noninferiority margin, reporting of intention-to-treat analysis with per-protocol analysis, and having conclusions that are concordant with study results.

### Reporting quality of noninferiority randomized controlled trials for skin disease: a meta-epidemiological study [^115bXaCv]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Noninferiority randomized controlled trials (NI-RCTs) aim to demonstrate that an intervention has acceptable efficacy compared to an established treatment. We assessed the reporting quality of NI-RCTs evaluating treatments for skin conditions. We searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to April 2024 for NI-RCTs published in top journals measured by h5-index. Screening, full-text review, and data-extraction were conducted independently in duplicate. We measured items reported from the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for NI-RCTs published after 2006. We included 71 NI-RCTs reporting, on average, 78% of overall and 67% of NI-RCT specific items. Forty-seven (51.6%) studies reported the noninferiority hypothesis. Sixty-five (91.5%) studies reported a noninferiority margin, with 26 (36.6%) providing justification; 48 (67.6%) calculated sample size using the margin. Twenty-two (31.0%) studies conducted both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, while 26 (36.6%) used ITT and 11 (15.5%) used PP alone. For 17 studies (24.0%), reviewers reached different conclusions from authors (7%) or could not assess appropriateness of authors' conclusions due to insufficient reporting (17.0%). Reporting of NI-RCTs for skin conditions is inconsistent, with crucial information missing from many publications. Improved reporting is essential to incorporating their results into clinical practice.
