## Question

Role of interprofessional addiction consultation services

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of interprofessional addiction consultation services, including their core functions, team composition, evidence of effectiveness, implementation challenges, and how to strengthen their impact on patient outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what these services are and their core clinical functions. Then, I should verify the typical team composition and why each role matters. Next, I will review the randomized and quasi-experimental evidence for effectiveness. After that, I need to examine implementation barriers and facilitators. Finally, I will synthesize the role statement and outline practical steps to enhance impact, making sure I double-check key claims against the cited trials and guidelines throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope. Interprofessional addiction consultation services are hospital-based specialty teams that provide comprehensive SUD care during medical or surgical admissions, including assessment and diagnosis, withdrawal management, MOUD initiation and titration, harm reduction, and linkage to post-discharge care, with explicit attention to care transitions and coordination with the primary team and outpatient services [^114DNZkn] [^111dpYtw] [^116KxqnD] [^112oqmip].

> I will now examine the core functions to ensure I'm not missing anything critical. These services conduct comprehensive biopsychosocial assessments, manage withdrawal using evidence-based protocols, initiate and adjust MOUD, provide overdose education and naloxone distribution, and create detailed, addiction-focused discharge plans with warm handoffs to outpatient treatment, often via bridge clinics or rapid-access pathways, aligning with ASAM standards for assessment, treatment planning, and care transitions [^116ekDGR] [^1171M2yH] [^111dpYtw] [^1176mMTG] [^1147RRSj].

> Next, I should review team composition and verify why each role is impactful. Typical teams include an addiction medicine physician or nurse practitioner for medical management, a social worker or case manager for counseling and linkage, and a peer counselor with lived experience to build trust and facilitate engagement. Pharmacists are increasingly integrated to support dosing, order sets, and medication safety, and this structure reflects the collaborative care model with structured plans and enhanced communication [^116TpmRf] [^113XerD9] [^1138jwLY] [^112a9Tod].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about effectiveness without checking the randomized trials. The CATCH stepped-wedge RCT across six NYC public hospitals found that interprofessional addiction consultation increased post-discharge MOUD initiation by about 7.96-fold and 30-day engagement by about 6.90-fold compared with usual care, although absolute rates remained modest, underscoring both benefit and room for improvement [^116TpmRf] [^111dX65q]. The START multicenter RCT showed that a specialist-plus-care-manager model doubled in-hospital MOUD initiation and improved linkage to care within 30 days versus usual care, with high fidelity to core components, which strengthens causal inference for process outcomes [^1164zAPK] [^1112wyCJ] [^113Qvk1T]. Observational and quasi-experimental studies corroborate increased inpatient MOUD initiation and linkage, including a fivefold increase in buprenorphine starts and substantially higher post-discharge prescriptions and program linkages after ACS consultation, though I should acknowledge confounding and selection bias in nonrandomized designs [^112bGXa4] [^111kpsNh] [^114pi3rH].

> Wait, let me verify the impact on utilization and mortality, because that's where expectations often exceed evidence. Secondary analyses of CATCH found a significant reduction in ED visits over the year after discharge but no significant differences in hospitalizations or mortality, highlighting that inpatient-only interventions may be insufficient to alter hard outcomes in a population with high comorbidity and structural vulnerability [^1144arud] [^117WysiB] [^113YnBxV]. I should emphasize that mortality was high overall and concentrated early after discharge, reinforcing the need for robust transitional supports and community-based solutions beyond the hospital stay [^114FuYa6].

> I need to check implementation barriers next. Financial fragility is common, with many programs relying on soft funding and limited billing capture. ED and weekend coverage are frequently absent. Stigma among staff and fragmented workflows impede referrals. Workforce shortages constrain scale, all of which are repeatedly documented in qualitative and mixed-methods evaluations of hospital-based addiction services [^1154DzcR] [^114rah9M] [^112rMDRd] [^114VSXjs]. But wait, what if we can mitigate some of these with policy and design choices? Embedding pharmacists, building EHR order sets, and securing payer or health-system investment have been described as practical levers to improve uptake and sustainability [^1138jwLY] [^111dpYtw] [^114rah9M].

> Let me consider the role of peer counselors more carefully, because I recall earlier thinking they were "optional". Hmm, wait a minute, that understates their centrality. Qualitative work shows peers function as cultural brokers who translate between patients and clinicians, build trust, and mitigate stigma, and their presence is associated with improved patient engagement and provider experience, suggesting they are a core — not optional — component of effective teams [^113k5gD7] [^1122AvdN].

> I should confirm how these services interface with standards and guidelines to ensure clinical coherence. ASAM standards emphasize comprehensive assessment, concurrent treatment of comorbidities, shared decision-making, and high-quality care transitions, all of which are operationalized by interprofessional consult teams through structured plans, motivational approaches, and linkage protocols that align with guideline-based care for OUD [^116ekDGR] [^1142hqSr] [^116KxqnD] [^114Hhhgd].

> Next, I should review how to strengthen impact beyond the hospital walls. Expert consensus prioritizes bridge clinics, in-reach from outpatient programs, and patient navigation to improve linkage and retention, while addressing social determinants like housing and employment; these extensions are precisely where inpatient-only models often falter on hard outcomes, so building partnerships and policy supports for low-barrier, longitudinal care is essential [^1176mMTG] [^114FuYa6] [^113VRQA6].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my synthesis captures both evidence and limitations. Interprofessional addiction consultation services play a pivotal role in transforming hospitalization into a reachable moment by delivering evidence-based SUD care, increasing MOUD initiation and linkage, reducing ED utilization, and reshaping hospital culture toward nonstigmatizing, collaborative practice; however, their impact on hospitalizations and mortality is limited without comprehensive post-discharge supports, so their role must be framed as a critical node within a broader continuum of care rather than a standalone solution [^116TpmRf] [^1164zAPK] [^1144arud] [^114FuYa6].

---

Interprofessional addiction consultation services (ACS) are hospital-based teams that **improve MOUD initiation and linkage** [^116TpmRf] [^1164zAPK] and **reduce ED use** [^1144arud] for patients with OUD. They provide comprehensive, stigma-free care [^112rMDRd] by integrating addiction medicine, nursing, social work, pharmacy, and peer support [^114TfbHV] to manage withdrawal, initiate MOUD, and coordinate post-discharge care [^114TfbHV]. ACS are most effective when embedded with standardized protocols, EHR tools, and strong linkage systems [^114rah9M] [^1176mMTG], but **retention remains a challenge** [^114FuYa6], highlighting the need for robust community supports and policy alignment [^113YnBxV].

---

## Core functions and responsibilities

ACS deliver **integrated, evidence-based care** through the following core functions:

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Biopsychosocial evaluation, withdrawal risk assessment, and readiness for change [^116ekDGR] [^112JWMgw].

- **Withdrawal management**: Protocolized treatment of opioid, alcohol, benzodiazepine, and stimulant withdrawal [^111Vg6qY] [^114CykY5].

- **Medication initiation**: Start and titrate MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) with counseling on benefits, risks, and adherence [^114Hhhgd] [^112bjQBe].

- **Harm reduction**: Provide naloxone, syringe services, and overdose education [^112rMDRd] [^116WnxQP].

- **Care coordination**: Link to outpatient treatment, arrange follow-up, and ensure continuity at discharge [^116KxqnD] [^1176mMTG].

- **Education and training**: Teach hospital staff, trainees, and community providers to reduce stigma and improve care [^113ZahDB] [^114VSXjs].

---

## Composition of interprofessional teams

Effective ACS rely on **collaborative, multidisciplinary teams**, typically including:

| **Team member** | **Role and responsibilities** |
|-|-|
| Addiction medicine physician | - Medical oversight <br/> - MOUD initiation <br/> - Complex comorbidity management [^113XerD9] [^112buAik] |
| Addiction nurse | - Withdrawal monitoring <br/> - Medication administration <br/> - Patient education [^notfound] |
| Clinical pharmacist | - Medication reconciliation <br/> - Dosing support <br/> - Drug–drug interaction checks [^notfound] |
| Social worker/case manager | - Discharge planning <br/> - Resource linkage <br/> - Family/support engagement [^113XerD9] [^1176mMTG] |
| Peer support specialist | - Lived-experience support <br/> - Engagement <br/> - Stigma reduction [^113k5gD7] |

---

## Evidence of effectiveness

Robust evidence shows ACS **improve initiation and linkage** and reduce ED use, though mortality effects are limited:

- **MOUD initiation**: CATCH increased post-discharge initiation 7.96-fold (11.0% vs 6.7%) [^116TpmRf] [^111dX65q].

- **Linkage to care**: START doubled linkage to post-discharge OUD care (72.0% vs 48.1%) [^1164zAPK] [^1112wyCJ].

- **Reduced ED visits**: CATCH reduced 1-year ED visits by 21% (IRR 0.79) [^117WysiB].

- **Mortality**: No significant reduction in 1-year mortality, underscoring the need for stronger community supports [^1144arud] [^114FuYa6].

---

## Barriers and challenges

Despite benefits, ACS face **significant barriers**:

- **Stigma**: Persistent bias among staff and patients [^112rMDRd] [^113ZahDB].

- **Resource constraints**: Limited staffing, funding, and coverage gaps [^1154DzcR] [^113vJLUi].

- **System fragmentation**: Poor coordination with outpatient care and social services [^114FuYa6] [^114Ao5zX].

- **Policy and regulatory issues**: Restrictions on methadone, billing complexities, and lack of standardized protocols [^117Fd6ew].

---

## Best practices and implementation strategies

Successful ACS **use standardized protocols** for assessment, withdrawal management, and MOUD initiation [^111dpYtw] [^111Vg6qY]. EHR integration with order sets, clinical decision support, and tracking tools improves workflow and outcomes [^1138jwLY] [^114rah9M]. Strong partnerships with outpatient programs, bridge clinics, and social services enhance linkage and retention [^1176mMTG] [^114pi3rH]. Continuous training and stigma-reduction initiatives for staff and trainees improve care quality and patient engagement [^113ZahDB] [^1122AvdN].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes and healthcare utilization

ACS **improve patient outcomes and system use** by increasing MOUD initiation and engagement, reducing ED visits and readmissions, and enhancing patient experience through stigma-free, patient-centered care [^116TpmRf] [^1144arud] [^114cD1nV]. They also support system efficiency by shortening length of stay, reducing uncompensated care, and enabling safer discharges with coordinated follow-up [^1112wyCJ] [^114FuYa6].

---

## Policy implications and recommendations

Policy should mandate insurance coverage for **ACS and MOUD**, expand the addiction medicine workforce, and require hospitals to offer ACS [^112bGXa4]. Funding should support staffing, training, and infrastructure, and regulations should align with evidence-based care, including flexible **methadone and buprenorphine** policies [^115jowwu] [^114FuYa6]. Quality metrics should track **MOUD initiation, linkage, retention**, and ED use to drive accountability and improvement [^114pi3rH] [^117WysiB].

---

Interprofessional addiction consultation services are a **critical, evidence-based intervention** that improves MOUD initiation, linkage, and ED use, while addressing stigma and care fragmentation. They require sustained policy support, adequate funding, and strong community integration to achieve lasting impact on outcomes and equity [^114FuYa6] [^116TpmRf] [^117WysiB] [^113ZahDB] [^115jowwu].

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^11383rRP]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The overdose public health crisis in the US continues, with more than 80 000 overdose deaths in 2024 and opioids involved in more than two-thirds of these fatalities. Individuals with opioid use have higher mortality rates than the general population, driven by causes including overdose, trauma, infections, and noncommunicable diseases. Notably, both inhospital and posthospital discharge mortality among patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) are increasing. This population also has high hospitalization rates and frequent preventable readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits.,

Despite the proven efficacy of medications for OUD (MOUD) treatment, fewer than 1 in 4 Americans with OUD report receiving MOUD in the past year. With nearly half a million patients admitted to US hospitals annually with opioid-related diagnoses, the hospital setting is critical for reaching people with OUD who are at highest risk of adverse outcomes, including those not actively seeking OUD treatment. Yet the opportunity to engage patients in OUD treatment and harm reduction services during hospitalization is often missed. Patients with OUD continue to have high rates of discharge before medically advised, acute care readmissions, postdischarge morbidity and mortality, and increased health care costs.,

Interprofessional addiction consult services are increasingly being adopted as a solution to integrating substance use disorder (SUD) services into the continuum of hospital care. Addiction consult services provide expert diagnosis of SUDs, counseling on treatment options, MOUD initiation and dose adjustment, psychoeducation, harm reduction, and linkage to postdischarge care. Previous studies suggest that addiction consult services are associated with lower acute care utilization and mortality after hospitalization among individuals with OUD. Members of our team previously completed a pragmatic trial evaluating the effectiveness of Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH), an addiction consult service for increasing postdischarge uptake of MOUD. Patients discharged from CATCH hospitals had significantly higher odds of MOUD initiation (7.96 times as high) and 30-day MOUD engagement (6.90 times as high). In this prespecified analysis, we present secondary outcomes from the CATCH trial, focusing on acute care utilization and mortality rates 1 year after discharge.

### Time to ACT: launching an addiction care team (ACT) in an urban safety-net health system [^113vJLUi]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2018, 20.3 million people in the USA had an active alcohol or drug use disorder. Opioid overdose deaths have reached epidemic proportions, with alcohol and stimulant-related deaths also rising. Simultaneously, between 2009 and 2014 hospitalisations for people with substance use disorders (SUD) nearly doubled. These hospitalisations are long, costly and associated with high rates of readmission and self-discharge (discharge against medical advice).

Hospitalisation is an opportunity to offer SUD care to patients and connect them to ongoing services, since many are motivated to reduce substance use during hospitalisation. Offering and initiating addiction treatment is associated with decreased substance use and readmission rates, and increased linkage to postdischarge care and retention in SUD treatment. Providing addiction treatment to inpatients also improves patient and provider experiences.

In this landscape, a variety of acute care SUD models have been developed, including addiction medicine consult services (AMCS). However, funding them is challenging and only a few AMCS are embedded in safety-net health systems. We present our approach to launching the Addiction Care Team (ACT), an interprofessional AMCS, in an urban, integrated safety-net health system. We share key factors for successful implementation, the current state of addiction care in our hospital, and ongoing challenges.

### Rewriting the hidden curriculum via addiction consult services: meeting patients where they are at… [^113ZahDB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Addiction Consult Services (ACS) deliver evidence-based care for patients with substance use disorder (SUD) during the course of general hospital admissions. Stigma toward patients with SUD is a known phenomenon and is part of the "hidden curriculum" that permeates medical training and healthcare settings. ACS have the potential to rewrite the hidden curriculum around SUD and to teach medical students and other trainees how to compassionately care for this patient population. Here, the authors explore the role of stigma within the hidden curriculum of medical training and outline how ACS can successfully contribute to combatting this stigma. The authors highlight two institutions' approaches to educational initiatives that incorporate health professional trainees into ACS. The authors end by providing a vision of how expansion of ACS can promote interdisciplinary learning for healthcare providers amidst the changing landscape of SUD treatment in the USA.

### Predictors of opioid and alcohol pharmacotherapy initiation at hospital discharge among patients seen by an inpatient addiction consult service [^111JizVG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and alcohol use disorder (MAUD) are effective and under-prescribed. Hospital-based addiction consult services can engage out-of-treatment adults in addictions care. Understanding which patients are most likely to initiate MOUD and MAUD can inform interventions and deepen understanding of hospitals' role in addressing substance use disorders (SUD).

Objective

Determine patient- and consult-service level characteristics associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation during hospitalization.

Methods

We analyzed data from a study of the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), an interprofessional hospital-based addiction consult service at an academic medical center. Researchers collected patient surveys and clinical data from September 2015 to May 2018. We used logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with medication initiation among participants with OUD, AUD, or both. Candidate variables included patient demographics, social determinants, and treatment-related factors.

Results

Three hundred thirty-nine participants had moderate to severe OUD, AUD, or both and were not engaged in MOUD/MAUD care at admission. Past methadone maintenance treatment (aOR 2.07, 95%CI (1.17, 3.66)), homelessness (aOR 2.63, 95%CI (1.52, 4.53)), and partner substance use (aOR 2.05, 95%CI (1.12, 3.76) were associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation. Concurrent methamphetamine use disorder (aOR 0.32, 95%CI (0.18, 0.56)) was negatively associated with MOUD/MAUD initiation.

Conclusions

The association of MOUD/MAUD initiation with homelessness and partner substance use suggests that hospitalization may be an opportunity to reach highly-vulnerable people, further underscoring the need to provide hospital-based addictions care as a health-system strategy. Methamphetamine's negative association with MOUD/MAUD warrants further study.

### Opportunities to innovate health policy and practice to improve opioid use disorder care for older adults across the care continuum [^113VRQA6]. Innovation in Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

Improving the integration of addiction medicine and geriatric principles for hospitalized patients is a key strategy for systems improvement. First, many patients, including older adults and those with substantial medical comorbidities, come to medical attention in acute care settings, and opioid-related medical hospitalizations for older adults have grown. Acute care services, such as emergency departments and hospitals, are also important touchpoints for engagement in addiction care. There is a broader movement to improve addiction care within EDs and hospitals, including policy and health system strategies to incentivize and build treatment models starting in acute care. For example, low-barrier bridge programs are an innovative model to initiate treatment for OUD and provide rapid access and care continuity, including in brick-and-mortar or telehealth models. Specialty addiction medicine consult services are a growing strategy being implemented in hospitals across the United States focused on improving stabilization and management of withdrawal, initiation of medications for OUD, and facilitating linkage to longitudinal care. However, much of the care has been tailored toward a general population with little to address challenges specific to older adults who may require adaptation, such as support in the home setting and additional resources for care coordination across providers. For example, risks of delirium, falls, and polypharmacy are higher in older adults. Opportunities for addiction specialists to partner with hospital-based models such as Acute Care for Elders units or other settings tailored for geriatric care may be important clinical collaborations to fortify within hospitals. Similarly, there is growing recognition about the overlap between palliative care and addiction medicine and the need for collaboration and guidelines in this space. Education, investment, and reimbursement toward building coordinated care between addiction care teams and other multidisciplinary providers are essential.

### Recommendations for addressing in-hospital substance use from a national Delphi consensus process [^116FhHnj]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Results

We contacted 87 potential participants (55 clinicians and 32 people with LLE) by email. Twenty-five of the clinicians (45%) and 13 of the people with LLE (41%) responded and met inclusion criteria, for a total of 38 experts included (response rate, 44%). Of the 38 experts, 21 (55%) identified as clinicians without LLE of SUD, 10 (26%) as nonclinicians with LLE, and 7 (18%) as clinicians with LLE. Mean (SD) age was 40.3 (10.0) years; 24 participants (63%) identified as cisgender female, 12 (32%) as cisgender male, 1 (3%) as nonbinary, and 1 (3%) as transgender male. One participant (3%) identified as American Indian, 7 (18%) as Asian, 1 (3%) as Middle Eastern, 1 (3%) as Roma, and 33 (87%) as White (race and ethnicity categories were not mutually exclusive). Ten of the people with LLE (77%) had a role advocating for people who use drugs. Of the 13 nonclinicians with LLE, 6 (46%) were hospitalized within the past year, 4 (31%) within 1 to 3 years, and 3 (23%) within 3 to 5 years. Among the 25 clinicians working on an addiction consultation service, 10 (40%) spent 4 to 10 weeks, 6 (24%) spent 10 to 20 weeks, and 9 (36%) spent more than 20 weeks in the past year caring for people with SUD on an addiction consultation team. Their median number of years of experience in addiction was 6.0 (range, 1–25 years). All physicians and 2 of the 7 advanced practice clinicians (29%) reported board certification in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry. Table 1 has further details regarding participants.

Guideline 3. Psychologists are Prepared to Clarify Their Distinct Roles and Services and How These Relate to those of Other Health Care Professionals, emphasizing that development and delivery of services depend on psychologists' abilities to explain how they contribute to prevention, diagnosis, consultation, treatment, rehabilitation, and/or end-of-life care and to enhance patient participation, satisfaction, and adherence to recommended care. Psychologists strive to create opportunities for collegial and public discourse to demonstrate how their knowledge, skills, training, education, and experience complement other health care professionals, and when organizational demands conflict with ethical obligations they clarify the conflict, commit to mandatory sources of ethical guidance, take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the APA Ethics Code, and cooperate with other professionals when indicated and professionally justified to serve patients effectively and appropriately.

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^113YnBxV]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This secondary analysis of a pragmatic cluster randomized trial demonstrated that the CATCH interprofessional addiction consult service was effective in reducing ED admissions in the year following hospital discharge among patients with OUD. Nonetheless, our study population continued to have elevated rates of acute care utilization and high rates of all-cause mortality and overdose deaths that were not significantly different between usual care and the CATCH intervention. These findings illustrate the urgency of developing and deploying comprehensive strategies that extend beyond hospital-based interventions, such as outpatient and community-based services as well as policy and services reforms, to improve health care and treatment for people with OUD.

### Role of the primary care physician in problems of substance abuse… [^111Wx4oH]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Patients with substance abuse problems are common in general medical practice and include people of all ages and socioeconomic groups. Initial diagnosis and treatment of addiction problems are often done by the primary care practitioner before referral to a specialist. This article provides information to help in recognition of addiction, guidelines for treatment of intoxication and withdrawal of various drugs of abuse, and techniques for brief intervention as well as long-term care of substance-abusing patients. The physician can be a powerful influence for getting the patient to accept treatment, especially when the physician is empathic without being judgmental. Addiction is a chronic disorder with remissions and relapses like any other chronic disease, so exacerbations should not be seen as failures but as time to intensify treatment.

Patients with substance abuse problems can be frustrating to treat, but it can also be a rewarding experience when a physician helps a substance-abusing patient return to normal and productive functioning in society. The long-term treatment of chemical dependency can be a difficult, frustrating, but rewarding process. There are specialists, both physicians and nonphysicians, who make this area their practice and in many communities referral to a specialist is part of appropriate care. In the current practice of medicine, the primary care physician plays an increasingly important part in the care of the chemically dependent patient, regardless of the referral. The primary care physician may be the first health care professional to be aware of the disorder, or of a relapse, and refer the patient to treatment. As a trusted guardian of the patient's well-being, the primary care physician's concern that the patient stay in remission from drug use is a powerful motivator.

At times, the primary care physician will be asked to provide withdrawal or other medical treatment for addiction, particularly in communities where specialized physicians are not available or there are limited resources for specialized treatment. It is always easiest to recognize the problem of drug abuse when a patient presents with the request to discontinue using drugs. When this occurs, the physician should be prepared to seize this opportunity and initiate treatment or refer the patient to an appropriate treatment program. Since addiction is a common problem, each patient should be screened for it just as he/she is screened for diabetes mellitus or hypertension.

### Storylines of family medicine IX: people and places-diverse populations and locations of care [^112C7UeN]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Coordinating multidisciplinary care — Although medicinal interventions in primary care practice are gaining acceptance, substance abuse often requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves various healthcare professionals and support services. Family physicians are crucial to coordinating this care. They collaborate with addiction specialists, mental health professionals, counsellors and social workers to develop comprehensive treatment plans. By facilitating effective communication among these professionals, family physicians act as a kind of glue that holds together the treatment team.

The bottom line — Substance abuse poses significant challenges to individuals, families and communities. By adopting a holistic approach, family physicians can make a substantial impact on the prevention, early identification and management of substance abuse. Their position vis-à-vis patients allows them to address the complex interplay between individuals, families and communities, and provide comprehensive care that considers the physical, mental and social aspects of health. Through collaboration and support, family physicians can work alongside patients to overcome the devastating effects of substance abuse and guide them toward a healthier and more fulfilling life (figure 2).

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^1164zAPK]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

For hospitalized patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs), can an intervention by a hospital-based addiction consultation service called the Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START) increase initiation of medication for OUD in the hospital and improve linkage to OUD-focused follow-up care compared with usual care?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial that included 325 adults, START participants were more likely than usual care participants to initiate medication for OUD during hospitalization (57.3% vs 26.7%, respectively) and to link to OUD care after discharge (72.0% vs 48.1%, respectively).

Meaning

START, a hospital-based addiction consultation service, can improve receipt of evidence-based treatment for people with OUD, potentially reducing overdose and mortality.

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^113Qvk1T]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

START Fidelity Assessment

Fidelity to the START intervention was high. The majority, 149 (91%), received all 4 components: (1) patient registry: 162 START patients (99%) had an entry in the patient registry; (2) team-based care: 156 patients (95%) were discussed between the CM and AMS, with 153 (93%) seen by the CM at least once, and 153 (93%) seen by the AMS at least once; (3) evidence-based resources: 144 patients (88%) received these (pros and cons worksheet, readiness rulers, and discharge plan review); and (4) follow-up: CMs attempted follow-up calls with 161 patients (98%); 100 patients (61%) received at least 1 follow-up call.

### Programme theories to describe how different general practitioner service models work in different contexts in or alongside emergency departments (GP-ED): realist evaluation [^116D2QqM]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Inside-parallel models

Inside-parallel models showed the most variation in the way the services were set up. Some were more similar to inside-integrated models, others more distinct as inside-parallel models. The level of primary care demand (and aim of addressing this) varied at these sites and perceptions differed about how integrated the GP service and the ED were intended to be at different sites. Some services had shared IT systems, in others the IT services were incompatible. While streaming guidelines were often formalised, there was sometimes flexibility for GPs to take on a wider (emergency medicine) role, with variable access to ED level investigations, and to allow for personal characteristics of individual clinicians, including preferred ways of working, experience, confidence levels and medico-legal concerns to shape their case-mix. Techniques described by GPs as ways to mitigate risks when using the 'GP approach' to treat higher risk ED patients included longer consultations, different thresholds for investigation or admission, and developing supplementary emergency medicine skills. The lack of clarity around the breadth of the GP role could be a particular concern for sites with this model, although this could be overcome in settings with strong clinical ED leadership and effective interprofessional communication to facilitate understanding of each other's roles. The visibility and accessibility of the GP service was described to influence patient expectations and satisfaction with the service (figure 4).

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^117FYPMk]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

IV. Treatment management — determining clinical progress: The addiction specialist physician meets with the patient or assures that other clinician(s) meet with the patient to regularly assess progress toward mutually agreed-upon, measurable goals in the treatment plan. If the patient and addiction specialist physician agree that progress toward these goals is adequate, then plans will be made to build upon these achievements, which may include transition to other services for recovery focused strategies. If the patient or the addiction specialist physician perceives that progress is not being made toward agreed-upon goals, the patient and addiction specialist physician will reassess the diagnosis, treatment modalities, treatment intensity and treatment goals in order to revise the treatment plan. Lack of treatment progress should lead to treatment plan revisions and not result in an inappropriate termination of care.

### Time to ACT: launching an addiction care team (ACT) in an urban safety-net health system [^112LNi4q]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Across the USA, morbidity and mortality from substance use are rising as reflected by increases in acute care hospitalisations for substance use complications and substance-related deaths. Patients with substance use disorders (SUD) have long and costly hospitalisations and higher readmission rates compared to those without SUD. Hospitalisation presents an opportunity to diagnose and treat individuals with SUD and connect them to ongoing care. However, SUD care often remains unaddressed by hospital providers due to lack of a systems approach and addiction medicine knowledge, and is compounded by stigma. We present a blueprint to launching an interprofessional inpatient addiction care team embedded in the hospital medicine division of an urban, safety-net integrated health system. We describe key factors for successful implementation including: (1) demonstrating the scope and impact of SUD in our health system via a needs assessment; (2) aligning improvement areas with health system leadership priorities; (3) involving executive leadership to create goal and initiative alignment; and (4) obtaining seed funding for a pilot programme from our Medicaid health plan partner. We also present challenges and lessons learnt.

### Building a hospital-based addiction medicine consultation service in vancouver, Canada: the path taken and lessons learned [^114U6nJH]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To improve evidence-based addiction care in acute care settings, many hospitals across North America are developing an inpatient addiction medicine consultation service (AMCS). St Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada houses a large interdisciplinary AMCS. This study aimed to: (1) describe the current model of clinical care and its evolution over time; (2) evaluate requests for an AMCS consultation over time; (3) highlight the established clinical training opportunities and educational curriculum and (4) provide some lessons learned.

Design, Setting and Participants

A retrospective observational analysis in an urban, academic hospital in Vancouver, Canada with a large interdisciplinary AMCS, studied from 2013 to 2018, among individuals who presented to hospital and had a substance use disorder.

Measurements

Data were collected using the hospital's electronic medical records. The primary outcome was number of AMCS consultations over time.

Findings

In 2014 the hospital's AMCS was restructured into an academic, interdisciplinary consultation service. A 228% increase in the number of consultations was observed between 2013 (1 year prior to restructuring) and 2018 (1373 versus 4507, respectively; P = 0.027). More than half of AMCS consultations originated from the emergency department, with this number increasing over time (55% in 2013 versus 74% in 2018). Referred patients were predominantly male (> 60% in all 5 years) between the ages of 45 and 65 years. Reasons for consultation remained consistent and included: opioids (33%), stimulants (30%), alcohol (23%) and cannabis use (8%).

Conclusions

After St Paul's Hospital in Vancouver, Canada was restructured in 2014 to a large, interdisciplinary addiction medicine consultation service (AMCS), the AMCS saw a 228% increase in the number of consultation requests with more than half of requests originating from the emergency department. Approximately two-thirds of consultation requests were for opioid or stimulant use.

Assessing withdrawal management needs: The addiction specialist physician assesses the need for patient withdrawal management, the intensity of withdrawal management services needed, and the appropriate treatment environment, given the patient's severity of symptomatology. This assessment includes the number and classes of drugs from which the patient needs withdrawal management and the eventual treatment modality in which the patient will engage after the acute withdrawal syndrome has stabilized through biopsychosocial interventions.

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^1144arud]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do hospital addiction consult services decrease 1-year acute care utilization or mortality among patients with opioid use disorder?

Findings

This secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial with 1355 admissions studying the effectiveness of addiction consult services, acute care utilization (hospitalizations and emergency department [ED] visits) and mortality (all-cause and overdose deaths) among patients hospitalized with opioid use disorder found that in the year after discharge, patients receiving the intervention had significantly fewer ED admissions than those receiving usual care. Rates of hospitalization and death were not significantly different between groups.

Meaning

In this study, an interprofessional hospital addiction consultation service reduced ED visits but not hospital admissions or mortality among patients with opioid use disorder, highlighting the need for comprehensive care that goes beyond the hospital and addresses the complex health and social needs of people who use opioids.

### Integrating ambulatory addiction consultation service into a community mental health center [^113XAYr5]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the escalation in substance related overdose mortality-culminating in more than 100,000 deaths in each of the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic-healthcare systems have not kept up with the demands for care among people who use drugs. There remains a significant gap in access to evidence-based treatment. The addiction consult services has served to address this gap, as a critical intervention that engages mostly hospitalized patients and initiate addiction treatment in acute settings, but little is known about addiction consult services in ambulatory settings. This model of care could potentially serve to scale up the care for people who use drugs in the community by embedding the limited number of addiction professionals within existing ambulatory systems, thus extending their reach. We describe here an innovative, yet simple and potentially replicable model for an ambulatory addiction consultation service in a large, advanced community mental health center.

### Addiction consult service and inpatient outcomes among patients with OUD [^111kpsNh]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite rising hospitalizations for opioid use disorder (OUD), rates of inpatient medications for OUD (MOUD) initiation are low. Addiction consult services (ACSs) facilitate inpatient MOUD initiation and linkage to post-discharge MOUD, but few studies have rigorously examined ACS OUD outcomes.

Objective

To determine the association between ACS consultation and inpatient MOUD initiation, discharge MOUD provision, and post-discharge MOUD linkage.

Design

Retrospective study comparing admissions that received an ACS consult and propensity score–matched historical control admissions.

Subjects

One hundred admissions with an OUD-related diagnosis, of patients not currently receiving MOUD who received an ACS consult, and 100 matched historical controls.

Intervention

Consultation from an interprofessional ACS offering expertise in MOUD initiation and linkage to post-discharge MOUD.

Main Measures

The primary outcome was inpatient MOUD initiation (methadone or buprenorphine). Secondary outcomes were inpatient buprenorphine initiation, inpatient methadone initiation, discharge prescription for buprenorphine, linkage to post-discharge MOUD (buprenorphine prescription within 60 days and new methadone administration at a methadone program within 30 days after discharge), patient-directed discharge, 30-day readmission, and 30-day emergency department (ED) visit.

Key Results

Among 200 admissions with an OUD-related diagnosis, those that received an ACS consultation were significantly more likely to have inpatient MOUD initiation (OR 2.57 [CI 1.44–4.61]), inpatient buprenorphine initiation (OR 5.50 [2.14–14.15]), a discharge prescription for buprenorphine (OR 17.22 [3.94–75.13]), a buprenorphine prescription within 60 days (22.0% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001; of those with inpatient buprenorphine initiation: 84.6% vs. 0.0%), and new methadone administration at a methadone program within 30 days after discharge (7.0% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.007; of those with inpatient methadone initiation: 19.4% vs. 0.0%). There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

There was a strong association between ACS consultation and inpatient MOUD initiation and linkage to post-discharge MOUD. ACSs promote the delivery of evidence-based care for patients with OUD.

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^112oqmip]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

Care transitions and care coordination — Standard V.1 (coordinating treatment and confidentiality) states that the addiction specialist physician "takes steps to coordinate addiction care, communicates with other treatment providers and, when necessary, adjusts the treatment plan whenever patients experience a major change in physical or psychological health". It adds that "This coordination is of particular importance when medications are being used to support recovery" and that the physician "also assures that proper authorizations for release of information are obtained". If "the patient asserts their privilege to not permit sharing of confidential addiction treatment information with other providers", the physician educates the patient about "the health and safety risks inherent in poorly coordinated care".

### "We' ve learned It's a medical illness, not a moral choice": qualitative study of the effects of a multicomponent addiction intervention on hospital providers' attitudes and experiences [^1122AvdN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Substance use disorders (SUD) represent a national epidemic with increasing rates of SUD-related hospitalizations. However, most hospitals lack expertise or systems to directly address SUD. Healthcare professionals feel underprepared and commonly hold negative views toward patients with SUD. Little is known about how hospital interventions may affect providers' attitudes and experiences toward patients with SUD.

Objective

To explore interprofessional hospital providers' perspectives on how integrating SUD treatment and care systems affect providers' attitudes, beliefs, and experiences.

Design

In-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The study was part of a formative evaluation of the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), an interprofessional hospital-based addiction medicine service with rapid-access pathways to post-hospital SUD treatment.

Setting

Single urban academic hospital in Portland, Oregon.

Participants

Multidisciplinary hospital providers.

Measurements

We conducted a thematic analysis using an inductive approach at a semantic level.

Results

Before IMPACT, participants felt that hospitalization did not address addiction, leading to untreated withdrawal, patients leaving against medical advice, chaotic care, and staff "moral distress". Participants felt that IMPACT "completely reframes" addiction as a treatable chronic disease, improving patient engagement and communication, and humanizing care. Participants valued post-hospital SUD treatment pathways and felt having systems to address SUD reduced burnout and provided relief. Providers noted that IMPACT had limited ability to address poverty or engage highly ambivalent patients.

Conclusions

Providers' distress of caring for patients with SUD is not inevitable. Hospital-based SUD interventions can reframe providers' views of addiction and may have significant implications for clinical care and providers' well-being.

### Addiction consultation services for opioid use disorder treatment initiation and engagement: a randomized clinical trial [^111dX65q]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study CATCH was published by Jennifer McNeely and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Opioid use disorder. In the CATCH study, the trial question was: what is the role of interprofessional addiction consultation services in hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder? In the CATCH study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CATCH study, the population was: 2315 patients (628 female, 1687 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adults with an admission or discharge diagnosis of opioid use disorder. The key exclusion criteria were dedicated inpatients of psychiatric, detoxification, or prison units; Medicaid claim for medications for opioid use disorder 30 days before hospitalization; dual services of both Medicaid and Medicare. In the CATCH study, the interventions were: n = 1895 addiction consultation service (interprofessional addiction consultation services provided during hospitalization) n = 1330 usual care (treatment as usual). In the CATCH study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the rate of initiation of medication for opioid use disorder in the first 14 days after hospital discharge (11% vs. 6.7%; OR 7.96, 96% CI 1.67 to 54.71). In the CATCH study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of engagement of medication for opioid use disorder for 30 days after initiation (7.4% vs. 5.3%; OR 6.9, 95% CI -0.01 to 13.81). In the CATCH study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized adults with an admission or discharge diagnosis of opioid use disorder, addiction consultation service was superior to usual care with respect to the rate of initiation of medication for opioid use disorder in the first 14 days after hospital discharge.

### A clinical guide to support the implementation of addiction consult services and the value of teaching and technical assistance [^1128BP6y]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

People with substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasingly admitted to general hospitals; however, many hospital systems lack both formal structures and skilled staff to provide high-quality care for inpatients with SUDs. Inpatient addiction consult services (ACSs), which are increasingly being implemented around the country, are an evidence-based strategy to add focused care for people with SUDs into the general medical setting. In 2018, New York City Health + Hospitals (H + H) launched an ACS program called Consult for Addiction Care and Treatment in Hospitals in six hospitals, supported by a team of addiction consult experts to deliver teaching and technical assistance (TTA) for the Consult for Addiction Care and Treatment in Hospitals ACSs. This commentary describes the TTA, which included site visits, introductory educational lectures, case conferences, ad hoc support, implementation assistance, and the creation of an addiction care guide. Similar TTA services could be used in the future when hospitals or systems want to launch novel clinical programs.

### Addiction consult service and inpatient outcomes among patients with OUD [^112bGXa4]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, ACS consultation in an academic medical center was associated with a dramatic increase in MOUD initiation (over fivefold for buprenorphine) and linkage to MOUD following hospital discharge (with no linkages in the control period). These findings add to the body of literature demonstrating the importance of ACSs for promoting hospital MOUD initiation and post-discharge linkage to outpatient MOUD. Whenever possible, hospitals should implement interprofessional ACSs to deliver evidence-based care to patients with OUD.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^116cBMg3]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Application — psychologists provide services to older adults as active participants in family, social, or institutional systems and may need to intervene at various levels of these systems. Psychologists may assist family members by providing education and/or emotional support, facilitating conceptualization of problems and potential solutions, and improving communication and the coordination of care, and may provide behavioral training and consultation on environmental modifications to long-term care staff for dementia related problem behaviors. Psychologists who work with older adults use frameworks for interdisciplinary collaboration such as the Interprofessional Core Competencies, emphasizing interprofessional communication competencies, and provide consultation or training to families, healthcare providers, or other professionals; once consent is obtained, they frequently consult with and provide psychoeducation for family members of older relatives who have been diagnosed with mental health or cognitive concerns, especially those with dementia, on how to best support these aging family members. In consultation with other professionals, institutions, agencies, and community organizations, psychologists may play key roles in training and educating staff who work directly with older adults in many different settings; in the staff training role, psychologists teach basic knowledge of normal aging and development, improved communication with older adults, appropriate management of cognitive and behavioral issues, and facilitate social engagement given the adverse consequences of social isolation. Many long-term-care staff members recognize that they lack adequate knowledge of how to implement evidence-based nonpharmacological protocols to address the mental health needs of residents, particularly those with serious mental illness or major neurocognitive disorder; more staff consultation and training in behavioral principles may result in a reduction in the over-use of psychoactive medications and improved quality of life for this vulnerable population. Psychologists may contribute to program development, evaluation and quality assurance related to aging services, and when consulting with health care teams or organizations, psychologists can facilitate increased collaboration among members of interdisciplinary care teams especially those that have client populations with complex medical and psychosocial needs.

### Time to ACT: launching an addiction care team (ACT) in an urban safety-net health system [^114rah9M]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Implementation

We designed the ACT based on available funding, needs assessment results and existing AMCS models. The ACT was rolled out in January 2019 in a stepwise fashion to pilot and improve workflows, build capacity, and develop collaborations with hospital services. The team consisted of a half-time attending, full-time patient navigator and a rotating addiction medicine fellow. The three alcohol and tobacco focused DPH LVNs were integrated into the ACT and onsite 7 days a week. All other ACT providers are onsite Monday–Friday. Fellows provide telephone support afterhours on weekdays and attendings cover weekends.

ACT attendings include addiction medicine board-certified and board-eligible providers. Providers were recruited from family medicine, internal medicine, toxicology, obstetrics and gynaecology, addiction psychiatry and adolescent medicine based on having addiction medicine board-certification or committing to obtaining it. Table 1 details ACT roles and responsibilities.

Table 1
ACT Members, Roles and Responsibilities

The ACT is unique in both responding to primary team consults and LVNs proactively seeing patients with unhealthy substance use. Like other AMCSs, our team has led system-wide addiction care improvements via interprofessional education, creating EHR SUD ordersets, and petitioning the hospital formulary committee to increase the availability of evidence-based addiction pharmacotherapies. In its first year of service, despite a staggered roll-out, the ACT experienced a rapid uptake with 631 consultation requests (figure 1) and more than 20 direct discharges to residential treatment programmes.

Figure 1
ACT consultation requests, 1 January 2019–31 December 2019. *ACT was consulted for 631 hospitalisations during our first year. We staffed 73% of consults. Reasons consults went unstaffed include consultation question was answered via phone, ACT not yet available to requesting service or patient discharged prior to being seen.

Billing

The ACT bills using consultation codes under time-based or element-based documentation and recoups professional fees. As a county hospital in a Medicaid expansion state, most ACT patients are insured by a managed Medicaid plan and the hospital is reimbursed via capitated payments. Uninsured and undocumented patients may qualify for Healthy San Francisco, a programme for San Francisco residents financed by the city's general fund which includes access to preventative, primary and hospital care within the city.

### Benefits of linking primary medical care and substance abuse services: patient, provider, and societal… [^114Ao5zX]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Effective linkage may benefit individuals with substance abuse, mental health, and medical problems in the following common scenarios: when substance dependence issues are not addressed in primary care and mental health settings; when medical and mental health issues are not addressed in substance abuse treatment; and when the patient is seen in 2 or more of these settings but no effective communication occurs between the systems. The potential benefits discussed below are listed in Table 1. From the primary care and mental health clinicians' perspective, possible benefits of linkage are improved early identification of substance abuse and prevention of relapse, 7 increased identification of alcohol and drug causes when formulating differential diagnoses, better access to substance abuse treatment services, enhanced adherence with keeping appointments and taking medications, and substance abuse training opportunities for personnel.

At the clinician level, various approaches can be taken simultaneously to help overcome barriers. Physician attitudes, skills, and practices can be changed by active learning educational programs. 18, 19 Studies showing the benefits of linked services will also lead clinicians to favor better-integrated care. The next section describes feasible models of linked primary medical, mental health, and substance abuse services that have overcome these barriers, and shows evidence about their success in facilitating the multidisciplinary care of addicted patients., compared with only 35% of patients referred to a local clinic. This model has also been found to augment delivery of HIV-related care and routine primary care, and to promote medication compliance. 44, 45 Other investigators suggest that on-site delivery of psychosocial services with addiction treatment lengthens treatment retention, reduces relapses to substance abuse, and improves health.

8 Integration of substance abuse treatment and mental health services similarly reduces relapses and improves social stability for patients with a dual diagnoses of addictive disorders and mental illnesses. 46–48. In summary, addiction interventions in medical settings may be appropriate for hazardous drinkers and those with other moderate substance use disorders, medically ill substance-dependent patients who refuse formal treatment referral, and substance-dependent patients who receive rehabilitative counseling elsewhere yet would benefit from medical therapy. Minimally motivated patients who will accept only harm-reducing interventions may also benefit from management in primary care settings. Primary care physicians may have a productive role in outpatient detoxification as well. 59 For patients in formal addiction treatment, linkage to needed medical and psychological services may improve access to health care, improve physical and mental health, and reduce relapses.

Further research should determine whether these promising models could be applied to other settings and populations of substance-dependent patients.

### A taxonomy of hospital-based addiction care models: a scoping review and key informant interviews [^114DNZkn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There is pressing need to improve hospital-based addiction care. Various models for integrating substance use disorder care into hospital settings exist, but there is no framework for describing, selecting, or comparing models. We sought to fill that gap by constructing a taxonomy of hospital-based addiction care models based on scoping literature review and key informant interviews.

Methods

Methods included a scoping review of the literature on US hospital-based addiction care models and interventions for adults, published between January 2000 and July 2021. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 key informants experienced in leading, implementing, evaluating, andpracticing hospital-based addiction care to explore model characteristics, including their perceived strengths, limitations, and implementation considerations. We synthesized findings from the literature review and interviews to construct a taxonomy of model types.

Results

Searches identified 2,849 unique abstracts. Of these, we reviewed 280 full text articles, of which 76 were included in the final review. We added 8 references from reference lists and informant interviews, and 4 gray literature sources. We identified six distinct hospital-based addiction care models. Those classified as addiction consult models include (1) interprofessional addiction consult services, (2) psychiatry consult liaison services, and (3) individual consultant models. Those classified as practice-based models, wherein general hospital staff integrate addiction care into usual practice, include (4) hospital-based opioid treatment and (5) hospital-based alcohol treatment. The final type was (6) community-based in-reach, wherein community providers deliver care. Models vary in their target patient population, staffing, and core clinical and systems change activities. Limitations include that some models have overlapping characteristics and variable ways of delivering core components.

Discussion

A taxonomy provides hospital clinicians and administrators, researchers, and policy-makers with a framework to describe, compare, and select models for implementing hospital-based addiction care and measure outcomes.

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^117WysiB]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

With acute care utilization and mortality rates increasing among people with opioid use disorder, hospital addiction consult services can provide an important touchpoint for care, potentially leading to improved outcomes.

Objective

To study the effectiveness of interprofessional hospital addiction consultation services on postdischarge acute care utilization and mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized implementation and effectiveness (hybrid type 1) clinical trial, 6 New York City public hospitals were randomized to an intervention start date, and outcomes were compared during treatment as usual (TAU) and intervention conditions. Participants included adults with hospitalizations identified in Medicaid claims data between October 2017 and January 2021. Eligible patients had an admission or discharge diagnosis of opioid use disorder or opioid poisoning or adverse effects, were hospitalized at least 1 night in a medical or surgical inpatient unit, and were not receiving medication for opioid use disorder before hospitalization.

Intervention

Hospitals implemented the Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH) program, an interprofessional inpatient addiction consult service providing specialty care for substance use disorders, with teams consisting of a medical clinician, social worker or addiction counselor, and peer counselor.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Acute care utilization (hospitalizations and emergency department [ED] visits) and mortality rates (all-cause deaths, overdose deaths, and opioid-involved overdose deaths) 1 year after hospital discharge. Data for the eligible patients were analyzed July 2023 to September 2024.

Results

In total, 1355 eligible admissions were identified (968 [71.4%] men; mean [SD] age, 46.6 [12.4] years). A majority of patients (835 [61.5%]) had at least 1 subsequent hospitalization or ED visit. There were 113 deaths, including 34 overdose deaths (30.1%), of which 28 (82.4%) involved opioids. ED admissions were lower in the intervention period compared with TAU (incidence rate ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72–0.88]; P < .001). There were no statistically significant differences between CATCH and TAU periods in numbers of hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.87–1.13]) or mortality (eg, hazard ratio for all-cause death, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.98–1.92]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this prespecified secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial, postdischarge ED visits decreased with the CATCH program, highlighting the potential of hospital-based addiction consult services to address needs of patients with opioid use. Nonetheless, high rates of acute care utilization and mortality persisted, underscoring the need for comprehensive care strategies that extend beyond the hospital walls, and addressing the complex health and social needs of individuals with opioid use.

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^1163pGS4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This prespecified secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial found high overall rates of acute care utilization in the year after hospital discharge among hospitalized patients with opioid use who were not receiving MOUD prior to admission in 6 NYC public hospitals. The CATCH interprofessional addiction consult service reduced 1-year postdischarge ED visits. However, no significant differences were detected between CATCH and TAU in 1-year postdischarge hospital admissions or in all-cause deaths or overdose deaths.

Our findings align with previous studies showing lower rates of ED visits among patients who received hospital addiction consult or services. Nonetheless, even during the CATCH period, the percentage of patients with at least 1 ED visit or hospitalization in the year after discharge was notably high at 61.5%, reflecting the overall elevated rates of acute care utilization among patients with OUD. Although a positive association between addiction consultation and lower postdischarge hospitalizations has been described, no significant effect on postdischarge hospital admissions has been found. Further investigation of the leading causes of postdischarge ED visits and readmissions could help characterize the health needs and drivers of acute care utilization in this population.

### Multidisciplinary approach for managing complex pain and addiction in primary care: a qualitative study [^11513XPX]. Annals of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Primary care providers (PCPs) may feel ill-equipped to effectively and safely manage patients with chronic pain, an addiction, or both. This study evaluated a multidisciplinary approach of supporting PCPs in their management of this psychosocially complex patient population, to inform subsequent strategies clinics can use to support PCPs.

Methods

Four years ago, at our academic community health safety-net system, we created a multidisciplinary consultation service to support PCPs in caring for complex patients with pain and addiction. We collected and thematically analyzed 66 referral questions to understand PCPs' initially expressed needs, interviewed 14 referring PCPs to understand their actual needs that became apparent during the consultation, and identified discrepancies between these sets of needs.

Results

Many of the PCPs' expressed needs aligned with their actual needs, including needing expertise in the areas of addiction, safe prescribing of opioids, nonopioid treatment options, and communication strategies for difficult conversations, a comprehensive review of the case, and a biopsychosocial approach to management. But several PCP needs emerged after the initial consultation that they did not initially anticipate, including confirming their medical decision-making process, emotional validation, feeling more control, having an outside entity take the burden off the PCP for management decisions, boundary setting, and reframing the visit to focus on the patient's function, values, and goals.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary consultation service can act as a mechanism to meet the needs of PCPs caring for psychosocially complex patients with pain and addiction, including unanticipated needs. Future research should explore the most effective ways to meet PCP needs across populations and health systems.

### Implementation of a medical education programme for addictions MDT members to improve knowledge and confidence in managing substance users with complex comorbidities [^115nz7S1]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

A medical education programme improved addictions service MDT knowledge and confidence in the detection, escalation and communication of physical and mental comobilities of drug and alcohol abuse. This intervention, therefore, should support harm reduction strategies both on an individual and wider community levels. Workforce development helps facilitate whole person care in a cost-effective manner for the future, as well as ensuring sustainability of expertise. Clear, compassionate communication is essential in providing care to this population group, often presenting with complex needs, whose inputs often span third sector, statutory, and other health and social care organisations.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^1136ndBq]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Substance use disorder (SUD) measures specific to addiction specialist physicians — many public and private efforts are developing, endorsing, and implementing SUD measures, but virtually none apply specifically to addiction specialist physicians. Measures developed to date are mostly intended for broader use — either for primary care providers, hospitals, health systems or health plans. When addiction-specific measures do exist, they usually address the performance of specialty care systems or specialty provider organizations rather than individual clinical specialists. Although these measures, especially those designed for primary care, can be used in specialty care, they do not address the unique role of the addiction specialist physician to identify, treat, or monitor patients with addiction and do not reflect the chronic nature of addiction and the long-term care modalities required to treat the disease. Measures specific to the continuum of addiction treatment therapies are necessary to determine the value of relevant services.

### Addiction consult service and inpatient outcomes among patients with OUD [^114TfbHV]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The ACS launched at Weiler Hospital on April 20, 2021. The ACS is an interprofessional hospital-based consult servicethat assists with substance use withdrawal management, SUD treatment, patient-centered harm reduction counseling, peer engagement, discharge planning, and linkage to outpatient care for patients with SUDs. The ACS consists of a multidisciplinary team including a board-certified addiction medicine attending physician, an addiction medicine fellow, a peer advocate, and other medical trainees. It works in close collaboration with nursing, social work, psychiatry, and pharmacy departments.

The ACS clinicians counsel patients with OUD about MOUD options and provide the primary team with recommendations for initiation and titration of MOUD. The consult service primarily recommends methadone or buprenorphine, as these are the MOUD with the strongest evidence base. The service provides daily evaluation and recommendations for the care of patients during admission. Before discharge, the ACS links patients with a post-discharge appointment for continued buprenorphine or methadone treatment at outpatient treatment programs affiliated with the academic medical center, depending on patient preference. The peer advocate serves as a continued point of contact after hospital discharge.

Study Design

We evaluated the effect of an ACS consultation on patient-care outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data. To address the potential for confounding by indication, wherein patients who received an ACS consult would have differing demographic, clinical, and hospitalization characteristics than those who did not, we used a propensity score–matched historical control design. Using this design, we created a control group with a similar likelihood of being consulted by the ACS if it were available. First, we identified the study-eligible population, consisting of two cohorts: (1) the consult-available cohort consisted of admissions during the consult-available time period and (2) the consult-unavailable cohort consisted of admissions during the consult-unavailable time period. Then, to create the matched study sample, each admission from the consult-available cohort who received an ACS consult was matched with a historical control admission from the consult-unavailable cohort using a propensity score matching protocol. We follow STROBE reporting guidelines for cohort studies. This study was determined to be exempt by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Review Board.

### Expert panel consensus on the effectiveness and implementation of models to support posthospitalization care transitions for people with substance use disorders [^1176mMTG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hospitals are increasingly offering treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) during medical admissions. However, there is a lack of consensus on the best approach to facilitating a successful transition to long-term medical and SUD care after hospitalization. We aimed to establish a hierarchy of existing SUD care transition models in 2 categories-effectiveness and implementation-using an expert consensus approach.

Methods

We conducted a modified online Delphi study that convened 25 interdisciplinary clinicians with experience facilitating posthospitalization care transitions for patients with SUD. Panelists rated 10 prespecified posthospitalization care transition models according to 6 criteria concerning each model's anticipated effectiveness (eg, linkage to care, treatment retention) and implementation (eg, feasibility, acceptability). Ratings were made on a 9-point bidirectional scale. Group consensus was determined using the interpercentile range adjusted for symmetry.

Results

After 3 rounds of the Delphi process (96% retention across all 3 rounds), consensus was reached on all 60 rating criteria. Interdisciplinary addiction consult teams (ACTs) and in-reach from partnering outpatient clinics were rated highest for effectiveness. Interdisciplinary ACTs and bridge clinics were rated highest for implementation. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment; protocol implementation; and postdischarge outreach received the lowest ratings overall. Feasibility of implementation was perceived as the largest challenge for all highly rated models.

Conclusions

An expert consensus approach including diverse clinician stakeholders found that interdisciplinary ACT, in-reach from partnering outpatient clinics, and bridge clinics had the greatest potential to enhance posthospitalization care transitions for patients with SUD when considering both perceived effectiveness and implementation.

### Spreading addictions care across Oregon's rural and community hospitals: mixed-methods evaluation of an interprofessional telementoring ECHO program [^114VSXjs]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite evidence of effectiveness, most US hospitals do not deliver hospital-based addictions care. ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is a telementoring model for providers across diverse geographic areas. We developed and implemented a substance use disorder (SUD) in hospital care ECHO to support statewide dissemination of best practices in hospital-based addictions care.

Objectives

Assess the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of ECHO and explore lessons learned and implications for the spread of hospital-based addictions care.

Design

Mixed-methods study with a pre-/post-intervention design.

Participants

Interprofessional hospital providers and administrators across Oregon.

Intervention

A 10–12-week ECHO that included participant case presentations and brief didactics delivered by an interprofessional faculty, including peers with lived experience in recovery.

Approach

To assess feasibility and acceptability, we collected enrollment, attendance, and participant feedback data. To evaluate ECHO effects, we used pre-/post-ECHO assessments and performed a thematic analysis of open-ended survey responses and participant focus groups.

Key Results

We recruited 143 registrants to three cohorts between January and September 2019, drawing from 32 of Oregon's 62 hospitals and one southwest Washington hospital. Ninety-six (67.1%) attended at least half of ECHO sessions. Participants were highly satisfied with ECHO. After ECHO, participants were more prepared to treat SUD; however, prescribing did not change. Participants identified substantial gains in knowledge and skills, particularly regarding the use of medications for opioid use disorder; patient-centered communication with people who use drugs; and understanding harm reduction as a valid treatment approach. ECHO built a community of practice and reduced provider isolation. Participants recognized the need for supportive hospital leadership, policies, and SUD resources to fully implement and adopt hospital-based SUD care.

Conclusions

A statewide, interprofessional SUD hospital care ECHO was feasible and acceptable. Findings may be useful to health systems, states, and regions looking to expand hospital-based addictions care.

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^113pknJr]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

Addiction medicine — patient, relapse, setting, and social context terms define scope and environments of care. Patient refers, in the ASAM Criteria, to an individual receiving alcohol, tobacco, and/or other drug or addictive disorder treatment. Relapse is described as a process with recurrence of signs and symptoms of active addiction after abstinence or sobriety, often with disengagement from recovery activities, and it can be triggered by exposure to rewarding substances and behaviors, environmental cues to use, and emotional stressors, with early intervention able to prevent the latter part of using or acting out. Setting is the general environment in which treatment is delivered and can include hospitals, residential programs, opioid treatment programs, community mental health centers, community health centers, other general medical settings, the physician's office, the patient's home, and correctional or other institutional settings. Social history is an account of the personal and social details of a person's life that serves to identify the person, and social support system is the network of relationships around an individual that can involve family members, friends, employers, and members of mutual support groups and that is current and comfortable to contact in times of distress. Recovery is defined as a process of sustained action that addresses the biological, psychological, social, and spiritual disturbances inherent in addiction.

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^112bjQBe]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study START was published by Allison J Ober and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Opioid use disorder. In the START study, the trial question was: what is the effect of hospital-based addiction-focused consultation service in hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder? In the START study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the START study, the population was: 325 patients (112 female, 213 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of FDA-approved medication treatment for opioid use disorder; < 6 months life expectancy; age < 18 years. In the START study, the interventions were: n = 164 substance use treatment and recovery team (addiction medicine specialist and care manager delivered motivational and addiction-focused discharge planning and follow-up calls) n = 161 usual care (each hospital's respective practices for managing opioid use disorder). In the START study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in proportion of patients successfully initiating medications for opioid use disorder during hospitalization (57.3% vs. 26.7%; RR 2.1, 97.5% CI 1.51 to 2.91). In the START study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of proportion of patients successfully linking to opioid use disorder treatment within 30 days after discharge (72% vs. 48.1%; RR 1.49, 97.5% CI 1.15 to 1.93) Significant increase in opioid use disorder-focused discharge plan in the medical record (49.4% vs. 27.3%; RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.41) Significant increase in initiation or continuation of medications for opioid use disorder after hospital discharge (52.4% vs. 30.8%; RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.39). In the START study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder, substance use treatment and recovery team were superior to usual care with respect to proportion of patients successfully initiating medications for opioid use disorder during hospitalization.

Section 4: Implementation of Research Findings for SAWS (T 4 Research)

The T 4 research domain involves the translation of research findings to communities, including population-level outcomes research and monitoring (e.g. morbidity, mortality, and impacts of policy changes). As previously discussed, evidence-based, validated treatment approaches for hospitalized patients with SAWS do not exist. As such approaches become available, the knowledge gap regarding how best to implement guideline-recommended care will likely become more evident. The dissemination of guidelines for treatment of SAWS will almost certainly face the same challenges as the dissemination of critical care guidelines more broadly. Concerningly, a growing body of literature suggests that even when critical care guidelines are available, patients often do not receive care consistent with the recommendations. This section explores research strategies for anticipating and mitigating the gaps that may develop between establishing efficacious therapies for SAWS (through clinical trials) and successful delivery of these treatments to patients in real-world clinical settings.

Recommendations to Promote Implementation of Evidence-based Practices

1) Engage stakeholders

Stakeholder involvement will be important for successful implementation of best practices for SAWS. In the area of addiction, one study of stakeholders found that a lack of interprogram cooperation and communication was a deterrent to addiction treatment after detoxification. Barriers to effective care can be identified and modified through broad stakeholder engagement that includes a wide range of individuals: patients, their caregivers, advocacy groups, community members, providers (e.g. nurses and clinicians across disciplines and care delivery systems), purchasers, payers, administrators, policy makers, and researchers. Although implementation and stakeholder engagement are often viewed as later steps in the research translation process, incorporating these elements before establishing a treatment's efficacy will accelerate the transfer of innovations into practice. Input from patients recovering from SAWS will be particularly important in delineating the needs and realities of those living with AUD. To this end, interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential. Although many existing relationships can be harnessed to improve the workflow of caring for patients with SAWS (e.g. natural collaborations among clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and therapists working in the ICU), less traditional partnerships are also needed (e.g. bridging critical care with addiction-related specialties and ambulatory services).

### Leveraging a clinical pharmacist as part of an interprofessional addiction medicine consult service: supporting and spreading best practices [^1138jwLY]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Beginning in March 2023, we integrated a clinical pharmacist into our interprofessional addiction medicine consult service (ACS) to improve care at our hospital and expand substance use disorder best practices regionally. Here, we share experiences from our first 18 months, describing the ACS pharmacist role and highlighting advances at the level of pharmacy care, the hospital, and the region. The ACS pharmacist enriched ACS care quality; built and implemented order sets and workflows; educated the interdisciplinary workforce; and provided training and technical assistance across regional hospitals. Healthcare leaders should consider integrating ACS pharmacists to advance and spread hospital-based addiction care.

### Opioid use disorder treatment initiation and continuation: a qualitative study of patients who received addiction consultation and hospital-based providers [^112dbUrA]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations related to opioid use disorder (OUD) are rising. Addiction consultation services (ACS) increasingly provide OUD treatment to hospitalized patients, but barriers to initiating and continuing medications for OUD remain. We examined facilitators and barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation from the perspective of patients and healthcare workers in the context of an ACS.

Methods

In this qualitative study, we sought input using key informant interviews and focus groups from patients who received care from an ACS during their hospitalization and from hospitalists, pharmacists, social workers, and nurses who work in the hospital setting. A multidisciplinary team coded and analyzed transcripts using a directed content analysis.

Findings

We conducted 20 key informant interviews with patients, nine of whom were interviewed following hospital discharge and 12 of whom were interviewed during a rehospitalization. We completed six focus groups and eight key informant interviews with hospitalists and hospital-based medical staff (n = 62). Emergent themes related to hospital-based OUD treatment included the following: the benefit of an ACS to facilitate OUD treatment engagement; expanded use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid withdrawal; the triad of hospitalization, self-efficacy, and easily accessible, patient-centered treatment motivates change in opioid use; adequate pain control and stabilization of mental health conditions among patients with OUD contributed to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) continuation; and stable housing and social support are prerequisites for OAT uptake and continuation.

Conclusion

Modifiable factors which facilitate hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation include availability of in-hospital addiction expertise to offer easily accessible, patient-centered treatment and the use of methadone or buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal. Further research and public policy efforts are urgently needed to address reported barriers to hospital-based OUD treatment initiation and continuation which include unstable housing, poorly controlled chronic medical and mental illness, and lack of social support.

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^114FuYa6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In the present study, mortality was high (8.3%) in the year following hospitalization, and 42.5% of deaths occurred within the first 90 days after discharge, similarly reported in previous research. Consistent with prior studies, while overdose deaths were prevalent, less than one-third of all deaths (30.1%) were attributable to overdose. Our findings reflect the multiple medical and psychiatric comorbidities of this complex patient population, as well as the emergence of fentanyl as a powerful driver of overdose deaths in New York City during the study period.

Prior studies have demonstrated that retention in treatment is positively associated with acute care utilization and mortality rates, and a prior analysis by members of our team did not show significant differences between CATCH and TAU in 6-month MOUD retention. Inpatient addiction consult services are fundamentally time-limited hospital-based interventions, with limited ability to influence longer-term treatment and health care utilization outcomes. In the hospital, these services have clear benefits, including improved withdrawal management, delivery of evidence-based and patient-centered care for substance use, and integration of harm reduction interventions, and they improve rates of initiation and 30-day engagement in postdischarge MOUD treatment. Yet most hospitalizations are brief, and the median length of stay was even lower in CATCH (4 days) than in TAU (5 days). After patients leave the hospital, they face numerous barriers to continuing MOUD, medical, and psychiatric treatment, and difficulty navigating systems of care, which may underlie the overall low rates of retention in MOUD treatment. More robust support during the transition from hospital to community, such as postdischarge patient navigation, could improve early treatment engagement. Yet to meaningfully improve health outcomes, broad program and policy solutions that remove structural barriers impeding access to health and mental health servicesand improve options for patient-centered MOUD treatment, are needed. Improving access to and quality of existing treatment programs (eg, patient-centered methadone take-home schedules, evidence-based MOUD doses, integrating harm reduction) are important steps to improving retention. Offering a greater array of options for MOUD treatment, including bridge clinics and other low-barrier treatment approaches, could help address these challenges and warrant further study.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^117BWrvG]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Elder abuse — social work roles and consultation in trauma care — When a health professional with expertise in caring for older adults is present in the inpatient clinical setting, strongly consider a consultation request for all trauma patients in whom elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation is suspected, given the complexities in patient management. Social workers and case managers serve a critical role in the assessment for potential elder abuse and initiation of intervention in most interprofessional trauma teams, and when these professionals conduct in-depth biopsychosocial assessments for all older adult trauma victims, additional cases may be identified. If elder mistreatment is identified, a social worker can connect with police, legal and advocacy services, and shelter if appropriate, and key roles include to "Use a strengths-based approach to help empower a patient to optimize his/her circumstances", "Assist with safety planning, especially regarding discharge planning decisions", "Identify and recommend available community resources to assist vulnerable older adult trauma patients being discharged to the community", and "Ensure that the rehabilitation or long-term care facility is aware of mistreatment concerns and is prepared to monitor the patient appropriately".

### Ethical management of challenging behaviors in hospitalized people who use drugs [^1138iHYn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Addiction consultation services are also the standard of care for PWUD. MOUD, with wrap-around services provided by addiction medicine experts, is associated with treatment uptake for SUD, reduction of hospital readmissions, and development of a therapeutic alliance, particularly when a peer support worker is integrated into the team.

Overly restrictive and inflexibly applied hospital policies, such as mandatory searches of patients' belongings or prohibiting substance use, can lead to stigma or even discrimination toward PWUD. Negative patient–clinician interactions such as these can fuel needless conflict between patients and clinicians and, by extension, poor outcomes from patient-directed discharges to deaths. Ideally, policies should prioritize both the health of the patient and their care teams via plans created by nonjudgmental conversations between patients and care teams that have sufficient training in the assessment and treatment of pain, withdrawal symptoms, and SUD. This may require multidisciplinary revision of existing policies with input from addiction consultation services to ensure policies are aligned with best practices, equitable, and nonstigmatizing.

In-hospital drug use can be a divisive topic. Some clinicians believe in-hospital drug use is an intolerable behavioral violation and risky to patients and clinicians. Others believe drug use is an unavoidable and unsurprising manifestation of SUD, particularly when patients are in pain or withdrawal. If in-hospital drug use occurs, it can be profitable to engage in care team education on harm reduction approaches and de-escalation techniques, such as the use of verbal and nonverbal communication to minimize aggression. We encourage care teams to focus not on drug use itself but rather on measures to protect the safety of patients (such as from overdoses) and employees (such as from needlesticks). A collaborative team approach can mitigate the need for the involvement of hospital security, especially given frequent PWUD anecdotes of negative experiences with the carceral setting and stigmatizing interactions with hospital security.

Beyond minimizing negative patient experiences, staff appreciate the provision of care team education around harm reduction, trauma-informed care, and patient safety plans.

### The case for chronic disease management for addiction [^11469BMa]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic disease (care) management (CDM) is a patient-centered model of care that involves longitudinal care delivery; integrated, and coordinated primary medical and specialty care; patient and clinician education; explicit evidence-based care plans; and expert care availability. The model, incorporating mental health and specialty addiction care, holds promise for improving care for patients with substance dependence who often receive no care or fragmented ineffective care. We describe a CDM model for substance dependence and discuss a conceptual framework, the extensive current evidence for component elements, and a promising strategy to reorganize primary and specialty health care to facilitate access for people with substance dependence. The CDM model goes beyond integrated case management by a professional, colocation of services, and integrated medical and addiction care-elements that individually can improve outcomes. Supporting evidence is presented that: 1) substance dependence is a chronic disease requiring longitudinal care, although most patients with addictions receive no treatment (eg, detoxification only) or short-term interventions, and 2) for other chronic diseases requiring longitudinal care (eg, diabetes, congestive heart failure), CDM has been proven effective.

### Hospital buprenorphine program for opioid use disorder is associated with increased inpatient and outpatient addiction treatment [^116Hk73b]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite evidence that medications for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) reduce mortality and improve engagement in outpatient addiction treatment, these life-saving medications are underutilized in the hospital setting. This study reports the outcomes of the B-Team (Buprenorphine-Team), a hospitalist-led interprofessional program created to identify hospitalized patients with OUD, initiate buprenorphine in the inpatient setting, and provide bridge prescription and access to outpatient treatment programs. During the first 2 years of the program, the B-Team administered buprenorphine therapy to 132 patients in the inpatient setting; 110 (83%) of these patients were bridged to an outpatient program. Of these patients, 65 patients (59%) were seen at their first outpatient appointment; 42 (38%) attended at least one subsequent appointment 1 to 3 months after discharge from the hospital; 29 (26%) attended at least one subsequent appointment between 3 and 6 months after discharge; and 24 (22%) attended at least one subsequent appointment after 6 months. This model is potentially replicable at other hospitals because it does not require dedicated addiction medicine expertise.

### Primary care provider expectations of addiction services and patients in Spain [^115TXMiL]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary care (PC) is crucial in the care of substance use disorder (SUD) patients. However, the relationship between PC and addiction settings is complex and collaboration issues stand out. Available evidence suggests that integration of SUD and PC services can improve physical and mental health of SUD patients and reduce health expenses.

Objective

To explore the experiences, views and attitudes of PC professionals towards the interaction between PC and SUD services.

Methods

Twenty-seven GPs took part in three focus groups. The focus group sessions were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Recurrent themes were identified.

Results

Four main themes were devised: (1) Differences and specificities of SUD patients, (2) Interaction between providers of PC and addiction services, (3) Patient management (4) Addiction stigma. These main themes reflect the consideration that SUD patients are a specific group with specific care needs that yield specific challenges to GPs themselves. Improved training, availability of a shared medical record system, increased feedback between GP and addiction specialists and the efficiency of the circuit are to be considered the main priority for the majority of the participants.

Conclusions

An efficient and effective referral circuit, with increased feedback and shared medical records is considered key to GPs. Its implementation should keep in mind the specific features of both SUD patients and GPs.

### Management of postoperative pain: a clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Society, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists' committee on regional anesthesia, executive committee, and administrative council [^1143LFzz]. The Journal of Pain (2016). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain — specialist consultation (Recommendation 30) — The panel recommends that facilities in which surgery is performed provide clinicians with access to consultation with a pain specialist for patients with inadequately controlled postoperative pain or at high risk of inadequately controlled postoperative pain (eg, opioid-tolerant, history of substance abuse) (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In some cases, postoperative pain might be inadequately controlled despite the use of standard multimodal interventions, and consultation or referral to a pain specialist might be necessary; facilities in which surgery is performed should ensure that access to such expertise is readily available when needed. Consultative expertise might also be required in patients with opioid tolerance, and adequate pain treatment should not be withheld from patients with a previous or ongoing history of addiction because of a fear of precipitation of relapse; poorly treated pain can be a trigger for relapse, and successful treatment might include measures to prevent relapse and require the involvement of a specialist trained in the assessment and management of chemical dependency and addiction disorders. An interdisciplinary approach using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions might be required to achieve successful postoperative outcomes and should be considered as part of the perioperative management plan in these patients.

### Inpatient addiction medicine consultation and post-hospital substance use disorder treatment engagement: a propensity-matched analysis [^114pi3rH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations due to medical and surgical complications of substance use disorder (SUD) are rising. Most hospitals lack systems to treat SUD, and most people with SUD do not engage in treatment after discharge.

Objective

Determine the effect of a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service, the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), on post-hospital SUD treatment engagement.

Design

Cohort study using multivariable analysis of Oregon Medicaid claims comparing IMPACT patients with propensity-matched controls.

Participants

18–64-year-old Oregon Medicaid beneficiaries with SUD, hospitalized at an Oregon hospital between July 1, 2015, and September 30, 2016. IMPACT patients (n = 208) were matched to controls (n = 416) using a propensity score that accounted for SUD, gender, age, race, residence region, and diagnoses.

Interventions

IMPACT included hospital-based consultation care from an interdisciplinary team of addiction medicine physicians, social workers, and peers with lived experience in recovery. IMPACT met patients during hospitalization; offered pharmacotherapy, behavioral treatments, and harm reduction services; and supported linkages to SUD treatment after discharge.

Outcomes

Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measure of SUD treatment engagement, defined as two or more claims on two separate days for SUD care within 34 days of discharge.

Results

Only 17.2% of all patients were engaged in SUD treatment before hospitalization. IMPACT patients engaged in SUD treatment following discharge more frequently than controls (38.9% vs. 23.3%, p < 0.01; aOR 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–3.58). IMPACT participation remained associated with SUD treatment engagement when limiting the sample to people who were not engaged in treatment prior to hospitalization (aOR 2.63; 95% CI 1.46–4.72).

Conclusions

Hospital-based addiction medicine consultation can improve SUD treatment engagement, which is associated with reduced substance use, mortality, and other important clinical outcomes. National expansion of such models represents an opportunity to address an enduring gap in the SUD treatment continuum.

Measure #6: Primary care visit follow-up — This measure identifies the proportion of individuals who have a primary care visit after a substance use disorder (SUD) treatment encounter and assesses the extent to which clinicians assure comprehensive patient care; the measure type is Process and it maps to standards III.4 Addressing Comorbidity; IV.1 Assuring Quality of Care; V. Care Transitions and Care Coordination; and VI. Continuing Care Management. The numerator is the number of individuals who receive a primary care visit within 6 months of initiation of SUD treatment, and the denominator is all individuals with an SUD encounter within a specified time period. The rationale notes suboptimal health system involvement and co-morbid conditions among individuals who engage in SUD treatment and states that addiction specialist physicians are responsible for assuring comorbid conditions are addressed concurrently; it also cites initial research, including an observational study of patients over 9 years, showing promising SUD and cost outcomes for a continuing care model that uses primary care as an anchor. Other comments state that the six-month period was based on consensus and that research is underway on outcomes for this time frame, and that the measure excludes addiction specialists who are also certified in a primary care specialty.

### Role of the hospital in the 21st century opioid overdose epidemic: the addiction medicine consult service [^1154DzcR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to explore and describe the structure and design elements of addiction medicine consult (AMC) services within selected US hospitals.

Methods

As part of a larger mixed methods study, 10 qualitative semi-structured telephone interviews were completed with board-certified addiction medicine physicians affiliated with the Addiction Medicine Foundation's Addiction Medicine Fellowship Programs at 9 US hospitals. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using a directed content analysis.

Results

Interviews completed with established AMC services in 9 hospitals probed AMC structure and design commonalities and differences across 4 domains: (1) availability and coverage, (2) team composition, (3) scope and responsibility, and (4) financing. Only 1 service provided weekend consults and most services did not provide coverage in the emergency department. Interprofessional teams were common with a variety of discipline combinations. AMC service scope and responsibility, generally, included 3 types of activities: (1) education and culture change, (2) the delivery of psychosocial and medical services, and (3) hospital guidance document development. Finally, most AMC services existed within a fragile financial environment with idiosyncratic arrangements.

Conclusions

As opioid use disorder (OUD)-related hospitalizations increase stakeholders look to innovative care delivery mechanisms to improve care and outcomes for persons with OUD. The implementation of an AMC service may be an organizational intervention for achieving these aims. Understanding the shared and different approaches to AMC service structure and design is an important first step for delivery systems interested in implementing or expanding these services.

### "If It wasn' T for him, I wouldn' T have talked to them": qualitative study of addiction peer mentorship in the hospital [^113k5gD7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations related to substance use disorders (SUD) are skyrocketing. Hospital providers commonly feel unprepared to care for patients with SUD and patients with SUD commonly feel discriminated against by hospital staff. This tension can lead to provider burnout and poor patient outcomes. Research in ambulatory settings suggests that peer mentors (PMs) can improve substance use outcomes and patient experience. However, no study has examined the role of peer mentorship for patients with SUD in hospitals.

Objective

Understand how peer mentorship affects care for hospitalized patients with SUD, and how working in a hospital affects PMs' sense of professional identity.

Design

Qualitative study utilizing participant observation, individual interviews, and focus groups related to the PM component of the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), a hospital-based interprofessional addiction medicine consult service.

Participants

IMPACT providers, patients seen by IMPACT, PMs, and a PM supervisor.

Approach

Qualitative thematic analysis.

Key Results

PMs occupy a unique space in the hospital and are able to form meaningful relationships with hospitalized patients based on trust and shared lived experiences. PMs facilitate patient care by contextualizing patient experiences to teams and providers. Reciprocally, PMs "translate" provider recommendations to patients in ways that patients can hear. Respondents described PMs as "cultural brokers" who have the potential to transfer trust that they have earned with patients to providers and systems who may otherwise be viewed as untrustworthy. While PMs felt their role led to professional and personal development, the intensity of the role in the hospital setting also put them at risk for emotional drain and stress.

Conclusions

While integrating PMs into hospital care presents substantial challenges, PMs may act as a "secret weapon" to engage often marginalized hospitalized patients with SUD and improve patient and provider experience.

### Planning and designing the improving addiction care team (IMPACT) for hospitalized adults with substance use disorder [^115jowwu]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

People with substance use disorders (SUD) have high rates of hospitalization and readmission, long lengths of stay, and skyrocketing healthcare costs. Yet, models for improving care are extremely limited. We performed a needs assessment and then convened academic and community partners, including a hospital, community SUD organizations, and Medicaid accountable care organizations, to design a care model for medically complex hospitalized patients with SUD. Needs assessment showed that 58% to 67% of participants who reported active substance use said they were interested in cutting back or quitting. Many reported interest in medication for addiction treatment (MAT). Participants had high rates of costly readmissions and longer than expected length of stay. Community stakeholders identified long wait times and lack of resources for medically complex patients as key barriers. We developed the Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT), which includes an inpatient addiction medicine consultation service, rapid-access pathways to posthospital SUD treatment, and a medically enhanced residential care model that integrates antibiotic infusion and residential addiction care. We developed a business case and secured funding from Medicaid and hospital payers. IMPACT provides one pathway for hospitals, payers, and communities to collaboratively address the SUD epidemic.

### Recommendations for addressing in-hospital substance use from a national Delphi consensus process [^117Fd6ew]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

When people who use drugs are hospitalized, they may use nonprescribed substances, including opioids, stimulants, and cannabis. Most hospitals do not have standardized approaches to address such in-hospital substance use, which may lead to harm and bias.

Objective

To develop best-practice recommendations to address in-hospital substance use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This survey study using 3 rounds of a Delphi process included clinicians and people with lived or living experience (LLE) of substance use disorders. Eligible clinician experts were physicians, advanced practice clinicians, nurses, and social workers who had worked on a hospital-based addiction consultation team for at least 4 weeks in the past year. Eligible experts with LLE self-identified as meeting diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder and experiencing a hospitalization in the prior 10 years. Participants were recruited by email through author contacts and snowball sampling and completed online surveys from February 27 to June 25, 2024.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was development of consensus recommendations to address in-hospital substance use. Using a Delphi process, addiction experts identified best-practice recommendations through 3 rounds of surveys. The final survey included 8 categories of recommendations: at the time of hospital admission, once in-hospital substance use is suspected, management of substances and substance use supplies if found, personnel involved in the response, clinical management, documentation, expected outcomes of the response, and systems-level approaches. A content analysis of the free-text comments associated with recommendations meeting consensus for "sometimes implement" or "rarely implement" was performed to better understand when these recommendations should be implemented.

Results

Of 87 experts contacted, 38 participated (response rate, 44%), including 21 clinicians without LLE of SUD (55%), 10 nonclinicians with LLE (26%), and 7 clinicians with LLE (18%). Mean (SD) participant age was 40.3 (10.0) years, and 24 (63%) were cisgender female. Experts identified 84 consensus recommendations, including 49 (58%) that should always be implemented, 4 (5%) that should never be implemented, and 31 (37%) that should be considered depending on the patient and circumstances. Five key concepts were identified in the content analysis of comments related to recommendations with group consensus to sometimes implement or rarely implement: patient autonomy, evidence-based care, feasibility, impact, and harms and unintended consequences.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this survey study, an expert panel identified best-practice recommendations to address in-hospital substance use, including recommendations to implement and avoid. These recommendations can inform local responses, including hospital policies, to standardize responses to in-hospital substance use in a patient-centered and evidence-based way.

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^111i2U2m]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

Implications and next steps — addiction treatment is in the process of evolving from a largely non-medical, isolated field into a more integrated part of mainstream medical care, and as this occurs, new working relationships, treatment protocols, and reimbursement mechanisms will need to be negotiated, with some growing pains inevitable; current commercial and regulatory requirements for physicians sometimes ask them to authenticate care for patients they have never seen, which threatens high quality care and can undermine physicians' decision-making; The Standards outline what we can and should expect from addiction specialist physicians and can serve as a benchmark, and it is expected that The Standards will be reviewed periodically and updated to reflect scientific and clinical advances and changes in the health care delivery system; the next step will involve the Steering Committee overseeing the work of an expert panel as it develops a set of performance measures based on The Standards.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^11768ZSd]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Performance measures applicable to the addiction specialist physician outline care transition metrics. Timely Transmission of Transition Record (Inpatient discharges to home or any other site of care) is defined as the percentage of patients discharged from an inpatient facility for whom a transition record was transmitted for follow-up care within 24 hours of discharge. Care transition survey is described as a uni-dimensional self-reported survey that measures the quality of preparation for care transitions, including understanding one's self-care role in the post-hospital setting, medication management, and having one's preferences incorporated into the care plan.

### Interprofessional collaboration: effects of practice-based interventions on professional practice and healthcare outcomes [^116GtmbV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Poor interprofessional collaboration (IPC) can negatively affect the delivery of health services and patient care. Interventions that address IPC problems have the potential to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the impact of practice-based interventions designed to change IPC, compared to no intervention or to an alternate intervention, on one or more of the following primary outcomes: patient satisfaction and/or the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care provided. Secondary outcomes include the degree of IPC achieved.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group Specialised Register (2000–2007), MEDLINE (1950–2007) and CINAHL (1982–2007). We also handsearched the Journal of Interprofessional Care (1999 to 2007) and reference lists of the five included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of practice-based IPC interventions that reported changes in objectively-measured or self-reported (by use of a validated instrument) patient/client outcomes and/or health status outcomes and/or healthcare process outcomes and/or measures of IPC.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two of the three reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. One author extracted data from and assessed risk of bias of included studies, consulting with the other authors when necessary. A meta-analysis of study outcomes was not possible given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in relation to clinical settings, interventions and outcome measures. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format.

Main Results

Five studies met the inclusion criteria; two studies examined interprofessional rounds, two studies examined interprofessional meetings, and one study examined externally facilitated interprofessional audit. One study on daily interdisciplinary rounds in inpatient medical wards at an acute care hospital showed a positive impact on length of stay and total charges, but another study on daily interdisciplinary rounds in a community hospital telemetry ward found no impact on length of stay. Monthly multidisciplinary team meetings improved prescribing of psychotropic drugs in nursing homes. Videoconferencing compared to audioconferencing multidisciplinary case conferences showed mixed results; there was a decreased number of case conferences per patient and shorter length of treatment, but no differences in occasions of service or the length of the conference. There was also no difference between the groups in the number of communications between health professionals recorded in the notes. Multidisciplinary meetings with an external facilitator, who used strategies to encourage collaborative working, was associated with increased audit activity and reported improvements to care.

Authors' Conclusions

In this updated review, we found five studies (four new studies) that met the inclusion criteria. The review suggests that practice-based IPC interventions can improve healthcare processes and outcomes, but due to the limitations in terms of the small number of studies, sample sizes, problems with conceptualising and measuring collaboration, and heterogeneity of interventions and settings, it is difficult to draw generalisable inferences about the key elements of IPC and its effectiveness. More rigorous, cluster randomised studies with an explicit focus on IPC and its measurement, are needed to provide better evidence of the impact of practice-based IPC interventions on professional practice and healthcare outcomes. These studies should include qualitative methods to provide insight into how the interventions affect collaboration and how improved collaboration contributes to changes in outcomes.

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^112X4LA8]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Primary Outcomes

Primary outcome 1 was the proportion of patients in each group who initiated MOUD prior to discharge, defined as use of any US Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacotherapy for OUD, including buprenorphine, naltrexone, and methadone. Primary outcome 2 was the proportion of patients in each group who attended at least 1 OUD-related care visit within 30 days of hospital discharge, including a visit to any prescriber for MOUD or a psychosocial treatment visit.

Secondary Outcomes

Secondary outcomes 1 to 3 were the proportion of patients in each group who (1) had an addiction focused discharge plan in the electronic medical record, defined as having an appointment made at or referral to a treatment program or clinician; (2) initiated or continued MOUD after discharge; and (3) had a visit to a clinician for their OUD. Secondary outcome 4 was the number of opioid use days in the 30 days after discharge, with use days defined as the total number of days (0–30) that the patient used any opioids, which were asked about in the following 4 categories: pain medications excluding fentanyl, fentanyl, heroin/opium alone, and heroin/opium mixed with another drug. If a patient used opioids in 2 or more categories on the same day, each would count as a use day. Possible use days ranged from 0 to 120 days.

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^1142hqSr]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

Treatment planning — addiction specialist physician standards: The addiction specialist physician integrates and coordinates the treatment of addiction and associated problems and conditions, negotiates with other providers, and is ultimately responsible for addiction-related medical decision-making. The addiction specialist physician discusses and offers all available clinically indicated psychosocial and pharmacological therapies to all patients, assists the patient to collaborate in clinical decision-making, assures awareness of therapeutic alternatives including advantages and disadvantages of medications for addiction with consideration of cost, availability, and potential for diversion, and when pharmacotherapies are used decides with the patient about setting, assures appropriate dosage and duration, monitors adherence, and assures psychosocial therapies occur throughout the process. The addiction specialist physician uses his or her unique expertise to evaluate safety risks associated with the patient's substance use disorder and assures that the treatment plan addresses those risks. The addiction specialist physician assures that all psychiatric and medical comorbidities are addressed concurrently rather than sequentially when concurrent treatment is clinically feasible and assures that attempts are made to involve social networks and the people therein in the treatment process, including assuring that appropriate support services are made available for patients' families. The addiction specialist physician assures that the reasoning behind clinical decision-making is documented within the treatment plan in the patient's health record, and documentation should reflect knowledge of the patient, include options discussed and patient preferences, set out a mutually agreed-upon plan of action to accommodate the individual needs of the patient, as well as delineate measurable goals of treatment.

### Patient and staff perspectives on the impacts and challenges of hospital-based harm reduction [^112rMDRd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Annual US deaths from drug-related overdose have doubled in less than a decade and substance use disorders (SUDs) account for 1 of 9 hospitalizations. Although hospitals spend $13.2 billion yearly caring for patients with SUDs, addiction treatment access remains low. Prior qualitative work on hospital addiction care, has highlighted pervasive stigma and frequent mismatch between patient and clinician goals. Consequences of such stigma include increased self-directed discharge, avoidance of medical care, decreased retention in treatment, and increased substance use.

Harm reduction, an approach developed by people who use drugs, may help bridge these gaps. Harm reduction includes provision of safer use supplies (eg, syringes, pipes, fentanyl test strips, and naloxone), education, and destigmatized care that promotes health anywhere on the continuum of substance use — contrasting with abstinence-only frameworks. Harm reduction decreases overdose mortality, increases uptake of medication treatment, and engages people with SUDs in care.,

Canadian hospitals have been forerunners in integrating harm reduction services into hospital care, finding improved mental health and decreased substance use. Several US hospitals and ambulatory clinics have followed suit, with growing interest from health systems nationwide as overdose deaths increase. However, data remain limited on patient experiences with these services in the hospital, and, to our knowledge, no studies have examined both patient and staff perspectives on US, hospital-based harm reduction.

Since 2020, our urban, safety-net hospital has offered harm reduction education and supplies through our interprofessional Addiction Care Team (ACT) partnership with a local syringe service provider (SSP). Primary teams consult ACT for SUD diagnosis, medication treatment, harm reduction services, and linkage to addiction care. Interested patients receive harm reduction supplies at discharge, and ACT members educate staff about harm reduction services provided. We performed a qualitative evaluation of these services, with the goal of building a model explaining the perspectives of hospital-based harm reduction for patients and staff, understanding the program's challenges, and developing recommendations to inform clinical practice and implementation nationwide.

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^113XerD9]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Descriptions of the START Intervention and Usual Care

START is an interprofessional ACS composed of an AMS and CM team that delivers a tailored intervention based on motivational interviewingand addiction-focused discharge planning. In this study, AMSs were board-certified physicians knowledgeable about the American Society for Addiction Medicine's standards of care for managing OUD and capable of initiating and managing MOUD. AMSs were already present at each hospital. CMs were social workers or case managers with knowledge about and experience with addiction treatment. The START provides diagnostic assessments, makes clinical recommendations, assists with the implementation of treatment plans, establishes OUD-focused discharge plans, facilitates linkage to treatment after discharge, and provides follow-up telephone calls for 1 month (Table 1). Of note, our study included a preimplementation organizational context assessment that helped us refine our intervention and its implementation to support the needs of each hospital.

Table 1.
Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START) Components

Abbreviations: MOUD, medication for opioid use disorder; NA, not applicable; OUD, opioid use disorder.

Usual care consisted of each hospital's respective practices for managing patients identified with OUD (Supplement 1). Cedars-Sinai Medical Center had an existing consultation liaison service with psychiatrists and social workers who could discuss opioid use with the patient and help the patient initiate MOUD if indicated. At Baystate Medical Center and the University of New Mexico, patients randomized to the usual care study condition could be treated directly with MOUD and provided discharge planning by the medical team. Although the START AMS at each hospital had previously served as each hospital's AMS, they did not see patients randomized to the usual care group during the study.

Training and Fidelity

For the START intervention, the AMS and CM from each site participated in an initial 4-hour training and monthly follow-up calls conducted by a licensed psychologist and experienced motivational interviewing trainer. Competency in using motivational interviewing was measured using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Coding Manual 4.2.1, which has metrics for scoring fair and good proficiency in using motivational interviewing. To assess fidelity to the START intervention, we assessed completion of 4 intervention components: (1) entry into the patient registry; (2) team-based care; (3) evidence-based resources provided; (4) follow-up calls.

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^115dMoGT]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The US opioid epidemic continues to be an urgent public health crisis, with 81 083 opioid overdose deaths in 2023. Despite the availability of effective medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), few hospitalized individuals initiate treatmentor link to postdischarge services.,

Hospitalization represents a pivotal opportunity to engage patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in evidence-based treatment. Hospital admissions for OUD have risen dramatically, from 301 707 in 2002 to an estimated 941 700 in 2018, with a corresponding surge in associated costs. These hospitalizations, whether primarily related to opioid use or other medical conditions, create a unique window for intervention, as hospitals possess the essential resources: physicians authorized to prescribe MOUD and support staff who can facilitate postdischarge care coordination. This opportunity is particularly important for patients who may face barriers to accessing MOUD in the health care system and other community access points due to stigma, unstable housing, costs, logistical issues, lack of knowledge among practitioners, racial and ethnic discrimination, and other social determinants of health. Hospitalization provides a structured, supportive environment where these barriers can be temporarily overcome, allowing for direct engagement with specialized addiction care, treatment initiation, and connection to ongoing support services.

Hospital-based addiction consultation services (ACS) demonstrate substantial potential to enhance the implementation of MOUD during acute hospitalization and for facilitating postdischarge treatment engagement. A range of ACS care models have been described, with varied roles comprising an interprofessional team capable of delivering evidenced-based interventions and supportive services. Among the ACS models described in the literature, the most common roles are that of a physician to medically manage substance use disorders and a care manager (CM) to deliver brief interventions and coordinate linkage to aftercare. Although several observational studies suggest potential impact of ACS on improving hospital-based treatment for people with substance use disordersand a recent study demonstrated that an ACS can improve postdischarge MOUD initiation and retention, no parallel-assignment randomized clinical trials have compared ACS effectiveness to usual care. Further, ACS research has not tested effects of an ACS with specified intervention components.

### Beyond workarounds: enhancing education, care, and wellness on inpatient medicine rotations – A multicenter qualitative study [^113g5JWH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges Facing IMRs

Despite the pivotal role and value of IMRs in medical education, all participants described serious challenges. At the heart of these were the combined issues of high demands, and inadequate resources to meet those demands. In terms of high demands, all participants spoke of increasing patient volumes and complexity (Table 2). As detailed in Table 2, the term 'complexity' was not used to describe a singular phenomenon but rather a mix of factors including: an aging population with multimorbidity and the associated struggles of maintaining independence; mental illness and addiction, with limited resources for specialized care; gaps related to the social determinants of health; and complex subspecialty care needs of patients with advanced illness.

Table 2
Rising Patient Care Demands on Internal Medicine Inpatient Teaching Services

IMR, inpatient medicine rotation

Compounding the high volumes and complexity of IMR patients were hospital pressures to accommodate growing patient numbers (Table 2). Many participants described hospital leaders and systems focusing almost exclusively on throughput and efficiency, with little appreciation for the "inefficiencies" necessary for quality education. As one participant described:

"Education is just not efficient. Education is redundant. It's slow… we can get the patient upstairs a lot faster if we don't involve the trainee. We could get the patient discharged a lot faster if we don't involve the trainee". (Participant 2, lamenting the difficulty of maintaining education amid hospital efficiency pressures)

This focus on efficiency is occurring in an "increasingly complex medical system" (Participant 1), where navigating the system to get patients the care they need is becoming more difficult. Consequently, participants described working in the IMR as being fundamentally "harder than it used to be" (Participant 14).

Most participants lamented a related challenge facing IMRs; the fragmentation and eroding quality of multidisciplinary teamwork (Supplementary Table 4). They cited lack of geographic co-location of patients across hospital wards as a key barrier to interprofessional collaboration because effective teamwork "really only happens when you're geographically situated together" (Participant 11). However, geography was not the sole obstacle to multidisciplinary teamwork. Faced with escalating patient volumes and complexity, both consulting subspecialty physicians and interprofessional healthcare staff are increasingly stretched thin, impairing their ability to forge productive partnerships and a shared understanding of team goals and individual team member roles with the IMR. This often leads to strained working relationships marked by uncertainty over responsibilities and an overreliance on asynchronous communication technologies.

### Hospital-based methadone and buprenorphine initiation practices by addiction consult services [^115Te7nj]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this survey study of hospital-based ACS directors, we found widespread agreement that HPSOs impact methadone and buprenorphine initiation and widespread use of novel initiation practices in response. Rapid methadone initiation and adjunctive use of full-agonist opioids to treat additional withdrawal were common. Low-dose initiation of buprenorphine was the most common buprenorphine initiation method used. Future research should assess the safety and effectiveness of these adaptations on patient outcomes and use community-partnered research to aid in implementation of new adaptations in response to a continuously shifting drug supply. Leveraging community expertise to generate time-sensitive guidance, such as through the Delphi Method, may serve as an important bridge to adapt clinical care more rapidly.

### Tools to support hospital-based addiction care: core components, values, and activities of the improving addiction care team [^111dpYtw]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hospitals are increasingly filled with people admitted for medical and surgical complications of substance use disorder (SUD). Hospitalization can be a reachable moment to engage and initiate SUD care. Yet most hospitals do not have systems in place to adequately address addiction, and most providers have little to no addiction training. There is widespread need for protocols and tools to implement hospital-based SUD care. We share best practices from our hospital-based Improving Addiction Care Team (IMPACT). We include a description of interprofessional roles (medical providers, social workers, peers with lived experience in recovery) and include detailed appendices of practical tools such as medication protocols (eg, buprenorphine induction), risk assessments (eg, outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy) and treatment tools (eg, a patient safety care plan to manage patient and staff expectations surrounding risks for in hospital drug use). A case example illustrates how IMPACT works and how tools can be applied. We hope other hospitals can adapt and integrate these tools to support widespread implementation of hospital-based SUD care.

### The development and implementation of a hospitalist-directed addiction medicine consultation service to address a treatment gap [^115Rw8U6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospitalizations related to the consequences of substance use are rising yet most hospitalized patients with substance use disorder do not receive evidence-based addiction treatment. Opportunities to leverage the hospitalist workforce could close this treatment gap.

Aim

To describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a hospitalist-directed addiction consultation service (ACS) to provide in-hospital addiction treatment.

Setting

Six hundred fifty-bed university hospital in Aurora, Colorado.

Program Description

Hospitalists completed buprenorphine waiver training, participated in a 13-part addiction lecture series, and completed a minimum of 40 hours of online addiction training. Hospitalists participated in shadow shifts with an addiction-trained physician. Dedicated addiction social workers developed relationships with local addiction treatment services.

Program Evaluation Metrics

Physician-related metrics included education, training, and clinical time spent in addiction practice. Patient and encounter-related metrics included a description of ACS care provision.

Results

Eleven hospitalists completed an average of 95 hours of addiction-related didactics. Once addiction training was complete, hospitalists spent an average of 30 days over 12 months staffing a weekday ACS. Between October 2019 and November 2020, the ACS completed 1620 consultations on 1350 unique patients. Alcohol was the most common substance (n = 1279; 79%), followed by tobacco (979; 60.4%), methamphetamines/amphetamines (n = 494; 30.5%), and opioids (n = 400; 24.7%). Naltrexone was the most frequently prescribed medication (n = 350; 21.6%), followed by acamprosate (n = 93; 5.7%), and buprenorphine (n = 77, 4.8%). Trauma was a frequent discharge diagnoses (n = 1564; 96.5%). Leaving prior to treatment completion was commonly noted (n = 120, 7.4%). The ACS completed 47 in-hospital methadone enrollments.

Discussion

The hospitalist-directed ACS is a promising clinical initiative that could be implemented to expand hospital-based addiction treatment. Future research is needed to understand challenges to disseminating this model into other hospital settings, and to evaluate intended and unintended effects of broad implementation.

### Addiction consult services, mortality, and acute care utilization in inpatients with opioid use disorder: a secondary analysis of a cluster randomized clinical trial [^116WnxQP]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Eligibility Criteria

Eligible cases were adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) admitted to a hospital medical or surgical unit, with a length of stay of at least 1 night, and at least 1 opioid-related diagnosis (OUD, opioid poisoning, or opioid adverse effects) among the admission or discharge diagnoses, based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes. Patients receiving MOUD in the 30 days before admission were excluded. We also excluded dual-eligible individuals enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare, as their outcomes would not be completely captured in Medicaid data, which was the primary data source. The study conditions were defined based on implementation of CATCH at the hospital level, and receipt of CATCH services was not required for eligibility. Admissions in which the patient was deceased prior to discharge were not eligible, given our focus on postdischarge outcomes. For individuals with multiple admissions meeting eligibility criteria during the study period, only their last admission was included in the analysis (226 patients had multiple admissions during the study period). Patients with an admission during the TAU period who had previously been admitted to a hospital with CATCH implemented were excluded (n = 4) due to the risk of contamination through prior exposure to the intervention. Due to differences in the measurement period and eligibility criteria, the sample size for this analysis differs from that of the primary outcome analysis.

Intervention

CATCH is an interprofessional addiction consult service, with teams consisting of 3 providers: medical clinician (physician or nurse practitioner), social worker or addiction counselor, and peer counselor. Each hospital received funding to support 3 CATCH teams, and was required to have at least 2 fully staffed teams before randomization. Teams were based in the psychiatry department at each facility, and at 3 hospitals, the lead physician was a psychiatrist.CATCH consultations could be ordered by the patient's primary team. CATCH provided comprehensive SUD care, including diagnosis, treatment recommendations, counseling, overdose prevention education (with take-home naloxone kits), and linkage to postdischarge SUD treatment. Patients without a treatment linkage at the time of discharge could be referred to short-term bridge clinics. While the trial evaluated outcomes only among patients with an opioid-related diagnosis, CATCH also provided care to patients with alcohol and other types of nontobacco SUDs.

### Interprofessional collaboration to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes [^115VAUPX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Poor interprofessional collaboration (IPC) can adversely affect the delivery of health services and patient care. Interventions that address IPC problems have the potential to improve professional practice and healthcare outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the impact of practice-based interventions designed to improve interprofessional collaboration (IPC) amongst health and social care professionals, compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention, on at least one of the following primary outcomes: patient health outcomes, clinical process or efficiency outcomes or secondary outcomes (collaborative behaviour).

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2015, issue 11), MEDLINE, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to November 2015. We handsearched relevant interprofessional journals to November 2015, and reviewed the reference lists of the included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of practice-based IPC interventions involving health and social care professionals compared to usual care or to an alternative intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of each potentially relevant study. We extracted data from the included studies and assessed the risk of bias of each study. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis of study outcomes, given the small number of included studies and their heterogeneity in clinical settings, interventions and outcomes. Consequently, we summarised the study data and presented the results in a narrative format to report study methods, outcomes, impact and certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included nine studies in total (6540 participants); six cluster-randomised trials and three individual randomised trials (1 study randomised clinicians, 1 randomised patients, and 1 randomised clinicians and patients). All studies were conducted in high-income countries (Australia, Belgium, Sweden, UK and USA) across primary, secondary, tertiary and community care settings and had a follow-up of up to 12 months. Eight studies compared an IPC intervention with usual care and evaluated the effects of different practice-based IPC interventions: externally facilitated interprofessional activities (e.g. team action planning; 4 studies), interprofessional rounds (2 studies), interprofessional meetings (1 study), and interprofessional checklists (1 study). One study compared one type of interprofessional meeting with another type of interprofessional meeting. We assessed four studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and an equal number of studies to be at high risk of detection bias. For studies comparing an IPC intervention with usual care, functional status in stroke patients may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities (1 study, 464 participants, low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether patient-assessed quality of care (1 study, 1185 participants), continuity of care (1 study, 464 participants) or collaborative working (4 studies, 1936 participants) are improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, as we graded the evidence as very low-certainty for these outcomes. Healthcare professionals' adherence to recommended practices may be slightly improved with externally facilitated interprofessional activities or interprofessional meetings (3 studies, 2576 participants, low certainty evidence). The use of healthcare resources may be slightly improved by externally facilitated interprofessional activities, interprofessional checklists and rounds (4 studies, 1679 participants, low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on patient mortality, morbidity or complication rates. Compared to multidisciplinary audio conferencing, multidisciplinary video conferencing may reduce the average length of treatment and may reduce the number of multidisciplinary conferences needed per patient and the patient length of stay. There was little or no difference between these interventions in the number of communications between health professionals (1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Given that the certainty of evidence from the included studies was judged to be low to very low, there is not sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions on the effects of IPC interventions. Neverthess, due to the difficulties health professionals encounter when collaborating in clinical practice, it is encouraging that research on the number of interventions to improve IPC has increased since this review was last updated. While this field is developing, further rigorous, mixed-method studies are required. Future studies should focus on longer acclimatisation periods before evaluating newly implemented IPC interventions, and use longer follow-up to generate a more informed understanding of the effects of IPC on clinical practice.

### Hospital addiction consultation service and opioid use disorder treatment: the START randomized clinical trial [^1112wyCJ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are effective, but hospitalized people with opioid use disorder (OUD) seldom receive MOUD while in the hospital or link with treatment after.

Objective

To test whether an addiction-focused consultation service, the Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START), increases MOUD initiation during hospitalization and linkage to follow-up care after discharge.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 1:1 randomized clinical trial grouped participants into the START intervention or usual care. The study was conducted between November 2021 and September 2023 at 3 hospitals in the following cities: Los Angeles, California; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Springfield, Massachusetts. The last follow-up was in December 2023. Eligible individuals were 18 years and older and met criteria for OUD.

Intervention

START consists of an addiction medicine specialist and a care manager delivering a motivational and addiction-focused discharge planning intervention and follow-up calls.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were the proportions of patients (1) initiating MOUD (naltrexone, buprenorphine, or methadone) during hospitalization (per electronic medical record data) and (2) successfully linking to OUD treatment within 30 days after discharge (per patient self-report).

Results

A total of 325 were consented and randomized to START (n = 164) or usual care (n = 161). Median (IQR) age was 41.0 (32.0–50.0) years. A total of 213 participants (65.5%) were male at birth, 28 (8.6%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 21 (6.5%) were Black, 156 (48.0%) were Hispanic, and 125 (38.5%) were White. More than half, 175 (53.8%), were unhoused in the past year, and 163 (50.2%) were unemployed. START participants were more likely than usual care participants to initiate MOUD during hospitalization (94/164 [57.3%] vs 43/161 [26.7%], respectively; adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 2.10 [97.5% CI, 1.51–2.91]) and to link to OUD care after discharge (90/125 [72.0%] vs 50/104 [48.1%], respectively; aRR, 1.49 [97.5% CI, 1.15–1.93]).

Conclusions and Relevance

By addressing gaps in inpatient care, the hospital-based addiction-focused consultation service presented in this randomized clinical trial improved receipt of evidence-based treatment for people with OUD in the hospital and linkage to treatment after discharge.

### Management of opioid use disorder and infectious disease in the inpatient setting [^113qoHJQ]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial infections such as endocarditis and skin and soft tissue infections are a common cause of hospitalization among persons with opioid use disorder (OUD). These interactions with acute care physicians provide an opportunity to diagnose OUD and treat patients with medications for OUD, including buprenorphine. When available, Addiction Medicine Consultation can be effective at linking patients to addiction treatment and also engaging patients in care for acute bacterial infections. In health systems without access to addiction medicine experts, infectious diseases providers, hospitalists, and other clinicians serve a valuable role in the diagnosis and treatment of OUD.

### Addiction consultation services for opioid use disorder treatment initiation and engagement: a randomized clinical trial [^116TpmRf]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are highly effective, but only 22% of individuals in the US with opioid use disorder receive them. Hospitalization potentially provides an opportunity to initiate MOUD and link patients to ongoing treatment.

Objective

To study the effectiveness of interprofessional hospital addiction consultation services in increasing MOUD treatment initiation and engagement.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized implementation and effectiveness (hybrid type 1) trial was conducted in 6 public hospitals in New York, New York, and included 2315 adults with hospitalizations identified in Medicaid claims data between October 2017 and January 2021. Data analysis was conducted in December 2023. Hospitals were randomized to an intervention start date, and outcomes were compared during treatment as usual (TAU) and intervention conditions. Bayesian analysis accounted for the clustering of patients within hospitals and open cohort nature of the study. The addiction consultation service intervention was compared with TAU using posterior probabilities of model parameters from hierarchical logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, and study period. Eligible participants had an admission or discharge diagnosis of opioid use disorder or opioid poisoning/adverse effects, were hospitalized at least 1 night in a medical/surgical inpatient unit, and were not receiving MOUD before hospitalization.

Interventions

Hospitals implemented an addiction consultation service that provided inpatient specialty care for substance use disorders. Consultation teams comprised a medical clinician, social worker or addiction counselor, and peer counselor.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The dual primary outcomes were (1) MOUD treatment initiation during the first 14 days after hospital discharge and (2) MOUD engagement for the 30 days following initiation.

Results

Of 2315 adults, 628 (27.1%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 47.0 (12.4) years. Initiation of MOUD was 11.0% in the Consult for Addiction Treatment and Care in Hospitals (CATCH) program vs 6.7% in TAU, engagement was 7.4% vs 5.3%, respectively, and continuation for 6 months was 3.2% vs 2.4%. Patients hospitalized during CATCH had 7.96 times higher odds of initiating MOUD (log-odds ratio, 2.07; 95% credible interval, 0.51–4.00) and 6.90 times higher odds of MOUD engagement (log-odds ratio, 1.93; 95% credible interval, 0.09–4.18).

Conclusions

This randomized clinical trial found that interprofessional addiction consultation services significantly increased postdischarge MOUD initiation and engagement among patients with opioid use disorder. However, the observed rates of MOUD initiation and engagement were still low; further efforts are still needed to improve hospital-based and community-based services for MOUD treatment.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^114R2b2q]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Settings-specific guidance for drug testing — organization and role states that recommended practices are proposed into two level-of-care categories: 1) Outpatient and Intensive Outpatient Services (Levels 1 and 2), and 2) Residential/Inpatient and Medically-Managed Intensive Inpatient Services (Levels 3 and 4); the document also examines drug-testing practices in OTS, with special considerations for OTPs and OBOT, noting that drug testing in OTS will differ because patients are on prescribed opioid agonist and/or antagonist medications, and that use of drug testing can assist in monitoring patients' response to different medication doses, monitoring adherence and in monitoring for possible medication diversion; recovery residences are considered though not included in The ASAM Criteria; maintaining a therapeutic drug-free environment is emphasized in Level 3 and 4 facilities as well as recovery residences, and drug testing is described as an important tool because it helps ensure a safe, recovery-oriented environment; the following recommendations are designed to provide additional guidance to providers working with addiction patients in specific settings.

### Trust in hospital physicians among patients with substance use disorder referred to an addiction consult service: a mixed-methods study [^114cD1nV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Trust is essential in patient-physician relationships. Hospitalized patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) often experience stigma and trauma in the hospital, which can impede trust. Little research has explored the role of hospital-based addictions care in creating trusting relationships with patients with SUDs. This study describes how trust in physicians changed among hospitalized people with SUDs who were seen by an interprofessional addiction medicine service.

Methods

We analyzed data from hospitalized patients with SUD seen by an addiction consult service from 2015 to 2018. Participants completed surveys at baseline and 30 to 90days after hospital discharge. Follow-up assessments included open-ended questions exploring participant experiences with hospitalization and the addiction consult service. We measured provider trust using the Wake Forest Trust scale. We modeled trust trajectories using discrete mixture modeling, and sampled qualitative interviews from those trust trajectories.

Results

Of 328 participants with SUD who had prior hospitalizations but had not previously been seen by an addiction consult service, 196 (59.8%) had both baseline and follow-up trust scores. We identified 3 groups of patients: Persistent-Low Trust, Increasing Trust, and Persistent-High Trust and 4 qualitative themes around in-hospital trust: humanizing care, demonstrating addiction expertise, reliability, and granting agency.

Conclusions

Most participants retained or increased to high trust levels after hospitalization with an addiction consult service. Addiction consult services can create environments where healthcare providers build trust with, and humanize care for, hospitalized patients with SUD, and can also mitigate power struggles that hospitalized patients with SUD frequently experience.

### Standards of care for the addiction specialist physician document [^111D6RnA]. ASAM (2014). Medium credibility.

Standard VI.1: Assuring continuity in addiction care — the addiction specialist physician encourages patients to meet with him or herself or with a designated care provider who intermittently monitors and assesses the patient's maintenance of recovery, and the assessment for continuing care management can include patient and collateral interview; physical and/or psychological examination as appropriate; structured rating scales; review of current medications; laboratory studies; and engagement in recovery activities.

### From embedded interprofessional clinics to expanded alcohol-associated liver disease programs [^113eg8tb]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Hazardous alcohol use remains a major contributor to acute and chronic liver disease, while alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading indication for liver transplantation. In recent years, embedded, interprofessional ALD clinics have improved access to alcohol use disorder care within hepatology and liver transplantation, but more work is needed to meet this challenge. The literature is lacking regarding scaling procedures to provide services for increasingly large ill patient populations. This article begins to fill this gap by describing "expanded ALD care": broad, innovative, longitudinal, interprofessional care delivery strategies surpassing standalone clinics. Drawing from analogous patient populations served by collaborative models in primary care and comprehensive eating disorder treatment, the expanded ALD care framework proposes practical strategies toward specific innovations: equipoise between biomedical and psychosocial care elements, increased clinician number and reach, long-term patient relationships, harm reduction and palliative care, outreach to external agencies and clinicians, and enhanced support for patients and families. The article also defines attributes of innovative healthcare systems that support expanded ALD care.

### Collaborative care approaches for people with severe mental illness [^112a9Tod]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Defining collaborative care

There is no universally agreed definition of collaborative care and variation exists in how it is operationalised. It is noted that "Interventions or organisational models similar to collaborative care are sometimes referred to as integrated care, enhanced care, or care management" (Muntingh 2016). In our original review, Reilly 2013, we reported the six unique definitions of collaborative care, cited in 13 systematic reviews of collaborative care (conducted between 2006 and 2016) for a range of mental health conditions (see Appendix 1). The description of collaborative care reported in Gunn 2006 was the most commonly cited and focuses on four 'core' elements: multi‐professional work between a primary care practitioner and at least one other service, a structured management plan in the form of protocols or guidance, scheduled patient follow‐ups and enhanced interprofessional communication. In all reviews, collaborative care was described as an intervention that aims to foster closer working relationships between primary care and specialist health care.

Operationalising collaborative care

Collaborative care models are often operationalised by way of a specific role, such as a case manager. In addition to prompting collaboration between services, the case manager role might involve work at the patient level according to a manual or protocol with regular follow‐up periods (e.g. providing low‐level psychological interventions, proactive follow‐up, patient education, promotion of self‐management and monitoring of clinical status, side effects and adherence, and shared decision‐making with patients). In our original review we noted that even when collaborative care interventions have similar components they can differ in the way these are provided (see Appendix 2 in Reilly 2013). For example, Bauer 2001 and Baker 2019 both describe collaboration between the case manager and the patient to achieve jointly identified goals. However, Bauer 2001 does this via group patient education and Baker 2019 via a one‐on‐one coaching model.

Collaborative care as a complex intervention

Collaborative care meets the definition of a 'complex intervention'. It includes several interacting components, which may act independently and interdependently and within pre‐existing systems for providing health care, and may create a range of possible outcomes (Craig 2008). As such, the 'active ingredient' of the intervention can be difficult to identify (Campbell 2000). For this reason, the Medical Research Council guidance recommends that the design and evaluation of complex interventions includes creation of a good theoretical understanding of how the intervention causes change (Craig 2008).

### Patients with substance use disorders leaving against medical advice: strategies for improvement [^111Vg6qY]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of Addiction Medicine, 2 studies fill an important gap in knowledge by examining predictors of leaving against medical advice from inpatient withdrawal management settings. The studies identify important risk factors for leaving against medical advice and highlight important areas for inpatient withdrawal management. These include the use of substance specific standardized protocols and initiation of opioid agonist treatment instead of opioid detoxification given harms associated with opioid withdrawal. Further need for increased training in addiction medicine for primary care physicians, and use of inpatient addiction medicine consult services as part of early intervention for substance withdrawal are also discussed.
