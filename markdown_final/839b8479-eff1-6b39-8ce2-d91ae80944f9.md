## Question

Visceral leishmaniasis management in HIV infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why HIV–VL coinfection changes outcomes. Then, I should verify the diagnostic strategy and its limitations in HIV. Next, I will review first-line treatment options, including liposomal amphotericin B regimens and the role of combination therapy. After that, I need to check ART timing and immune reconstitution considerations, including IRIS. Then, I will examine secondary prophylaxis, when to start, and when to stop. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, relapse management, and special populations, and close with a concise, practical algorithm that aligns with guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. HIV–VL coinfection is associated with higher mortality, treatment failure, and relapse, and patients often present with advanced immunosuppression, frequently with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm³, which drives atypical presentations and poor outcomes; VL is also an AIDS-defining illness in WHO staging, underscoring its severity and the need for aggressive, coordinated management [^4f0b7585] [^6915c1b0] [^b5776104].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach because serology underperforms in HIV. Serologic tests can be supportive but have lower sensitivity in people with HIV, so parasitologic confirmation is preferred when suspicion is high; bone marrow aspiration is safer than splenic aspiration, and molecular methods such as PCR improve detection and can track parasite burden during and after therapy, which is particularly useful for anticipating relapse in coinfected patients [^e55d580b] [^fec18520] [^5f24f9f8].

> I will now examine first-line therapy. Liposomal amphotericin B is the preferred agent across guidelines, with regimens targeting a total cumulative dose of 20–60 mg/kg delivered either as 3–5 mg/kg daily or via an interrupted schedule of 4 mg/kg on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38; this interrupted schedule is FDA-labeled and widely used in immunocompromised hosts, including those with HIV [^bf76543f] [^b37ff46f] [^b24a10d7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy being sufficient in coinfection. Combination therapy with liposomal amphotericin B plus miltefosine has been conditionally recommended by WHO based on randomized data showing improved relapse-free survival; in India, a phase 3 trial showed 85% relapse-free survival with AmBisome 40 mg/kg versus 96% with AmBisome 30 mg/kg plus miltefosine 1.4 g over 14 days, and in Ethiopia, combination therapy achieved 88% parasite clearance at day 58 versus 55% with monotherapy, supporting its use where feasible, particularly in L. donovani regions [^1460ba17] [^9c347ee0] [^5a0e5f78].

> Let me consider ART timing because immune reconstitution is pivotal. Guidelines advise initiating or optimizing ART as soon as the patient is clinically stable enough to tolerate it, ideally during or soon after the initial antileishmanial course; ART reduces relapse and improves survival, though clinicians should anticipate and manage immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, which can unmask or worsen leishmaniasis after ART starts [^ebc22d28] [^b55fd563] [^adee7fbe].

> Next, I should review secondary prophylaxis, since relapse risk is high without maintenance. For patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm³, chronic maintenance with liposomal amphotericin B 4 mg/kg every 2–4 weeks is recommended; alternatives include amphotericin B lipid complex every 21 days or meglumine antimoniate 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks, and prophylaxis can be discontinued once the CD4 count exceeds 350 cells/mm³, viral load is suppressed for at least 6 months, and there is no clinical evidence of relapse [^98cd231a] [^3502e9ba] [^477c8744].

> I need to ensure monitoring is explicit and indefinite in immunosuppressed patients. Coinfected individuals should be monitored indefinitely until effective immune reconstitution, with clinical surveillance for fever, weight loss, cytopenias, and organomegaly; routine parasitologic testing in asymptomatic patients is not recommended, but a positive peripheral blood PCR correlates with high relapse risk and may guide anticipatory management in select cases [^e87b6d17] [^254716b6] [^5f24f9f8].

> But wait, what if relapse occurs or initial therapy fails. In treatment failure or relapse, repeat or extend liposomal amphotericin B is reasonable, and combination therapy can be considered for refractory disease; rescue options such as pentamidine have case-level evidence, and any retreatment should be paired with optimized ART and reassessment of adherence and drug interactions [^3c2dc77f] [^2691119e] [^dcae3ba4].

> Let me think about special populations and drug safety. Miltefosine is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy, so pregnancy testing and reliable contraception are mandatory; in pregnancy, liposomal amphotericin B is preferred, and dose adjustments and close monitoring for infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity are essential, with prehydration and premedication as indicated [^1460ba17] [^a6f59ccf].

> I should double-check regional nuances. In South Asia, combination therapy is increasingly favored given superior outcomes in trials, whereas in East Africa, evidence supports combination regimens and highlights the limitations of lower-dose monotherapy; in all settings, integration with HIV programs, TB screening, and nutritional support improves outcomes and reduces loss to follow-up [^1460ba17] [^5a0e5f78] [^97608de3].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm. Confirm VL with parasitology given serology limitations in HIV, initiate liposomal amphotericin B to a total 20–60 mg/kg using daily or interrupted dosing, start or optimize ART as soon as stable, and add miltefosine in combination where feasible and not contraindicated; after initial cure, provide secondary prophylaxis if CD4 is below 200 cells/mm³, monitor indefinitely with clinical vigilance, and discontinue prophylaxis only after sustained immune recovery and virologic suppression without relapse; manage failures with repeat or extended L-AmB and consider combination or rescue therapy as appropriate [^e55d580b] [^bf76543f] [^ebc22d28] [^98cd231a] [^3502e9ba].

---

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^97608de3] with prompt diagnosis, ART initiation or optimization [^ebc22d28], and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) as first-line therapy [^bf76543f]. Combination therapy (L-AmB plus miltefosine) is **preferred in high-burden regions** [^1460ba17] due to superior efficacy and shorter duration [^9c347ee0]. Secondary prophylaxis is essential for patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm³ [^98cd231a] until immune reconstitution (CD4 > 350 cells/mm³ and undetectable viral load for ≥ 6 months) [^3502e9ba]. Relapse is common [^6915c1b0]; monitor indefinitely [^e87b6d17] and retreat with L-AmB or alternatives if relapse occurs [^3c2dc77f]. Antimonials are avoided due to toxicity and resistance [^9406468f]; miltefosine is teratogenic and contraindicated in pregnancy [^1460ba17].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

- **Clinical presentation**: VL in HIV often presents atypically [^4f0b7585], with gastrointestinal involvement, lymphadenopathy, and cutaneous dissemination [^da11f764].

- **Diagnostic methods**: Parasitological confirmation is essential [^e55d580b]; bone marrow aspiration is preferred over splenic aspiration due to safety concerns [^fec18520]. PCR has high sensitivity (> 95%) [^8474a138] and is useful for monitoring response and relapse [^5f24f9f8].

- **Serology**: Serological tests have lower sensitivity in HIV [^e55d580b]; immunoblotting with L. infantum antigen may improve detection [^8474a138].

---

## Treatment strategies

### First-line therapy

Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) is the **preferred agent** [^bf76543f] [^b37ff46f] (3–5 mg/kg/day IV or interrupted schedule to total 20–60 mg/kg) [^60a5c463]. Combination therapy with L-AmB plus miltefosine is **conditionally recommended** [^1460ba17] in high-burden regions (e.g. 30 mg/kg L-AmB plus 1.4 g miltefosine over 14 days) [^9c347ee0] due to higher efficacy and shorter duration [^240e093f].

---

### Alternative therapies

Miltefosine monotherapy is an **alternative for L. donovani** [^3c8364d2] (2.5–3 mg/kg/day PO for 28 days; max 150 mg/day) [^feef813f]. Amphotericin B deoxycholate or pentavalent antimonials are **less favored** due to toxicity and resistance [^9030610e] [^9406468f].

---

## Antiretroviral therapy (ART)

ART should be initiated or optimized as soon as the patient is stable [^ebc22d28] [^b55fd563] to improve outcomes and reduce relapse [^61ab2026]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may occur; treat symptomatically and continue ART [^adee7fbe] [^2bc88fee].

---

## Secondary prophylaxis

Secondary prophylaxis is indicated for patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm³ [^98cd231a] [^38d9cd42] to reduce relapse risk [^737cfdc8]. Preferred regimen: L-AmB 4 mg/kg IV every 2–4 weeks [^98cd231a]; alternatives include amphotericin B lipid complex or meglumine antimoniate [^98cd231a]. Discontinue prophylaxis when CD4 > 350 cells/mm³, viral load is suppressed for ≥ 6 months, and there is no clinical relapse [^3502e9ba] [^477c8744].

---

## Monitoring and management of relapse

Relapse is common [^6915c1b0]; monitor indefinitely [^e87b6d17] for clinical and parasitological recurrence. Retreatment options include repeating L-AmB or using alternatives such as miltefosine or pentamidine [^3c2dc77f] [^dcae3ba4].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: L-AmB is preferred; miltefosine is contraindicated due to teratogenicity [^notfound].

- **Drug interactions**: Monitor for interactions between antileishmanials and ART, particularly with protease inhibitors [^6c8ffc36].

- **Supportive care**: Address malnutrition, anemia, and co-infections (e.g. tuberculosis) to improve outcomes [^c69e1b92] [^97608de3].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| First-line therapy | L-AmB (3–5 mg/kg/day or interrupted schedule; total 20–60 mg/kg) [^bf76543f] [^b37ff46f] |
| Combination therapy | L-AmB + miltefosine in high-burden regions [^1460ba17] [^9c347ee0] |
| ART | Initiate/optimize as soon as stable [^ebc22d28] [^b55fd563] |
| Secondary prophylaxis | L-AmB 4 mg/kg every 2–4 weeks if CD4 < 200 cells/mm³ [^98cd231a] [^38d9cd42] |
| Monitoring | Indefinite clinical and parasitological follow-up [^e87b6d17] [^254716b6] |
| Relapse management | Repeat L-AmB or alternative agents [^3c2dc77f] [^dcae3ba4] |

---

Effective VL management in HIV hinges on **early diagnosis**, **prompt ART**, and **appropriate antileishmanial therapy** with secondary prophylaxis until immune reconstitution [^ebc22d28] [^bf76543f] [^98cd231a]. Combination therapy is preferred in high-burden settings [^1460ba17], and indefinite monitoring is essential due to high relapse rates [^e87b6d17].

### Combination treatment for visceral leishmaniasis patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India [^b5776104]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Considering the high probability of relapse in coinfected patients, there is a need to provide a safe and effective treatment while protecting the limited drugs available from the development of resistance. This is more pertinent because resistance mechanisms to amphotericin B have recently been described, and evidence from Ethiopia that high-dose AmBisome monotherapy was much less effective in HIV-positive VL relapse patients who had received previous treatment with AmBisome or amphotericin B compared with those who had not.

Our findings have a number of implications for policy and practice in India. Current WHO and NACO guidelines describe "atypical disseminated VL" as a stage IV-defining opportunistic infection, rather than simply "visceral leishmaniasis" and therefore do not recommend initiation of ART in all HIV patients with typical VL irrespective of CD4 count. This contrasts with WHO expert committee on VL recommendations delivered in 2010, where typical VL infection in HIV-infected patients is clearly identified as an AIDS-defining illness. These inconsistencies cause confusion in the field when making decisions to start ART in coinfected patients. The outcomes of the recent expert meeting between NACO and the NVBDCP in India to develop guidelines for the management of HIV-VL coinfection is a strong first step in developing clearer recommendations and convergence between WHO ART guidelines and VL guidelines. In turn, these study results strengthen emerging evidence that typical VL should be considered as a clear entry criterion in the stage IV definition of HIV, support the need to offer PICT to all patients diagnosed with VL and crucially that extended follow-up of coinfected patients is required to ensure relapses are detected early and treated appropriately. This needs to be done using a coordinated multidisciplinary approach between VL and HIV/AIDS programs.

In conclusion, the administration of a combination therapy of AmBisome and miltefosine appears safe and effective among HIV-VL coinfected patients under programme conditions in India. Early diagnosis of the coinfection, prompt initiation of ART, and anti-leishmania therapy, screening and treatment for tuberculosis and extended follow-up may lead to more favorable treatment outcomes.

### Clinical aspects of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV infection [^9406468f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

HIV infection profoundly impairs the immune mechanisms needed to control and clear Leishmania infection, and outcomes in patients with HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis are poor. This review summarizes recent work describing the epidemiology, presentation and outcomes of HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis and discusses advances in diagnosis and management.

Recent Findings

Studies have shown that serological tests can effectively diagnose HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis, with a sensitivity of 98% if direct agglutination test and rK39 assays are used in combination. Few data exist to guide treatment recommendations. Observational data show high rates of toxicity and treatment failure with pentavalent antimonials, and their use is no longer recommended. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) is better tolerated, but outcomes are suboptimal, with mortality rates of 7–12%, and parasitological failure rates of up to 32%. Initial reports suggest that L-AmB and miltefosine in combination may be effective in HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis; however, clinical trial data are lacking. Secondary prophylaxis reduces the rate of relapse, but optimal regimens have not been defined, and optimal timing of antiretroviral therapy initiation in patients with visceral leishmaniasis is unknown.

Summary

Recent studies have demonstrated the inadequacy of current treatments for HIV-associated visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials are needed to improve early diagnosis, develop combination therapies and define effective secondary prophylaxis regimens.

### The unwelcome trio: HIV plus cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis [^ab76119f]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Leishmania/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) coinfection has emerged as an extremely serious and increasingly frequent health problem in the last decades. Considering the insidious and not typical clinical picture in presence of immunosuppressive conditions, the increasing number of people travelling in endemic zones, the ability to survive, within both human and vector bodies, of the parasite, clinicians and dermatologists as the first line should be aware of these kind of "pathologic alliances", to avoid delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this setting, the occurrence of cutaneous lesions can, paradoxically, aid the physician in recognition and approaching the correct staging and management of the two (or three) diseases. Treatment of these unwelcome synergies is a challenge: apart from the recommended anti-retroviral protocols, different anti-leishmanial drugs have been widely used, according with the standard guidelines for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), with no successful treatment regimen still been established.

### Atypical manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis in patients with HIV in north Ethiopia: a gap in guidelines for the management of opportunistic infections in resource poor settings [^145914d4]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

In regions where it is endemic, visceral leishmaniasis is an important opportunistic infectious disease in people living with HIV. Typically, clinical presentation of visceral leishmaniasis includes chronic fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and weight loss. In Leishmania infantum endemic regions in Europe, atypical visceral leishmaniasis presentations have been well documented, with almost every possible organ involved. However, such reports are rare in Leishmania donovani endemic regions such as east Africa. In this Personal View, we describe the various atypical disease presentations in patients screened as part of an HIV and visceral leishmaniasis clinical trial in north Ethiopia, where up to 40% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis are co-infected with HIV. Atypical presentations such as these are not covered in clinical guidelines used in these settings. Apart from the lack of diagnostic facilities, this gap contributes to the underdiagnosis of atypical visceral leishmaniasis, with associated morbidity and mortality. Involvement of clinicians experienced with the management of HIV and visceral leishmaniasis co-infection in the development of HIV clinical guidelines in affected regions is warranted.

XXIV. How should HIV/AIDS-associated CL or ML be treated in persons in North America who do not have evidence of VL, and what other management issues should be considered?

Recommendations
67. In HIV/AIDS-associated CL/ML, systemic antileishmanial therapy is recommended, particularly in persons who are moderately to severely immunosuppressed (e.g. have CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell counts < 200–350 cells/mm 3), who may be at increased risk for suboptimal therapeutic responses, for posttreatment relapses, and for cutaneous, mucosal, or visceral dissemination [Strong, very low].
68. The systemic regimens used for CL/ML in otherwise comparable immunocompetent persons typically are recommended for the initial treatment of coinfected persons, taking into account the potentials for drug interactions and toxicity (Tables 3 and 4) [Strong, very low]. Remark: Whether coinfected persons who experience multiple posttreatment relapses of CL/ML would benefit from secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) has not yet been established.
69. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized in accordance with standard practice for HIV/AIDS; no evidence-based, CL/ML-specific recommendations regarding ART have been established [Strong, low].

### Visceral leishmaniasis [^09a7409b]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector-borne parasitic disease targeting tissue macrophages. It is among the most neglected infectious diseases. Classical manifestations of VL include chronic fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Most cases can be detected through serologic and molecular testing. Although therapy has historically relied on antimonials, newer therapeutic options include conventional or liposomal amphotericin B, paromomycin and miltefosine. Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is increasingly reported and comes with additional diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article provides an up-to-date clinical review of VL focusing on clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and issues related to HIV coinfection.

### HIV-1 protease inhibitors for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-co-infected individuals [^6c8ffc36]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

The global prevalence of HIV is a major challenge for control of visceral leishmaniasis, a disseminated protozoan infection. In some east African regions, up to 40% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis are co-infected with HIV. Management of visceral leishmaniasis in such patients is complicated by treatment failures and relapses, even while patients are receiving standard antiretroviral therapy. In-vitro studies have consistently documented an inhibitory effect of specific HIV-1 protease inhibitors on leishmania parasites, and the underlying mechanism is partly explained. With the global scaling up of HIV treatment, HIV-1 protease inhibitors are increasingly becoming available for second-line HIV treatment in regions where visceral leishmaniasis and HIV are endemic. However, additional research is needed before HIV-1 protease inhibitors can be taken forward for clinical use against visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients. Since the effect of protease inhibitors against Leishmania species was generally observed at high drug concentrations, efficacy and dose-response relationships should be studied in animals before these drugs are used in clinical trials. More extensive studies of all available HIV protease inhibitors are needed, including investigation of drug interactions and emergence of drug-resistant parasites. In addition to exploring the full potential of current HIV-1 protease inhibitors against visceral leishmaniasis, leishmania-specific protease inhibitors should be developed.

XXV. What is the preferred treatment of visceral/cutaneous leishmaniasis in immunocompromised hosts with solid organ transplant, persons with lymphatic-hematologic malignancies, or persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy for other reasons?

Recommendations
70. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) is recommended as the drug of choice for immunosuppressed persons with VL (Table 3) [Strong, low]. Remarks: The FDA-approved regimen is 4 mg/kg/day IV on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (total dose of 40 mg/kg). Higher doses and longer durations of therapy may be needed depending in part on the level of immunosuppression.
71. Doses of immunosuppressive drugs should be decreased in persons with VL during antileishmanial therapy whenever possible [Strong, very low].
72. Secondary prophylaxis is not recommended for initial management in persons with VL who have not manifested a relapse [Weak, low]. Remark: Immunosuppressed persons with VL who are not coinfected with HIV typically have higher response rates to initial treatment and lower recurrence rates than HIV-coinfected persons.
73. Routine serologic screening of organ donors from leishmaniasis-endemic areas is not recommended. If an available donor is known to be seropositive, it is advisable to perform clinical and laboratory monitoring of the recipient in the post-transplant period rather than to reject the organ for transplant [Strong, low].
74. We suggest that clinicians not routinely perform diagnostic testing to assess persons for evidence of asymptomatic visceral infection, including persons who have lived or traveled in leishmaniasis-endemic regions (Figure 3 Figure 3: Maps of the Geographic Distribution of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL)) and are considering organ transplantation or initiation of therapy with biologic immunomodulating agents. Immunosuppressed persons known or found to be asymptomatically infected and those with a history of VL warrant close monitoring. Neither preemptive treatment nor primary prophylaxis for VL in asymptomatically infected persons is suggested [Weak, very low].
75. Immunosuppressed persons with VL who are not coinfected with HIV should be monitored for a minimum of 1 year (ideally lifelong or until effective immune reconstitution) to assess for posttreatment relapse. During clinical follow-up, assess for symptoms and, if present, pursue parasitologic confirmation of relapse [Strong, very low].
76. Confirmed VL therapeutic failure typically can be managed by retreatment using L-AmB at the same or a higher total dose [Strong, very low]. Remark: Pentavalent antimonials could be used in some persons with VL under close follow-up.
77. We suggest that CL/ML associated with the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonist therapy be managed with systemic therapy and standard drug regimens for the pertinent setting/species (e.g. geographic area where the infection was acquired) [Weak, very low]. Remark: Withdrawal of TNF-α antagonists during antileishmanial therapy may be appropriate: the risks, benefits, and feasibility of this action should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Life Cycle Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies. The sandflies inject the infective stage from their proboscis during blood meals. Promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages and other types of mononuclear phagocytic cells. Viannia subgenus; in the midgut for organisms in the Leishmania subgenus), and migrate to the proboscis. Persons who have visceral leishmaniasis usually have fever, weight loss, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Some patients have swollen glands. Certain blood tests are abnormal. For example, patients usually have low blood counts, including a low red blood cell count, low white blood cell count, and low platelet count. Some patients develop post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis is becoming an important opportunistic infection in areas where it coexists with HIV.

Serology Antibody detection can prove useful in visceral leishmaniasis but is of limited value in cutaneous disease, since most patients do not develop a significant antibody response. In addition, cross reactivity can occur with Trypanosoma cruzi, a fact to consider when investigating Leishmania antibody response in patients who have been in Central or South America.

### Leishmaniasis: recognition and management with a focus on the immunocompromised patient [^698245f2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease whose clinical manifestations depend both on the infecting species of Leishmania and the immune response of the host. Transmission of the disease occurs by the bite of a sandfly infected with Leishmania parasites. Infection may be restricted to the skin in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), to the mucous membranes in mucosal leishmaniasis or spread internally in visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In the last 2 decades, leishmaniasis, especially VL, has been recognized as an opportunistic disease in immunocompromised patients, particularly those infected with HIV. Leishmaniasis is characterized by a spectrum of disease phenotypes that correspond to the strength of the host's cell-mediated immune response. Both susceptible and resistant phenotypes exist within human populations. Clinical cutaneous disease ranges from a few spontaneously-healing lesions, to diffuse external or internal disease, to severe mucous membrane involvement. Spontaneously-healing lesions are associated with positive antigen-specific T cell responsiveness, diffuse cutaneous and visceral disease with T cell non-responsiveness, and mucocutaneous disease with T cell hyperresponsiveness. Current research is focused on determining the extent to which this spectrum of host response is genetically determined. In endemic areas, diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds alone including: small number of lesions; on exposed areas; present for a number of months; resistant to all types of attempted treatments; and usually no pain or itching. Multiple diagnostic techniques are available. When evaluating treatment, the natural history of leishmaniasis must be considered. Lesions of CL heal spontaneously over 1 month to 3 years, while lesions of mucocutaneous and VL rarely, if ever, heal without treatment. Consequently, all the latter patients require treatment. Therapy is not always essential in localized CL, although the majority of such patients are treated. Patients with lesions on the face or other cosmetically important areas are treated to reduce the size of the resultant scar. In addition, the species of parasite should be identified so that infection with Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania panamensis can be treated to reduce the risk of development of mucocutaneous disease. Treating patients with Leishmania and HIV co-infection requires close monitoring for effectiveness of treatment, especially because of the high relapse rates. Proven treatments include: antimonials, pentamidine, amphotericin B, interferon with antimony. Treatments where current clinical experience is too limited include: allopurinol, ketoconazole, itraconazole, immunotherapy, rifampin, dapsone, localized heat, paromomycin ointment and cryotherapy. Investigational treatments include: WR6026, liposomal amphotericin and miltefosine. In addition, vaccines for leishmaniasis are being investigated in clinical trials.

Leishmaniasis in people with HIV — post-treatment monitoring and relapse surveillance: People with HIV who respond to initial treatment should be clinically monitored for relapse for at least 6 months to 1 year after treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis; those with infection with L. (Viannia) subspecies also should be followed for 2 to 5 years for nasal mucosa symptoms. People with HIV successfully treated for visceral leishmaniasis should be clinically monitored for symptoms or signs of recurrence such as fever, constitutional symptoms, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or cytopenia. Routine follow-up via parasitological testing with repeat biopsies or longitudinally tracking antibody levels is generally not recommended for people with HIV with treated leishmaniasis who do not demonstrate clinical signs or symptoms of recurrence. A positive peripheral blood PCR for Leishmania correlated with a high risk of relapse in people with HIV-visceral leishmaniasis coinfection. Cases of newly symptomatic leishmaniasis have been reported in association with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following initiation of ART, but existing experience is insufficient to provide data for specific management guidelines.

Leishmaniasis in Immunocompromised Hosts

XXIII. How should HIV/AIDS-associated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) be treated in persons in North America, and what other management issues should be considered?

Recommendations
61. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) is recommended for the treatment of VL in immunocompromised persons in North America (Table 3) [Strong, low]. Remark: The FDA-approved dosage regimen of L-AmB for such persons, including those with concurrent HIV/AIDS, is 4 mg/kg/day IV, on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (10 doses over a 38-day period), for a total dose of 40 mg/kg.
62. Combination therapy (e.g. L-AmB plus miltefosine) might be considered, especially for persons with refractory cases of VL [Weak, very low]. Remark: The efficacy and optimal duration of miltefosine monotherapy (and combination therapy) for HIV/AIDS-associated VL have not been established.
63. Because of the importance of effective immune reconstitution in HIV-VL-coinfected persons, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as the person is sufficiently stable to tolerate it (e.g. either during or soon after the initial course of therapy for VL) [Strong, low].
64. Leishmania infection that becomes clinically manifest or worsens after initiation of ART should be treated with antileishmanial (and, if indicated, corticosteroid) therapy; leishmaniasis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) reactions after initiation of ART have been reported occasionally [Strong, very low].
65. We recommend administering secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy) to decrease the risk for posttreatment relapse of VL in persons with HIV/AIDS-associated immunosuppression (e.g. CD4 T-lymphocyte cell counts < 200 cells/mm 3) [Strong, moderate].
66. Persons with VL-HIV/AIDS coinfection should be monitored indefinitely (until effective immune reconstitution) for evidence of posttreatment relapse; ART and secondary prophylaxis provide only partial protection against relapse. Antileishmanial treatment is indicated for persons who have clinical and parasitologic evidence of recurrence [Strong, low].

### Visceral leishmaniasis and HIV Co-infection in northwest Ethiopia: antiretroviral treatment and burden of disease among patients enrolled in HIV care [^1bd24d01]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

The approach to treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-HIV co-infection in East Africa has not been systematically examined. Although antiretroviral treatment (ART) should be initiated for all co-infected persons, the extent of ART prescription is not known. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all VL-HIV co-infected adults at selected referral and district hospitals in northwest Ethiopia from 2010 to 2015. Purposes of the study were to compare the proportion of VL diagnoses made in previously diagnosed HIV-patients versus diagnosis concurrent with HIV diagnosis and to quantify utilization of ART. We included 112 patients and 58 patients at the referral and district hospital, respectively (median age: 30 years, 98% males). Of all VL cases, 56% (63/112) and 19% (11/58) occurred in known HIV patients at the referral and district hospital, respectively, with a median CD4 count at VL diagnosis of 45 cells/µL and 248 cells/µL at the referral and district hospital, respectively. Seventy-six percent (56/44) were on ART at VL diagnosis and nine (12%) started ART after VL diagnosis. The remaining 96 (56%) patients had both infections diagnosed concurrently, with a median CD4 count of 56 and 143 cells/µL at the referral and district hospital, respectively. Among cured patients, ART initiation was 67% and 36% at the referral and district hospital, respectively. A substantial proportion of VL-HIV cases occur while in HIV care, requiring further evaluation of preventive strategies. Among newly diagnosed VL-HIV co-infected patients, ART initiation was low. The reasons, including poor documentation and information exchange, should be assessed.

### Leishmaniasis: treatment updates and clinical practice guidelines review [^da7546cb]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes recent important and interesting articles investigating the challenging treatment of the parasitic infection, leishmaniasis. In addition, it compares and contrasts leishmaniasis clinical practice treatment guidelines.

Recent Findings

Studies show that, in contrast to experience in India, visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa requires higher doses of liposomal amphotericin for effective treatment results and that pentavalent antimonial drugs remain efficacious. A retrospective study of visceral leishmaniasis in organ transplant patients suggests that there may be a role for secondary prophylaxis after treatment akin to HIV coinfection recommendations. The pros and cons of oral therapy with miltefosine, which cuts across leishmaniasis syndromes in its spectrum, are discussed. Cutaneous leishmaniasis clinical practice guidelines vary, although the recent European guidelines favor species-directed therapy.

Summary

Leishmaniasis remains a neglected tropical disease, with a need for additional clinical trials with better design and reported endpoints to lead evidence-based treatment recommendations — especially in cutaneous leishmaniasis and leishmaniasis in the immunocompromised host.

Preventing recurrence of leishmaniasis — relapses are common after cessation of therapy, and in HIV-co-infected patients with visceral leishmaniasis not receiving or responding to ART, the risk of relapse at 6 and 12 months was 60% and 90%, respectively, in the absence of secondary prophylaxis. Therefore, secondary prophylaxis with an effective antileishmanial drug, administered at least every 2 to 4 weeks, is recommended, particularly for patients with visceral leishmaniasis and CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/μL (AII).

### Combination treatment for visceral leishmaniasis patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India [^260bea3c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Visceral Leishmaniasis Treatment Protocol

Patients with HIV-VL coinfection were treated as in-patients using a combination of 30 mg/kg body weight AmBisome divided in 6 equal dose infusions given on alternate days, concurrently with 14 days of oral miltefosine. The dose of miltefosine was calculated according to patient weight (≥ 25 kg 50 mg twice daily; Weight 12– < 25 kg, 50 mg once daily). Test of cure was not routinely performed, with patients discharged as "initial cures" once they completed a full course of VL treatment and showed clinical improvement, cessation of fever, reduction of spleen size, and return of appetite at the time of discharge as per WHO descriptions of treatment response.

All newly diagnosed HIV patients were advised and counselled to start ART at the nearest government ART centre as per NACO guidelines. Of note, unlike in the African subcontinent, typical VL in India is not yet considered a stage IV AIDS-defining opportunistic infection; hence ART initiation is not typically offered to all HIV patients with VL regardless of CD4-count.

Patient Follow-up

At the time of discharge, all patients were instructed to return to the treatment centre if experiencing symptoms of relapse. Routine follow-up visits for all patients were scheduled every month to coincide with collection of ART from the ART centre. Follow-up absentees were actively traced. During each follow-up, patients were clinically screened by a physician for signs of relapse, and parasitological confirmation performed in case of suspicion. CD4 counts and ART adherence information were collected, and communication with ART providers maintained to allow integrated longer-term management of patients.

HIV/AIDS-associated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in North America — treatment and management recommendations are as follows: L-AmB is recommended for the treatment of VL in immunocompromised persons in North America (Table 3) (strong, low), and the FDA-approved dosage regimen of L-AmB for such persons, including those with concurrent HIV/AIDS, is 4 mg/kg/day IV (on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 [10 doses over a 38-day period], for a total dose of 40 mg/kg). Combination therapy (eg, L-AmB plus miltefosine) might be considered, especially for persons with refractory cases of VL (weak, very low). Because of the importance of effective immune reconstitution in HIV/Leishmania coinfected persons, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as the person is sufficiently stable to tolerate it (eg, either during or soon after the initial course of therapy for VL) (strong, low). Leishmania infection that becomes clinically manifest or worsens after initiation of ART should be treated with antileishmanial (and, if indicated, corticosteroid) therapy; leishmaniasis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) reactions after initiation of ART have been reported occasionally (strong, very low).

### Combination treatment for visceral leishmaniasis patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India [^b1b80e1d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL; Kala-azar) is a vector-borne disease caused by Leishmania donovani parasites. VL is endemic in the Indian state of Bihar, which accounts for 40% of the worldwide burden of VL. Although the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Bihar is considered low (0.2%–0.3%), it is one of the few states where prevalence is increasing. A recent study from India has suggested that 2.4% of all patients ≥ 14 years of age presenting with VL were unknowingly coinfected with HIV.

HIV-infected patients are more likely to develop symptomatic VL due to reactivation of dormant Leishmania infection acquired prior to being infected with HIV or due to a much higher rate of clinical manifestation following primary Leishmania infection after acquiring HIV. Therefore, VL is generally considered an opportunistic infection in patients with HIV and often presents with atypical clinical features. Coinfected patients are at higher risk of relapse and death, and this risk appears inversely correlated with CD4 counts. Furthermore, VL adversely affects the response to antiretroviral treatment. Worse outcomes and the treatment challenges faced by coinfected patients as compared to immunocompetent patients are well documented in the literature.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which reflects dissemination of Leishmania parasites throughout the reticuloendothelial system, is potentially life threatening without treatment. VL is an opportunistic infection in persons with HIV/AIDS or other causes of cell-mediated immunosuppression.

The primary goals of therapy for VL and CL/ML are to prevent mortality and morbidity, respectively. The only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for the treatment of leishmaniasis are intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) for VL and oral miltefosine for CL, ML, and VL caused by particular species. For prevention of leishmaniasis in travelers, no vaccines or chemoprophylaxis currently are available; personal protective measures to minimize exposure to sand fly bites are recommended.

Our recommendations for the diagnosis and clinical management of leishmaniasis are listed below. Background information about leishmaniasis, a description of our methods, and the evidence summaries that support our recommendations can be found online in the full text, tables, figures, and appendix of the guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [^622fc4a2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in immunocompromised hosts — treatment, screening, prophylaxis, and follow-up: L-AmB is recommended as the drug of choice for immunosuppressed persons with VL (Table 3) (strong, low). IV on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (total dose of 40 mg/kg). Doses of immunosuppressive drugs should be decreased in persons with VL during antileishmanial therapy whenever possible (strong, very low). Secondary prophylaxis is not recommended for initial management in persons with VL who have not manifested a relapse (weak, low). Routine serologic screening of organ donors from leishmaniasis-endemic areas is not recommended. If an available donor is known to be seropositive, it is advisable to perform clinical and laboratory monitoring of the recipient in the posttransplant period rather than to reject the organ for transplant (strong, low). We suggest that clinicians not routinely perform diagnostic testing to assess persons for evidence of asymptomatic visceral infection, including persons who have lived or traveled in leishmaniasis-endemic regions (Figure 3) and are considering organ transplantation or initiation of therapy with biologic immunomodulating agents. Immunosuppressed persons known or found to be asymptomatically infected and those with a history of VL warrant close monitoring. Neither preemptive treatment nor primary prophylaxis for VL in asymptomatically infected persons is suggested (weak, very low). Immunosuppressed persons with VL who are not coinfected with HIV should be monitored for a minimum of 1 year (ideally lifelong or until effective immune reconstitution) to assess for posttreatment relapse. During clinical follow-up, assess for symptoms and, if present, pursue parasitologic confirmation of relapse (strong, very low). Confirmed VL therapeutic failure typically can be managed by retreatment using L-AmB at the same or a higher total dose (strong, very low). Comment: Pentavalent antimonials could be used in some persons with VL under close follow-up. We suggest that CL/ML associated with the use of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonist therapy be managed with systemic therapy and standard drug regimens for the pertinent setting/species (eg, geographic area where the infection was acquired) (weak, very low). Comment: Withdrawal of TNF-α antagonists during antileishmanial therapy may be appropriate: the risks, benefits, and feasibility of this decision should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

### The risk and predictors of visceral leishmaniasis relapse in human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected patients in Ethiopia: a retrospective cohort study [^8d891df5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The current lack of reliable information on the risk and predictors of VL relapse has 2 important implications. First, there are no benchmark data to which interventions to decrease relapse can be compared. Second, identification of predictors is vital to improve patient management in a rational manner. Risk stratification is required to target preventive strategies to those most likely to benefit. This will avoid unnecessary follow-up visits thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare providers and patients. In this study, we aimed to identify the risk and predictors of VL relapse in HIV coinfected patients in Ethiopia.

Leishmaniasis and antiretroviral therapy — Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized following standard practice for HIV‑infected patients (AIII); there are no leishmaniasis‑specific data on when to start ART, and appropriate use of ART has substantially improved the survival of co‑infected patients in Europe and decreased the likelihood of relapse after antileishmanial therapy.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in immunocompromised patients without HIV/AIDS — The evidence base regarding treatment of VL in patients who are immunocompromised for reasons other than HIV/AIDS consists of case reports and small case series. We suggest that VL treatment be similar to what is recommended for induction therapy (ie, L-AmB) for persons with HIV/AIDS-associated VL, and L-AmB is recommended because of its safety profile and generally good efficacy. If an immunocompromised person with L. infantum-chagasi infection does not have therapeutic success with L-AmB, the administration of pentavalent antimonials can be effective. Severely immunosuppressed patients with VL also may have or develop dermatologic manifestations suggestive of diffuse or dermal leishmaniasis or mucosal involvement.

Leishmaniasis in HIV — preventing recurrence and relapse risk: Relapses, particularly of visceral leishmaniasis and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis, are common after cessation of antileishmanial therapy in people with HIV, and relapse is more frequent in those with lower CD4 count. Reported associations with relapse are prior episode of visceral leishmaniasis, CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3 at time of primary visceral leishmaniasis, and no increase in CD4 count at follow-up. In people with HIV-visceral leishmaniasis coinfection who were not receiving or responding to ART, the risk of relapse at 6 and 12 months was 60% and 90%, respectively, in the absence of secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance therapy).

Because the transmission is intra- and peridomiciliary, spraying houses with residual-action insecticides and using small mesh bed nets treated with long-lasting insecticides may be protective.

Leishmaniasis — clinical manifestations in HIV: The most common clinical presentation of leishmaniasis in HIV-infected individuals is a systemic visceral disease syndrome, with geographic variation; in Europe, visceral disease has been reported in 95% of cases (87% typical visceral, 8% atypical visceral), whereas in Brazil mucosal, visceral, and cutaneous forms have accounted for 43%, 37%, and 20% of reported cases, respectively. In patients with HIV and visceral disease, common findings include fever (65% to 100%), systemic malaise (70% to 90%), splenomegaly (usually moderate) (60% to 90%), hepatomegaly without splenomegaly (34% to 85%), hepatosplenomegaly (68% to 73%), lymphadenopathy (12% to 57%), and pancytopenia (50% to 80%).

### Combination therapy for visceral leishmaniasis [^78362f29]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Combination therapy for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis has increasingly been advocated as a way to increase treatment efficacy and tolerance, reduce treatment duration and cost, and limit the emergence of drug resistance. We reviewed the evidence and potential for combination therapy, and the criteria for the choice of drugs in such regimens. The first phase 2 results of combination regimens are promising, and have identified effective and safe regimens as short as 8 days. Several phase 3 trials are underway or planned in the Indian subcontinent and east Africa. The limited data available suggest that combination therapy is more cost-effective and reduces indirect costs for patients. Additional advantages are reduced treatment duration (8–17 days), with potentially better patient compliance and lesser burden on the health system. Only limited data are available on how best to prevent acquired resistance. Patients who are coinfected with visceral leishmaniasis and HIV could be a reservoir for development and spread of drug-resistant strains, calling for special precautions. The identification of a short, cheap, well-tolerated combination regimen that can be given in ambulatory care and needs minimal clinical monitoring will most likely have important public health implications. Effective monitoring systems and close regulations and policy will be needed to ensure effective implementation. Whether combination therapy could indeed help delay resistance, and how this is best achieved, will only be known in the long term.

In this strategy, the diagnosis and treatment of visceral leishmaniasis and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis should be provided free of charge at the primary health-care level; and a referral system including free transport, waiving hospital bed fees, provision of meals, and management of malnutrition and concomitant infections needs to be provided for complex cases. Regular training and mentoring of health workers should be in place, using innovative approaches, which can include telemedicine (mainly for post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis), a visceral leishmaniasis person as a point of contact, or a helpline. The detection of patients who are co-infected with HIV could be improved by screening patients with HIV for visceral leishmaniasis in endemic regions. Because these patients are prone to relapse and are infectious reservoirs, they should be regularly monitored. Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis is also a proven infectious reservoir, and our strategy to reduce the case load includes finding and treating these patients. Detection among leprosy-negative skin lesion cases from the hospitals treating leprosy can be an effective integrated approach. Because visceral leishmaniasis in east Africa is likely to occur as outbreaks, particularly during mass displacement within areas where the vector is present, surveillance and the provision of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment should be ensured.

These data led WHO 2022 HIV and visceral leishmaniasis coinfection guidelines to conditionally recommend combination liposomal amphotericin and miltefosine treatment; in Eastern Africa (L. donovani) miltefosine should be administered for 28 days, and in South East Asia miltefosine should be administered for 14 days. Since miltefosine is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnancy, β-hCG should be checked prior to initiation and effective contraception should be continued for 5 months.

### Combination treatment for visceral leishmaniasis patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India [^7e998790]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There are considerable numbers of patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the VL-endemic areas of Bihar, India. These patients are at higher risk of relapse and death, but there are still no evidence-based guidelines on how to treat them. In this study, we report on treatment outcomes of coinfected patients up to 18 months following treatment with a combination regimen.

Methods

This retrospective analysis included all patients with confirmed HIV-VL coinfection receiving combination treatment for VL at a Médecins Sans Frontières treatment center between July 2012 and September 2014. Patients were treated with 30 mg/kg body weight intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) divided as 6 equal dose infusions combined with 14 days of 100 mg/day oral miltefosine (Impavido). All patients were encouraged to start or continue on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Results

102 patients (76% males, 57% with known HIV infection, 54% with a prior episode of VL) were followed-up for a median of 11 months (interquartile range: 4–18). Cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and VL relapse at 6, 12, and 18 months was 11.7%, 14.5%, 16.6% and 2.5%, 6.0%,13.9%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of poor outcome at 6, 12, and 18 months was 13.9%, 18.4%, and 27.2%, respectively. Not initiating ART and concurrent tuberculosis were independent risk factors for mortality, whereas no factors were associated with relapse.

Conclusions

In this Bihar-based study, combination therapy appeared to be well tolerated, safe, and effective and may be considered as an option for treatment of VL in HIV coinfected patients.

DISCUSSION

This is the first report to our knowledge on HIV-VL coinfected patients receiving treatment with a combination of AmBisome and miltefosine therapy in the Indian subcontinent. Our data suggest that combination therapy is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for an episode of VL in HIV-VL coinfection within the Indian setting. The choice of 14 days of concurrent oral treatment had the added benefit of ensuring compliance as both treatments can be administered during the inpatient stay. However, a high risk of relapse and early death, similar to earlier studies on short- and long-term outcomes of coinfected patients is described in this cohort, particularly among tuberculosis patients and those not initiated on antiretroviral treatment. When compared to patients with VL not known to be HIV-infected treated with a lower dose monotherapy of 20 mg/kg AmBisome in the same setting, the outcome among coinfected patients observed in our study was considerably worse — mortality and relapse rates at 12 months for patients were 0.9% and 3.7% compared to 14.5% and 6.0%, respectively, for the coinfected patients described here.

In HIV-VL coinfected patients already taking or initiated on ART, this study demonstrated slightly higher overall mortality but substantially reduced relapse rates compared to coinfected patients treated with a lower dose 20–25 mg/kg AmBisome monotherapy, with mortality and relapse rates at 12 months of 11.2% and 6.4% compared to 8.7% and 16.2%, respectively. Concurrent tuberculosis was found to be an independent risk factor for overall poor outcome in our multivariable model, similar to other studies. No other sociodemographic or clinical factors were found to be associated with poor outcomes.

Baseline CD4 counts at the time of VL diagnosis were low in our cohort, with counts < 100 cells/µL at baseline being a significant risk factor for mortality in bivariate analysis, consistent with reports from an Ethiopian coinfected cohort. Patients receiving ART had substantially lower mortality than those who did not, confirming results of earlier studies on coinfected patients in the same programme and reinforcing the need for the central place of ART in the management of this group of patients.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis in people with HIV — clinical patterns vary by immune status; when HIV is well-controlled with high CD4 counts, presentation is not different than in those without HIV except that there may be a higher rate of relapse, whereas in those with lower CD4 counts (e.g., < 200 cells/mm3) dermal leishmaniasis may disseminate in the skin, mucosa, and viscera with multiple, often atypical lesions and more frequent genital involvement. Among people with HIV in Brazil, 68% had concomitant mucosal leishmaniasis, and people with HIV and visceral leishmaniasis may present with cutaneous lesions.

To evaluate the usefulness of a real-time PCR for Leishmania DNA in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Leishmania coinfection, Leishmania DNA levels were measured in whole peripheral blood from 25 HIV-infected patients with clinical features suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmania DNA was detected in 10 of 25 patients with microscopically confirmed visceral leishmaniasis and in none of those without this disease. Following treatment with liposomal amphotericin B, a clinical response was observed in 9 of 10 patients, in association with significantly decreased parasite loads. Seven patients relapsed clinically a median of 110 days after the end of treatment, in association with substantial increases in Leishmania DNA levels. Leishmania DNA levels correlated with the clinical course of visceral leishmaniasis, and their measurement at diagnosis and during and after treatment seems to be useful in the clinical management of HIV-infected patients with this disease.

Visceral leishmaniasis in HIV — miltefosine monotherapy scope and dosing: Oral miltefosine monotherapy is recommended as an alternative treatment option for Indian L. donovani visceral leishmaniasis in people with HIV at a dose of approximately 2.5 to 3 mg/kg daily (maximum of 150 mg daily) for 28 days (BII). Data supporting the use of miltefosine monotherapy in people with HIV are relatively limited and restricted to Indian L. donovani. For visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum, Pan American Health Organization guidelines recommend against miltefosine monotherapy due to lower efficacy and limited evidence, and currently there is no recommendation for combination therapy in visceral leishmaniasis due to L. infantum.

### Leishmaniasis in immunosuppressed individuals [^695b3c95]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Leishmaniasis is a vector-born chronic infectious disease caused by a group of protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Whereas most immunocompetent individuals will not develop disease after Leishmania infection, immunosuppression is a well-established risk factor for disease. The most severe form is visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is typically fatal if untreated. Whereas human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection (VL-HIV) was initially mainly reported from southern Europe, it is now emerging in other regions, including East Africa, India, and Brazil. VL has also been found in a wide range of non-HIV-related immunosuppressive states, mainly falling under the realm of transplantation medicine, rheumatology, haematology, and oncology. Clinical presentation can be atypical in immunosuppressed individuals, being easily misdiagnosed or mistaken as a flare-up of the underlying disease. The best diagnostic approach is the combination of parasitological and serological or molecular methods. Liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice. Treatment failure and relapse rates are particularly high in cases of HIV co-infection, despite initiation of antiretroviral treatment. Primary prophylaxis is not recommended, but secondary prophylaxis is recommended when the patient is immunosuppressed. Cutaneous leishmaniasis can have a number of particular features in individuals with immunosuppression, especially if severe, including parasite dissemination, clinical polymorphism with atypical and often more severe clinical forms, and even visceralization. Mucosal leishmaniasis is more common. Treatment of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis can be challenging, and systemic treatment is more often indicated. With globally increased travel and access to advanced medical care in developing countries, the leishmaniasis burden in immunosuppressed individuals will probably continue to rise, warranting increased awareness and enhanced surveillance systems.

Leishmaniasis — diagnosis in HIV-infected patients uses parasitologic methods: for cutaneous disease, demonstration of Leishmania parasites by histopathology, cultures, and smears in tissue specimens is the standard; for visceral disease, parasites may be demonstrated in blood smears (approximately 50% sensitivity in expert hands) and PCR amplification can also be useful for detecting Leishmania nucleic acid in blood or tissue (> 95% sensitivity). Serology should not be used as a screening test and should be used only as a confirmatory test in compatible cases; in HIV-infected patients, serology has a low sensitivity, so parasitological diagnosis should be sought when clinical suspicion exists. Immunoblotting with Leishmania infantum soluble antigen has been successful in detecting specific antileishmanial antibodies in up to 70% of European patients, and reports suggest that the serology sensitivity may remain fairly high in Ethiopia (77%–89% in HIV-visceral leishmaniasis co-infected patients, versus 87%–95% in HIV-negative patients). Leishmanin skin tests are nearly always negative in active visceral leishmaniasis.

An additional contributor to the rise of VL is decreased host susceptibility. Globally, this is most commonly caused by malnutrition, but in high-resourced countries this can also be caused by immunosuppression. Causative factors for the latter include HIV– Leishmania co-infection, initially recognized in Mediterranean intravenous drug users but now seen worldwide, and risks associated with biologic immunomodulating drugs, including post transplantation, and with the burgeoning use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors.

Leishmaniasis — epidemiology in HIV: Leishmaniasis occurs in 98 countries or territories with an estimated incidence of 1.6 million new cases annually, including as many as 1.2 million cutaneous and 0.4 million visceral cases; as of March 2010, HIV–leishmaniasis co-infection has been reported in 35 countries, predominantly as visceral leishmaniasis, and during the 1980s and 1990s more than 90% of co-infection cases were reported in southern Europe. In India's Bihar state, the prevalence of HIV infection among patients with visceral leishmaniasis increased from 0.88% in 2000 to 2.18% in 2006, and in Humera, northwestern Ethiopia, 31% of patients with visceral leishmaniasis were co-infected with HIV. In many disease-endemic areas, 30% or more of the population has a positive leishmanin skin test indicating latent infection, and in those with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 T lymphocyte cell count < 200 cells/mm3) manifestations can be atypical and more severe. In Southern Europe, HIV and Leishmania infantum visceral co-infections were reported in association with injection-drug use; Leishmania parasites were demonstrated in 34% to 52% of used syringes in Madrid and investigators have described a transmission cycle that relies on mechanical transfer of amastigotes via contaminated syringes.

### AmBisome monotherapy and combination amBisome-miltefosine therapy for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India: a randomized open-label, parallel-arm, phase 3 trial [^240e093f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Patients with VL-HIV coinfection represent a vulnerable population for whom access to appropriate care is hampered by a pervasive combination of health provider– and community-related stigma, substantial financial barriers, and lack of coordinated multidisciplinary care. This study represents the largest randomized trial of patients with VL-HIV globally to date, and the first of its kind in Asia. This study demonstrated that both treatment regimens appear to be safe and well tolerated, with 85% (n = 64; 95% CI, 77–100%) efficacy at 6 months for AmBisome monotherapy and 96% (n = 72; 95% CI, 90–100%) for the combination of AmBisome and miltefosine.

Prior to the current study, the safety and efficacy of the current WHO recommendations of a total dose of 40 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B had not been evaluated in the Indian subcontinent. This recommendation is based on a randomized trial involving 57 VL-HIV coinfected patients from southern Europe, with Leishmania infantum, and compared 2 regimens of amphotericin B lipid complex (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) with meglumine antimoniate. All regimes resulted in initial cure rates below 43%. This current recommendation for intermittent administration over 38 days is challenging for patients in lower- and middle-income countries, for whom lengthy inpatient stays or frequent ambulatory hospital visits result in substantial loss of income for both patient and caregiver, and likely increases the risk of nosocomial infection for a severely immunocompromised group in a region with high rates of antimicrobial resistance.

### Combination treatment for visceral leishmaniasis patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India [^6b3dceaf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Considering relapse, no associations with demographic characteristics were found, which is in keeping with a systematic review describing predictors of VL relapse in HIV-infected patients. However, unlike this review, our study failed to establish low CD4 count and previous history of VL treatment as risk factors for relapse, possibly for lack of power.

This study has several limitations. Being a retrospective analysis of program data, and despite demographic and clinical data related to VL treatment being complete, some important HIV-related data were missing, particularly timely CD4 counts following diagnosis. Second, all-cause mortality was used in the analysis, and as such we were not able to ascertain documented causes of deaths discovered during follow-up. However, all but 2 patients were discharged in good clinical condition following treatment completion, and the 2 deaths occurring before completion of treatment were not considered related to the therapy. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that any of the 16 deaths recorded in the cohort was a treatment related serious adverse event. The 2 patients who died after relapsing did so after retreatment was completed and were discharged with improved clinical condition. Finally, test of cure was not routinely performed on patients unless there was suggestion of treatment failure clinically, of which there were none; therefore the study may have underdiagnosed initial treatment failures.

Presently, the WHO recommends monotherapy with AmBisome up to a total of 40 mg/kg in divided doses for over a month in HIV-VL coinfected patients worldwide; however, this recommendation is made on the basis of patient case series involving L. infantum in Europe alone. To our knowledge, no case of L. donovani infection in a patient with HIV treated with this regimen has been documented in the Indian subcontinent, whereas high dose monotherapy with AmBisome already appears to be ineffective in African L. donovani infection, where studies evaluating the combination of AmBisome and miltefosine in coinfected patients have already begun. We therefore suggest that the use of this WHO-recommended regimen and the combination described in this study need to be investigated in further studies in order to help establish optimal dosing and safety profiles to help determine the best management of this challenging group of patients.

Leishmaniasis in adults and adolescents with HIV — epidemiology and immunosuppression context indicates that in Europe visceral disease has been reported in 95% of coinfections, comprising 87% typical visceral and 8% atypical visceral, while in Brazil mucosal, visceral, and cutaneous forms have accounted for 43%, 37%, and 20% of reported cases in people with HIV, respectively. In disease-endemic areas, 30% or more of the population has evidence of latent infection by leishmanin skin test, and in those with advanced immunosuppression (i.e. CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) disease can be atypical and more severe. Relapse after treatment — especially of visceral leishmaniasis — is common, and atypical disseminated leishmaniasis in people with HIV is considered a WHO clinical stage 4 HIV criterion.

### The risk and predictors of visceral leishmaniasis relapse in human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected patients in Ethiopia: a retrospective cohort study [^e33c0c7d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector borne protozoan disease caused by species of the Leishmania donovani complex that predominantly target the reticuloendothelial cells. Annually, an estimated 200000−400000 new VL cases occur within approximately 70 countries. Whereas L. infantum is the causative species in the Mediterranean region and South America, L. donovani is prevalent in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a risk factor for developing symptomatic VL, and the HIV epidemic led to the re-emergence of VL in the endemic countries of southern Europe. Prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale up, VL-HIV coinfection was common in southern Europe. It is now a major burden in low resource settings, where access to ART is limited. The highest burden worldwide is reported in northwest Ethiopia, where an estimated 20% of VL patients are HIV coinfected. Young, male, migrant workers from the highlands, who travel for seasonal work in this VL endemic area, are the most at risk.

Coinfected patients pose a challenge in clinical management: they present atypically, have higher rates of drug toxicity, treatment failure, mortality, and relapse. VL relapse is a new VL episode that occurs after an initial cure. Coinfected patients are not only at high risk of relapse but often have multiple relapses, which progressively become less responsive to therapy eventually causing death.

In East Africa, the region with the highest burden of coinfection and where L. donovani is prevalent, data on the risk and predictors of VL relapse are scarce. A systematic review reported relapse rates varying between 20 and 70%, but all except one of the studies included were from Europe, where L. infantum is prevalent. The only included study relating to L. donovani was conducted in Ethiopia. Moreover, this study had a relatively short patient follow-up time, and more than half of the patients were excluded from analysis, mainly due to loss to follow-up. Furthermore, this study was also conducted around 10 years ago, before the wide availability of ART. Currently, with the scaling up of ART, patient survival has increased, and gradually the patient profile is shifting from primary VL cases not on ART to relapse VL cases on ART.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) in immunocompromised persons — As with HIV/AIDS-associated CL, in persons with coexistent CL and immunosuppressive therapy for other underlying conditions, local therapies may often be practical; we recommend systemic instead of local therapy for CL. Species identification is important when treating CL in immunocompromised persons because the treatment recommendations or prognosis may vary. If the immunosuppression is drug induced, we recommend decreasing the dose of the drug, if feasible, or, if pertinent, withdrawing TNF-α antagonists. The evidence base for treatment of ML in immunocompromised persons is limited. In general, we recommend that CL and ML be treated as per the recommendations for HIV-coinfected patients.

Visceral leishmaniasis — The following medications have been used to treat visceral leishmaniasis: amphotericin B deoxycholate, liposomal amphotericin B, pentavalent antimonial drugs (e.g., meglumine antimoniate), and miltefosine (for L. donovani). Lower cure rates, higher drug toxicity, more relapses, and higher mortality summarize the treatment outcomes for people with HIV with visceral leishmaniasis. Amphotericin deoxycholate and lipid formulations of amphotericin B appear to be at least as effective as pentavalent antimonials. Liposomal and lipid complex preparations of amphotericin B are typically better tolerated than amphotericin B deoxycholate or pentavalent antimony (meglumine antimoniate).

Case management

Visceral leishmaniasis in east Africa is diagnosed by a rK39-antigen-based rapid test, used in clinically suspected cases. Because this test has a suboptimal sensitivity of around 85%, the following additional diagnostic tests are often necessary: microscopy detection of amastigotes in stained smears from lymph node punctures, bone marrow or spleen aspirates, and the direct agglutination test. Another drawback is that the rapid diagnostic test cannot be used for verifying cure, and it is less specific if typical symptoms are absent. The first-line treatment consists of a 17-day combination regimen of antimonials (namely sodium stibogluconate) and paromomycin which, due to its potential toxicity, is not suitable for all patients. Patients who are pregnant, severely ill, or older than 45 years are therefore treated with multiple-dose liposomal amphotericin B and HIV co-infected patients with a liposomal amphotericin B-miltefosine combin-ation instead. If treated in a timely manner, cure rates are generally high, although HIV and TB co-infections cause high relapse and mortality rates.

Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis is a skin sequela of visceral leishmaniasis that manifests usually within 6 months of treatment in a variable proportion of cured patients; in Sudan, prevalence is estimated to be up to 20%, in other countries it is not well documented. This condition is often mild and self-limiting, and most patients do not report to clinics. In severe cases, a treatment of 60–90 days of antimonials is necessary, which is highly toxic and demanding to patients and to hospitals.

A major drawback of the currently used diagnostic algorithms and treatments is that they are not suited for roll-out beyond the hospital or well equipped health centre. New treatments are under development: a clinical trial of a 14-day treatment with paromomycin and miltefosine is underway, with results expected in 2021, and there are new compounds that show promise as oral treatments of 10-day duration or less. A safe oral drug might offer prospects for chemoprophylaxis, to be given during the transmission season. Therapeutic vaccines could be an option for preventing relapse and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. The development of a more sensitive rapid test, preferably one that detects antigens, should be a priority. A simple, low cost DNA-detecting CRISPR-Cas-based rapid test is a promising option to be explored.

The FDA-approved 1997 L-AmB regimen for immunosuppressed persons was based on 3 nonrandomized European studies including 21 immunosuppressed persons, 17 with HIV. In these data, the first 10 of 19 persons meeting FDA criteria received 100 mg daily for 21 days (total dose, 2.1 grams; 29–38.9 mg/kg), all responded clinically and parasitologically, yet 8 persons (80%) relapsed. The other 9 evaluable HIV-infected persons were treated with the FDA-approved schedule (total dose, 40 mg/kg), all 9 initially had a "cure", but all of the other 7 persons relapsed 2–7 months posttreatment; only one patient was alive at 26 months, and among the other 6 persons the mean interval from initial VL diagnosis to death was 19 months (range, 5–40 months).

HIV/AIDS-associated visceral leishmaniasis in North America — treatment and prevention: L-AmB is recommended for the treatment of VL in immunocompromised persons in North America (strong, low), with the FDA-approved regimen of 4 mg/kg/day IV on days 1–5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (10 doses over a 38-day period), for a total dose of 40 mg/kg. Combination therapy (eg, L-AmB plus miltefosine) might be considered, especially for refractory VL (weak, very low). Because effective immune reconstitution is important, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or optimized as soon as the person is judged to tolerate it (eg, either during or soon after initial anti-leishmanial therapy for VL) (strong, very low). Leishmania infection that becomes clinically manifest or worsens after initiation of ART should be treated with antileishmanial (and, if indicated, corticosteroid) therapy; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome reactions after ART have been reported occasionally (strong, very low). Secondary prophylaxis is recommended to decrease the risk for posttreatment relapse in persons with HIV/AIDS-associated immunosuppression (eg, CD4 T-lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm3) (strong, moderate). Persons with VL and HIV/AIDS coinfection should be monitored indefinitely (until effective immune reconstitution) for evidence of posttreatment relapse; ART and secondary prophylaxis provide only partial protection, and antileishmanial treatment is indicated for clinical and parasitologic recurrence (strong, low).

### Clinical testing and diagnosis for leishmaniasis… [^fec18520]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Different laboratory tests are available to diagnose leishmaniasis.
- Some of the diagnostic methods are only available in reference laboratories.
- In the United States, CDC provides reference diagnostic services for leishmaniasis. Background Various laboratory methods can be used to detect the parasite and to identify the Leishmania species. Some of the methods are available only in reference laboratories. Determining a screening approach Leishmaniasis is diagnosed by detecting Leishmania parasites in tissue specimens, such as from skin lesions, or from bone marrow. This can be done via light-microscopic examination of stained slides, molecular methods, and specialized culture techniques. Identification of the Leishmania species also can be important, particularly if more than one species is found where the patient lived or traveled and if they can have different clinical and prognostic implications.

The species can be identified by various approaches, such as molecular methods and biochemical techniques. For visceral leishmaniasis, serologic testing can provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis. The performance of various serologic assays may vary by geographic region and by host factors. Most serologic assays do not reliably distinguish between active and quiescent infection. Although leishmanin skin-test preparation is used in some endemic countries, this has not been approved for use in the United States.

Note: For VL, although the diagnostic sensitivity typically is higher for splenic aspirates than for specimens from other organs/tissues, splenic aspiration can be associated with life-threatening hemorrhage, even if conducted under radiologic guidance. Bone marrow aspiration is much safer. Examples of other potential sources of specimens for diagnostic testing include liver, lymph node, and whole blood or buffy coat. Among HIV-infected patients, the parasite also may be found in atypical sites. Resources In the United States, CDC provides reference diagnostic services for leishmaniasis. CDC accepts both unpreserved and formalin-fixed specimens for testing, however, submission of specimens requires pre-approval.

### Leishmaniasis chemotherapy – challenges and opportunities [^1aa40d55]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Although there have been significant advances in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), there remain challenges to ensure that treatments effective in India are also effective in other regions of the world and to identify treatment for post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis as well as the opportunity to develop a safe oral short-course treatment. At the same time, there have been few advances for the treatment of simple or complex forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), other than topical paromomycin formulations. The main challenge for CL is to ensure that this disease is on the research and development agenda, so that new drugs are evaluated or compounds are screened in appropriate models, and that the standardization of quality of clinical trials is guaranteed. Problems also remain in the treatment of HIV/leishmaniasis co-infected patients. We are some way from having the ideal treatments for VL and CL and drug research and development for these diseases must remain focused.

### AmBisome monotherapy and combination amBisome-miltefosine therapy for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus in India: a randomized open-label, parallel-arm, phase 3 trial [^5a0e5f78]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

One-third of all patients with human immunodeficiency virus (PHIV) worldwide live in regions where leishmaniasis is endemic. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani is endemic to Bihar, a populous state of 125 million people in North India, which has, until very recently, carried an estimated 40% of the global VL burden. Moreover, Bihar is one of the few states in India where the rate of new HIV infections is increasing. This has major implications for VL–HIV coinfection: like other opportunistic infections in PHIV, Leishmania amastigotes have evolved strategies to survive, which are enhanced by HIV coinfection and accelerate progression of disease. This may help explain why the risk of developing VL is estimated to be between 100 and 2300 times higher in individuals with HIV than in those who are HIV negative.

Evidence of treatment for coinfected patients is limited due to a lack of randomized trials and is mostly from observational studies with relatively short follow-up periods, and often with high rates of loss to follow-up. Nevertheless, worse outcomes in almost every respect have consistently been reported in this patient group when compared with patients not known to be HIV positive.

More recently, evidence from a noncomparative randomized trial of 59 VL–HIV coinfected patients in Ethiopia has been published examining a combination of AmBisome (liposomal amphotericin B; total dose of 30 mg/kg in 6 divided doses) with miltefosine (100 mg/day for 28 days) and AmBisome monotherapy (total dose of 40 mg/kg in 8 divided doses over 24 days). This showed poor performance in the monotherapy arm (adjusted efficacy at day 58 of 55%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 32–78%), whereas the combination arm reached an 88% (95% CI, 79–98%) efficacy rate at the end of treatment, albeit an extended repeat treatment strategy was required for substantial numbers of initial treatment failures in both arms. Furthermore, the addition of a secondary prophylaxis due to high relapse rates seen in the geographical context limited evaluation of long-term primary treatment efficacy.

### Clinical care of leishmaniasis… [^c69e1b92]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment of CL may be indicated to:

- Decrease the risk for mucosal dissemination/disease;
- Accelerate the healing of the skin lesions;
- Decrease the risk for relapse of the skin lesions;
- Decrease the local morbidity caused by large or persistent skin lesions, particularly those on the face or ears or near joints; and/or
- Decrease the reservoir of infection in geographic areas where infected persons serve as reservoir hosts showed modest activity against L. mexicanaand L. panamensisinfection in small studies in Guatemala and Panama, respectively.

Itraconazole was ineffective against L. panamensisinfection in a clinical trial in Colombia. The use of highly effective systemic therapy for VL is important, as is supportive care — for example, therapy for malnutrition, anemia/bleeding, and intercurrent infections. For HIV-coinfected patients, antiretroviral therapy should be started or optimized according to standard practice; appropriate use of ART may delay relapses and improve survival. Liposomal amphotericin B is FDA-approved for treatment of VL and generally is the treatment of choice for U. S. patients. Although various regimens have been suggested in the published literature, the FDA-approved regimen for immunocompetent patients consists of 3 mg per kg daily, by IV infusion, on days 1–5, 14, and 21.

Pentavalent antimonial therapy generally remains highly effective therapy for VL in most geographic regions, with the notable exception of parts of South Asia. The standard dosage regimen for immunocompetent patients consists of 20 mg of Sb Vper kg daily, IV or IM, for 28 days. For some patients, adjustment of the daily dose or the duration of therapy may be indicated.

The management of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV-infected patients is complex because of high mortality rates, toxic drug-related side effects, and a high risk of treatment failure and relapse. We report a case of active chronic VL in an HIV-1-infected woman presenting multiple secondary VL episodes over 7 years leading to massive splenomegaly and blood transfusion-dependent anemia despite several treatment courses and secondary prophylaxis. The patient was finally successfully treated with rescue treatment based on intravenous pentamidine. Twenty months after discontinuation of pentamidine the patient presented complete clinical and parasitological response. In patients with active chronic VL, treatment with intravenous pentamidine can be effective and should be considered as rescue treatment.

Abstract

Background

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presents an increasingly important patient cohort in areas where both infections are endemic. Evidence for treatment is sparce, with no high-quality studies from the Indian subcontinent.

Methods

This is a randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, phase 3 trial conducted within a single hospital in Patna, India. One hundred and fifty patients aged ≥ 18 years with serologically confirmed HIV and parasitologically confirmed VL were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment arms, either a total 40 mg/kg intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome; Gilead Pharmaceuticals) administered in 8 equal doses over 24 days or a total 30 mg/kg intravenous AmBisome administered in 6 equal doses given concomitantly with a total 1.4 g oral miltefosine administered through 2 daily doses of 50 mg over 14 days. The primary outcome was intention-to-treat relapse-free survival at day 210, defined as absence of signs and symptoms of VL or, if symptomatic, negative parasitological investigations.

Results

Among 243 patients assessed for eligibility, 150 were recruited between 2 January 2017 and 5 April 2018, with no loss to follow-up. Relapse-free survival at day 210 was 85% (64/75; 95% CI, 77–100%) in the monotherapy arm, and 96%, (72/75; 90–100%) in the combination arm. Nineteen percent (28/150) were infected with concurrent tuberculosis, divided equally between arms. Excluding those with concurrent tuberculosis, relapse-free survival at day 210 was 90% (55/61; 82–100%) in the monotherapy and 97% (59/61; 91–100%) in the combination therapy arm. Serious adverse events were uncommon and similar in each arm.

Conclusions

Combination therapy appears to be safe, well tolerated, and effective, and halves treatment duration of current recommendations.

### Access to medicines for treating people with cryptococcal meningitis [^142aee58]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The decline in HIV-associated deaths has stagnated, and there is a growing appreciation that advanced HIV disease is a persistent challenge that requires targeted attention. Cryptococcal meningitis remains a leading cause of HIV-associated mortality. An updated review of the global burden of cryptococcal disease shows little change over the past decade. From 2020 estimates, there are 179,000 cases of cryptococcal antigenemia (infection) globally in 2020 and 152,000 cases of cryptococcal meningitis, resulting in 112,000 cryptococcal-related deaths. There has been a reduction in the estimated absolute global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis compared to estimates from 2014, likely due to expanded coverage of antiretroviral therapy; however, cryptococcal disease still accounts for one in five AIDS-related deaths, similar to previous estimates.

The new clinical management of cryptococcal meningitis guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 2022 strongly recommend a single high-dose of liposomal amphotericin B with 2 weeks of flucytosine and fluconazole as the preferred treatment. This recommendation was made following a multi-country trial showing this regimen is at least as effective as the standard of care, with better safety, and fewer monitoring demands. The favourable safety profile of the single-dose liposomal amphotericin B–containing regimen has a lower risk of anaemia and hypokalaemia, reducing the intensity of monitoring and the need to manage drug-related toxicity. The single high-dose containing regimen was also preferred by providers because it was less time consuming to prepare, and may allow for faster hospital discharge.

Liposomal amphotericin B is a preferred drug for the management of a number of co-infections that are common among people living with HIV. In the last two years WHO has released guidelines for the management of disseminated histoplasmosis and visceral leishmaniasis in people living with HIV and both of these guidelines recommend liposomal amphotericin B as part of a preferred treatment regimen. However, despite having received regulatory approval in 1997, and being off patent since 2016 in the United States, the drug remains unaffordable and unavailable in public healthcare systems in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Serologic testing in HIV-associated leishmaniasis — use and limitations are specified: Serologic tests that detect Leishmania antibodies have high sensitivity and can be used to support diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in immunocompetent patients, but they should be used only in those with a compatible clinical picture and an exposure history suggestive of visceral leishmaniasis. Because serology has a lower sensitivity in people with HIV, parasitological diagnosis should be sought when clinical suspicion has been raised. The use of recombinant antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (or ELISAs) may increase sensitivity, yet a proportion of people with HIV-leishmaniasis coinfection remain seronegative, and immunoblotting with L. infantum soluble antigen has been successful in detecting specific antileishmanial antibodies in up to 70% of patients.
