## Question

Is a craniotomy performed for meningioma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a craniotomy is performed for meningioma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard of care for intracranial meningiomas and when surgery is indicated. Then, I should verify what surgical access is typically required to remove a meningioma. Next, I will check for direct examples of craniotomies used across different meningioma locations. After that, I need to consider minimally invasive alternatives and whether any of them obviate the need for craniotomy when resection is planned. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence into a clear answer with risk and context considerations [^112m6yfo].

> Let me first confirm the clinical standard. When intervention is necessary due to tumor size, mass effect, symptoms, or edema, maximal safe surgical resection is the mainstay, with radiotherapy typically used as adjunctive or, in selected cases, as a stand‑alone option, while observation is reasonable for incidental, small, asymptomatic tumors with low‑risk features [^112m6yfo] [^115BsT5m] [^111DFjv3] [^114ae3xe].

> I will now examine how surgeons access an intracranial meningioma. To remove an intracranial tumor, the surgeon generally creates a bone flap and opens the dura — by definition, a craniotomy — after which the lesion is microsurgically resected and the dura is reconstructed as needed; wait, I should double‑check that contemporary series describing meningioma excision explicitly involve craniotomy and dural closure choices, which they do [^116J4Eoe] [^115Y6Lgk].

> Next, I should review concrete examples. Direct reports describe lateral suboccipital craniotomy for cerebellopontine‑angle meningiomas, supraorbital "keyhole" minicraniotomy for olfactory groove meningiomas, frontotemporal/pterional craniotomy for tuberculum/dorsum sella lesions, and modified orbitozygomatic craniotomy for intraorbital meningiomas; hold on, let me verify — these are indeed meningioma‑specific series using craniotomy for access [^1166gGUT] [^117K9BvQ] [^115UsMQv] [^111E8tJJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — are all minimally invasive approaches still craniotomies? Initially, I thought so, but I should correct that: the supraorbital "keyhole" approach is a minicraniotomy, whereas the expanded endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) is transnasal and not a craniotomy; however, algorithms reserve EEA for select anterior skull base meningiomas, and when transcranial resection is pursued, a craniotomy remains the route of access [^117K9BvQ] [^113uDF28].

> But wait, what if surgery is not chosen at all? Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy can be used definitively for small, well‑selected benign meningiomas or as adjuvant therapy after subtotal resection; I should confirm control rates and indications — long‑term control for WHO grade I lesions is high with SRS, but higher‑grade tumors fare worse, reinforcing that when gross total resection is the goal, operative management via craniotomy is standard [^113dM9gw] [^117KEcf8] [^111DFjv3] [^112m6yfo].

> Hold on, I should verify perioperative considerations because the access choice has implications. Craniotomy for tumor carries known risks such as postoperative seizures and rare vascular complications like delayed dural arteriovenous fistula; let me double‑check the data — nationwide data show notable cumulative risk of de novo epilepsy after craniotomy, and case series document dAVFs after craniotomy for meningioma resection, emphasizing the need for careful patient selection and counseling, though repeated craniotomies do not necessarily increase morbidity in well‑selected patients [^113pkFfZ] [^116boA3u] [^113JnPoF].

> Synthesis: I need to ensure the bottom line is clear. Yes, a craniotomy is performed for meningioma when surgical resection is indicated; transcranial removal of an intracranial meningioma requires opening the skull and dura, with the craniotomy tailored to tumor location and goals of resection, while minimally invasive non‑craniotomy options like EEA apply only to select skull‑base cases and nonoperative modalities such as radiosurgery are reserved for specific scenarios or as adjuncts [^112m6yfo] [^116J4Eoe] [^117K9BvQ] [^113dM9gw].

Craniotomy is the **standard surgical approach** for meningioma resection when the tumor is symptomatic, growing, or causing mass effect [^112m6yfo] [^114ae3xe]. The goal is **maximal safe resection** to relieve symptoms, reduce recurrence, and obtain tissue for diagnosis and molecular profiling [^112m6yfo] [^111DFjv3]. Craniotomy is tailored to tumor location and size [^112m6yfo], with alternatives such as stereotactic radiosurgery [^113dM9gw] or observation [^116vV7sD] for small, asymptomatic, or high-risk patients [^115BsT5m]. Because risks include neurological deficits [^111fgSfC], infection [^113VVdf5], hemorrhage, and recurrence [^112m6yfo], careful patient selection and multidisciplinary planning are essential.

---

## Indications for craniotomy in meningioma

Craniotomy is **indicated** based on clinical and radiological factors:

- **Symptomatic tumors**: Causing neurological deficits, seizures, headaches, or visual disturbances [^114ae3xe].

- **Tumor growth**: Documented enlargement on serial imaging [^116vV7sD].

- **Mass effect**: Significant edema or brain compression [^112m6yfo].

- **High-grade tumors**: WHO grade II or III, due to higher recurrence and aggressive behavior [^112m6yfo].

- **Patient preference**: Desire for definitive treatment after counseling [^115BsT5m].

---

## Surgical techniques and approaches

The choice of **surgical approach** depends on tumor location, size, and relationship to critical structures:

| **Tumor location** | **Common surgical approaches** |
|-|-|
| Convexity | Standard craniotomy and Simpson grade I or II resection [^113hdJCY] |
| Parasagittal | Craniotomy with sinus preservation or reconstruction [^1113Q95D] |
| Skull base | - Pterional <br/> - Orbitozygomatic [^113uDF28] <br/> - Endoscopic-assisted approaches [^111HS7zb] |
| Posterior fossa | Suboccipital craniotomy and the retrosigmoid approach [^111wEob6] |
| Intraventricular | Parieto-occipital transcortical and transcallosal approaches [^1176bg59] |

---

## Risks and complications

Craniotomy for meningioma carries potential **risks and complications**, including:

- **Neurological deficits**: Temporary or permanent, depending on tumor location and extent of resection [^111fgSfC].

- **Infection**: Meningitis or wound infection.

- **Hemorrhage**: Intraoperative or postoperative bleeding [^113swDx6].

- **Seizures**: Postoperative epilepsy [^113pkFfZ].

- **Recurrence**: Particularly in higher-grade tumors or incomplete resections [^112m6yfo] [^111DFjv3].

---

## Outcomes and prognosis

Outcomes after craniotomy for meningioma are **generally favorable**, particularly for benign (WHO grade I) tumors, with gross total resection achieving approximately 90%, 80%, and 70% recurrence-free survival at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively [^111DFjv3]. WHO grade II and III tumors have higher recurrence rates and may require adjuvant radiotherapy [^112m6yfo] [^116XuwGd]. Most patients experience improvement or stabilization of neurological function postoperatively [^115cvv3H].

---

## Alternative treatments

Alternative treatments to craniotomy include **stereotactic radiosurgery**, effective for small, asymptomatic, or surgically inaccessible tumors [^113dM9gw] [^117KEcf8]. Observation is appropriate for incidental, asymptomatic, slow-growing tumors [^116vV7sD] [^115BsT5m]. Fractionated radiotherapy serves as adjunctive therapy for residual or recurrent tumors [^111DFjv3] [^112m6yfo].

---

## Factors influencing surgical decision-making

Several factors **influence the decision** to perform craniotomy:

- **Patient age and comorbidities**: Elderly or medically fragile patients may have higher surgical risks [^115Lbwwd].

- **Tumor size and location**: Larger or critically located tumors may require more complex surgical approaches [^113hdJCY].

- **Tumor grade**: Higher-grade tumors may necessitate more aggressive surgical and adjunctive treatments [^112m6yfo].

- **Patient preferences**: Informed patient choice plays a significant role in treatment selection [^115BsT5m].

---

Craniotomy is the standard surgical approach for meningioma, aiming for **maximal safe resection** to relieve symptoms, reduce recurrence, and provide tissue for diagnosis. The decision to perform craniotomy depends on tumor characteristics, patient factors, and available alternatives, with careful weighing of risks and benefits.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^115BsT5m]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Initial treatment strategies for meningiomas include observation, surgical resection, and/or radiotherapy. Among these, radiation is widely accepted as a stand-alone treatment for a presumed meningioma or as an adjunct after surgery, but not within the scope of this review. Surgery is not indicated for all meningiomas. A range of factors impact the decision for surgical management and timing of intervention, including presenting symptoms, patient age, medical comorbidities, and tumor characteristics, such as size, the presence of edema, and/or mass effect in the surrounding brain.

Intracranial meningiomas are often incidentally found, with an increasing incidence likely due to an aging population and more frequent utilization of sensitive brain imaging. Studies report that the presence of one or more meningiomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is nearly 1% of the general population. While there is no class I or II evidence to support a standard protocol, incidental, asymptomatic, small to moderate-sized meningiomas without concerning radiographic features are generally monitored with serial imaging. The reported growth rates of untreated, incidental meningiomas vary greatly, with growth reported in 11% to 74% of patients, of which 0% to 56% become symptomatic. The majority of tumors grow less than 1 cm³/year, but growth can range anywhere from 0.03 to 2.62 cm³/year. These wide ranges underscore the relative biologic heterogeneity of meningiomas.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^112m6yfo]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, accounting for nearly 40% of intracranial tumors. When intervention is necessary due to size and/or symptomatology, the mainstay of treatment is maximal safe resection. Surgical intervention alleviates mass effect, relieves associated neurological symptoms, decreases risk of recurrence, and provides for diagnosis and molecular characterization. Gross total resection (GTR) is often considered curative in many cases. Radiotherapy can be used as a stand-alone approach and, more commonly, as an adjunct for more aggressive lesions. There are currently no effective standard pharmacological therapies.

Meningiomas are divided into three World Health Organization (WHO) grades (Grades 1–3) based on histology. Grade 1 tumors are often considered benign tumors and are the most common, accounting for 80% of all meningiomas, demonstrating a relatively low risk of recurrence. WHO grade 1 meningiomas have historically and generally been considered a "benign" tumor type, readily cured through surgical resection. Grade 2 and 3 meningiomas are higher-grade tumors that can exhibit increased growth and recurrence rates of more than 70% following GTR, as well as increased mortality despite multimodal therapy.

As our understanding of meningioma natural history has progressed, these tumors are increasingly recognized as a significantly more complex and heterogeneous group. Indeed, meningiomas do not always behave in accordance with their WHO grade, such that histologically confirmed grade 1 tumors can demonstrate unexpected recurrence.

### Radiosurgery as definitive management of intracranial meningiomas [^113dM9gw]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Stereotactic radiosurgery has become an important primary or adjuvant, minimally invasive management strategy for patients with intracranial meningiomas, with the goals of long-term tumor growth prevention and maintenance of patient neurological function. We evaluated clinical and imaging outcomes of meningiomas stratified by histological tumor grade.

- **Methods**: The patient cohort consisted of 972 patients with 1,045 intracranial meningiomas managed during an 18-year period. The series included 70% women, 49% of whom had undergone a previous resection and 5% of whom had received previous fractionated radiation therapy. Tumor locations included middle fossa (n = 351), posterior fossa (n = 307), convexity (n = 126), anterior fossa (n = 88), parasagittal region (n = 113), or other (n = 115).

- **Results**: The overall control rate for patients with benign meningiomas (World Health Organization Grade I) was 93%. In those without previous histological confirmation (n = 482), tumor control was 97%. However, for patients with World Health Organization Grade II and III tumors, tumor control was 50% and 17%, respectively. Delayed resection after radiosurgery was necessary in 51 patients (5%) at a mean of 35 months. After 10 years, Grade I tumors were controlled in 91% (n = 53); in those without histology, 95% (n = 22) were controlled. None of the patients developed a radiation-induced tumor. The overall morbidity rate was 7.7%. Symptomatic peritumoral imaging changes developed in 4% of the patients at a mean of 8 months.

- **Conclusion**: Stereotactic radiosurgery provided high rates of tumor control in patients with benign meningiomas and effectively minimized the incidence of radiation-induced tumors.

### Comparison of supratentorial meningioma resection outcomes by dural reconstruction technique [^116J4Eoe]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). High credibility.

Excision of intracranial meningiomas often necessitates resection or coagulation of the dura mater. The choice of dural closure technique is individualized and based on surgeon preference. This study aimed to determine outcomes following various dural closure techniques for supratentorial meningiomas.

A retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted for patients who underwent excision of supratentorial meningiomas from 2000 to 2019. Outcomes, including operative time, postoperative in-hospital complications, readmissions, causes of readmission such as surgical site infection, pseudomeningocele, the need for shunt surgery, and imaging appearance of pseudomeningocele on long-term follow-up, were compared. Both univariate and multivariable analyses were performed.

A total of 353 patients with complete clinical and operative data were included. Of these patients, 227 (64.3%) underwent nonsutured dural graft reconstruction, while 126 (35.7%) received sutured dural repair, including primary closure, artificial dura, or pericranial graft. There was significant variability among surgeons in using nonsutured dural reconstruction compared with the sutured dural repair technique (p < 0.001). Tumors with sagittal sinus involvement were more likely to undergo nonsutured closure (n = 79, 34.8%) than dural repair (n = 26, 20.6%) (p = 0.003). No other differences were observed in preoperative imaging findings or WHO grade. The frequency of surgical site infection, pseudomeningocele, the need for shunt surgery, and recurrence were similar between the two groups.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery for meningiomas [^117KEcf8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are benign tumors attached to the dura that typically have a slow growth rate. After gliomas, they are the most common primary tumor of the brain. They are ideal radiobiological targets because single-fraction radiation has a high biologically effective dose. Furthermore, a highly conformal radiation plan can provide effective treatment to the tumor while sparing the surrounding brain. Meningioma control rates range from 90 to 95%, and the risk of morbidity is low. Radiosurgery is an excellent treatment for asymptomatic, small- to moderate-sized meningiomas. It is also ideal for patients with incompletely resected meningiomas, recurrent meningiomas, and risk factors precluding conventional surgery.

### Piezosurgery - a safe technique to perform lateral suboccipital craniotomy [^1166gGUT]. Operative Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Piezosurgery (PS) is a relatively new technique based on microvibrations generated by the piezoelectric effect. It selectively cuts bone tissue while preserving the surrounding soft tissue.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the use of PS for performing lateral suboccipital craniotomy.

- **Methods**: PS was used to perform a lateral suboccipital craniotomy in 22 patients who underwent surgery for different cerebellopontine angle (CPA) pathologies in the neurosurgical department. The applicability of PS for lateral suboccipital craniotomy was evaluated with respect to safety, preciseness of bone cutting, and in particular the preservation of the adjacent dura and sigmoid and transverse sinuses.

- **Results**: Lateral suboccipital craniotomy in 22 patients who underwent surgery for different CPA pathologies (13 vestibular schwannoma, 5 petrous bone meningioma, 1 petroclival meningioma, 2 epidermoid cysts, and 1 petrous bone cholesterol granuloma) was performed with PS without any complications. A burr hole was set before piezosurgical craniotomy in 6 patients, with no prior burr hole in 16 patients. Incidental durotomy during piezosurgical craniotomy occurred in 6 patients, and small lacerations of the sigmoid sinus caused by the piezosurgical device were observed in 3 patients.

- **Conclusion**: Although PS is a safe and selective bone cutting technique that preserves the surrounding soft tissue, it can still lead to unintended dural tears during lateral suboccipital craniotomy. This must be kept in mind when using PS for craniotomies and relying on the selective bone cutting properties of PS.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^113wcgPW]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Although several cases of dAVFs have been reported secondary to craniotomy due to sinus occlusion, we did not find the torcular dAVF after craniotomy in the literature. We conducted a literature review and identified 11 cases of dAVF developing after craniotomy for meningioma resection. The mean patient age was 57 years (range 46–67) with a slight female predilection (7:4 female-to-male ratio). The median interval for development of dAVF after craniotomy was 37 months (6–90 months). There were 7 cases of developed postoperative sinus stenosis or occlusion. Ten out of 11 cases were directly related to the site of craniotomy, with only one case developing at a different site.

The TS/SS junction was the most common location for dAVFs after craniotomy, representing 9 of the 11 cases. A total of nine cases presented with non-haemorrhagic symptoms, and only one case presented with haemorrhage. The main clinical presentations included tinnitus, bruit, visual obscuration, and headache in nine cases, while two cases were asymptomatic. Six cases developed after suboccipital craniotomy. Four cases were classified as Borden II or III dAVFs, three cases as Borden I, and the rest were not mentioned in these studies.

Six dAVFs were treated with endovascular embolisation, and four of them began with TA embolisation as an initial treatment. Two dAVF cases underwent surgical resection; one case did not require any treatment due to the patient being asymptomatic. Four cases achieved good or complete resolution of the dAVFs after endovascular treatment.

### Decision-making algorithm for minimally invasive approaches to anterior skull base meningiomas [^117K9BvQ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2018). Low credibility.

Anterior skull base meningiomas are benign lesions that cause neurological symptoms through mass effect on adjacent neurovascular structures. While traditional transcranial approaches have proven effective at removing these tumors, minimally invasive approaches using an endoscope offer the possibility of reducing brain and nerve retraction, minimizing incision size, and speeding patient recovery; however, appropriate case selection and results in large series are lacking.

The authors developed an algorithm for selecting a supraorbital keyhole minicraniotomy (SKM) for olfactory groove meningiomas or an expanded endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) for tuberculum sella (TS) or planum sphenoidale (PS) meningiomas, based on the presence or absence of olfaction and the anatomical extent of the tumor. Where neither approach is appropriate, a standard transcranial approach is utilized. The authors describe rates of gross-total resection (GTR), olfactory outcomes, and visual outcomes, as well as complications, for seven subgroups of patients. Exceptions to the algorithm are also discussed.

The series consisted of 57 patients, each harboring an anterior skull base meningioma. The mean tumor volume was 14.7 ± 15.4 cm³ (range 2.2–66.1 cm³), and the mean follow-up duration was 42.2 ± 37.1 months (range 2–144 months). Among 19 patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, 10 had preserved olfaction and underwent SKM, with preservation of olfaction observed in 60%. Of nine patients who presented without olfaction, eight had cribriform plate invasion and underwent combined approaches.

### An unusual lymphoid lesion mimicking meningioma [^113rCd8c]. Brain Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old woman suffered two epileptic seizures with paresthesia on the left side of the body and dysarthria. Cranial MRI revealed a contrast medium-enhancing, en plaque tumor located post centrally over the right parietal lobe (Figure 1). Due to the radiological features of the lesion, an en plaque meningioma was suspected, and tumor resection was advised. Microsurgical resection was performed via a right-sided parietal approach. The craniotomy was customized using brain navigation. The tumor was located in the subdural space, adherent to both dura mater and arachnoid, without infiltration of the cerebral cortex. Complete tumor resection was achieved, and the dura above the tumor was resected as well. The extent of resection was graded at Simpson grade I. Postoperatively, the patient had no neurological deficits and was discharged on the seventh postoperative day. Further systemic screening ruled out malignancies and autoimmune disorders. MRI imaging performed twelve months after surgery showed a complete tumor resection with no signs of recurrence.

### Combined interhemispheric translamina terminalis and pterional approach for a dorsum sellae meningioma [^115UsMQv]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). Low credibility.

This video demonstrates a surgical technique for resecting a dorsum sellae meningioma using a combined interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach and pterional approach with clinoidectomy. The meningioma, measuring 5 cm in maximum diameter, originated from the dorsum sellae, compressed the third ventricle and midbrain, and displaced the pituitary stalk ventrally. The tumor's feeding arteries were bilateral meningohypophyseal trunks, predominantly from the right side.

The authors performed devascularization of the tumor through a right pterional approach following a frontotemporal craniotomy and proceeded with debulking via an interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach following a bifrontal craniotomy. These procedures, involving two separate craniotomies, facilitated safe and effective tumor resection.

### Neurological update: Consult the neurosurgical oracle for a standard operating procedure [^113aZXL6]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Real-life example of a consensus process regarding duraplasty during decompressive craniectomy: In the process of reaching a consensus on duraplasty techniques, neurosurgeons were surveyed extensively.

- **Survey and consensus**: A significant number of professionals contributed their expertise, highlighting varied approaches and preferred materials for duraplasty.

- **Outcome and application**: The consensus reached serves as a guideline for standard operating procedures in similar neurosurgical scenarios, thereby improving patient outcomes and ensuring consistency in surgical practices.

### From data to practice: Brain meningioma treatment in elderly patients - a survey of the Italian Society of Neurosurgery (SINch®) and systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Lbwwd]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

The management of meningiomas in elderly patients (MEP) presents a complex and evolving challenge. Available data offer conflicting information on treatment options and complications. This survey aimed to examine the approach to MEP, comparing the national profile at the time of writing in the literature. A survey addressing the treatment options and management of meningiomas in the elderly was designed on behalf of SINch® (Società Italiana di Neurochirurgia) and sent via email to all chiefs of neurosurgical departments. The survey remained open for responses from May 5, 2022, until November 21, 2022. A search of the literature published between January 2000 and March 2023, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, was included. A total of 51 neurosurgical centers participated in the survey.

- **Treatment selection**: The caseload profile of each center influences the choice of treatment (stereotactic radiosurgery versus open surgery) [p = 0.01] and the consolidated practice of discussing cases within a multidisciplinary group (p = 0.02).
- **Risk analysis**: The pooled meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly increased risk in the elderly group for permanent deficits (p < 0.00001), postoperative infections (p = 0.0004), hemorrhage (p = 0.0001), perioperative mortality (p < 0.00001), and medical complications (p < 0.00001) compared to the young population.

This study presents the initial comprehensive analysis of the existing trends in the surgical management of MEP in Italy. The significant variation in practices primarily stems from the absence of standardized guidelines. While most centers have adopted an integrated approach, there remains a need for cohesive practice standards to optimize patient outcomes.

### Endoscopic far-lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach for petroclival region meningioma: Surgical technique and clinical experience [^112LQTFq]. Operative Neurosurgery (2022). Low credibility.

The management of petroclival region meningioma remains the ultimate achievement in neurosurgery because of the formidable technical challenges involved. This study aims to describe the technique and feasibility of the purely endoscopic far-lateral supracerebellar infratentorial approach (EF-SCITA) for the treatment of petroclival region meningiomas.

The clinical data of 10 consecutive cases of petroclival region meningiomas treated with the EF-SCITA from August 2018 to August 2020 were reviewed. The clinical outcomes were analyzed. The patient was placed in the lateral position, and then, a "C" shaped incision and craniotomy with exposed sigmoid and transverse sinuses were performed. With the endoscopic holder, endoscopic procedures were performed using standard two-hand microsurgical techniques. Whether the tentorium or Meckel cave was handled depended on the tumor extension.

The mean diameter was 45 × 25 mm. Dizziness and headache were the main symptoms. All 10 patients achieved gross total or subtotal resection (Petroclival Meningioma Grade I-III) with good neurological outcomes. The EF-SCITA provides satisfactory, direct exposure to the petroclival region. Cranial nerve deficits are the main postoperative complications. Two patients had a trochlear nerve injury, three patients had transient facial paralysis, and two patients had oculomotor paralysis (one total and one incomplete), but both of them recovered during the follow-up period. One patient experienced an ipsilateral superior cerebellar artery infarction, and another patient had transient hemiparesis. The study documents these experiences and underscores the utility of EF-SCITA in treating petroclival region meningiomas.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^116B6u6J]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A woman in her mid-50s, who had undergone a subtotal resection of a peritorcular meningioma three years earlier, presented with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. A delayed diagnosis of a torcular dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) was made on MRI. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed a torcular dAVF (Borden type II).

Staged three rounds of transarterial (TA) embolization were performed using n-butyl cyanoacrylate, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer, and coils on the complex torcular dAVF, which significantly reduced the flow and corresponded with improved symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus, vision, and headache. We reviewed previously reported cases of dAVFs that developed after craniotomy for meningioma resection. Despite its rarity, a torcular dAVF can develop after craniotomy and progress from low to high grade due to its location.

Diagnosis requires a thorough understanding of subtle imaging findings, which may be present in follow-up studies obtained for tumor surveillance.

### Outcome and survival following primary and repeat surgery for World Health Organization Grade III meningiomas [^116XuwGd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Despite an increased understanding of the biology of malignant meningioma tumor progression, there is a paucity of published clinical data on factors affecting outcomes following treatment for these lesions. The authors present the largest case series at the time of writing dealing with these tumors, providing an analysis of 63 patients.

- **Methods**: The authors identified all patients undergoing resection of WHO Grade III tumors at their institution over a 16-year period. They analyzed clinical data from these patients and performed Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses to determine the impact of different clinical characteristics and treatment modalities on survival following initial and repeat surgery.

- **Results**: Sixty-three patients met inclusion criteria and were analyzed further. The median clinical follow-up time was 5 years (range 1–22 years). The 2-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates following the initial operation were 82, 61, and 40%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a marked survival benefit with repeat operation (53 vs. 25 months, p = 0.02). Interestingly, patients treated with near-total resection experienced improved overall survival compared to patients treated with gross-total resection at initial (p = 0.035) and repeat operations (p = 0.005). Twelve (19%) of 63 patients experienced significant neurological morbidity referable to the resection of their tumors.

- **Conclusions**: Surgery is an effective treatment for WHO Grade III meningiomas at presentation and recurrence; however, aggressive attempts to achieve gross-total resection may lead to increased morbidity.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^111wuvde]. Neurosurgery (2017). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerebral edema, particularly in patients with traumatic brain injury, the 2017 BTF guidelines recommend not performing bifrontal decompressive craniectomy as a means to improve outcomes in patients with severe and diffuse traumatic brain injury without mass lesions. Although this procedure is recognized as effective in reducing intracranial pressure (ICP) and may decrease ICU length of stay, it is not recommended for improving overall patient outcomes.

### Bone cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115t2KnY]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chordoma, specifically with respect to the management of skull base/clival chordoma, the NCCN 2025 guidelines recommend offering intralesional excision (maximal safe excision for maximal tumor removal when appropriate) with or without adjuvant radiation therapy in patients with resectable skull base/clival chordoma. Follow up with contrast-enhanced MRI of the primary site to assess the adequacy of excision. Consider offering adjuvant radiation therapy for positive surgical margins or for large extracompartmental tumors. Consider performing re-excision if necessary.

### Goal-directed fluid therapy and major postoperative complications in elective craniotomy. A retrospective analysis of a before-after multicentric study [^115Y6Lgk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Before the implementation of the protocol, the monitoring of cardiac output and goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) was not standardized and was performed at the attending anesthetist's discretion. GDFT was implemented for patients deemed at the highest risk of postoperative complications, specifically those with an ASA score of III or IV, a preoperative Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15, a history of brain tumor, intracranial surgery, tumor size greater than or equal to 35 mm, a mid-line shift of 3 mm or more, and/or significant hemorrhagic risk (meningioma or tumor location).

Cardiac output monitoring could be carried out using either an invasive or non-invasive device. In the three centers, the available devices included the EV1000 Edwards® with either a Flotrac® or a Clearsight®, as well as the MostCare Vygon®. Within the GDFT protocol, once the device was set, 250 mL of fluid was initially administered to define the stroke volume of reference (SV). If fluid responsiveness was not achieved, defined as a 10% increase in SV, another 250 mL of fluid was administered to establish the SV of reference. Vascular expansion (250 mL) was triggered if there was a decrease in Indexed Stroke Volume (≥ 10%) or if mean arterial pressure fell below 65 mmHg. A Stroke Volume Variation increase of 10% or more was used to assess the efficacy of vascular expansion.

Use of static parameters and heart rate for vascular expansion was left to the discretion of the attending physician. EtCO2 was not considered in our centers for performing vascular expansion. When fluid responsiveness was not observed, continuous norepinephrine was administered to ensure a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mmHg.

### Suprane [^116cTu8M]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Suprane was studied in 38 patients aged 26–76 years (median 48 years), ASA physical status II or III, who were undergoing neurosurgical procedures for intracranial lesions.

- **Induction**: Induction consisted of standard neuroanesthetic techniques including hyperventilation and thiopental.

- **Maintenance**: No change in cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) was observed in 8 patients who had intracranial tumors when the dose of Suprane was 0.5 MAC in N2O 50%. In another study of 9 patients with intracranial tumors, 0.8 MAC desflurane/air/O2 did not increase CSFP above post induction baseline values. In a different study of 10 patients receiving 1.1 MAC desflurane/air/O2, CSFP increased 7 mm Hg (range 3–13 mm Hg increase, with final values of 11–26 mm Hg) above the pre-drug values.

All volatile anesthetics may increase intracranial pressure in patients with intracranial space-occupying lesions. In such patients, Suprane should be administered at 0.8 MAC or less, in conjunction with a barbiturate induction and hyperventilation (hypocapnia) before cranial decompression. Appropriate attention must be paid to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. The use of a lower dose of Suprane and the administration of a barbiturate and mannitol would be predicted to lessen the effect of desflurane on CSFP.

Under hypocapnic conditions (PaCO2 27 mm Hg), Suprane 1 and 1.5 MAC did not increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 9 patients undergoing craniotomies. CBF reactivity to increasing PaCO2 from 27 to 35 mm Hg was also maintained at 1.25 MAC desflurane/air/O2.

### Congress of Neurological Surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update for the role of emerging therapies in the management of patients with metastatic brain tumors [^1149s4FZ]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cutaneous melanoma, more specifically with respect to management of advanced/metastatic disease, management of brain metastases, the CNS 2025 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to recommend interstitial modalities, including interstitial chemotherapy or radiation (brachytherapy, intraoperative radiotherapy), in patients with parenchymal brain metastases.

### Repeated craniotomies for intracranial tumors: Is the risk increased? Pooled analysis of two prospective, institutional registries of complications and outcomes [^111u9Y4a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

When a surgeon must decide whether to operate on a patient, they balance the potential advantages and disadvantages to estimate the risks and benefits of the operation itself. This evaluation becomes more challenging in the case of repeated surgical interventions, as these risks are less well understood.

In general surgery, there are advocates for the notion of increased risk with repeated surgeries, while others present more optimistic results. In neurosurgery, repeated procedures are most frequently performed for the recurrence of intracranial tumors, which have a high tendency for re-growth despite macroscopically complete resection and/or adjuvant treatment. For HGG, atypical meningiomas, or chordomas, for example, re-operation rates between 8–45% have been described. Thus, besides reflecting upon the oncological benefit, the surgeon must decide whether the safety of repeated procedures is assured.

- **Scarring and complications**: In theory, aspects such as scarring of critical structures or prior dural opening can increase the difficulty of microsurgical tumor dissection or complicate dural closure. Moreover, wound closure defects or delays, secondary to the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and an increased rate of postoperative infections have been associated with repeated surgery. On the other hand, a previously established surgical corridor may facilitate access to the lesion.

According to our surgical experience, repeated operations are technically more difficult. However, present data indicate that careful patient care does not necessarily translate into increased complications with repeated craniotomies.

### Concomitant embolization and microsurgical resection of a giant, hypervascular skull base meningioma: 2-dimensional operative video [^114CwUFg]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

Some skull base tumors can be extremely hypervascular, incorporating multiple vascular territories and demonstrating arteriovenous shunting. Devascularization is a critical step undertaken early in meningioma surgery, necessary before the debulking that is required in skull base tumors. While devascularization can often be achieved with appropriate approach selection, bony drilling, and microsurgical cautery, preoperative embolization of meningiomas has an invaluable role in selected cases. Embolization, however, carries added risk, magnified in large tumors by the potential infarction with subsequent edema, which can potentially lead to acute deterioration and neurosurgical emergency.

To achieve devascularization of an extremely vascular tumor, embolization and surgical resection should be performed concomitantly as one operation. Embolization might be the first stage or might be performed after the craniotomy flap is raised, if necessary. Naturally, this requires the multifaceted neurosurgical expertise of embolization and microsurgical resection, and the facility to perform such.

We present a case of a giant, hypervascular, radiation-induced, skull base meningioma with internal and external carotid artery supply in a young patient with deteriorating vision in his only eye. Selective embolization of the internal maxillary, middle meningeal, and middle cerebral artery blood supplies was performed. Microsurgical interruption of the ethmoidal artery blood supply was then performed. This hybrid approach safely and effectively devascularized the tumor.

### Effect of differences in extubation timing on postoperative pneumonia following meningioma resection: A retrospective cohort study [^112HA7xp]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients in the delayed extubation cohort were older than those in the cohort with a shorter extubation time. Our result was akin to many other findings. Most previous research has examined the potential for older age to be an independent factor for delayed extubation, which is, in turn, associated with worse outcomes. Elderly patients have increased sensitivity toward general anesthetics and a slow return of consciousness due to a progressive decline in CNS function. Moreover, craniotomy itself can lead to CNS dysfunction. However, with advancements in medical technology and increasing human life expectancy, an increasing number of meningiomas have been identified in elderly patients. Thus, anesthesiologists need to weigh the benefits of early extubation for elderly patients.

The limitation of this study is that it was a single-center, retrospective study. We collected as many sample sizes as possible, and rigorous data analysis was performed to demonstrate the relationship between airway extubation time and postoperative pneumonia (POP). Furthermore, the incidence of these complications largely depends on the treatment's difficulty. Easily accessible meningiomas differ significantly from complicated skull-base ones. The former involves more limited incisions, shorter surgery duration, and fewer blood transfusions. Post-operative intensive care for skull-base meningiomas resection may require intubation and mechanical ventilation, resulting in a significant increase in POP. For this reason, we excluded patients who entered the ICU after surgery. The highlight of our study lies…

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^113zxBc7]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

The domain-based evaluations are detailed in Table 5. None of the included studies fulfilled our criteria for high quality. Major shortcomings and potential sources for various biases included the retrospective design (all seven studies), limited reporting of intracranial meningioma (IM) characteristics (four studies), and limited outcome assessments (four studies).

- **Quality assessment of selected studies**: All studies were categorized as low quality. A "+" indicates a low risk of bias, "−" indicates a high risk of bias, and "?" represents an unknown risk of bias.

### Olfaction preservation in olfactory groove meningiomas: a systematic review [^111hVHbH]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Olfactory groove meningiomas (OGM) are skull base neoplasms that arise from the lamina cribrosa and frontoethmoidal suture. They represent between 8 and 13% of all intracranial meningiomas. Patients can present with headache, personality and cognitive changes, visual impairment, and alterations in their sense of smell. When symptomatic, management of these tumors is primarily surgical. Broadly, these tumors can be approached endonasally with an endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) or transcranially through a craniotomy. Traditionally, the selection of approach has focused on achieving surgical goals such as frontal lobe decompression, gross total resection, vision preservation, and enhanced recovery. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of articles examining olfaction and its preservation as a quality-of-life outcome measure.

The goal of this article is to systematically review the available literature examining olfaction outcomes in patients with olfactory groove meningiomas and recommend a strategy to approach these tumors.

### Surgery on giant meningiomas in very old patients entails frequent postoperative intracranial hemorrhages and atypical histopathology [^1121qmzf]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical and surgical data were extracted from the electronic patient files as described previously. In brief, we included the following information: patient characteristics, preoperative physical status (Helsinki version of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scale), surgical indication, functional performance (Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale), surgical time, length of hospital stay, discharge location, histopathological diagnosis, and surgery-associated morbidity and mortality.

We assessed pre- and postoperative independence, specifically living at home. Postoperative independence was evaluated at discharge and within 1 year after surgery. Regarding independence (the rate of very old patients living at home 1 year after surgery) and postoperative functional performance (the KPS score), we reviewed the electronic health record data for every patient. For KPS score estimation, we used only medical notes recorded during outpatient clinic visits to the Department of Neurosurgery or Neurology, as both neurological and performance statuses were well documented during these postoperative visits. If a patient had multiple visits to the outpatient clinic within the first postoperative year, we used the data from the last visit to estimate the 1-year postoperative KPS score. Because the time and frequency of postoperative visits of these very old patients varied throughout the study period, the time of the KPS score estimation also varied.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^114qjDqD]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

The results are summarized as follows. The study selection protocol is depicted in Figure 1. From a total of 1,039 articles, seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All seven studies were retrospective, conducted between 1995 and 2018. Three of the studies were performed in Italy, two in France, one in Norway, and one in the United States, which was based on a large national register.

Altogether, the studies included 308 operated intracranial meningioma (IM) patients, ranging from 11 to 93 patients per study. There was an overrepresentation of females in each study. One publication was written in French.

- **Preoperative characteristics**: All seven studies utilized the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scale to assess preoperative physical status, which varied considerably among studies. Four studies included mostly healthy patients or patients with mild comorbidities (ASA classes I–II), while in three studies, most patients had severe systemic comorbidities (ASA classes III–V).

- **Preoperative status and morbidity**: Six studies used the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) to describe IM patients' preoperative functional status. These studies showed equal representation of dependent (KPS 0–60) and independent (KPS 70–100) IM patients. Six studies reported indications for surgical resection. The most frequent symptoms leading to resection were motor deficits (27–65% in three studies), seizures (16–43% in four studies), and changed mental status (51–59% in three studies).

### Endoscope-assisted microsurgical resection of skull base meningiomas [^116pPDw6]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). Low credibility.

This study aims to determine the value of endoscope assistance in the microsurgical resection of skull base meningiomas. Forty-six patients harboring a skull base meningioma underwent an endoscope-assisted microsurgical resection. In 30 patients (65%), tumor parts that could not be visualized under the microscope were detected with the endoscope. In 26 patients (56%), these tumor remnants were removed under endoscopic view. Gross total resection was achieved in 35 patients (76%), and near-total resection in 11 (24%). There was no surgical mortality. The major complication was a new cranial nerve deficit.

The application of endoscopes was most useful in small supraorbital craniotomies to look under the ipsilateral optic nerve and internal carotid artery, as well as to visualize the diaphragm sellae and olfactory groove. In the retrosigmoid craniotomies, the endoscope was beneficial to inspect the internal auditory canal, look into Meckel's cave, or inspect areas hidden behind the jugular tubercle and tentorial edge. There was no obvious complication related to the application of the endoscope.

Endoscope assistance is particularly valuable when skull base meningiomas are to be removed via small craniotomies to inspect blind corners that cannot be visualized in a straight line with the microscope. Additionally, there is a benefit in using endoscopes with various angles of view in standard craniotomies and skull base approaches to look around bony and dural corners or to look behind neurovascular structures, which reduces the amount of skull base drilling and retraction.

### Postoperative de novo epilepsy after craniotomy: a nationwide register-based cohort study [^113pkFfZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

In this unselected, nationwide cohort study encompassing 8,948 patients, we found high cumulative risks of de novo epilepsy following craniotomy compared with the previously reported risk among the background population. The overall 1-year cumulative risk of de novo epilepsy after craniotomy was 13.9% (95% CI 13.2 to 14.6) and after 5 years was 20.4% (95% CI 19.5 to 21.3). The cumulative 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year risks for each of the neurosurgical diseases leading to craniotomy exhibited considerable variation owing to the indications for craniotomy. Notably, both short-term and long-term risks were surprisingly high for most of the indications for craniotomy.

- **Comparison with other studies**: There are few comparable studies, mainly concerning meningioma and glioblastoma. In line with our findings, a Swedish single-centre study including 113 meningioma patients reported a 2-year cumulative risk of postoperative epilepsy of 14% (95% CI not provided), whereas we found a 1-year risk of 12.1% (95% CI 10.4 to 14.0). Meningiomas are a very common type of intracranial tumour with an overall prevalence of 97.5/100,000. As the vast majority of meningiomas are benign and slow-growing tumours, most of them are treated conservatively, but this approach is highly variable and debated. The high risk of postcraniotomy epilepsy needs to be considered when balancing risks and benefits regarding surgical treatment in the individual meningioma patient, particularly if asymptomatic.

A prospective single-centre study in China reported a 1-year…

### Meningiomas [^114ae3xe]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common tumors arising from the meninges. Progressive enlargement of the tumor can lead to focal or generalized seizure disorders, or neurological deficits due to compression of adjacent neural tissue. Surgery is the primary treatment of choice. However, the use of fractionated radiotherapy or stereotactic single-dose radiosurgery is increasing for meningiomas that are incompletely excised, surgically inaccessible, or either atypical or anaplastic.

Although most meningiomas have a good long-term prognosis after treatment, there are controversies over management in some cases. This paper reviews various features of meningioma biology, diagnosis, and treatment, and provides an overview of the rationale and evidence base for the different therapeutic approaches.

### Evolution of surgical approaches in the treatment of petroclival meningiomas: A retrospective review [^111wEob6]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

We examined the surgical approaches used at a single institution to treat petroclival meningioma and evaluated changes in method utilization over time. Craniotomies performed to treat petroclival meningioma between September 1994 and July 2005 were examined retrospectively. We reviewed 46 patients (mean follow-up, 3.6 years).

- **Techniques**: Included combined petrosal or transcochlear approaches (15% of patients), retrosigmoid craniotomies with or without some degree of petrosectomy (59% of patients), orbitozygomatic craniotomies (7% of patients), and combined orbitozygomatic-retrosigmoid approaches (19% of patients). In 18 patients, the tumor extended supratentorially. Overall, the rate of gross total resection was 43%.

- **Outcomes**: Seven patients demonstrated progression over a mean of 5.9 years. No patients died. At 36 months, the progression-free survival rate for patients treated without petrosal approaches was 96%. Of 14 patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery, none developed progression.

Over the study period, a diminishing proportion of patients with petroclival meningioma were treated using petrosal approaches. Utilization of the orbitozygomatic and retrosigmoid approaches alone or in combination provided a viable alternative to petrosal approaches for the treatment of petroclival meningioma. Regardless of the approach, progression-free survival rates were excellent over the short-term follow-up period.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111ZYAyC]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery in supratentorial hemorrhage, the AHA/ASA 2022 guidelines recommend considering minimally invasive hematoma evacuation using endoscopic or stereotactic aspiration, with or without thrombolytic use, to reduce mortality in patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 5–12 and supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of more than 20–30 mL volume. However, this intervention is not recommended for improving functional outcomes. The guidelines suggest opting for minimally invasive hematoma evacuation over conventional craniotomy to improve functional outcomes in patients considered for hematoma evacuation.

### Route patterns of the collateral venous pathway in patients with tumors invading the superior sagittal sinus: An angiographic study and clinical applications [^1113Q95D]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Low credibility.

Surgical resection concurrently with preservation of venous flow or repair/reconstruction/bypass of the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) is the mainstay treatment of tumors arising in the parasagittal region with SSS invasion. In some patients, combined microsurgery and radiosurgery are required to reduce resection-related morbidities and the risk of tumor recurrence. Occasionally, staged operations aiming to develop collateral venous pathways (CVP) over time are a good alternative to prevent inadvertent venous complications.

To achieve adequate resection of parasagittal meningiomas, neurosurgeons tend to make the craniotomy size wider than the tumor margins. In studies by Sindou et al. and Ricci et al, the craniotomy to remove SSS-invading parasagittal meningiomas was usually extended to approximately 2 to 3 cm beyond the margins of the occluded SSS and midline to reduce venous manipulation during tumor removal and provide adequate exposure for sinus reconstruction. However, a larger craniotomy could interrupt the collateral diploic veins (DV) in the vicinity. If any of the functions of the DV are interrupted as the main CVP, this injury can lead to serious venous complications.

The distance of the diploic channels from the tumor attachment to the SSS is important for neurosurgeons in deciding the extent of craniotomy. In the present study, we explored the distance between the tumor and the SSS and the collateral DV. The results were intriguing because more than 60% of patients with DV as CVP demonstrated very close proximity (less than 1 cm) to a DV from tumor attachment in the SSS.

### Surgery for extra-axial tumors of the cerebral convexity and midline [^113hdJCY]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Extra-axial tumors of the cerebral convexity and midline include both convexity and parasagittal meningiomas; they are the most common tumors of the cranial vault and are the principal topic of this article. Over the past 30 years, neurosurgery has witnessed steady change in both technological capacity and in conceptualization of certain diseases. Meningiomas are good examples of this change. Although cranial base meningiomas have received the most attention in the past two decades, the management of cranial vault meningiomas has also changed significantly.

- **Issues in management**: Particular issues include decisions about when to treat, deciding between surgery and radiosurgery, increasing use of image-guided surgery, the understanding of the biology of these tumors, and changing attitudes in the management of the sagittal sinus. These issues exemplify the changing biological, conceptual, and technological concepts that characterize contemporary neurosurgery.

### Gliadel [^117UHPcX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]; intracranial hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]; impaired neurosurgical wound healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]; and meningitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In a study of newly-diagnosed high-grade glioma, the safety of Gliadel wafers was evaluated in a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 240 adult patients. These patients, who were newly diagnosed with high-grade glioma, received up to eight Gliadel wafers or a matched placebo implanted against the resection surfaces following maximal tumor resection (Study 1). The study population was 67% male and 97% White, with a median age of 53 years (range: 21–72). Notably, 87% had a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70, and 71% had a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 80%. A central pathology review determined that 78% had a histologic subtype of glioblastoma.

During the trial, 38% of patients received eight wafers, while 78% received six or more wafers. Starting three weeks after surgery, 80% of patients underwent standard limited field radiation therapy (RT) described as 55–60 Gy delivered in 28 to 30 fractions over six weeks; an additional 11% received no radiation therapy (RT).

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^116boA3u]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Tentorial middle region dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) is extremely rare to develop after craniotomy. Acquired progressive torcular dAVF (Lawton type 3) after craniotomy has not been reported in the literature. Cranial dAVFs are arteriovenous shunts between dural arteries and dural venous sinuses, dural veins, or leptomeningeal veins. In a meta-analysis of 1077 patients with cerebral dAVFs reported before 2017, torcular dAVF represents only 4.7% (51/1077) of all cerebral dAVFs. Although the majority are thought to be idiopathic, a subset has been associated with trauma, infection, venous sinus thrombosis, and previous craniotomy.

Yajima et al. have reported 25 cases of dAVFs developing after craniotomy in the literature. Here, we report the first case of an acquired progressive torcular dAVF after subtotal resection of a peritorcular meningioma as well as a review of the relevant literature.

### Microsurgical resection of skull base meningioma-expanding the operative corridor [^111HS7zb]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

A better understanding of surgical anatomy, marked improvements in illumination devices, the provision of improved hemostatic agents, and the greater availability of more precise surgical instruments and better modalities for skull base reconstruction have led to an inevitable evolution of skull base neurosurgery. For the past few decades, many skull base neurosurgeons have worked relentlessly to improve the surgical approach and trajectory for the expansion of the operative corridor. With the advent of newer techniques and their rapid adaptation, it is foundational, especially for young neurosurgeons, to understand the basics and nuances of modifications of traditional neurosurgical approaches. The goal of this topic review is to discuss the evolution of and technical nuances regarding the operative corridor expansion in the field of skull base surgery for intracranial meningioma as they pertain to achieving optimal functional outcomes.

### Acquired progressive torcular dural arteriovenous fistula after subtotal resection of peritorcular meningioma [^111bXdN7]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Reflecting on my medical journey over the past 8 years, I am struck by how much persistence was required to get answers. Initially, my symptoms were dismissed as menopause until I insisted on an MRI, which led to the discovery of a brain tumour. After my craniotomy and tumour resection, my symptoms worsened; whooshing sounds, pressure, vision issues, and severe fatigue became daily hurdles. It was my physiotherapist, whom I consulted for back pain, who urged me to see a neuro-ophthalmologist, leading to an IIH diagnosis. My neurosurgeon and neuro-ophthalmologist worked together, but despite a lumbar puncture and various medications with difficult side effects, I continued experiencing whooshing, pressure, nerve pain, and muscle spasms that made sleep and even sitting difficult.

Researching my own condition, I advocated for a stent, believing compromised blood flow caused my symptoms, though my scans did not reflect this. Eventually, I was referred to a vascular neurosurgeon and an interventional neuroradiologist, who confirmed an AV fistula that nearly took my life. This was the beginning of challenging treatments during Covid, involving multiple surgeries and extended hospital stays. Yet for the first time, I felt heard and part of the team. My fourth brain surgery appears to have cured the AV fistula, although I still have the brain tumour and face lingering effects like exhaustion, severe tinnitus, visual issues, and GI problems. Despite it all, I'm grateful to be here.

### Olfactory groove meningioma with a 10-year history of smell loss and olfactory recovery after surgery [^114zCgsP]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment**: The patient presented with generalized seizures, for which antiepileptic medication, specifically lamotrigine, was prescribed. Due to increasing headaches and substantial white matter changes observed radiologically, which suggested edema, oral steroids were administered prior to surgery.

- **Surgical treatment**: Given the primarily right-sided basofrontal location, the absence of paranasal sinus infiltration, and the patient's intact but diminished olfactory function, a right-sided pterional craniotomy was performed to preserve the olfactory apparatus. Perioperatively, the right olfactory tract was discovered to be stretched around the basolateral side of the tumor and could not be preserved. In contrast, the left olfactory tract was left intact. The tumor was completely resected, and the dural attachment was coagulated, corresponding to a Simpson grade II resection.

### Role of radiation therapy in treating intracranial meningiomas [^111DFjv3]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Surgery is the mainstay for many patients with meningiomas and remains the standard. In large single-institution series, gross-total resection has been reported to achieve 5-, 10-, and 15-year recurrence-free survival rates of approximately 90%, 80%, and 70%, respectively. There is a growing number of series of patients with prolonged follow-up, in which authors have evaluated fractionated external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) either as an adjuvant to surgery for subtotally resected, recurrent, or higher-grade meningiomas or as an alternative to surgery.

The primary focus of this review is EBRT. To lend perspective, a comparative analysis of surgery and radiosurgery is also provided.

### Surgery on giant meningiomas in very old patients entails frequent postoperative intracranial hemorrhages and atypical histopathology [^113swDx6]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumors, and the incidence rate of meningiomas increases strongly with age. Up to 80–90% of intracranial meningiomas are classified as World Health Organization (WHO) type I, representing a benign tumor entity with a favorable prognosis. Due to the population's increasing life expectancy, the finding of intracranial meningiomas in very old patients, i.e. patients that are 80 years old and older, is becoming more frequent. Nowadays, these very old patients with meningiomas often have a good functional status and still live independently at home, despite known increased frailty. Consequently, neurosurgeons are increasingly confronted with the question of whether a major surgery (i.e. intracranial tumor surgery) is justified and beneficial for these frail and very old patients.

Giant meningiomas, i.e. meningiomas with a largest diameter of at least 5 cm, form a distinct entity. Related to their size, giant meningiomas are located more frequently in eloquent areas and have a more intricate and complex relation with neurovascular structures. Moreover, surgery of giant meningiomas is additionally challenging due to limited intraoperative visualization, edema, prominent vascularization, and larger-sized craniotomies.

Since giant meningiomas are reported to occur more frequently with aging, and since the number of very old patients is increasing, we studied the surgical outcome of very old patients with giant meningiomas. We hypothesized that surgery of giant meningiomas increases the risk of postoperative morbidity.

### Contemporary surgical outcome for skull base meningiomas [^115cvv3H]. Neurosurgical Review (2011). Low credibility.

Although surgical excision of meningioma and its dural base is the most common primary management, skull base meningiomas are quite different. Contemporary management usually consists of multimodal treatment with the aim of achieving the best possible functional outcome and quality of life (QOL) for these patients. As surgery plays an important role in the treatment of skull base meningiomas, it is crucial for neurosurgeons to appreciate the surgical outcome and QOL after meningioma surgery. Outcome is usually measured in terms of morbidity, mortality, time to recurrence, and QOL. The extent of resection, tumor grade, proliferative markers, and tumor location are significant factors in predicting the surgical outcome. Therefore, we address each of these factors in detail in this review.

Advances in recent decades in microsurgical techniques, neuroimaging modalities, neuroanesthesia, and perioperative intensive care have substantially improved the surgical outcome. Most surgical outcomes discussed in this review are cited from contemporary literature (2000 to the present) in order to depict the surgical outcome of contemporary microsurgery.

### Delayed dural arteriovenous fistula at the transverse-sigmoid sinus secondary to petroclival meningioma surgery via far lateral approach [^115Jjivb]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are characterized by pathological anastomoses between meningeal arteries and dural venous sinuses or cortical veins. Various causes contribute to the etiology of DAVFs. Among these, acquired DAVFs secondary to craniotomy have rarely been reported, particularly delayed DAVFs at the transverse-sigmoid sinus. To date, there are only 12 published cases of delayed DAVFs at the transverse-sigmoid sinus secondary to craniotomy.

The authors describe an extraordinarily rare case secondary to petroclival meningioma resection via a far lateral approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first well-documented case of a delayed DAVF at the transverse-sigmoid sinus following far lateral craniotomy. Furthermore, cases of delayed DAVFs at the transverse-sigmoid sinus secondary to craniotomy were reviewed and investigated, and the clinical characteristics and treatment were also broadly discussed.

### Is surgery justified for 80-year-old or older intracranial meningioma patients? A systematic review [^111Q96qd]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

After a careful patient selection process, surgical removal of intracranial meningioma (IM) appears to be a relatively safe procedure, even in 80-year-old and older meningioma patients. However, prospective studies should confirm these findings by comparing postoperative outcomes, ideally to a matched IM patient group that undergoes conservative treatment.

### Gliadel [^112U3mrg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dose**: The recommended dose of Gliadel Wafer is eight 7.7 mg wafers for a total of 61.6 mg implanted intracranially. The safety and effectiveness of repeat administration have not been studied.

- **Insertion instructions**: Following maximal tumor resection, confirmation of tumor pathology, and establishment of hemostasis, place up to a maximum of eight Gliadel Wafers to cover as much of the resection cavity as possible. If the size and shape of the resected cavity do not accommodate eight wafers, place the maximum number of wafers feasible within the cavity. Slight overlapping of the wafers is acceptable. Wafers broken in half may be used, but wafers broken into more than two pieces should be discarded. Oxidized regenerated cellulose (Surgicel®) may be placed over the wafers to secure them against the cavity surface. After placement of the wafers, irrigate the resection cavity and close the dura in a water-tight fashion.

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically concerning the indications for surgery in cases of supratentorial hemorrhage, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering early surgical hematoma removal via open craniotomy and standard surgical evacuation in non-comatose adult patients with acute spontaneous supratentorial lobar ICH, particularly where minimally invasive approaches are not available.

### Repeated craniotomies for intracranial tumors: is the risk increased? Pooled analysis of two prospective, institutional registries of complications and outcomes [^113JnPoF]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Repeated surgical procedures for intracranial tumors, in general, do not increase the risk of morbidity in carefully selected candidates, compared to primary surgeries. The rate and severity of complications are comparable, and mortality is equally low. These findings, made in a large, heterogeneous cohort, could be reproduced in disease-specific subgroup analyses of patients with intracranial meningiomas, gliomas, and cerebral metastases. When considering repeated surgery, this information will be of value for patient counseling and the informed consent process.

### Myocardial infarction after craniotomy for asymptomatic meningioma [^114ewrnb]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his 40s with a history of coronary artery disease, previously treated with a drug-eluting stent, presented for elective craniotomy and resection of an asymptomatic but enlarging meningioma. During his craniotomy, he received desmopressin and tranexamic acid for surgical bleeding. Postoperatively, the patient developed chest pain and was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Because of the patient's recent neurosurgery, standard post-MI care was contraindicated, and he was instead managed symptomatically in the intensive care unit.

An echocardiogram on postoperative day 1 demonstrated no regional wall motion abnormalities and an ejection fraction of 60%. His presentation was consistent with thrombosis of his diagonal stent. He was transferred out of the intensive care unit on postoperative day 1 and discharged home on postoperative day 3.

### Role of risk factors, scoring systems, and prognostic models in predicting the functional outcome in meningioma surgery: Multicentric study of 552 skull base meningiomas [^111fgSfC]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Low credibility.

Predictive factors associated with a new neurologic deficit, whether temporary or permanent, were evaluated at one year post-surgical resection. Additionally, a decrease in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) at patient discharge was identified in the univariate analysis presented.

- **Univariate analysis**: The predictive factors of a new neurologic deficit and a postoperative decrease in KPS were analyzed using statistical tests such as the chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Wilcoxon test.

Predictive factors selected by the multivariate stepwise selection model for a new neurologic deficit and a postoperative decrease in KPS are identified.

- **Multivariate stepwise selection analysis**: Factors considered for predicting new neurologic deficits and changes in KPS involved degrees of freedom in statistical evaluation.

### Surgical results of 158 petroclival meningiomas with special focus on standard craniotomies [^116p5cpn]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Petroclival meningiomas (PCMs) account for 2% of all meningiomas. These tumors are located ventrally to the trigeminal nerve, originate on the dura mater of the petrous bone, and extend to the clivus, the petrosphenoidal ligament, the tentorium, or the sphenoid wing. Due to the surrounding cranial nerves (CN) and the compression and adherence to the brain stem, resection of these tumors is challenging and accompanied by a high risk of neurological deficits. Intensive discussions have centered on appropriate skull base approaches to expose the tumor and surrounding CNs as safely as possible, thereby avoiding complications. In consideration of the origin and extension of the tumors, various tailored approaches have been favored. However, complex skull base approaches are time-consuming during both the opening and closing phases. Therefore, standard approaches, as well as their staged use, have been advocated.

The main technique for tumors of the cerebello-pontine angle is the suboccipital retrosigmoid approach (RSA). This approach is straightforward, routinely performed, and not time-consuming. If the PCM is located purely infratentorially, the RSA may be sufficient for tumor removal. However, in cases where the tumor extends supratentorially, a two-stage procedure combining the suboccipital approach with a fronto-temporal craniotomy will be necessary. Notably, in PCMs without significant lateral extension, some neurosurgeons consider an endoscopic endonasal approach to achieve effective brainstem decompression.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^114R46r2]. Neurosurgery (2017). High credibility.

For specific circumstances concerning cerebral edema, especially in patients with traumatic brain injury, the BTF 2017 guidelines recommend performing a large frontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy (no less than 12×15 cm or 15 cm in diameter) over a small frontotemporoparietal decompressive craniectomy. This approach is associated with reduced mortality and improved neurologic outcomes in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

### Intraorbital meningioma: Resection through modified orbitozygomatic craniotomy [^111E8tJJ]. Neurosurgical Focus (2012). Low credibility.

Intraorbital meningiomas are challenging lesions to excise because of their location and the restricted surgical corridor available due to the presence of important neighboring structures. Lesions located in the posterior one-third of the orbit require skull base approaches for their exposure and safe resection. Frontoorbital and modified orbitozygomatic (OZ) craniotomies may facilitate the exposure and resection of masses in the posterior intraorbital space. Specifically, the one-piece modified OZ craniotomy provides many advantages of the "full" OZ craniotomy, which includes a more extensive zygomatic osteotomy.

The modified OZ approach minimizes the extent of frontal lobe retraction and provides ample space for the surgeon to exploit all the working angles to resect the tumor. The following video presentation discusses the nuances of technique for the resection of an intraorbital meningioma through the modified OZ approach and optic nerve decompression.

### Interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy for radiorecurrent atypical meningioma: A brief report [^115eni8y]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

The patient initially underwent a left frontal craniotomy for gross total resection (GTR) of a left frontal atypical meningioma in September 2012. However, she declined adjuvant radiation therapy. Postoperative imaging indicated no convincing residual foci of enhancement within the resection cavity.

In January 2013, she required another craniotomy for the evacuation of fluid, titanium mesh cranioplasty, and debridement due to a Staphylococcus aureus infection. Pathology revealed a benign bone flap with focal necrosis and mitotic figures in multiple foci (2–4 per 10 high-power fields). Cautery artifact impeded the evaluation of any tumor presence.

### Orbitozygomatic craniotomy and trans-sylvian approach for resection of a tuberculum sella meningioma with extension to the posterior fossa [^113uDF28]. Neurosurgical Focus (2017). High credibility.

Tuberculum sella meningiomas can be addressed through lateral approaches, including pterional/orbitozygomatic craniotomies, frontobasal craniotomy, or expanded endoscopic transsphenoidal approaches. The authors present the case of a 60-year-old male who experienced bitemporal hemianopia and significant right-side visual acuity compromise due to a large tuberculum sella meningioma. The tumor extended significantly to the posterior fossa. A right orbitozygomatic trans-sylvian approach was considered most suitable to manage the posterior extension of the tumor. Some operative nuances are detailed in the video, including dissection of the tumor off the carotid artery, basilar bifurcation, and small thalamoperforators attached to the tumor. Postoperatively, the patient's bilateral hemianopia improved significantly, though his right visual acuity remained unchanged. The residual tumor in the sella and midclivus was addressed with a second-stage expanded endoscopic transclival approach. The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/KbewhlT2FWs.

### Risk of early failure of VP shunts implanted for hydrocephalus after craniotomies for brain tumors in adults [^114TyEbU]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Low credibility.

- **Primary/secondary surgery for brain tumor**: Primary craniotomies were performed in 64 patients (75.3%) and secondary in 21 patients (24.7%). Primary or secondary craniotomy for brain tumors was not significantly associated with shunt longevity in either univariate or multivariate proportional hazards analyses.

- **Pre-craniotomy and post-craniotomy treatment for hydrocephalus**: Out of the 373 patients with pre-craniotomy hydrocephalus, 23 underwent EVD insertion, 19 had ETV, while 41 had EVD and craniotomy concomitantly. From these, 334 patients (89.5%) did not require further treatment for hydrocephalus. Of the remaining 39 patients with persisting post-craniotomy hydrocephalus, 11 had EVD insertion and one underwent ETV in an attempt to avoid shunting. Ultimately, all 39 patients with persisting post-craniotomy hydrocephalus required VP shunt insertion. From the 39 patients with VP shunt dependency, two had pre-craniotomy EVD and two had ETV, while seven patients had EVD and tumor resection simultaneously. Except for one patient, there was no overlap of treatment modalities for hydrocephalus in the pre-craniotomy and post-craniotomy stages before VP shunt implantation.

From those without pre-craniotomy hydrocephalus, 3 out of 46 patients had EVD insertion after tumor surgery due to de novo hydrocephalus, but all 46 patients required VP shunt insertion eventually. Of the total of 85 patients with shunt dependency, none had craniotomies between initial shunt placement and first shunt failure.

### The relation between surgical cleavage and preoperative neuroradiological findings in intracranial meningiomas [^114WN1RF]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are generally benign masses and, in many cases, they do not invade the brain, which increases their potential to provide cures. The most significant cause of recurrence in the postoperative period is subtotal resection. Thus, any information assisting in total mass resection would be beneficial for long-term positive clinical outcomes. The aim of this study is to obtain radiological data to determine the surgical cleavage between the tumor and parenchyma during the surgical planning of meningiomas.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 85 cases of intracranial meningiomas treated using the same microsurgical technique. All posterior fossa and skull base meningiomas were excluded from the study.

- **Results**: Tumor size was classified as smaller than 3 cm in 19 cases, between 3 and 6 cm in 46 cases, and larger than 6 cm in 20 cases. The cleavage line between the tumor capsule and the underlying cortex was extrapial in 32 cases, subpial in 29 cases, and mixed in 24 cases. The dominant arterial supply was dural in 46 cases, predominantly mixed in 33 cases, and corticopial in 6 cases. On magnetic resonance images, 16 of 28 cases exhibiting a clear tumor-cortex interface had an extrapial cleavage line.

- **Conclusions**: When considering the surgical treatment of intracranial meningiomas, it is essential to determine if a surgically safe border exists between the cortex and the tumor in preoperative images. It can be concluded that it is appropriate to operate on small meningiomas.

### Obesity and meningioma: A US population-based study paired with analysis of a multi-institutional cohort [^113puB2Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). High credibility.

The study examines whether obesity is associated with meningioma and its impact by gender. The primary objective was to investigate differences in BMI between male and female patients undergoing craniotomy for meningioma, comparing these with patients undergoing craniotomy for other intracranial tumors. The secondary objective was to compare meningioma location and progression-free survival (PFS) between obese and non-obese patients in a multi-institutional cohort.

National data were obtained from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, analyzing male and female patients separately. Patients undergoing craniotomies for meningioma were compared with patients of the same sex undergoing craniotomies for other intracranial tumors. Institutional data from two academic centers were collected for all male and an equivalent number of female meningioma patients undergoing meningioma resection. Multivariate regression controlling for age was used to determine differences in meningioma location. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were computed to investigate differences in PFS.

From the NSQIP dataset, 4,163 male meningioma patients were compared with 24,266 controls, and 9,372 female meningioma patients were compared with 21,538 controls. Male and female patients undergoing meningioma resection were more likely to be overweight or obese compared with patients undergoing craniotomy for other tumors, with the odds ratio increasing with weight class (all p < 0.0001).

### Exploring optimal microscopic keyhole access to the skull base: An anatomical evaluation of transciliary supraorbital and transpalpebral orbitofrontal craniotomy approaches [^1129saDi]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). High credibility.

During cadaveric dissections, the TPA was performed via a standard orbital-frontal craniotomy, encompassing the orbital rim and the lateral aspect of the orbital wall, extending inferiorly to the zygomatic frontal suture. These aspects were deemed crucial for a larger craniotomy compared to a TCA. While it is feasible to execute a small craniotomy confined to the orbital rim without engaging the lateral portion of the orbital bone, this approach may result in a narrow surgical corridor, thereby restricting access to the middle fossa.

The TPA creates a tangential view of the anterior skull base. A smaller angle of attack offered by the TPA may be a drawback when we consider surgeries involving the anterior skull base. On the other hand, a greater angle of attack, as the TCA provides, allows for a more perpendicular view of the anterior skull base. This leads to better control of the lesion and identification of important neuroanatomic landmarks. Although we have not coupled with an orbital osteotomy during dissections, this maneuver in the TCA provides an even better CC angle of attack for the management of lesions located around the third ventricle, such as retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas or bulky tuberculum sellae meningiomas.

### Risk factors for the development of serious medical complications after resection of meningiomas. Clinical article [^113VVdf5]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

While the surgical and neurological risks of meningioma surgery have been reported, much less effort has been devoted to studying the rates of serious medical complications following such a procedure. The authors performed a review of 834 patients who underwent craniotomy for meningioma at their institution and analyzed the rate of major cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic complications.

- **Methods**: The authors identified all patients between 1993 and 2007 who underwent craniotomy for meningioma. Clinical information was reconstructed using patient medical records, medication records, radiological data, and pathological specimens from both the author institution and outside medical facilities. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association between the dependent variable (rate of medical complications) and all covariates.

On univariate analysis, age greater than 65 years (p < 0.05) and undergoing more than two cardiac medications prior to surgery (p < 0.004) all demonstrated significantly increased rates of medical complications. On multivariate analysis, only a new or worsened neurological deficit remained a significant factor.

### Intraventricular meningiomas: A report of 25 cases [^1176bg59]. Neurosurgical Review (2006). Low credibility.

In order to study the clinical characteristics of intraventricular meningiomas, we retrospectively analyzed 25 patients and reviewed the literature concerning incidence, clinical manifestation, imaging features, preoperative diagnosis, surgical findings, and histopathological results. Intraventricular meningiomas are quite rare, yet they represent an important differential diagnosis of intraventricular neoplasms. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging enable a correct diagnosis of intraventricular meningiomas in most cases. These tumors often grow slowly to a substantial size before becoming symptomatic; thus, the operative route should be selected according to the tumor's location.

Out of the 24 lateral ventricular meningiomas in our series, 20 were resected via a posterior parieto-occipital transcortical approach, two were resected via a transcallosal approach, and another two tumors, located in the frontal horn and body of the lateral ventricle, were resected via a frontal approach. A median suboccipital craniotomy was performed for the fourth ventricular meningioma. The parieto-occipital route for lateral ventricular meningiomas is a safe surgical approach, which is not necessarily associated with postoperative visual deficits. Piecemeal removal of the tumor can be safely and easily performed, with special attention paid to the choroidal vessels intraoperatively.
