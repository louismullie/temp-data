## Question

Some patients claim that use of electronic cigarettes has contributed to cessation from smoking tobacco products, and subsequently cessation of electronic cigarette use. Is there any evidence that supports this method of total nicotine cessation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is evidence that using e-cigarettes to quit smoking can result in complete nicotine abstinence, meaning stopping both combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and how strong that evidence is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between smoking cessation and total nicotine cessation. Then, I should verify what randomized trials and meta-analyses actually measured and whether they tracked e-cigarette discontinuation. Next, I will examine data on continued vaping after smoking cessation. After that, I should review any direct evidence on interventions to stop vaping. Finally, I will synthesize the certainty of evidence and translate this into practical clinical guidance, including what to tell patients and what to recommend if the goal is total nicotine abstinence.

> Let me first confirm the key distinction so I don't conflate outcomes. Smoking cessation in these studies is typically defined as biochemically validated abstinence from combustible cigarettes at six months or longer, whereas total nicotine cessation would require abstinence from both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Most trials did not prespecify or report total nicotine abstinence as an outcome, which is crucial for answering the user's question accurately [^113P3Q7K] [^111aEmQ6].

> Next, I should review what the highest-quality evidence shows for smoking cessation. The 2025 Cochrane living review of 104 studies, including 61 randomized controlled trials with 30,366 participants, provides high-certainty evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes increase quit rates versus nicotine replacement therapy, with a risk ratio around 1.55 and an absolute benefit of about three additional quitters per 100, and moderate-certainty evidence of benefit versus non-nicotine e-cigarettes and versus behavioural support or no support, which confirms efficacy for smoking cessation but does not address e-cigarette discontinuation [^113P3Q7K] [^111aEmQ6] [^113GVNyU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about total nicotine cessation just because smoking quit rates improve. I need to check whether people actually stop vaping after quitting smoking. A dedicated meta-analysis of longer-term product use found that among those assigned to e-cigarettes, about 54% were still vaping at six months or more, and critically, among participants who had successfully quit smoking, approximately 70% remained e-cigarette users at six months or longer, indicating high rates of continued nicotine exposure after smoking abstinence [^113JgL7p].

> Wait, let me verify whether any trials directly tested strategies to stop vaping after smoking cessation. The Cochrane review of interventions for quitting vaping identified only nine small randomized trials and concluded that evidence is limited: text messaging may help some youth and young adults stop vaping, and varenicline shows a signal for increased vaping cessation at six months, but overall certainty is low to very low and no studies measured relapse to combustible tobacco at six months, underscoring a major evidence gap for total nicotine cessation pathways [^115TvK8i] [^114uxnxd].

> I should double-check whether any authoritative guidelines endorse e-cigarettes as a route to total nicotine abstinence. The ACC expert consensus advises clinicians to prioritize FDA-approved cessation pharmacotherapies and, if patients use e-cigarettes, to support complete switching away from cigarettes with a plan to taper and discontinue e-cigarettes thereafter, reflecting a harm-reduction-to-abstinence approach rather than evidence of a validated e-cigarette discontinuation strategy [^113wmTBg] [^1111VBen].

> Let me synthesize the certainty of evidence. There is high-certainty evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes improve smoking cessation compared with NRT, but there is very low-certainty evidence about how to stop vaping after smoking cessation and sparse data on rates of total nicotine abstinence at six months or longer, so the claim that e-cigarettes lead to total nicotine cessation remains unsupported by robust, direct evidence at this time [^113P3Q7K] [^115TvK8i].

> But wait, what if dual use undermines cessation trajectories and complicates total nicotine cessation? Observational syntheses suggest that e-cigarette use in real-world settings is associated with lower odds of quitting cigarettes, likely reflecting confounding and product-use patterns, and expert reviews highlight that many who switch continue long-term vaping, reinforcing the need for explicit, evidence-based tapering plans if total nicotine abstinence is the goal [^111Zgquq] [^114VwdJb].

> I will now translate this into clinical guidance. For patients whose immediate priority is stopping combustible cigarettes, nicotine e-cigarettes are a reasonable, evidence-supported option with higher quit rates than NRT in trials, but clinicians should set expectations that most successful switchers continue vaping at six months and that long-term e-cigarette safety remains uncertain, so the plan should include a structured taper off e-cigarettes after smoking abstinence is stable, with close follow-up to prevent relapse and monitor harms [^113P3Q7K] [^113wmTBg] [^113JgL7p].

> Hold on, I should verify what to recommend when the patient's explicit goal is total nicotine cessation. Given the lack of direct evidence for e-cigarette discontinuation strategies, first-line approaches should still be FDA-approved medications such as varenicline, combination NRT, or bupropion with behavioural support, and if e-cigarettes are used as a bridge, pair them with a predetermined taper schedule and consider emerging but low-certainty options like varenicline or text-message support for vaping cessation once smoking is stopped, while monitoring for relapse to cigarettes [^115TvK8i] [^113wmTBg] [^113HAYvA].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. There is strong evidence that e-cigarettes help adults quit smoking, but there is minimal high-quality evidence that they lead to total nicotine cessation, and high rates of continued vaping after smoking abstinence indicate that, without a deliberate discontinuation plan, many users remain nicotine-dependent. Therefore, clinicians should treat e-cigarettes as a potential smoking-cessation aid with a built-in exit strategy toward complete nicotine abstinence rather than assume spontaneous discontinuation will occur [^113P3Q7K] [^113JgL7p] [^115TvK8i].

---

There is **limited evidence** that e-cigarettes can lead to complete nicotine cessation after smoking cessation, with most users continuing to vape long-term [^113JgL7p] [^114VwdJb]. Only about **30% of former smokers who quit using e-cigarettes** stop vaping within a year, and many remain dependent on nicotine [^113JgL7p] [^115RgTHv]. While e-cigarettes are effective for smoking cessation, they are not designed for nicotine cessation, and there is no robust evidence that they reliably lead to total nicotine abstinence [^113P3Q7K] [^115RgTHv]. Clinicians should use evidence-based cessation aids and plan for e-cigarette tapering to support complete nicotine cessation [^1111VBen].

## Evidence on e-cigarettes for smoking cessation

E-cigarettes are effective for smoking cessation, with **higher quit rates than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), non-nicotine e-cigarettes, and behavioral support alone** [^113P3Q7K] [^112fbzDn]. The Cochrane review reports a **risk ratio (RR) of 1.55** versus NRT, translating to about three additional quitters per 100 [^113P3Q7K]. However, these trials focus on smoking abstinence, not total nicotine cessation [^113P3Q7K].

---

## Evidence on complete nicotine cessation after smoking cessation

Evidence that e-cigarettes lead to complete nicotine cessation is **limited and inconclusive**:

- **Continued vaping**: Most smokers who quit with e-cigarettes continue vaping long-term, with 54% still using e-cigarettes at ≥ 6 months and 70% of successful quitters still vaping at ≥ 6 months [^113JgL7p].

- **Low cessation of vaping**: Only ~30% of former smokers who quit with e-cigarettes stop vaping within a year, and many remain nicotine-dependent [^113JgL7p] [^114VwdJb].

- **Lack of evidence**: There is no robust evidence that e-cigarettes reliably lead to total nicotine abstinence [^114VwdJb].

---

## Factors influencing complete nicotine cessation

Several factors influence whether e-cigarette users achieve complete nicotine cessation:

- **Nicotine dependence**: Higher dependence predicts continued vaping and lower likelihood of total nicotine cessation [^notfound].

- **Device and liquid characteristics**: Higher nicotine delivery and certain flavors may sustain dependence and delay cessation [^111Je9XK].

- **Behavioral support**: Structured tapering and behavioral support improve chances of stopping e-cigarettes [^115TvK8i].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize evidence-based cessation aids and caution against prolonged e-cigarette use. The ACC recommends FDA-approved therapies as first-line and advises that if e-cigarettes are used, clinicians should **plan for tapering and complete cessation of all nicotine products** [^113wmTBg]. The ACPM notes that while e-cigarettes may help some smokers, there is insufficient evidence on long-term harms and cessation efficacy, and they should be reserved for those who have failed or refuse approved therapies [^116ofSnz].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of prolonged e-cigarette use

Prolonged e-cigarette use after smoking cessation has both potential benefits and risks:

| **Potential benefits** | **Potential risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced exposure to combustible tobacco toxins | Continued nicotine dependence [^114VwdJb] |
| Lower risk of relapse to smoking | Potential long-term health risks (unknown) [^112TA8um] |
| Harm reduction compared to smoking | Dual use and increased adverse health effects [^114VwdJb] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

There is **limited evidence** that e-cigarettes lead to complete nicotine cessation after smoking cessation, with most users continuing to vape long-term [^113JgL7p]. Clinicians should:

- **Use evidence-based cessation aids**: Prioritize FDA-approved pharmacotherapies and behavioral support [^113wmTBg].

- **Plan for e-cigarette tapering**: If e-cigarettes are used, set a clear plan to taper and stop all nicotine products [^1111VBen].

- **Monitor for continued use**: Regularly assess vaping and provide support to stop e-cigarettes [^115qVXdU].

In sum, e-cigarettes are effective for smoking cessation, but **evidence is lacking** that they reliably lead to complete nicotine cessation; clinicians should guide patients toward total nicotine abstinence using structured plans and evidence-based treatments [^113P3Q7K] [^113JgL7p].

### Electronic cigarettes as a smoking-cessation: tool results from an online survey [^111CeLF3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are battery-powered devices that deliver nicotine without any combustion or smoke. These devices have generated much publicity among the smoking-cessation community and support from dedicated users; however, little is known about the efficacy of the device as a smoking-cessation tool.

Purpose

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation using a survey of smokers who had tried e-cigarettes.

Methods

Using as a sampling frame a cohort of all first-time purchasers of a particular brand of e-cigarettes during a 2-week period, a cross-sectional, online survey was conducted in 2010 to describe e-cigarette use patterns and their effectiveness as a smoking-cessation tool. There were 222 respondents, with a survey response rate of 4.5%. The primary outcome variable was the point prevalence of smoking abstinence at 6 months after initial e-cigarette purchase.

Results

The primary finding was that the 6-month point prevalence of smoking abstinence among the e-cigarette users in the sample was 31.0% (95% CI = 24.8%, 37.2%). A large percentage of respondents reported a reduction in the number of cigarettes they smoked (66.8%) and almost half reported abstinence from smoking for a period of time (48.8%). Those respondents using e-cigarettes more than 20 times per day had a quit rate of 70.0%. Of respondents who were not smoking at 6 months, 34.3% were not using e-cigarettes or any nicotine-containing products at the time.

Conclusions

Findings suggest that e-cigarettes may hold promise as a smoking-cessation method and that they are worthy of further study using more-rigorous research designs.

Potential for reduced harm or cigarette smoking cessation

Twelve studies and surveys evaluated the patterns of e-cigarette use including the reasons for initiating or continuing use and the potential for e-cigarettes to facilitate smoking cessation.

Marketing information frequently includes a stated or implied claim that using e-cigarettes will help smokers quit or reduce cigarette use. Supporting data, however, are quite limited. Several small studies have demonstrated short-term reduction in cigarette smoking while using e-cigarettes. Smokers also report fewer withdrawal symptoms when using e-cigarettes while quitting. Many cigarette smokers also report attraction to e-cigarettes due to reduced cost, perceived reduced toxicity, and more freedom of use. Users acknowledge that e-cigarettes may 'not be completely safe' and are 'addictive' but believe they are safer and less addictive than cigarettes. Studies attempting to show efficacy of e-cigarettes as a cessation therapy have had mixed results, with generally low sustained cessation rates (self-reported or verified). Adverse events, when reported, were not serious.

A summary of the reviewed surveys and studies is presented in table 2.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross‐over trials in which people who smoke are randomized to ECs or to a control condition. RCTs are the best available primary evidence; we also include uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants are given an EC intervention. These studies have the potential to provide information on harms and longer‐term use.

We include studies regardless of their publication status or language of publication.

Types of participants

Participants are people defined as currently smoking cigarettes at enrolment into the studies. Participants could be motivated or unmotivated to quit. We include studies that recruited pregnant people and include their data in our pairwise meta‐analyses and narrative syntheses; however, we will not include their data in our network meta‐analyses (NMA) (described in our Data synthesis section) as some of the comparisons eligible for inclusion are unlikely to be offered to this population (e.g. varenicline).

Should a study meet all other criteria but include only a subset of eligible participants (e.g. a study on people who currently smoke and people who formerly smoked), we would only include data on the subgroup of participants who met our inclusion criteria. If these data were not available, we would include the study if at least 80% of participants met our inclusion criteria and would test the exclusion of the study in a sensitivity analysis.

We include participants regardless of age.

Types of interventions

Any type of EC or intervention intended to promote EC use for smoking cessation, including studies that did not measure smoking cessation but provided ECs with the instruction that they be used as a complete substitute for cigarette use. ECs may or may not contain nicotine. For the purpose of the NMA, we assume that the interventions were jointly randomizable for all participants except those who were pregnant.

Types of comparators

We compare nicotine ECs with alternative smoking cessation aids, including NRT or no intervention, with ECs without nicotine, and ECs added to standard smoking cessation treatment (behavioural or pharmacological or both) with standard treatment alone. We compare different types of EC (refillable, cartridge, nicotine salt, free‐base), different nicotine doses, and different flavours.

What others are saying

To our knowledge, no other clinical practice guideline has compared varenicline with electronic cigarettes. The American College of Cardiology recently produced a tobacco-cessation clinical pathway, recommending pharmacotherapy and advocating discussion with patients who choose to use electronic cigarettes. Several professional societies have developed warnings or adopted policy positions regarding the electronic cigarette's role in tobacco-dependence treatment, including the U.S. CDC, the European Respiratory Society, the Federation of International Respiratory Societies, the Ibero-Latino-American Respiratory Scientific Societies, the American Association for Cancer Research, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, each recommending that clinicians rely on medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agencies instead of relying on alternative modalities that lack an established evidentiary base. A 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine evidence review of the public health impact of electronic cigarettes made specific comment on the quality of the evidence comparing electronic cigarettes with pharmacotherapy, noting insufficient evidence warranting electronic cigarettes as cessation pharmacotherapy. A widely cited policy statement produced by the Royal College of Physicians in 2016 did promote the widespread availability of electronic cigarettes in the United Kingdom as a public health substitute for smoking, but avoided positioning electronic cigarettes as a means of treating tobacco dependence.

Research needs

The primary impediment to confidently answering the question is the lack of randomized trials directly comparing varenicline with electronic cigarettes. Assuming a specific antecedent exposure causing electronic cigarette– or vaping-associated lung injury can be identified, it may become ethically feasible to conduct trials blinding participants to both the intervention and the comparator. In all cases of clinical trials involving electronic cigarettes, we recommend using objective measures of compensatory behaviors and long-term control over dependence, not simply counts of cigarettes consumed. Observational studies that account for the known variability in real-world use patterns when describing the long-term safety outcomes of electronic cigarette use are also needed.

### E-cigarette support for smoking cessation: identifying the effectiveness of intervention components in an on-line randomized optimization experiment [^114Du5nT]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The annual global burden of tobacco smoking includes more than 6 million deaths. Even with the most effective treatments (combined pharmacotherapy + behavioural support), quit rates remain modest. In England, e‐cigarettes (EC) have become the most popular methods of quitting over the last 10 years, supporting approximately 35% of all attempts. There is increasing evidence for their efficacy in promoting quitting over more conventional cessation aids; between 8 to 12% of those making a quit attempt using a nicotine EC typically achieve abstinence at 6 months, compared with 6% of those using nicotine‐replacement therapy (NRT), or 4% of those using behavioural support only or no support. In stop smoking services between 2020 and 2021, approximately 65% of quit attempts involving EC (alone or combined with medication), were successful at 4‐week follow‐up compared with 59% of attempts not involving EC. However, while data from throughout Great Britain shows that, at a population level, approximately three in five smokers report having tried an EC, approximately 65% discontinue use and continue smoking. A recent Cochrane Review pooling randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and uncontrolled observation studies show higher quit rates among those allocated to a nicotine EC condition compared to non‐nicotine EC [relative risk (RR) = 1.94], NRT (RR = 1.53) or behavioural support (RR = 2.61) at 6 months. This would translate to an additional three to six quitters per 100. Given their potential effectiveness and the harm reduction benefits if people fully switch, a clearer understanding of what types of support can help more smokers to fully transition to e‐cigarettes is warranted.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) evidence review limitations include that a rapid review methodology was employed rather than a systematic review, which allows for a more rapid process but is a less rigorous methodology. Risk of bias was assessed for systematic reviews but was not for individual clinical and observational studies, strength of evidence for KQ conclusions was not assessed by predefined criteria, the evidence base is developing rapidly with new studies since the last search date, and given the evolving evidence, new reviews of the literature and potential revisions to the practice statement will be necessary.

### Does reduced smoking if you can' T stop make any difference? [^116VvFx4]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Promoting and supporting smoking reduction in smokers with no immediate intention of stopping smoking is controversial given existing fears that this will deter cessation and that reduction itself may not improve health outcomes.

Discussion

Evidence shows that smokers who reduce the number of daily cigarettes smoked are more likely to attempt and actually achieve smoking cessation. Further, clinical trials have shown that nicotine replacement therapy benefits both reduction and cessation. Worldwide data suggests that 'non-medical' nicotine is more attractive to people who smoke, with electronic cigarettes now being widely used. Nevertheless, only one small trial has examined the use of electronic cigarettes to promote reduction, with direct evidence remaining inconclusive. It has been suggested that long-term reduced smoking may directly benefit health, although the benefits are small compared with cessation.

Summary

The combined data imply that smoking reduction is a promising intervention, particularly when supported by clean nicotine; however, the benefits are only observed when it leads to permanent cessation.

### Does reduced smoking if you can' T stop make any difference? [^1142tj3Z]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking reduction, defined herein as a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked per day, is a strategy used by smokers to moderate the health and financial effects of smoking and ease towards complete cessation. It is advocated by some health professionals for smokers who have no immediate intention of quitting or those who have been unable to do so. Despite approximately half of all smokers in England currently attempting a reduction in smoking, this strategy remains controversial. Concerns have been raised regarding smoking reduction being seen as a favourable alternative compared to complete cessation, thus possibly decreasing the likelihood of future cessation. Nevertheless, eventual cessation success may be influenced by the methods used to reduce smoking, particularly given the several options currently available to support this, including pharmacotherapies, such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, oral tobacco products including snus, and more recently, novel devices such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). However, if smokers are unable to quit following reduction, it is important to understand whether this affects their health outcomes in order to inform the current debate.

In this opinion piece, the main issues related to smoking reduction and cessation are considered and evaluated based on the available evidence. The discussion includes an evaluation of whether promoting smoking reduction directly or indirectly deters cessation, a summary of the methods available to reduce smoking, and discussion of evidence that reduction itself may decrease the harm from smoking even if cessation is not achieved.

### Electronic cigarettes, quit attempts and smoking cessation: a 6-month follow-up [^11561exz]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

There is conflicting evidence that use of e-cigarettes promotes cessation in regular smokers, but contrasting findings may be due to differing definitions of vaping. The aim was to assess whether regular use of e-cigarettes while smoking is associated with subsequent smoking cessation.

Design

Baseline internet survey with outcomes measured at 6-month follow-up.

Setting

All French metropolitan territory.

Participants

A total of 2057 smokers aged 15–85 years were recruited through an access panel and responded to a 6-month follow-up: 1805 exclusive tobacco smokers and 252 dual users (tobacco plus regular e-cigarette users) at baseline.

Measurements

The three outcomes assessed at 6 months were: a minimum 50% reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked per day, quit attempts of at least 7 days and smoking cessation of at least 7 days at the time of follow-up. Logistic regressions were performed to model the three outcomes according to regular e-cigarette use at baseline, adjusted for socio-economic variables and smoking behaviours.

Findings

Baseline dual users were more likely than baseline exclusive tobacco smokers to have halved cigarette consumption [25.9 versus 11.2%, P < 0.001, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.6, confidence interval (CI) = 1.8–3.8]. Dual users at baseline were also more likely to have made a quit attempt of at least 7 days (22.8 versus 10.9%, P < 0.001, aOR = 1.8, CI = 1.2–2.6). No significant difference was found for 7-day cessation rates at 6 months (12.5 versus 9.5%, P = 0.18, aOR = 1.2, CI = 0.8–1.9).

Conclusions

Among people who smoke, those also using an e-cigarette regularly are more likely to try to quit smoking and reduce their cigarette consumption during the next 6 months. It remains unclear whether regular e-cigarette users are also more likely to stop smoking.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^117U18nt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

This field of research and EC devices themselves continue to evolve rapidly. This is the fifth update conducted as part of our 'living systematic review' approach, which will proceed until at least 2027, meaning we can continue to rapidly incorporate new evidence (see Supplementary material 8).

This update incorporates data from 1 March 2024 to 1 March 2025. Subsequent monthly searches will keep the evidence in this review current. Although studies predominantly came from the USA and UK, this review covers data from 16 countries. Geographical range in studies may be particularly important, due to the marked differences in EC regulation between countries; for example, studies conducted in countries that limit nicotine dose in EC, or allow only certain EC devices to be tested, may observe less pronounced effects on quitting. This review includes studies on some under‐researched populations, including people not motivated to quit smoking, people with substance misuse disorders, people with serious mental health conditions, people living in socially deprived areas and people experiencing homelessness. Quit rates in these groups are traditionally lower, but these groups may particularly stand to benefit from EC if they are effective because, in absolute terms, conventional cessation methods are often not as effective for them.

Abstract

Background

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Stopping smoking can reduce this harm and many people would like to stop. There are a number of medicines licenced to help people quit globally, and e‐cigarettes are used for this purpose in many countries. Typically treatments work by reducing cravings to smoke, thus aiding initial abstinence and preventing relapse. More information on comparative effects of these treatments is needed to inform treatment decisions and policies.

Objectives

To investigate the comparative benefits, harms and tolerability of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and e‐cigarettes, when used to help people stop smoking tobacco.

Search methods

We identified studies from recent updates of Cochrane Reviews investigating our interventions of interest. We updated the searches for each review using the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (TAG) specialised register to 29 April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs and factorial RCTs, which measured smoking cessation at six months or longer, recruited adults who smoked combustible cigarettes at enrolment (excluding pregnant people) and randomised them to approved pharmacotherapies and technologies used for smoking cessation worldwide (varenicline, cytisine, nortriptyline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e‐cigarettes) versus no pharmacological intervention, placebo (control) or another approved pharmacotherapy. Studies providing co‐interventions (e.g. behavioural support) were eligible if the co‐intervention was provided equally to study arms.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment (using the RoB 1 tool). Primary outcome measures were smoking cessation at six months or longer, and the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs). We also measured withdrawals due to treatment. We used Bayesian component network meta‐analyses (cNMA) to examine intervention type, delivery mode, dose, duration, timing in relation to quit day and tapering of nicotine dose, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). We calculated an effect estimate for combination NRT using an additive model. We evaluated the influence of population and study characteristics, provision of behavioural support and control arm rates using meta‐regression. We evaluated certainty using GRADE.

Main results

Of our 332 eligible RCTs, 319 (835 study arms, 157,179 participants) provided sufficient data to be included in our cNMA. Of these, we judged 51 to be at low risk of bias overall, 104 at high risk and 164 at unclear risk, and 118 reported pharmaceutical or e‐cigarette/tobacco industry funding. Removing studies at high risk of bias did not change our interpretation of the results.

Benefits

We found high‐certainty evidence that nicotine e‐cigarettes (OR 2.37, 95% CrI 1.73 to 3.24; 16 RCTs, 3828 participants), varenicline (OR 2.33, 95% CrI 2.02 to 2.68; 67 RCTs, 16,430 participants) and cytisine (OR 2.21, 95% CrI 1.66 to 2.97; 7 RCTs, 3848 participants) were associated with higher quit rates than control. In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional eight (95% CrI 4 to 13), eight (95% CrI 6 to 10) and seven additional quitters per 100 (95% CrI 4 to 12), respectively. These interventions appeared to be more effective than the other interventions apart from combination NRT (patch and a fast‐acting form of NRT), which had a lower point estimate (calculated additive effect) but overlapping 95% CrIs (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.61 to 2.34). There was also high‐certainty evidence that nicotine patch alone (OR 1.37, 95% CrI 1.20 to 1.56; 105 RCTs, 37,319 participants), fast‐acting NRT alone (OR 1.41, 95% CrI 1.29 to 1.55; 120 RCTs, 31,756 participants) and bupropion (OR 1.43, 95% CrI 1.26 to 1.62; 71 RCTs, 14,759 participants) were more effective than control, resulting in two (95% CrI 1 to 3), three (95% CrI 2 to 3) and three (95% CrI 2 to 4) additional quitters per 100 respectively.

Nortriptyline is probably associated with higher quit rates than control (OR 1.35, 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.81; 10 RCTs, 1290 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence), resulting in two (CrI 0 to 5) additional quitters per 100. Non‐nicotine/placebo e‐cigarettes (OR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.80; 8 RCTs, 1094 participants; low‐certainty evidence), equating to one additional quitter (95% CrI ‐2 to 5), had point estimates favouring the intervention over control, but CrIs encompassed the potential for no difference and harm. There was low‐certainty evidence that tapering the dose of NRT prior to stopping treatment may improve effectiveness; however, 95% CrIs also incorporated the null (OR 1.14, 95% CrI 1.00 to 1.29; 111 RCTs, 33,156 participants). This might lead to an additional one quitter per 100 (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Harms

There were insufficient data to include nortriptyline and non‐nicotine EC in the final SAE model. Overall rates of SAEs for the remaining treatments were low (average 3%). Low‐certainty evidence did not show a clear difference in the number of people reporting SAEs for nicotine e‐cigarettes, varenicline, cytisine or NRT when compared to no pharmacotherapy/e‐cigarettes or placebo. Bupropion may slightly increase rates of SAEs, although the CrI also incorporated no difference (moderate certainty). In absolute terms bupropion may cause one more person in 100 to experience an SAE (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Authors' conclusions

The most effective interventions were nicotine e‐cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine (all high certainty), as well as combination NRT (additive effect, certainty not rated). There was also high‐certainty evidence for the effectiveness of nicotine patch, fast‐acting NRT and bupropion. Less certain evidence of benefit was present for nortriptyline (moderate certainty), non‐nicotine e‐cigarettes and tapering of nicotine dose (both low certainty).

There was moderate‐certainty evidence that bupropion may slightly increase the frequency of SAEs, although there was also the possibility of no increased risk. There was no clear evidence that any other tested interventions increased SAEs. Overall, SAE data were sparse with very low numbers of SAEs, and so further evidence may change our interpretation and certainty.

Future studies should report SAEs to strengthen certainty in this outcome. More head‐to‐head comparisons of the most effective interventions are needed, as are tests of combinations of these. Future work should unify data from behavioural and pharmacological interventions to inform approaches to combined support for smoking cessation.

### Another article about E-cigarettes: why should I care? [^117AoGdW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Two recent comprehensive reviews of the scientific evidence on e‐cigarettes help to define the state of the science around e‐cigarettes. Admittedly, the science is in a state of flux and evolving rapidly. 1, 2 The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on the public health consequences of e‐cigarettes, and a new evidence review on e‐cigarettes and heated tobacco products commissioned by Public Health England both come to similar conclusions. 1, 2 Both reports acknowledge that available evidence indicates that e‐cigarette use is less risky than use of combustible tobacco cigarettes, that e‐cigarettes may be helpful to smokers who are trying to stop smoking cigarettes, and that e‐cigarettes should not be used by non‐smokers, especially youth. However, both reports also state that e‐cigarettes contain constituents that are not inert and are likely to have some negative health effects on their own. The reports also note the need for more research to better understand which patients might be most likely to benefit from e‐cigarette use to support complete cessation, who should avoid using them, and what the overall population health benefits might ultimately be.

### Is the use of electronic cigarettes while smoking associated with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and reduced cigarette consumption? A survey with a 1-year follow-up [^111sterV]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To use a unique longitudinal data set to assess the association between e-cigarette use while smoking with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and substantial reduction, taking into account frequency of use and key potential confounders.

Design

Web-based survey, baseline November/December 2012, 1-year follow-up in December 2013.

Setting

Great Britain.

Participants

National general population sample of 4064 adult smokers, with 1759 (43%) followed-up.

Measurements

Main outcome measures were cessation attempt, cessation and substantial reduction (≥ 50% from baseline to follow-up) of cigarettes per day (CPD). In logistic regression models, cessation attempt in the last year (analysis n = 1473) and smoking status (n = 1656) at follow-up were regressed on to baseline e-cigarette use (none, non-daily, daily) while adjusting for baseline socio-demographics, dependence and nicotine replacement (NRT) use. Substantial reduction (n = 1042) was regressed on to follow-up e-cigarette use while adjusting for baseline socio-demographics and dependence and follow-up NRT use.

Findings

Compared with non-use, daily e-cigarette use at baseline was associated with increased cessation attempts [odds ratio (OR) = 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24–3.58, P = 0.006], but not with cessation at follow-up (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.28–1.37, P = 0.24). Non-daily use was not associated with cessation attempts or cessation. Daily e-cigarette use at follow-up was associated with increased odds of substantial reduction (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.14–5.45, P = 0.02), non-daily use was not.

Conclusions

Daily use of e-cigarettes while smoking appears to be associated with subsequent increases in rates of attempting to stop smoking and reducing smoking, but not with smoking cessation. Non-daily use of e-cigarettes while smoking does not appear to be associated with cessation attempts, cessation or reduced smoking.

Key question 1 — study selection and scope — two authors reviewed the literature search, selected 30 studies for full-text review, and excluded 53 studies; common exclusions were lack of ENDS as the intervention (seven studies), lack of focus on tobacco cessation (17 studies), being published prior to a more recent systematic review (12 studies), or not a study (17 articles), and studies of benefit are in adult populations and do not apply to youth. The literature search identified several acceptable quality systematic reviews relevant to this key question: two published in 2017, four published in 2016, and one published in 2015.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^113P3Q7K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Electronic cigarettes (EC) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if EC can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review update was conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of EC for helping people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 March 2025, reference-checked, and contacted study authors.

Eligibility Criteria

We included trials randomising people who smoked to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies where all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to measure an eligible outcome.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use.

Risk Of Bias

We used the RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias for each study and GRADE to assess evidence certainty.

Synthesis Methods

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Where appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences with 95% CIs.

Included Studies

We included 104 completed studies (14 new to this update), representing 30,366 participants, of which 61 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We rated 11 included studies as being at low risk of bias, 70 at high risk (including all non-randomised studies), and the remainder at unclear risk overall.

Synthesis Of Results

Nicotine EC result in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.88; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 2703 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37; I² = 58%; 7 studies, 2241 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.03; I² = 30%; 8 studies, 2950 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nicotine EC probably result in increased quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1918 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 4 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate-certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1717 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to behavioural support only or no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomised to nicotine EC (low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.25; I² = 13%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomised to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.55; I² = 66%; 8 studies, 2485 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain and, again, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.29; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 4716 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Data from non-randomised studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that nicotine EC increase quit rates compared to NRT, and moderate-certainty evidence that they probably increase quit rates compared to EC without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with behavioural support or no support also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study designs. CIs were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence of a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine EC nor between nicotine EC and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger trials are needed to fully evaluate safety. Included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision for some comparisons and for safety outcomes due to the relatively small number of RCTs contributing, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review. We run and screen searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113wmTBg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes — unanimous committee guidance for clinical practice states that the clinician's role is to encourage and support a smoker's efforts to stop using cigarettes and other combustible tobacco products, that given the uncertainties of the long-term effects of e-cigarettes on health, a clinician should advise cigarette smokers seeking to quit to use evidence-based, FDA-approved, safe, and effective smoking cessation pharmacotherapies as first-line treatments in preference to e-cigarettes, and that clinicians should be prepared to discuss the risks and benefits with patients who ask about or are already using an e-cigarette; if a smoker decides to use e-cigarettes, the committee felt that the clinician should play a supportive role, helping the patient to use the product in a way that minimizes risk to themselves and others and indicating that the eventual goal is complete abstinence from all products, including e-cigarettes.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^115LSRpz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating an e‐liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of using EC to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long‐term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non‐nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 February 2024 and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register to 1 February 2023, reference‐checked, and contacted study authors.

Selection criteria

We included trials randomizing people who smoke to an EC or control condition. We included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report an eligible outcome.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We used the risk of bias tool (RoB 1) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer‐term EC use. We used a fixed‐effect Mantel‐Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in pairwise and network meta‐analyses (NMA).

Main results

We included 90 completed studies (two new to this update), representing 29,044 participants, of which 49 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the included studies, we rated 10 (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 61 at high risk overall (including all non‐randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk.

Nicotine EC results in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high‐certainty evidence) (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.93; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 2544 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate‐certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 2052 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.60; I² = 32%; 6 studies, 2761 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Nicotine EC probably results in increased quit rates compared to non‐nicotine EC (moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; I² = 4%; 6 studies, 1613 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 7 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate‐certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 1412 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (low‐certainty evidence due to issues with risk of bias) (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.32; I² = 0%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 3 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non‐serious) AEs may be more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.27; I² = 6%; low‐certainty evidence; 6 studies, 2351 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28; I² = 0%; 12 studies, 4561 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Results from the NMA were consistent with those from pairwise meta‐analyses for all critical outcomes. There was inconsistency in the AE network, which was explained by a single outlying study contributing the only direct evidence for one of the nodes.

Data from non‐randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' conclusions

There is high‐certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate‐certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care or no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study design. Confidence intervals were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence for a difference in AEs between nicotine and non‐nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT, but low‐certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger studies are needed to fully evaluate EC safety. Our included studies tested regulated nicotine‐containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles.

The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up‐to‐date information to decision‐makers, this is a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### The effect of 12-week e-cigarette use on smoking abstinence at 1 year: the E3 trial [^112W3ajL]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The current evidence regarding the long-term efficacy of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) for smoking cessation is unclear.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes for smoking cessation in the general population.

Methods

We randomized 376 adults who smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes/day and were motivated to quit at 17 Canadian sites to 12 weeks of nicotine (15 mg/mL) e-cigarettes (n = 128), non-nicotine e-cigarettes (n = 127), or no e-cigarettes (n = 121). All groups received individual counseling. The primary endpoint was point prevalence abstinence (7-day recall, biochemically validated using expired carbon monoxide) at 12 weeks. The 52-week follow-up results are reported here.

Results

Participants (mean age 52 ± 13 years; 47% female) smoked a mean of 21 ± 11 cigarettes/day at baseline. Compared to individual counseling alone, participants randomized to nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling had higher rates of point prevalence (23.6% vs 9.9%; difference: 13.7%; 95% CI: 4.6%-22.8%) and continuous abstinence (3.1% vs 0.0%; difference: 3.1%; 95% CI: 0.1%-6.2%) and greater reductions in the number of cigarettes smoked (-9.5 ± 10.5 vs -5.6 ± 9.5; difference: -3.9; 95% CI: -6.5 to -1.4) at 52 weeks. Benefits were also observed among participants randomized to non-nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling vs counseling alone. No differences in abstinence or reduction were found between nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes.

Conclusions

Compared to individual counseling alone, short-term use of standardized nicotine and non-nicotine e-cigarettes plus counseling is efficacious at increasing smoking abstinence at 52 weeks.

### Varenicline for smoking cessation in individuals who smoke cigarettes and use electronic cigarettes: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial [^112WmM5w]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vaping products are combustion-free nicotine delivery systems (i.e. electronic cigarettes; hereafter referred to as e-cigarettes) that have become popular among adult tobacco cigarette smokers, with the global number of e-cigarette users estimated at about 68 million in 2020. Although e-cigarette users report buying them to quit traditional tobacco cigarette smoking, many continue to smoke while vaping. In the USA, the number of adults who currently both smoke traditional cigarettes and use e-cigarettes (i.e. dual users) is estimated at 40–60%.

E-cigarettes may be effective in helping adult smokers to quit. Also, a marked reduction in toxic chemicals and beneficial impact on health effect indicators have been shown in exclusive e-cigarette users compared to cigarette smokers. However, the extent to which smoking-related harm is reduced when e-cigarettes are used concurrently with combustible cigarettes is less clear. Further complicating the analysis, dual users are highly heterogeneous in their use of these products, with significant variability observed across population subgroups by age, race, socioeconomic, and psychosocial status. Given these uncertainties, it is imperative that dual use patterns and health effects be thoroughly investigated.

In our experience and according to recent surveys, interest in stopping smoking altogether has grown among dual users, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dual users' desire to stop smoking altogether appears to be largely due to concern about the well-known health risks of cigarette smoking, the high cost of tobacco cigarettes, and the need to break away from dependency on tobacco cigarettes. In spite of the growing interest in smoking cessation among dual users, there is little evidence to inform specific recommendations for people who vape and smoke and intend to stop smoking. Although guidelines on best management for smoking cessation are available, there are no specific evidence-based recommendations for individuals who smoke cigarettes and use e-cigarettes and intend to quit cigarette smoking. Rigorous research is required to establish effectiveness of interventions for e-cigarette and dual use cessation among specific subpopulations and to guide the decisions of health authorities and healthcare providers. In particular, there is limited information about the efficacy and safety of medications approved for smoking cessation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for individual who smoke and use e-cigarettes.

### Is the use of electronic cigarettes while smoking associated with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and reduced cigarette consumption? A survey with a 1-year follow-up [^11697bQw]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a web‐based national sample of smokers from the general population, those using e‐cigarettes daily at baseline were more likely to have attempted to stop smoking when followed‐up a year later than smokers not using e‐cigarettes, but neither non‐daily nor daily e‐cigarette use was associated with smoking cessation during follow‐up. Smokers using e‐cigarettes daily when followed‐up were more likely to have achieved at least 50% reduction in tobacco cigarette consumption from baseline. Less frequent e‐cigarette use did not have a significant effect on consumption. Using e‐cigarettes every day while smoking increased the prevalence of substantial reduction in tobacco consumption, and this was not restricted to smokers who had recently taken up e‐cigarettes, suggesting that persistent users continue to reduce consumption over time. Reduction in consumption has been reported previously 14. This increase in substantial reduction was reflected in a small overall reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked in daily e‐cigarette users. The size of the reduction was similar to that seen in smokers using NRT 12. NRT itself showed a similar size of positive association with subsequent cessation to that found in previous studies 12, but in this case it was not statistically significant using a conventional alpha (P = 0.067 two‐tailed).

### Does reduced smoking if you can' T stop make any difference? [^1163CnDx]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit would benefit from a gradual reduction in the number of daily cigarettes smoked given its benefit in the likelihood of achieving cessation. Combining reduction attempts with clean nicotine leads to greater reduction and cessation rates. Indeed, e-cigarettes show particular promise since they appeal to smokers and may help them achieve cessation. Nevertheless, their rapid evolution, with newer models outpacing older devices tested in currently published efficacy trials, presents a challenge for researchers and clinicians. Finally, evidence that reduced smoking decreases the harm from smoking is suggestive, but not conclusive. The lack of detailed characterisation of the extent and length of smoking reduction in relation to health outcomes makes it difficult to determine the health benefits. Given the uncertainty of this evidence and the clear benefits of total smoking cessation, the focus in harm reduction should remain on promoting cessation through reduction rather than on reduction as an end goal.

General clinical assumptions and scope — this document is applicable to anyone who smokes tobacco cigarettes, with special emphasis on individuals with CVD; many recommendations are generalizable to patients who use other combustible forms of tobacco products such as little filter cigars and cigarillos or who are exposed to tobacco smoke; the smoking of nontobacco products such as marijuana is not covered. The scope includes assessment of cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence and the provision of behavioral, pharmacological, and supportive interventions for both inpatient and outpatient settings. It also discusses alternative tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes, noting recommendations are less certain because their net health risks and benefits are still being determined, and explores emerging evidence about CV risk to guide clinician discussions of such products with patients.

### How to facilitate smoking cessation [^111qaipM]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite a decline in global smoking prevalence over recent decades, cigarette smoking remains one of the main modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular benefits of smoking cessation are well established; however, quitting smoking remains a major challenge. In this review, we aim to highlight useful tools to support smokers in their cessation journey. These include brief counseling, cognitive and behavioral interventions, and pharmacological therapies (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline). We also discuss evidence regarding eHealth-based interventions and the potential impact of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation. Finally, we focus on the role of public health interventions in promoting smoking cessation.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^117LZH2U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices which produce an aerosol by heating an e-liquid. Some people who smoke use ECs to stop or reduce smoking, although some organizations, advocacy groups and policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of using electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 July 2022, and reference-checked and contacted study authors. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross-over trials, in which people who smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or longer or data on safety markers at one week or longer, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people still using study product (EC or pharmacotherapy) at six or more months after randomization or starting EC use, changes in carbon monoxide (CO), blood pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels of carcinogens or toxicants, or both. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses.

Main Results

We included 78 completed studies, representing 22,052 participants, of which 40 were RCTs. Seventeen of the 78 included studies were new to this review update. Of the included studies, we rated ten (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 50 at high risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There was high certainty that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.04; I² = 10%; 6 studies, 2378 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6). There was moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar between groups (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.19; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1702 participants). SAEs were rare, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differed between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; I² = 34%; 5 studies, 2411 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1447 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional seven quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1840 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 1272 participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.65; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 3126 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 3). However, this finding was of very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I² = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.97; I² = 38%; 9 studies, 1993 participants). Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate-certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the effect size. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two years and the number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this review is a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### Electronic cigarettes and subsequent cigarette smoking in young people: a systematic review [^115RyCiG]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the evidence for a relationship between the use of e-cigarettes and subsequent smoking in young people (≤ 29years), and whether this differs by demographic characteristics.

Methods

Systematic review with association direction plots (searches to April 2023). Screening, data extraction and critical appraisal followed Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was the association between e-cigarette use, availability or both, and change in population rate of smoking in young people. The secondary outcomes were initiation, progression and cessation of smoking at individual level. We assessed certainty using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).

Results

We included 126 studies. For our primary outcome, there was very low certainty evidence (limited by risk of bias and inconsistency) suggesting that e-cigarette use and availability were inversely associated with smoking in young people (i.e. as e-cigarettes became more available and/or used more widely, youth smoking rates went down or, conversely, as e-cigarettes were restricted, youth smoking rates went up). All secondary outcomes were judged to be very low certainty due to very serious risk of bias. Data consistently showed direct associations between vaping at baseline and smoking initiation (28 studies) and smoking progression (5 studies). The four studies contributing data on smoking cessation had mixed results, precluding drawing any conclusion on the direction of association. There was limited information to determine whether relationships varied by sociodemographic characteristics.

Conclusion

At an individual level, people who vape appear to be more likely to go on to smoke than people who do not vape; however, it is unclear if these behaviours are causally linked. Very low certainty evidence suggests that youth vaping and smoking could be inversely related.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^113HTHoZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators are interested in knowing if EC can help people to quit and if it is safe to use them to do so. In particular, healthcare providers have an urgent need to know what they should recommend to people to help them to stop smoking. The largest health gains are achieved from stopping smoking completely, as opposed to reducing cigarette consumption and, as such, this review focusses on the effectiveness of EC in aiding complete smoking cessation.

This review was first published in 2014, and updated in 2016, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2024 and 2025. We published an update to the protocol in 2023 (see) and in 2025.

Following publication of the 2020 update of this review, we are maintaining it as a living systematic review. This means we are continually running searches and incorporating new evidence into the review. For more information about the living systematic review methods being used, see Supplementary material 8. A living systematic review approach is appropriate for this review for three reasons. Firstly, the review addresses an important public health issue: the role of EC in enabling people who smoke to stop smoking, with the potential for substantial ongoing individual and societal benefits, depending on the extent of effectiveness. Secondly, there remains uncertainty in the existing evidence; more studies are needed to confirm the degree of benefit for different comparisons and product types, and there is considerable uncertainty about adverse events and other markers of safety. Thirdly, we are aware of multiple ongoing trials that are likely to have an important impact on the conclusions of the review.

### Interventions for quitting vaping [^115TvK8i]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

There is limited guidance on the best ways to stop using nicotine-containing vapes (otherwise known as e-cigarettes) and ensure long-term abstinence, whilst minimising the risk of tobacco smoking and other unintended consequences. Treatments could include pharmacological interventions, behavioural interventions, or both.

Objectives

To conduct a living systematic review assessing the benefits and harms of interventions to help people stop vaping compared to each other or to placebo or no intervention. To also assess how these interventions affect the use of combustible tobacco, and whether the effects vary based on participant characteristics.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from 1 January 2004 to 24 April 2024: CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; PsycINFO; ClinicalTrials.gov (through CENTRAL); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (through CENTRAL). We also searched the references of eligible studies and abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 2024 conference, and contacted study authors.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting people of any age using nicotine-containing vapes, regardless of tobacco smoking status. Studies had to test an intervention designed to support people to quit vaping, and plan to measure at least one of our outcomes.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes: vaping cessation; change in combustible tobacco use at six months or longer; number of participants reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) at one week or longer.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in the included studies.

Synthesis Methods

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We grouped studies by comparisons and outcomes reported, and calculated individual study and pooled effects, as appropriate. We used random-effects Mantel-Haenszel methods to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We used random-effects inverse variance methods to calculate mean differences and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

Nine RCTs, representing 5209 participants motivated to stop using nicotine-containing vapes at baseline, are included. In six studies, participants were abstinent from smoking tobacco cigarettes at baseline, although most studies included some participants who had previously smoked. Eight studies included participants aged 18 or older, three included only young adults (18 to 24 years), and one included 13- to 17-year-olds only. We judged three studies at low risk, three at high risk, and three at unclear risk of bias.

Synthesis Of Results

Pharmacological interventions for quitting nicotine vaping Studies assessed combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), cytisine, and varenicline as pharmacological interventions for quitting vaping in comparison to placebo or no/minimal support (control). The point estimate for combination NRT indicated possible benefit, but the CI incorporated the possibility of no benefit and a potential benefit of control (very low-certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias; RR 2.57, 95% CI 0.29 to 22.93; 1 study, 16 participants). The one study investigating cytisine did not report vaping cessation rates at six months or longer. Varenicline increased vaping cessation rates at six months, but the evidence was low certainty due to imprecision (RR 2.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.68; 1 study, 140 participants). Zero participants reported SAEs in the studies of combination NRT versus no/minimal support (1 study, 508 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision) and cytisine versus placebo (1 study, 159 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Three studies investigating varenicline measured the number of participants reporting SAEs. However, only one study reported an SAE (in the intervention arm); therefore, the effect estimate was calculated based on that single study (RR 2.60, 95% CI 0.11 to 62.16; 95 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Behavioural interventions for quitting nicotine vaping Studies assessed reducing nicotine concentration and vaping behaviour (1 study) and text message-based interventions (3 studies) as behavioural interventions for stopping vaping in comparison to no/minimal support (control). In one study, the point estimate suggested nicotine/vaping reduction increased vaping cessation compared to minimal support at six-month follow-up, but the CI incorporated the possibility of no intervention effect and higher cessation rates in the control arm (RR 3.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 26.30; 17 participants; very low-certainty due to imprecision and risk of bias). There was low-certainty evidence (downgraded two levels due to indirectness) that text message-based interventions may have increased vaping cessation rates compared to control in 13- to 24-year-olds (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 4091 participants). The one study investigating nicotine/vaping behaviour reduction did not report on SAEs. One of the studies investigating text message-based interventions did report on SAEs; however, zero events were reported in both study arms (508 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). No studies reported change in combustible tobacco smoking at six-month follow-up or longer.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low-certainty evidence that text message-based interventions designed to help people stop nicotine vaping may help more youth and young adults to successfully stop than no/minimal support, and low-certainty evidence that varenicline may also help people quit vaping. Data exploring the effectiveness of combination NRT, cytisine, and nicotine/vaping behaviour reduction are inconclusive due to risk of bias and imprecision. Most studies that measured SAEs reported none; however, more data are needed to draw clear conclusions. Of note, data from studies investigating these interventions for quitting smoking have not demonstrated serious concerns about SAEs. No studies assessed the change in combustible tobacco smoking, including relapse to or uptake of tobacco smoking, at six-month follow-up or longer. It is important that future studies measure this so the complete risk profile of relevant interventions can be considered. We identified 20 ongoing RCTs. Their incorporation into the evidence base and the continued identification of new studies is imperative to inform clinical and policy guidance on the best ways to stop vaping. Therefore, we will continue to update this review as a living systematic review by running searches monthly and updating the review when relevant new evidence that will strengthen or change our conclusions emerges.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation and reduction [^115cMtv2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are electronic devices that heat a liquid - usually comprising propylene glycol and glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir - into an aerosol for inhalation. Since ECs appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady growth in sales. Smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of smoking, but some healthcare organisations have been reluctant to encourage smokers to switch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to know if these devices can reduce the harms associated with smoking. In particular, healthcare providers have an urgent need to know what advice they should give to smokers enquiring about ECs.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy of ECs in helping people who smoke to achieve long-term abstinence; to examine the efficacy of ECs in helping people reduce cigarette consumption by at least 50% of baseline levels; and to assess the occurrence of adverse events associated with EC use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Groups Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases for relevant records from 2004 to July 2014, together with reference checking and contact with study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which current smokers (motivated or unmotivated to quit) were randomized to EC or a control condition, and which measured abstinence rates or changes in cigarette consumption at six months or longer. As the field of EC research is new, we also included cohort follow-up studies with at least six months follow-up. We included randomized cross-over trials and cohort follow-up studies that included at least one week of EC use for assessment of adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted data from the included studies and another checked them. Our main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, and we used the most rigorous definition available (continuous, biochemically validated, longest follow-up). For reduction we used a dichotomous approach (no change/reduction < 50% versus reduction by 50% or more of baseline cigarette consumption). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study, and where appropriate we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses.

Main Results

Our search identified almost 600 records, from which we include 29 representing 13 completed studies (two RCTs, 11 cohort). We identified nine ongoing trials. Two RCTs compared EC with placebo (non-nicotine) EC, with a combined sample size of 662 participants. One trial included minimal telephone support and one recruited smokers not intending to quit, and both used early EC models with low nicotine content. We judged the RCTs to be at low risk of bias, but under the GRADE system the overall quality of the evidence for our outcomes was rated 'low' or 'very low' because of imprecision due to the small number of trials. A 'low' grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. Participants using an EC were more likely to have abstained from smoking for at least six months compared with participants using placebo EC (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4% versus EC 9%; 2 studies; GRADE: low). The one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in six-month abstinence rates, but the confidence intervals do not rule out a clinically important difference (RR 1.26, 95% CI: 0.68 to 2.34; GRADE: very low). A higher number of people were able to reduce cigarette consumption by at least half with ECs compared with placebo ECs (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.68, 2 studies; placebo: 27% versus EC: 36%; GRADE: low) and compared with patch (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.67, 1 study; patch: 44% versus EC: 61%; GRADE: very low). Unlike smoking cessation outcomes, reduction results were not biochemically verified. None of the RCTs or cohort studies reported any serious adverse events (SAEs) that were considered to be plausibly related to EC use. One RCT provided data on the proportion of participants experiencing any adverse events. Although the proportion of participants in the study arms experiencing adverse events was similar, the confidence intervals are wide (ECs vs placebo EC RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.34; ECs vs patch RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22). The other RCT reported no statistically significant difference in the frequency of AEs at three- or 12-month follow-up between the EC and placebo EC groups, and showed that in all groups the frequency of AEs (with the exception of throat irritation) decreased significantly over time.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from two trials that ECs help smokers to stop smoking long-term compared with placebo ECs. However, the small number of trials, low event rates and wide confidence intervals around the estimates mean that our confidence in the result is rated 'low' by GRADE standards. The lack of difference between the effect of ECs compared with nicotine patches found in one trial is uncertain for similar reasons. ECs appear to help smokers unable to stop smoking altogether to reduce their cigarette consumption when compared with placebo ECs and nicotine patches, but the above limitations also affect certainty in this finding. In addition, lack of biochemical assessment of the actual reduction in smoke intake further limits this evidence. No evidence emerged that short-term EC use is associated with health risk.

### Is e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults associated with later smoking? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146khkk]. Tobacco Control (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Existing evidence suggests that electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is less harmful than smokingand is an effective smoking cessation aid; however, there are concerns that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking cigarettes among young people. If this is correct, rather than seeing a decline in smoking rates we may see smoking rates remaining stable or increasing due to a new generation of smokers for whom e-cigarettes have acted as a route into smoking. This hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the 'gateway hypothesis' or 'catalyst model') has been widely debated among researchers and public health officials. Some argue that a common liability better explains the association between vaping and later smoking, whereby the same genetic or environmental factors that increase the likelihood of someone vaping also increase the likelihood of someone smoking. As many people use e-cigarettes to help them stop smoking, it would also be logical to assume the opposite direction of causality with smoking causing people to vape. The lack of consensus on the issue demonstrates the need for the current evidence to be synthesised.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^113HAYvA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants). Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants). We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence). Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Electronic cigarettes and subsequent use of cigarettes in young people: an evidence and gap map [^114kyaor]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The use of e-cigarettes may influence later smoking uptake in young people. Evidence and gap maps (EGMs) are interactive on-line tools that display the evidence and gaps in a specific area of policy or research. The aim of this study was to map clusters and gaps in evidence exploring the relationship between e-cigarette use or availability and subsequent combustible tobacco use in people aged < 30years.

Methods

We conducted an EGM of primary studies and systematic reviews. A framework and an interactive EGM was developed in consultation with an expert advisory group. A systematic search of five databases retrieved 9057 records, from which 134 studies were included. Systematic reviews were appraised using AMSTAR-2, and all included studies were coded into the EGM framework resulting in the interactive web-based EGM. A descriptive analysis of key characteristics of the identified evidence clusters and gaps resulted in this report.

Results

Studies were completed between 2015 and 2023, with the first systematic reviews being published in 2017. Most studies were conducted in western high-income countries, predominantly the United States. Cohort studies were the most frequently used study design. The evidence is clustered on e-cigarette use as an exposure, with an absolute gap identified for evidence looking into the availability of e-cigarettes and subsequent cessation of cigarette smoking. We also found little evidence analysing equity factors, and little exploring characteristics of e-cigarette devices.

Conclusions

This evidence and gap map (EGM) offers a tool to explore the available evidence regarding the e-cigarette use/availability and later cigarette smoking in people under the age of 30years at the time of the search. The majority of the 134 reports is from high-income countries, with an uneven geographic distribution. Most of the systematic reviews are of lower quality, suggesting the need for higher-quality reviews. The evidence is clustered around e-cigarette use as an exposure and subsequent frequency/intensity of current combustible tobacco use. Gaps in evidence focusing on e-cigarette availability, as well as on the influence of equity factors may warrant further research. This EGM can support funders and researchers in identifying future research priorities, while guiding practitioners and policymakers to the current evidence base.

### Electronic cigarettes and subsequent cigarette smoking in young people: a systematic review [^111EibEF]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

For our secondary outcomes — initiation, progression and cessation — certainty was again very low. All of these outcomes were downgraded, as all studies contributing data were judged to be at serious or critical risk of bias. Certainty in our cessation outcome was further limited by unexplained heterogeneity in findings across the studies.

Given risk of bias is the main limitation of the evidence overall, it is worth noting that the tool we used, although strict, does not rule out the possibility of a low risk of bias study. The only risk of bias detected for some population‐level (quasi‐experimental) studies was a lack of pre‐registration, which can introduce bias because of selective reporting. These studies were judged to be at low risk of bias in all other domains because of their attempts to mimic randomization by using plausibly exogenous changes in e‐cigarette policies or introductions. Our individual‐level studies for the most part did not set out to do this, and confounding is and will continue to be difficult to rule out in these designs. However, methods such as Mendelian randomization, or use of other instrumental variables, conceivably could provide a path toward low risk of bias individual‐level studies using our tool.

Data overwhelmingly came from a small number of high‐income countries. This is a further critical limitation to the evidence base. Different countries have different regulations and enforcement processes in place for vaping and smoking, and different rates of smoking and vaping among youth. These may affect the relationship between vaping and smoking, and so conclusions cannot be extrapolated to lower‐income countries or even to other higher‐income countries that have different cultural or regulatory environments. More research is needed outside of the United States. We stratified individual‐level studies by sample size, but findings were consistent across both groups of studies, and both groups of studies predominantly represented data from the same countries.

Many studies did not report whether associations differed based on socially stratifying characteristics, so there is uncertainty as to whether the impact of EC availability on smoking applies equally in all population subgroups. The data we do have suggest that, at an individual level, direct associations between vaping and subsequent smoking may be more pronounced in males than females and in groups judged to have the lowest susceptibility to smoking at baseline.

### Efficacy of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^114N74ui]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data demonstrating effective smoking cessation with electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed (1946-March 2014) was performed using the search terms e-cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, and smoking cessation. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language clinical studies assessing efficacy of e-cigarettes compared with baseline, placebo, or other pharmacological methods to aid in withdrawal symptoms, smoking reduction, or cessation were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

A total of 6 clinical studies were included in the review. In small studies, e-cigarettes significantly decreased desire to smoke, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and exhaled carbon monoxide levels. Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and adverse effects were variable. The most common adverse effects were nausea, headache, cough, and mouth/throat irritation. Compared with nicotine patches, e-cigarettes were associated with fewer adverse effects and higher adherence. Most studies showed a significant decrease in cigarette use acutely; however, long-term cessation was not sustained at 6 months.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation; however, there may be a place in therapy to help modify smoking habits or reduce the number of cigarettes smoked. Studies available provided different administration patterns such as use while smoking, instead of smoking, or as needed. Short-term studies reviewed were small and did not necessarily evaluate cessation with a focus on parameters associated with cessation withdrawal symptoms. Though long-term safety is unknown, concerns regarding increased poisoning exposures among adults in comparison with cigarettes are alarming.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^111c2a5m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse and serious adverse events

Moderate‐certainty evidence does not show a difference in adverse events for nicotine EC compared to NRT, as well as for non‐nicotine EC. For all other outcomes in this category, evidence is of low or very low certainty. Imprecision remains a key issue for these outcomes, and particularly for SAEs. None of the analyses signalled serious harm, nor did complementary data from cohort studies but, unlike our cessation analyses, many of the CIs encompassed the possibility of both clinically significant harm and clinically significant benefit, and longer‐term health effects are unknown. This uncertainty should reduce as more studies become available.

Limitations of the review processes

We consider the review process we used to be robust. For outcome assessment, we followed the standard methods used for Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group cessation reviews. Our search strategy included CENTRAL, which incorporates findings from trial registries, and we were able to capture a number of ongoing studies. However, there may be unpublished data that our searches did not uncover. We also considered participants lost to follow‐up as continuing to smoke, which is standard practice in this field. There are concerns that frequently updating meta‐analyses can lead to issues with multiple testing; we followed Cochrane guidance in conducting this living systematic review and hence do not adjust for multiple testing.

Six of our review authors are authors of the included studies. These authors were not involved in the decisions about inclusion of their studies, or in risk of bias assessment for these studies; this approach is standard across all Cochrane reviews (regardless of subject area) and has been approved by the Cochrane editorial office as sufficient to avoid bias.

Our review includes studies funded by the tobacco/vaping industry – Cochrane guidelines (not tobacco addiction‐specific) mandate that studies be included regardless of funder, in order that the reviews remain transparent and rigorous. As noted throughout the results section, we removed studies with tobacco or vaping industry funding in sensitivity analyses; our conclusions were unchanged when we did this. This means that studies funded by tobacco or vaping industries did not influence our conclusions. We do not receive any funding from tobacco or vaping industries, and maintain a firm stance of independence.

### Efficacy and safety of E-cigarette use for smoking cessation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111pYBj2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

People who smoke conventional cigarettes are increasingly turning to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a pathway to quitting. However, the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation remains controversial.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), identified through a systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Inclusion was restricted to RCTs with a follow-up duration ≥ 6 months. The primary endpoint was the most rigorous criterion of biochemically validated abstinence at maximum follow-up, and the primary comparison was nicotine e-cigarettes versus any conventional (ie, non-e-cigarette) smoking cessation therapy. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess bias. Count data were pooled across trials using random-effects models with inverse variance weighting to estimate relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We registered the study protocol with the Open Science Framework Registries (osf.io/26fkq).

Results

A total of 5 RCTs (n = 3253) were included. Compared with conventional smoking cessation therapies, the use of nicotine e-cigarettes was associated with an increase in abstinence, defined by the most rigorous criterion of abstinence reported (RR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.29–2.44). Nicotine e-cigarettes also increased abstinence (defined by the most rigorous criterion) compared with non-nicotine e-cigarettes (RR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13–2.15). The incidence of death or serious adverse events was low across all trials at maximum follow-up.

Conclusions

Among individuals attempting to quit smoking, nicotine e-cigarettes are more efficacious than conventional nicotine replacement or behavioral smoking cessation therapies, and may prove beneficial in reducing smoking-related health risks.

### Longer-term use of electronic cigarettes when provided as a stop smoking aid: systematic review with meta-analyses [^113JgL7p]. Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Moderate certainty evidence supports use of nicotine electronic cigarettes to quit smoking combustible cigarettes. However, there is less certainty regarding how long people continue to use e-cigarettes after smoking cessation attempts. We set out to synthesise data on the proportion of people still using e-cigarettes or other study products at 6 months or longer in studies of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation. We updated Cochrane searches (November 2021). For the first time, we meta-analysed prevalence of continued e-cigarette use among individuals allocated to e-cigarette conditions, and among those individuals who had successfully quit smoking. We updated meta-analyses comparing proportions continuing product use among individuals allocated to use nicotine e-cigarettes and other treatments. We included 19 studies (n = 7787). The pooled prevalence of continued e-cigarette use at 6 months or longer was 54% (95% CI: 46% to 61%, I 2 86%, N = 1482) in participants assigned to e-cigarette conditions. Of participants who had quit combustible cigarettes overall 70% were still using e-cigarettes at six months or longer (95% CI: 53% to 82%, I 2 73%, N = 215). Heterogeneity in direction of effect precluded meta-analysis comparing long-term use of nicotine e-cigarettes with NRT. More people were using nicotine e-cigarettes at longest follow-up compared to non-nicotine e-cigarettes, but CIs included no difference (risk ratio 1.15, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.41, n = 601). The levels of continued e-cigarette use observed may reflect the success of e-cigarettes as a quitting tool. Further research is needed to establish drivers of variation in and implications of continued use of e-cigarettes.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^115qVXdU]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

2018 ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on tobacco cessation — team-based care and core clinical actions are specified as follows: The Decision Pathway recommends that clinicians and practices establish a team-based system of care that recognizes cigarette smoking as a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine, and the care team should ensure that patients are asked about cigarette smoking and other tobacco product use at all clinical encounters. Patients who use any tobacco product should receive clear advice to stop tobacco use and be offered a brief intervention that includes prescriptions for proven pharmacological smoking cessation aids and proactive connection to evidence-based behavioral support based in the healthcare system and/or the community. Former smokers, especially recent quitters, should be monitored closely for possible relapse back to smoking, and nonsmokers should routinely be asked about exposure to secondhand smoke and advised to avoid it.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^111P3cDm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices which produce an aerosol by heating an e-liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of using electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments and no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register to 1 February 2023, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 July 2023, and reference-checked and contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials in which people who smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention as these studies have the potential to provide further information on harms and longer-term use. Studies had to report an eligible outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in pairwise and network meta-analyses (NMA).

Main Results

We included 88 completed studies (10 new to this update), representing 27,235 participants, of which 47 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the included studies, we rated ten (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 58 at high risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There is high certainty that nicotine EC increases quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.93; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 2544 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6 more). There is moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs is similar between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 2052 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.60; I² = 32%; 6 studies, 2761 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that nicotine EC increases quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; I² = 4%; 6 studies, 1613 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 7 more). There is moderate-certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 1412 participants; low-certainty evidence). Due to issues with risk of bias, there is low-certainty evidence that, compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.25; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 5024 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I² = 41%, low-certainty evidence; 4 studies, 765 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.34; I² = 23%; 10 studies, 3263 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Results from the NMA were consistent with those from pairwise meta-analyses for all critical outcomes, and there was no indication of inconsistency within the networks. Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate-certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study design. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but the longest follow-up was two years and the number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this review is a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### The E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury epidemic: pathogenesis, management, and future directions: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114VwdJb]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Nicotine e-cigarettes and smoking cessation — "Some randomized clinical trials have shown higher quit rates using nicotine e-cigarettes than nicotine replacement medications, and nicotine e-cigarettes were found to be more acceptable to smokers", yet "Only four such studies were included in the 2021 Cochrane Review (34)". "Many of those who used nicotine e-cigarettes to stop smoking combustible tobacco continued to use nicotine e-cigarettes, and a meta-analysis… has concluded that use of e-cigarettes as a therapeutic intervention may lead to permanent nicotine dependence". "There is increasing evidence that dual use of combustible tobacco and e-cigarettes causes more adverse health effects than use of either alone". "No studies have been done comparing nicotine e-cigarettes to varenicline", and although "it may be possible but challenging to make nicotine e-cigarettes available to adult smokers while minimizing use by youth", approaches include "youth educational efforts around risks of e-cigarette use, flavor restrictions, restricting access (e.g., limiting sales to adult-only tobacco shops or access only through prescription by a medical doctor), and FDA regulation of nicotine e-cigarette marketing — focusing on adult smokers and completely switching from cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use".

### Is the use of electronic cigarettes while smoking associated with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and reduced cigarette consumption? A survey with a 1-year follow-up [^116u1nMM]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To use a unique longitudinal data set to assess the association between e‐cigarette use while smoking with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and substantial reduction, taking into account frequency of use and key potential confounders.

Design

Web‐based survey, baseline November/December 2012, 1‐year follow‐up in December 2013.

Setting

Great Britain.

Participants

National general population sample of 4064 adult smokers, with 1759 (43%) followed‐up.

Measurements

Main outcome measures were cessation attempt, cessation and substantial reduction (≥ 50% from baseline to follow‐up) of cigarettes per day (CPD). In logistic regression models, cessation attempt in the last year (analysis n = 1473) and smoking status (n = 1656) at follow‐up were regressed on to baseline e‐cigarette use (none, non‐daily, daily) while adjusting for baseline socio‐demographics, dependence and nicotine replacement (NRT) use. Substantial reduction (n = 1042) was regressed on to follow‐up e‐cigarette use while adjusting for baseline socio‐demographics and dependence and follow‐up NRT use.

Findings

Compared with non‐use, daily e‐cigarette use at baseline was associated with increased cessation attempts [odds ratio (OR) = 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.24–3.58, P = 0.006], but not with cessation at follow‐up (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.28–1.37, P = 0.24). Non‐daily use was not associated with cessation attempts or cessation. Daily e‐cigarette use at follow‐up was associated with increased odds of substantial reduction (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.14–5.45, P = 0.02), non‐daily use was not.

Conclusions

Daily use of e‐cigarettes while smoking appears to be associated with subsequent increases in rates of attempting to stop smoking and reducing smoking, but not with smoking cessation. Non‐daily use of e‐cigarettes while smoking does not appear to be associated with cessation attempts, cessation or reduced smoking.

### Interventions for quitting vaping [^114uxnxd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

There is currently limited guidance based on direct evidence on: how to stop vaping nicotine; the most effective ways to ensure long‐term vaping cessation; or minimising the risk of tobacco smoking relapse and other unintended effects of treatment. A systematic review of the evidence, including literature published to September 2021, concluded that very little interventional research had been conducted, precluding any conclusions on the benefits and harms of vaping cessation interventions. A more recent review of the literature carried out in 2023 and published in 2024 concluded that there was still little evidence on the best ways to support people to quit vaping, and that further studies were required. Vaping cessation is a growing area of research, with a number of trials completed in the last year and many more underway.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^115xpKcp]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Preventive Medicine practice statement — evidence on electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) indicates that a rapid review of the literature was performed through June 2017 to assess efficacy, patient-oriented harms, and population impact; on an individual level, limited evidence suggests that ENDS may be effective at reducing cigarette use among adult smokers intending to quit, but there is insufficient evidence addressing potential long-term harms of ENDS and limited evidence about short-term harms and the impact of secondhand exposure; although ENDS appear safer than combustible cigarettes, they are not without risk; among youth there is no known benefit and significant concern for harm; on a population level, there may be significant harms associated with ENDS, particularly among youth nonsmokers; and the long-term balance of potential benefits versus harms from the individual and population perspectives are unclear.

### Interventions for quitting vaping [^111Je9XK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Vapes or electronic cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that produce an aerosol by heating an e‐liquid. The e‐liquid, usually comprising propylene glycol (a synthetic liquid substance that absorbs water) and/or glycerol (a naturally occurring alcohol), with or without nicotine and flavours, is stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir or 'pod'. Nicotine‐containing vapes or electronic cigarettes are considered less harmful to health than tobacco cigarettes, and in some countries are endorsed as smoking cessation aids. However, there are concerns about their potential harm to health if used long‐term by people who stopped smoking a long time ago or by people who have never smoked, with particular concerns relating to young people. Young people who take up nicotine vaping who have never smoked may develop a dependence on nicotine, which has led to concerns that they may be more likely to try other more harmful nicotine‐containing products, such as combustible tobacco cigarettes. We do not yet have any evidence on the long‐term harms of nicotine vaping in the absence of a tobacco smoking history; therefore, potential health harms of vaping itself are an additional, as yet unquantified, concern. Even if modest in comparison to smoking tobacco, it is unlikely that vaping nicotine will be completely risk or harm free. Consequently, there are clear reasons to support people to stop nicotine vaping. There are also various reasons that people (of any age) who have used vapes for tobacco smoking cessation may ultimately want to stop using them. Commonly cited reasons include cost, concerns around health, perceptions of friends and family, concerns about dependence on nicotine, and stigma. However, as nicotine is an addictive substance, and advancements in vaping technology make it increasingly effective at delivering nicotine to the brain, it may not be easy for people to discontinue use. In addition, people who have used vapes to stop smoking need to ensure that they are no longer at risk of relapsing to smoking if they stop using vapes. Where nicotine vaping is supported as a smoking cessation aid, there is a growing awareness that support to stop using vapes may be needed once people have fully stopped smoking.

### Electronic cigarettes and their impact on allergic respiratory diseases: a work group report of the AAAAI environmental exposures and respiratory health committee [^115RgTHv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). High credibility.

Electronic cigarettes as smoking cessation tools — regulatory status, observational data, and a randomized trial are summarized. E-cig devices are not currently approved as a cessation device by the US FDA. Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health data indicate increased probability of sustained abstinence and greater likelihood of quitting or reducing combustible cigarettes among daily e-cig users compared with nonusers, and many former smokers (7.6%) reported using e-cigs. A Cochrane review concluded there was evidence that e-cigs improved smoking cessation long-term versus placebo, with less effect than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), though evidence quality was low, and e-cigs helped smokers cut back more than placebo or NRT. In a randomized study of 800 adults, sustained abstinence from combustible cigarettes was higher with e-cigs versus NRT (18% vs 9.9%, adjusted relative risk: 1.75 [1.24–2.46]); among those not fully abstinent, a biochemically confirmed 50% or greater reduction in cigarette consumption favored e-cigs (12.8% vs 7.4%, relative risk: 1.73 [1.11–2.69]); however, among those with 1-year abstinence, 80% were still using e-cigs at 52 weeks compared with 9% still using NRT. The page notes that the data suggest e-cig use primarily promotes switching between nicotine delivery forms and that manufacturers state their products are intended as switching products, not cessation products for nicotine addiction.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^111aEmQ6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Electronic cigarettes (EC) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if EC can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review update was conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of EC for helping people who smoke tobacco achieve long‐term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non‐nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 March 2025, reference‐checked, and contacted study authors.

Eligibility criteria

We included trials randomising people who smoked to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies where all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to measure an eligible outcome.

Outcomes

Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer‐term EC use.

Risk of bias

We used the RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias for each study and GRADE to assess evidence certainty.

Synthesis methods

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Where appropriate, we pooled data using random‐effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences with 95% CIs.

Included studies

We included 104 completed studies (14 new to this update), representing 30,366 participants, of which 61 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We rated 11 included studies as being at low risk of bias, 70 at high risk (including all non‐randomised studies), and the remainder at unclear risk overall.

Synthesis of results

Nicotine EC result in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high‐certainty evidence) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.88; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 2703 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate‐certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37; I² = 58%; 7 studies, 2241 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.03; I² = 30%; 8 studies, 2950 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Nicotine EC probably result in increased quit rates compared to non‐nicotine EC (moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1918 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 4 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate‐certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1717 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Compared to behavioural support only or no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomised to nicotine EC (low‐certainty evidence due to risk of bias) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.25; I² = 13%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non‐serious) AEs may be more common in people randomised to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.55; I² = 66%; 8 studies, 2485 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain and, again, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.29; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 4716 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Data from non‐randomised studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' conclusions

There is high‐certainty evidence that nicotine EC increase quit rates compared to NRT, and moderate‐certainty evidence that they probably increase quit rates compared to EC without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with behavioural support or no support also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study designs. CIs were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence of a difference in AEs between nicotine and non‐nicotine EC nor between nicotine EC and NRT, but low‐certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger trials are needed to fully evaluate safety. Included studies tested regulated nicotine‐containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles.

The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision for some comparisons and for safety outcomes due to the relatively small number of RCTs contributing, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up‐to‐date information to decision‐makers, this is a living systematic review. We run and screen searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### E-cigarette use and associated changes in population smoking cessation: evidence from US current population surveys [^115STbSe]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Current regulatory policies on electronic cigarettes vary widely across countries. The United Kingdom provides a path for licensing e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid if they can pass safety standards and deliver nicotine like existing nicotine replacement therapy. In contrast, Australia bans the sale of e-cigarettes containing nicotine.US policy falls somewhere between. If there is no claim that e-cigarettes are a smoking cessation aid, they are treated as recreational products and regulated by the Tobacco Product Center of the Food and Drug Administration. Most manufacturers of e-cigarettes avoid making explicit claims on cessation benefits. Thus e-cigarettes are currently sold in the US with minor restrictions, as the most recent FDA rulings on e-cigarettes give grace periods for implementation of many components.

The scientific community is also divided in its opinion of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid. The debate is not as much about the potential efficacy of e-cigarettes for individual users as it is about the overall population impact. A recent Cochrane review suggests that e-cigarettes have a similar effect as nicotine replacement therapy for individual smokers who use them. Thus e-cigarettes will have a positive impact on the population cessation rate if they function as a nicotine replacement therapy and if they increase the total proportion of smokers using nicotine replacement products. Others argue the overall impact of e-cigarettes on smoking in adults will be negative, even if they help some individuals to quit smoking. The reason is that smokers who use e-cigarettes often use them occasionally, along with cigarettes. Such dual use could lessen the urgency to quit smoking, delaying the cessation process. If this is true, then the positive effect of e-cigarettes on some will be offset by the negative effect on many others, rendering the overall population impact as negative.

### Is the use of electronic cigarettes while smoking associated with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and reduced cigarette consumption? A survey with a 1-year follow-up [^115UBwqt]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

The use of NRT while smoking is supported as a harm reduction approach by national guidance in the United Kingdom 24. It reduces tobacco harm not only by increasing cessation and reducing consumption but also by reducing the amount of nicotine taken in from each cigarette 25, which is likely to be accompanied by a reduction in intake of toxins 26, 27. Although it remains to be tested, it appears possible that the use of e‐cigarettes while smoking similarly reduces intake from each cigarette, thus supporting tobacco harm reduction. Although long‐term data on safety of e‐cigarettes are not yet available, toxicology testing suggests that they will be considerably safer than tobacco cigarettes 28, although they may be less safe than NRT, which is licensed as medicine.

Smoking cessation rates in England were higher in 2014 than in previous years. Generally, cessation rates in a population can be increased by encouraging as many smokers as possible to make quit attempts and to use the most effective support in each of these attempts. The current data indicate that e‐cigarettes were associated with more smokers attempting to stop smoking. We found no evidence that e‐cigarette use while smoking increased subsequent smoking cessation. This is in line with previous findings 9, 15, 16, although in one recent study intense long‐term use was associated with increased cessation 17. The present analyses extend the evidence by assessing use prospectively, thus avoiding confounding with quit attempts (otherwise e‐cigarette use may be mainly a marker of having made a quit attempt) and by assessing quit attempts, cessation and reduction separately. Further research on the link between smoking cessation rates and e‐cigarette use is warranted.

### Interventions for tobacco smoking cessation in adults, including pregnant persons: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113gVFLz]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

National Academies report on e-cigarettes — youth risks and toxicant exposure — In youth and young adults, there is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever using combustible tobacco and moderate evidence that it increases the frequency and intensity of subsequent cigarette smoking. The report also found conclusive evidence that e-cigarettes contain and emit potentially toxic substances, although substantial evidence shows that other than nicotine, there is significantly lower exposure to potentially toxic substances from e-cigarettes compared with combustible tobacco cigarettes.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^112TA8um]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Electronic cigarettes — regulatory authority and long-term risk evidence indicate that "In August 2016, the FDA gained regulatory authority over e-cigarettes, allowing it to enforce laws preventing the sale of e-cigarettes to persons under the age of 18 years, ban provision of free product samples, and regulate the labeling and content of e-cigarettes". A "2018 systematic evidence review" by NASEM concluded evidence is "insufficient to allow reliable conclusions" on long-term health effects, yet "such risks could be less than those associated with smoking, because toxicants and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke are absent or present at much lower concentrations in e-cigarette aerosols". The text adds potential benefits for quitting must be balanced against "long-term health risks, which are largely unknown at this time".

### Is there A role for electronic cigarettes in tobacco cessation? [^112Emoun]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

An additional justification for advocating continued availability of e‐cigarettes is the claim that e‐cigarettes assist chronic smokers in quitting combustible cigarettes and potentially other tobacco products. Several randomized and observational studies have been conducted to address this issue; however, no clear consensus has emerged. The results of early trials comparing e‐cigarettes with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) were inconclusive because of small sample size, low acceptability of first‐generation e‐cigarettes, and issues related to specific study designs. Nonetheless, a recent report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is limited evidence to support the notion that e‐cigarettes help people stop smoking because the current evidence was insufficient to assess the effectiveness of e‐cigarettes as a smoking‐cessation aid. 7

Whether e‐cigarettes facilitate quitting has also been examined in several observational studies. A 2014 Eurobarometer survey of 28 European countries found that e‐cigarette use was associated with inhibiting rather than assisting with smoking cessation. 8 Similarly, in a study of 1357 hospitalized adult cigarette smokers who planned to stop smoking and received counseling in the hospital, the use of e‐cigarettes was associated with less tobacco abstinence at 6‐month follow‐up than attempted abstinence without the use of e‐cigarettes. 9 Likewise, in a population‐based prospective cohort study of 1284 US adult smokers, the use of e‐cigarettes did not help adult smokers quit at rates higher than smokers who did not use these products, 10 suggesting that the use of e‐cigarettes in real‐world situations is not effective in decreasing smoking or promoting tobacco cessation. Indeed, it has been suggested that using e‐cigarettes may make it more difficult to quit smoking combustible cigarettes. 11 This suggestion was based on a systematic analysis of 38 studies reporting e‐cigarette use and smoking cessation in real‐world and clinical settings, in which the authors found that the odds of quitting cigarettes were 28% lower for those who used e‐cigarettes compared with those who did not use e‐cigarettes. 11 In contrast, other studies have suggested e‐cigarettes may be beneficial in assisting quitting. A study of a cohort of young adults (n = 1263, aged 19–23) surveyed over 4 years found that the use of e‐cigarettes was associated with reduced smoking in highly nicotine‐dependent, young adult cigarette smokers. 12 Our analysis of the PATH (Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health) data set (n = 5832) 13 indicated that those who used e‐cigarettes to quit combustible cigarettes had an increased probability of persistent cigarette abstinence and that daily e‐cigarette users were more likely to quit smoking or reduce their use of combustible cigarettes compared with nonusers. However, this proportion of individuals was relatively small, and less frequent e‐cigarette use was not associated with combustible cigarette cessation.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^11765tkn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are electronic devices that heat a liquid into an aerosol for inhalation. The liquid usually comprises propylene glycol and glycerol, with or without nicotine and flavours, and stored in disposable or refillable cartridges or a reservoir. Since ECs appeared on the market in 2006 there has been a steady growth in sales. Smokers report using ECs to reduce risks of smoking, but some healthcare organizations, tobacco control advocacy groups and policy makers have been reluctant to encourage smokers to switch to ECs, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. Smokers, healthcare providers and regulators are interested to know if these devices can help smokers quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review is an update of a review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and effect of using ECs to help people who smoke achieve long-term smoking abstinence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant records from 2004 to January 2016, together with reference checking and contact with study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which current smokers (motivated or unmotivated to quit) were randomized to EC or a control condition, and which measured abstinence rates at six months or longer. As the field of EC research is new, we also included cohort follow-up studies with at least six months follow-up. We included randomized cross-over trials, RCTs and cohort follow-up studies that included at least one week of EC use for assessment of adverse events (AEs).

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, and we used the most rigorous definition available (continuous, biochemically validated, longest follow-up). We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study, and where appropriate we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses.

Main Results

Our searches identified over 1700 records, from which we include 24 completed studies (three RCTs, two of which were eligible for our cessation meta-analysis, and 21 cohort studies). Eleven of these studies are new for this version of the review. We identified 27 ongoing studies. Two RCTs compared EC with placebo (non-nicotine) EC, with a combined sample size of 662 participants. One trial included minimal telephone support and one recruited smokers not intending to quit, and both used early EC models with low nicotine content and poor battery life. We judged the RCTs to be at low risk of bias, but under the GRADE system we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our outcomes as 'low' or 'very low', because of imprecision due to the small number of trials. A 'low' grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate. Participants using an EC were more likely to have abstained from smoking for at least six months compared with participants using placebo EC (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96; placebo 4% versus EC 9%; 2 studies; 662 participants. GRADE: low). The one study that compared EC to nicotine patch found no significant difference in six-month abstinence rates, but the confidence intervals do not rule out a clinically important difference (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.34; 584 participants. GRADE: very low). Of the included studies, none reported serious adverse events considered related to EC use. The most frequently reported AEs were mouth and throat irritation, most commonly dissipating over time. One RCT provided data on the proportion of participants experiencing any adverse events. The proportion of participants in the study arms experiencing adverse events was similar (ECs vs placebo EC: RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.34 (298 participants); ECs vs patch: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.22 (456 participants)). The second RCT reported no statistically significant difference in the frequency of AEs at three- or 12-month follow-up between the EC and placebo EC groups, and showed that in all groups the frequency of AEs (with the exception of throat irritation) decreased significantly over time.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from two trials that ECs help smokers to stop smoking in the long term compared with placebo ECs. However, the small number of trials, low event rates and wide confidence intervals around the estimates mean that our confidence in the result is rated 'low' by GRADE standards. The lack of difference between the effect of ECs compared with nicotine patches found in one trial is uncertain for similar reasons. None of the included studies (short- to mid-term, up to two years) detected serious adverse events considered possibly related to EC use. The most commonly reported adverse effects were irritation of the mouth and throat. The long-term safety of ECs is unknown. In this update, we found a further 15 ongoing RCTs which appear eligible for this review.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^115ky2Ae]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) clinical positioning in adult cessation notes that at the individual level, the benefit/harm balance may weigh in favor of ENDS compared to no treatment for tobacco cessation in a very specific population of adult smokers who are trying to quit, based on limited evidence and a harm reduction approach if they are able to reduce use of combustible cigarettes through use of ENDS. There are other effective, evidence-based methods for smoking cessation; therefore, ENDS would only be appropriate in those unwilling to try or who have failed evidence-based smoking-cessation therapies and are interested in trying ENDS.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^111vnn83]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices which produce an aerosol formed by heating an e-liquid. People who smoke report using ECs to stop or reduce smoking, but some organisations, advocacy groups and policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review is an update of a review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect and safety of using electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke achieve long-term smoking abstinence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO for relevant records to January 2020, together with reference-checking and contact with study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross-over trials in which people who smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. To be included, studies had to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or longer and/or data on adverse events (AEs) or other markers of safety at one week or longer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included changes in carbon monoxide, blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels of known carcinogens/toxicants. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data from these studies in meta-analyses.

Main Results

We include 50 completed studies, representing 12,430 participants, of which 26 are RCTs. Thirty-five of the 50 included studies are new to this review update. Of the included studies, we rated four (all which contribute to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 37 at high risk overall (including the 24 non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 2.27; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1498 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four successful quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 8). There was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious imprecision) of no difference in the rate of adverse events (AEs) (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 485 participants). SAEs occurred rarely, with no evidence that their frequency differed between nicotine EC and NRT, but very serious imprecision led to low certainty in this finding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.41: I² = n/a; 2 studies, 727 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.92; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 802 participants). In absolute terms, this might again lead to an additional four successful quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 12). These trials used EC with relatively low nicotine delivery. There was low-certainty evidence, limited by very serious imprecision, that there was no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.36; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 346 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.19; I² = n/a; 4 studies, 494 participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.50, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.04; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 2312 participants). In absolute terms this represents an increase of six per 100 (95% CI 1 to 14). However, this finding was very low-certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was no evidence that the rate of SAEs varied, but some evidence that non-serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (AEs: RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.31; I² = 28%; 3 studies, 516 participants; SAEs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.25 to 6.96; I² = 17%; 5 studies, 842 participants). Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate over time with continued use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons and hence evidence for these is limited, with confidence intervals often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine and compared to NRT. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the degree of effect, particularly when using modern EC products. Confidence intervals were wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect any clear evidence of harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two years and the overall number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information for decision-makers, this review is now a living systematic review. We will run searches monthly from December 2020, with the review updated as relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### Smoking cessation [^112Qw6Pk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and its harms are well established. Physicians have more evidence-based resources than ever before to effectively treat smoking, including new uses and combinations of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacotherapies and expanded community programs. In addition, electronic nicotine delivery systems are potential treatment tools, but their safety and efficacy need to be established. Finally, high-priority groups, such as persons with cancer diagnoses or hospitalized patients, may benefit from particular attention to their tobacco use.

### Electronic cigarettes and subsequent cigarette smoking in young people: a systematic review [^114Derrq]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Although relatively few studies investigated the effect of EC on smoking cessation or reduction, this is the one area in which randomization to ECs may be judged appropriate — there is now a strong body of evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that giving ECs to adult tobacco smokers can help them quit smoking. Most of these studies to date have not been restricted to young people, therefore, are not eligible for our review, but conceivably such a study could be conducted in the future (one study testing e‐cigarettes for smoking reduction in young people is currently underway). Most other outcomes considered in this review would be unsuitable for a randomized trial design, because it would be unethical to randomize non‐smoking young people to start vaping.

Conducting this review posed many challenges. As it investigates an exposure as opposed to an intervention, in some cases we could not follow standard Cochrane methods, and the varied study designs included eventually precluded this review from being published as a Cochrane review, as was originally intended. This particularly applies to coding of outcome data, and to risk of bias assessment — there was no agreed tool for assessing risk of bias in reviews of exposures when we started this review, and hence, we adapted an external tool that was recommended by Cochrane. A different tool may have yielded different results, particularly for our population‐level studies. However, even if we had used a different risk of bias tool, our findings on effect direction would be unchanged and certainty would still be limited by the fact these were observational studies, and in some cases, unexplained heterogeneity was present.

The lack of pre‐registration as a norm for observational and quasi‐experimental studies also means we are unable to rule out publication bias. We tried to mitigate this by searching grey literature and contacting experts in the field. We may have also missed some relevant studies published in economics journals — we know of two missed because of indexing in economic journals not being as consistent as that for traditional medical journals (these two has been incorporated, but there may be others). Nonetheless, our search strategy followed Cochrane best practice for medical research.

Several studies used data that originated from the same surveys, so there may have been partial overlap in the individuals and time periods that made up the datasets used in these studies. It is possible that this may have made some study results more similar than would have been the case if they had all used fully independent data sources.

### Electronic cigarettes in north America: history, use, and implications for smoking cessation [^1135RYzC]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Designed to mimic the look and feel of tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may facilitate smoking cessation. However, the efficacy and safety of e-cigarette use for this purpose remain poorly understood. Our objectives were to review the available data on the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and to consider issues relevant to the context in which they are used, including product awareness and regulatory and ethical concerns.

Methods and Results

We systematically searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled, experimental studies involving e-cigarettes. Included studies were limited to English or French language reports. Quality assessment was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We identified 169 publications, of which 7 studies were included. Studies have concluded that e-cigarettes can help reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and may be as effective for smoking cessation as the nicotine patch. Although there is a lack of data concerning the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation therapy, available evidence showed no significant difference in adverse event rates between e-cigarettes and the nicotine patch. E-cigarettes are widely used among smokers attempting to quit. However, significant international variation remains in the regulatory mechanisms governing the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. Ethical concerns surround the use of e-cigarettes among minors and their potential to undermine efforts to reduce cigarette smoking.

Conclusion

Given the limited available evidence on the risks and benefits of e-cigarette use, large, randomized, controlled trials are urgently needed to definitively establish their potential for smoking cessation.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^116ofSnz]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) practice statement — tobacco cessation and harm reduction states that clinicians should advise patients that ENDS are not considered evidence-based smoking-cessation therapy; if patients have refused or failed these treatments and are more willing to try ENDS as a harm reduction or nicotine-cessation approach than a first-line evidence-based strategy, clinicians should use a shared decision-making approach and address limited short-term evidence, lack of long-term efficacy or harms, current lack of regulation, and rare but serious harms including burns, explosions, and childhood poisonings, and clinicians should monitor for effectiveness and any adverse effects (B (NASEM conclusions 17–1, 2, 3, 4)). Clinicians should counsel patients about the inconsistent nicotine content of liquids, the possibility that flavorings may sometimes include toxic components, unreliable labeling, and significant variations in drug delivery associated with ENDS devices that limit the expected efficacy of ENDS as a smoking-cessation measure and possibly could result in harm, and clinicians should advise pregnant women who smoke cigarettes to use evidence-based treatments rather than recommending ENDS.

Electronic cigarettes — device and flavoring safety and harm reduction notes from NASEM include that it "noted other safety concerns with e-cigarette devices, such as defective batteries causing explosion and injuries as well as risks of accidental or intentional exposure due to ingestion of or contact with the e-liquids". It further states that certain flavorings "may pose a health hazard and should be avoided". NASEM concluded that "completely switching from combustible tobacco products to e-cigarettes should reduce short-term adverse health effects of continued smoking", yet "the report found far less evidence that dual use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes".

### Electronic cigarettes: a pro-con review of the current literature [^114y1nFz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cigs, or electronic nicotine delivery systems) are battery-operated devices typically containing glycerol and/or propylene glycol-based solutions with varying nicotine content, known as e-liquids. Although e-cigarettes were originally developed as a potentially less harmful alternative to traditional combustible tobacco cigarette smokers, several factors have driven their popularity among smokers and nonsmokers alike, including their sleek product designs, innumerable appealing flavors, lack of combustible smoke and odor, and high potential nicotine concentrations. Furthermore, many advocates have promoted the idea that e-cigarettes are safe to use, or at least safer than conventional tobacco, despite limited longitudinal data to support these claims. Here, we examine what is known about the impacts of e-cigarette use on traditional cigarette smoking cessation, lung health, and youth and young adult tobacco product exposure. Upon review of the currently available literature, the negative effects of e-cigarette use seem to outweigh any potential benefit, because the available evidence does not confirm the use of e-cigarettes as an effective strategy for supporting traditional combustible tobacco cigarette smoking cessation, particularly given the emerging adverse effects on lung health and the potential future public health effects of e-cigarette adoption among a burgeoning new generation of tobacco product users.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^116eFuCm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes — committee opinions on use as a cessation aid indicate that committee members had a range of opinions about the use of e-cigarettes as a cessation aid, reflecting differing interpretations of the limited evidence; some felt e-cigarettes are associated with less short-term harm than combustible cigarettes and may be of benefit for smokers who have been unable to quit after multiple attempts using FDA-approved medications and behavioral support or for smokers unwilling to quit but seeking to reduce tobacco-related harms; in these situations, e-cigarette use is likely to minimize risk if smokers switched completely to e-cigarettes, avoided dual use, and used e-cigarettes temporarily as an aid to cessation of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes; other members felt that limited evidence of benefit and insufficient evidence regarding long-term health effects outweighed any potential benefits at this time.

### Biomarkers of potential harm in people switching from smoking tobacco to exclusive e-cigarette use, dual use or abstinence: secondary analysis of cochrane systematic review of trials of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation [^113FaNjE]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Scientific consensus overwhelmingly holds that nicotine electronic cigarettes (ECs), although not risk‐free, are considerably lower risk than combustible tobacco, as they provide a means to inhale nicotine without combustion. However, uncertainty persists around the health impacts in people who smoke who switch to EC completely, or who both smoke and use ECs (dual users). Without long‐term safety data, biomarkers of potential harm are often used to inform best estimates about relative benefits and harms of ECs compared to combustible tobacco. Biomarkers of potential harm include exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO), known carcinogens and other toxicants identified by regulatory bodies.

Our Cochrane living systematic review of ECs for smoking cessation evaluates changes in biomarkers between groups randomized using an intention‐to‐treat principle. This means that we compare differences in biomarkers of harm between those randomized to an EC condition and those randomized to a control condition. This follows standard Cochrane methods and is a pragmatic approach which best reflects the effects of such interventions delivered in real life. However, as with all smoking cessation trials, most people in these studies do not quit smoking successfully. In the EC condition, some participants will not use EC, and many will continue to use combustible cigarettes. In the control condition, some participants will use EC of their own accord. Most will also continue to use combustible cigarettes.

Although it is important to analyse the impact of the randomized interventions by group, there is also value in knowing how biomarkers of harm change based on participants' actual behaviour. Such analyses can inform debates concerning potential harms and benefits of dual use. They can also illustrate the changes that someone who smokes might expect to see if they switched completely to ECs or commenced dual use. Therefore, in this secondary analysis of trials included in our Cochrane review, we set out to compare biomarkers of potential harm between four groups, based on actual product use rather than group assignment: those switching completely to ECs, those not using EC and continuing to smoke combustible cigarettes (CC), those using both EC and CC (dual use) and those using neither (abstainers).

### Electronic cigarettes as smoking cessation tool: are we there? [^116HeQrU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is rapidly increasing, with many users reporting trying e-cigarettes as a method to quit combustible cigarettes. This review highlights recently published studies assessing the use of e-cigarettes as a tool for cessation of combustible cigarettes.

Recent Findings

When evaluating data from four randomized controlled trials and multiple cohort studies, differential association between e-cigarette use and cessation rates was seen. Cessation rates are highest in UK cohort studies and in studies using a multifaceted approach, such as with the addition of varenicline. The largest evidence base is derived from observational cohort studies. Overall, the current evidence remains too small for conclusive results regarding efficacy of e-cigarettes for combustible cessation. There does appear to be a consistent reduction in daily combustible cigarette use in regular e-cigarette users.

Summary

Currently, there are conflicting data which can be used to support or dismiss e-cigarettes as a tool for smoking cessation. As larger population-based studies become available, the potential harms and benefits of e-cigarettes will become clearer. In the short term, shared decision-making with combustible cigarette users will be imperative when considering e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^114qjvcc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating an e-liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of using EC to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 February 2024 and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register to 1 February 2023, reference-checked, and contacted study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials randomizing people who smoke to an EC or control condition. We included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report an eligible outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We used the risk of bias tool (RoB 1) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in pairwise and network meta-analyses (NMA).

Main Results

We included 90 completed studies (two new to this update), representing 29,044 participants, of which 49 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the included studies, we rated 10 (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 61 at high risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. Nicotine EC results in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.93; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 2544 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 6 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 2052 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.60; I² = 32%; 6 studies, 2761 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nicotine EC probably results in increased quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96; I² = 4%; 6 studies, 1613 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 7 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate-certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.79; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 1412 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (low-certainty evidence due to issues with risk of bias) (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.32; I² = 0%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional four quitters per 100 (95% CI 3 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.27; I² = 6%; low-certainty evidence; 6 studies, 2351 participants) and, again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28; I² = 0%; 12 studies, 4561 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Results from the NMA were consistent with those from pairwise meta-analyses for all critical outcomes. There was inconsistency in the AE network, which was explained by a single outlying study contributing the only direct evidence for one of the nodes. Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate-certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care or no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study design. Confidence intervals were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence for a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger studies are needed to fully evaluate EC safety. Our included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### E-cigarette characteristics and cigarette cessation among adults… [^112Zk2gU]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Daily vs nondaily e-cigarette use was associated with greater overall cigarette discontinuation rates for adults who used e-cigarettes daily compared with 6. 1% for those who used e-cigarettes nondaily. This cohort study's nationally representative findings show that daily use of e-cigarettes compared with nondaily use of e-cigarettes was consistently associated with greater cigarette cessation rates among adults who used e-cigarettes and attempted to quit smoking and with greater overall cigarette discontinuation rates, consistent with prior literature, 2–4 although daily use of e-cigarettes was uncommon.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^113GVNyU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The AEs described in both the RCT and cohort studies continue to look similar, regardless of the brand of EC used or nicotine content, with placebo and nicotine‐containing EC showing similar numbers and types of AEs in direct comparisons. They also reflect what is reported in survey data.

The structure of our analyses follows the standard practice of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group, i.e. evaluating outcomes on an intention‐to‐treat basis, meaning our pooled results represent the effect of offering an EC intervention. This is different from evaluating the per‐protocol effect, or the effect only on those who use the EC to quit smoking entirely, or continue to smoke whilst also using EC. Although pragmatic and hopefully of use to those designing and delivering interventions, we acknowledge that our intention‐to‐treat approach limits the ability to use the data presented here to draw conclusions about biomarkers in subgroups of participants based on subsequent EC use/smoking profiles. A companion publication, up to date to January 2022, attempts to address this deficit.

Cessation

All three comparisons found effect estimates favouring nicotine EC for smoking cessation. For nicotine EC versus NRT, we continue to judge the evidence to be of high certainty, meaning we are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect. For nicotine EC versus non‐nicotine EC, we continue to judge the evidence to be of moderate certainty, meaning we think the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect. For nicotine EC versus behavioural support only/no support, we continue to judge the evidence to be of low certainty, meaning we have limited confidence in the effect estimate. Nicotine EC versus non‐nicotine EC comparisons isolate the effect of nicotine as provided by an EC, and nicotine EC versus NRT comparisons isolate the effect of the sensorimotor elements provided by an EC. Both of these comparisons find a benefit of nicotine EC for smoking cessation. Therefore, it might logically follow that the comparison between nicotine EC and behavioural support only/no support would find a benefit in favour of nicotine EC, since this comparison would capture both pharmacological and sensorimotor mechanisms of effect. This increases our confidence in the effect of nicotine EC when compared to behavioural support alone or to no support. NRT has also been shown to be more effective than behavioural support alone, further supporting the likelihood that nicotine EC would be more effective than behavioural support alone.

Adverse and serious adverse events

We have moderate certainty of no evidence of a difference in adverse events for nicotine EC compared to NRT as well as for non‐nicotine EC. For all other outcomes in this category, evidence is of low or very low certainty. Imprecision remains a key issue for these outcomes, and particularly for SAEs. None of the analyses signalled serious harm, nor did complementary data from cohort studies but, unlike our cessation analyses, many of the confidence intervals encompassed the possibility of both clinically significant harm and clinically significant benefit. This uncertainty should reduce as more studies become available.

Quality of the evidence

We consider the certainty of the evidence as it relates to primary outcomes for our three main comparisons: nicotine EC versus NRT; nicotine EC versus non‐nicotine EC; nicotine EC versus behavioural support only/no support (Table 1; Table 2; Table 3). The certainty of evidence for all other comparisons and outcomes should be considered very low due to a paucity of data and issues with risk of bias.

Our summary of findings tables and assessments of certainty are based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The cohort studies that we include are all deemed to have high risks of bias, which is inherent in the study design. Data presented from these studies need to be interpreted with caution. However, data from cohort studies were reassuringly consistent with data from RCTs.

Risk of bias did not impact on the certainty of evidence for comparisons between nicotine and non‐nicotine EC, or between nicotine EC and NRT. For the latter, we judged all seven studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias overall. For the former, removing one study at high risk of bias increased the effect estimate for our efficacy outcome. Risk of bias decreased our certainty in the effect estimates for our nicotine EC versus behavioural support only/no support comparison as, due to the nature of the comparison, blinding was not possible and different levels of support could lead to bias.

All but three of our primary outcomes for our main comparisons were downgraded for imprecision, due to wide confidence intervals and few events. Other than the risk of bias and imprecision, we identified no other issues that decreased the certainty of the primary outcomes for our main comparisons.

### E-cigarette initiation and associated changes in smoking cessation and reduction: the population assessment of tobacco and health study, 2013–2015 [^115SBzAU]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the USA. The prevalence of cigarette smoking in the USA has declined considerably since the first Surgeon General's report (from 42.4% in 1964 to 15.1% in 2015), but smoking remains responsible for more than 400 000 deaths each year.

A large body of evidence demonstrates the benefits of cigarette smoking cessation. Adults who quit smoking gain 6–10 years of life compared with those who continue to smoke, and quitting before the age of 40 years decreases mortality risk by approximately 90%. In 2015, 57.2% of adult smokers in the USA were advised to quit smoking by a doctor or health professional. Although the majority of smokers appear to be aware of the health benefits associated with smoking cessation, fewer than one in ten smokers successfully quit over the prior year.

The prevalence of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use has risen in recent years since e-cigarettes entered the market in 2007. Evidence on the efficacy of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids remains limited and inconclusive. Pooled analysis of two randomised controlled trials indicated that participants assigned to nicotine-containing e-cigarettes had 2.29 times the odds of 6-month cigarette cessation compared with the placebo group. Several cross-sectional studies, longitudinal analysesand meta-analyseshave also shown an association between e-cigarette use and increased quit attempts and successes. However, other studies, including a systematic review and meta-analysis, have raised doubts about the efficacy of e-cigarettes as cessation/reduction aids for smokersand highlighted that e-cigarettes may not be a satisfying alternative to regular cigarettes. Furthermore, prior studies have shown dual product use is common, indicating e-cigarettes may be used as a complement rather than substitute to cigarette smoking.

Prior studies investigating the role of e-cigarette use in cigarette cessation/reduction have largely relied on the analysis of non-representative samples, limiting the ability to generalise results to the population at large. Our study aims to estimate how the uptake of e-cigarettes is associated with cigarette cessation and changes in cigarette smoking intensity in adults in the USA.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^111UwmLo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

This Cochrane review aligns with but updates the conclusions of the 2018 US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Consensus Study Report, Public Health Consequences of E‐cigarettes (NASEM 2018), which reviewed literature published through August 2017 to address the question, "Do e‐cigarettes help smokers quit smoking combustible tobacco cigarettes?". Focusing on RCTs and existing systematic reviews, it used a prespecified 'Level of Evidence' framework to develop conclusions. The report's overall conclusion was that there was "limited evidence that e‐cigarettes may be effective aids to promote smoking cessation". Based on the RCTs available, it concluded that there was "moderate evidence" that e‐cigarettes containing nicotine were more effective for cessation than e‐cigarettes without nicotine, but "insufficient evidence" about the effectiveness of e‐cigarettes compared to no treatment or to FDA‐approved smoking cessation treatments. Our review differs on this latter point, as we find high‐certainty evidence of benefit when comparing nicotine EC with NRT; this is due to the inclusion of studies published after NASEM 2018. Reviews from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (formerly Public Health England) conclude that, compared to their 2018 review, there is now stronger evidence that nicotine vaping products are effective for smoking cessation (McNeill 2021; McNeill 2022).

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^1111VBen]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

E-cigarettes — clinician counseling points and safety advice (Table 10) emphasize to smokers the importance of the goal of complete cessation of all combustible tobacco products and Recommend that smokers use evidence-based, FDA-approved smoking cessation aids, which are known to be safe and effective, while Clinicians should be prepared to discuss the evidence about e-cigarettes' risks and benefits with patients who ask about them; counseling should note that e-cigarettes expose the user to fewer and lower levels of toxic compounds than smoking a cigarette does, that if used as a complete substitute they are expected to be less harmful in the short-term but their long-term safety is uncertain, that they are not currently approved by the FDA as safe and effective cessation aids, and that products vary considerably in design and nicotine and toxicant delivery; if a smoker chooses to use e-cigarettes, advise switching completely and avoiding dual use, set the eventual goal of cessation of e-cigarettes as well as combustible cigarettes with a plan to taper off e-cigarettes after stopping combustible tobacco, and reinforce device safety including child-proof packaging, following maintenance and battery recharging and storage instructions to minimize the risk of explosion, and avoiding use around children.

### Is the use of electronic cigarettes while smoking associated with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and reduced cigarette consumption? A survey with a 1-year follow-up [^111ZQAjo]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Importantly, the current sample used e‐cigarettes for any reason, not necessarily to stop smoking, so the results cannot be used to derive statements on their effectiveness as cessation aids. Few studies have looked at e‐cigarettes as cessation aids. One randomized controlled trial indicated that the particular e‐cigarette used in the trial was of similar effectiveness as nicotine patches in supporting abstinence 29. Use and effects of different devices in the general population are likely to differ from those in controlled trials and samples of dedicated e‐cigarette users may differ from other users in the general population. A recent study using a representative population sample found that smokers who used e‐cigarettes in an attempt to stop smoking were more likely to report continued abstinence than those using NRT without prescription or no aids 30. Further high‐quality longitudinal studies are needed on e‐cigarettes as cessation aids. Future research should also evaluate the impact of continued use of e‐cigarettes on smoking behaviour, as we were only able to provide snapshots of use at two time‐points.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^111K1ahF]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) — smoking cessation comparisons across systematic reviews and meta-analyses report the following estimates. Compared with non-nicotine devices, one review reported (RR = 2.02, 95% CI = 0.97, 4.22), with follow-up ranging from 1 day to 9 months. A Cochrane review concluded that abstinence at 6 months or greater was more likely in ENDS users versus non-nicotine device users (RR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.05, 4.96, based on two RCTs), while a single study comparing ENDS with nicotine patches showed (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.68, 2.34). A 2015 review found that ENDS with nicotine versus without nicotine had a pooled (RR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.05, 4.57), and versus controls ENDS were associated with smoking cessation (pooled effect size = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11, 0.28). Another meta-analysis including 20 in the meta-analysis found e-cigarette use was negatively associated with quitting cigarettes (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.57, 0.91).

Methods

We followed the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the review, and PRISMA 2020 for the reporting. As this is a living review, methods are periodically updated between review updates to ensure that the review remains relevant and reliable. Differences in methods from the protocol and between review updates are documented in Supplementary material 10. Additional changes may be made to the methods for future updates, which will also be documented.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and randomised cross‐over trials in which people who smoke are randomised to EC or to a control condition. RCTs are the best available primary evidence to fulfil our objectives. We also include uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants are given an EC intervention. These studies have the potential to provide additional information on harms and longer‐term use. In the next update of this review, in response to editorial feedback from Cochrane and because of the growth in the RCT evidence base, we will no longer include single‐arm studies where all participants receive EC (see September 2025 protocol update).

We include studies regardless of their publication status or language of publication.

Types of participants

Participants are people defined as currently smoking cigarettes at enrolment into the studies. Participants could be of any age, motivated or unmotivated to quit, and we include studies that recruited pregnant people.

Should a study meet all other criteria, but include only a subset of eligible participants (e.g. a study on people who currently smoke and people who formerly smoked), we would only include data on the subgroup of participants who met our inclusion criteria. If these data were not available, we would include the study if at least 80% of participants met our inclusion criteria and would test the exclusion of the study in a sensitivity analysis.

Types of interventions

Any type of EC or intervention intended to promote EC use for smoking cessation, including studies that do not measure smoking cessation but provide EC with the instruction that they be used as a complete substitute for cigarette use. EC may or may not contain nicotine.

Types of comparators

We compare nicotine EC with alternative smoking cessation aids, including NRT or no intervention, with EC without nicotine, and EC added to standard smoking cessation treatment (behavioural or pharmacological, or both) with standard treatment alone. We also compare different types of EC (refillable, cartridge, nicotine salt, free‐base), different nicotine doses, and different flavours.

### Does reduced smoking if you can' T stop make any difference? [^117Xosc1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The use of e-cigarettes by regular smokers has been increasing worldwide. Nevertheless, evidence indicating that they are effective in encouraging and supporting smoking reduction and cessation is limited. Despite these being termed cigarettes, they do not contain tobacco and there is no combustion involved; the nicotine included in e-cigarettes is extracted from tobacco and toxicological testing of the vapour reveals high traces of tobacco toxins, exceeding those in NRT, but at concentrations much lower than those in conventional cigarettes. A report commissioned by the World Health Organization and a subsequent review concluded that the health benefits and efficacy of e-cigarettes for harm reduction and cessation were unsupported by the evidence to date, although this has been contested. Data from clinical studies show no adverse effects of their short-term use on cardiovascular function. More trials and studies are needed, particularly with regards to long-term risks. Survey data show that e-cigarettes are most commonly used in the reduction and cessation of cigarette consumption, to alleviate tobacco withdrawal symptoms, and to reduce the harm associated with smoking. Findings from a recent Cochrane review of two RCTs suggest that e-cigarettes with nicotine help smokers to reduce their cigarette consumption and quit compared to placebo. One of the included studies examined the effects of e-cigarette use in smokers not intending to quit, comparing two different e-cigarette nicotine doses with placebo e-cigarettes. The authors found that, at 1 year, more smokers in the nicotine e-cigarette groups were able to reduce their cigarette consumption by at least half and quit compared with the placebo group, though these differences were not statistically significant. Despite the fact that the study was underpowered to detect differences in cessation between groups and used products with low nicotine delivery, the data suggests that e-cigarettes may help those unable to quit to reduce smoking and eventually do so. This is also supported by the findings of prospective cohort studies.

### Electronic cigarettes. A position statement of the forum of international respiratory societies [^112xUYNa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Awareness and usage of electronic cigarettes has exponentially increased during the last few years, especially among young people and women in some countries. The rapid acceptance of electronic cigarettes may be attributed in part to the perception created by marketing and the popular press that they are safer than combustible cigarettes.

Goals

To alert and advise policy makers about electronic cigarettes and their potential hazards.

Methods

Using The Union's position paper on electronic cigarettes as the starting template, the document was written using an iterative process. Portions of the manuscript have been taken directly from the position papers of participating societies.

Results

Because electronic cigarettes generate less tar and carcinogens than combustible cigarettes, use of electronic cigarettes may reduce disease caused by those components. However, the health risks of electronic cigarettes have not been adequately studied. Studies looking at whether electronic cigarettes can aid smoking cessation have had inconsistent results. Moreover, the availability of electronic cigarettes may have an overall adverse health impact by increasing initiation and reducing cessation of combustible nicotine delivery products.

Conclusions

The health and safety claims regarding electronic nicotine delivery devices should be subject to evidentiary review. The potential benefits of electronic cigarettes to an individual smoker should be weighed against potential harm to the population of increased social acceptability of smoking and use of nicotine, the latter of which has addictive power and untoward effects. As a precaution, electronic nicotine delivery devices should be restricted or banned until more information about their safety is available. If they are allowed, they should be closely regulated as medicines or tobacco products.

Limitations of the evidence included in the review

We consider the certainty of the evidence as it relates to primary outcomes for our three main comparisons: nicotine EC versus NRT; nicotine EC versus non‐nicotine EC; nicotine EC versus behavioural support only/no support (Table 1; Table 2; Table 3).

Our summary of findings tables and assessments of certainty are based on the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The cohort studies that we include were all automatically classified as having high risk of bias on the basis of non‐random treatment allocation, irrespective of other methodological considerations. Data presented from these studies need to be interpreted with caution. However, data from cohort studies were consistent with data from RCTs.

Risk of bias did not impact on the certainty of evidence for comparisons between nicotine and non‐nicotine EC, or between nicotine EC and NRT. For the latter, we judged six out of seven studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias overall. For the former, removing one study at high risk of bias increased the effect estimate for our efficacy outcome. Risk of bias decreased our certainty in the effect estimates for our nicotine EC versus behavioural support only/no support comparison as, due to the nature of the comparison, blinding was not possible and different levels of support could lead to bias.

Some reviews have examined the evidence on the role of EC flavours in quit rates. A systematic review by Liber and colleagues concluded that the evidence was inconclusive, reflecting highly heterogeneous study definitions and methodological limitations, and called for more high‐quality evidence, ideally from RCTs. An overview of reviews examining the impact of EC flavours on any outcome reported that current evidence was inconclusive on the effect of flavours on quit rates.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^117WpHGS]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Key question 1 — electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) for smoking cessation — systematic reviews evaluated randomized trials (RCTs) and observational studies and reported the following findings. A 2017 review of 687 articles assessed ENDS with versus without nicotine for smoking cessation based on five RCTs; 28 longitudinal observational studies (13 with and 15 without a comparison group); 22 cross-sectional surveys; two clinical laboratory studies; and one case series, and the authors concluded qualitatively based on four of five RCTs that ENDS were effective in helping some adults quit or reduce cigarette consumption. Another 2017 review comparing ENDS or placebo ENDS with no smoking-cessation aids or alternative smoking-cessation aids evaluated use for 6–12 months based on three randomized trials including 1,007 participants and nine other cohorts including 13,115 participants; two RCTs suggested a possible increase in cessation with ENDS versus non-nicotine devices (RR = 2.03, 95% CI = 0.94, 4.38), whereas cohort studies suggested a possible reduction in quit rates with ENDS versus no ENDS (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55, 1.00), and the authors concluded that there is very limited evidence regarding effectiveness.

### Electronic cigarette use, related health outcomes and policy interventions in the USA: a call for research to fill evidence gaps [^116Qssue]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

The population-level health consequences of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use are heavily debated. This special communication provides updated evidence and identifies knowledge gaps across domains including: (1) health-related outcomes associated with e-cigarette use; (2) initiation and use of e-cigarettes among youth and young adults; (3) concurrent use of electronic and combustible cigarettes; (4) transitions from combustible cigarette use to exclusive e-cigarette use among adults who currently smoke cigarettes and (5) existing e-cigarette-related policy interventions. Literature was searched through PubMed and Medline for systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-analyses and primary research articles including emerging topics not covered in reviews published between 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2024. E-cigarette use is associated with several adverse acute health outcomes; there is currently insufficient longitudinal evidence to predict chronic health outcomes. Prevalence of e-cigarette use among youth is considerable and may be associated with subsequent combustible cigarette smoking. Evidence for the health and behavioural impact of dual use of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes is limited by imprecise measurement of exposure. Evidence on adults completely substituting combustible cigarettes for e-cigarettes is strong in clinical trials; observational studies do not show complete substitution. Finally, the effects of e-cigarette-related policy interventions to restrict e-cigarette consumption are currently limited in scope and too short-lived to draw causal inferences. Substantial evidence gaps related to the use, associated health impacts and regulation of e-cigarettes in the USA are identified, and we suggest key areas for future research to address that are crucial for informing the public health approach to e-cigarettes.

### Common assumptions in tobacco control that may not hold true for south-east Asia [^113H4vVK]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Electronic cigarettes

The emergence of electronic cigarettes and other novel nicotine and tobacco products has challenged the global consensus on tobacco control efforts. While there is a general agreement on the risks of e-cigarette uptake among youth, opinions on its usefulness in helping people to quit smoking are split. In the absence of generalisable evidence and a lack of global consensus, countries have adopted a range of policies stretching from a complete ban to promoting electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation. A conceptual dichotomy has emerged; those considering electronic cigarettes as tobacco products are borrowing policies from tobacco control which may or may not be appropriate. Similarly, those approaching them as nicotine delivery systems only have devised specific regulations, which are novel, and the supporting evidence is limited and contextual. In the meantime, the tobacco industry has rapidly taken over e-cigarettes market and are publicising it in many ways including as harm reduction products.

### Do electronic cigarettes help with smoking cessation? [^115XmMb9]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Smoking causes around 100,000 deaths each year in the UK, and is the leading cause of preventable disease and early mortality. Smoking cessation remains difficult and existing licensed treatments have limited success. Nicotine addiction is thought to be one of the primary reasons that smokers find it so hard to give up, and earlier this year DTB reviewed the effects of nicotine on health. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are nicotine delivery devices that aim to mimic the process of smoking but avoid exposing the user to some of the harmful components of traditional cigarettes. However, the increase in the use of e-cigarettes and their potential use as an aid to smoking cessation has been subject to much debate. In this article we consider the regulatory and safety issues associated with the use of e-cigarettes, and their efficacy in smoking cessation and reduction.

### Electronic cigarettes: common questions and answers [^114FFWMp]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are popular devices designed to heat a liquid solution, often containing nicotine, that generates an inhaled aerosol, or vapor. e-Cigarettes have been marketed as healthier alternatives to traditional cigarettes. Thus, most adult users are current or former smokers who use e-cigarettes to reduce or quit cigarette smoking. Switching completely from cigarettes to e-cigarettes is associated with reduced toxicant exposure and reduced short-term respiratory symptoms; however, long-term health effects of e-cigarettes are unknown. Although a recent randomized trial suggests that e-cigarettes may promote smoking cessation, systematic reviews have had low certainty of evidence regarding cessation. e-Cigarettes pose several potential health risks, including exposure to heavy metals and toxicants, and nicotine poisoning. e-Cigarettes are also popular among youth, with rates of e-cigarette use surpassing those of cigarette use in this population. Youth e-cigarette use is associated with increased risk of subsequent cigarette and marijuana use. Screening for e-cigarette use in youth and adults, including pregnant women, in conjunction with screening for tobacco use, is advised. Education and interventions to prevent e-cigarette use should be provided to all youth. Youth should be counseled to stop using nicotine/tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. Although the impact of e-cigarette use in pregnancy is unknown, nicotine is a teratogen; thus, pregnant women should be counseled to abstain from using all nicotine/tobacco products.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^112fbzDn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Stopping smoking can reduce this harm and many people would like to stop. There are a number of medicines licenced to help people quit globally, and e-cigarettes are used for this purpose in many countries. Typically treatments work by reducing cravings to smoke, thus aiding initial abstinence and preventing relapse. More information on comparative effects of these treatments is needed to inform treatment decisions and policies.

Objectives

To investigate the comparative benefits, harms and tolerability of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and e-cigarettes, when used to help people stop smoking tobacco.

Search Methods

We identified studies from recent updates of Cochrane Reviews investigating our interventions of interest. We updated the searches for each review using the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (TAG) specialised register to 29 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and factorial RCTs, which measured smoking cessation at six months or longer, recruited adults who smoked combustible cigarettes at enrolment (excluding pregnant people) and randomised them to approved pharmacotherapies and technologies used for smoking cessation worldwide (varenicline, cytisine, nortriptyline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and e-cigarettes) versus no pharmacological intervention, placebo (control) or another approved pharmacotherapy. Studies providing co-interventions (e.g. behavioural support) were eligible if the co-intervention was provided equally to study arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment (using the RoB 1 tool). Primary outcome measures were smoking cessation at six months or longer, and the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs). We also measured withdrawals due to treatment. We used Bayesian component network meta-analyses (cNMA) to examine intervention type, delivery mode, dose, duration, timing in relation to quit day and tapering of nicotine dose, using odds ratios (OR) and 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). We calculated an effect estimate for combination NRT using an additive model. We evaluated the influence of population and study characteristics, provision of behavioural support and control arm rates using meta-regression. We evaluated certainty using GRADE.

Main Results

Of our 332 eligible RCTs, 319 (835 study arms, 157,179 participants) provided sufficient data to be included in our cNMA. Of these, we judged 51 to be at low risk of bias overall, 104 at high risk and 164 at unclear risk, and 118 reported pharmaceutical or e-cigarette/tobacco industry funding. Removing studies at high risk of bias did not change our interpretation of the results. Benefits We found high-certainty evidence that nicotine e-cigarettes (OR 2.37, 95% CrI 1.73 to 3.24; 16 RCTs, 3828 participants), varenicline (OR 2.33, 95% CrI 2.02 to 2.68; 67 RCTs, 16,430 participants) and cytisine (OR 2.21, 95% CrI 1.66 to 2.97; 7 RCTs, 3848 participants) were associated with higher quit rates than control. In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional eight (95% CrI 4 to 13), eight (95% CrI 6 to 10) and seven additional quitters per 100 (95% CrI 4 to 12), respectively. These interventions appeared to be more effective than the other interventions apart from combination NRT (patch and a fast-acting form of NRT), which had a lower point estimate (calculated additive effect) but overlapping 95% CrIs (OR 1.93, 95% CrI 1.61 to 2.34). There was also high-certainty evidence that nicotine patch alone (OR 1.37, 95% CrI 1.20 to 1.56; 105 RCTs, 37,319 participants), fast-acting NRT alone (OR 1.41, 95% CrI 1.29 to 1.55; 120 RCTs, 31,756 participants) and bupropion (OR 1.43, 95% CrI 1.26 to 1.62; 71 RCTs, 14,759 participants) were more effective than control, resulting in two (95% CrI 1 to 3), three (95% CrI 2 to 3) and three (95% CrI 2 to 4) additional quitters per 100 respectively. Nortriptyline is probably associated with higher quit rates than control (OR 1.35, 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.81; 10 RCTs, 1290 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), resulting in two (CrI 0 to 5) additional quitters per 100. Non-nicotine/placebo e-cigarettes (OR 1.16, 95% CrI 0.74 to 1.80; 8 RCTs, 1094 participants; low-certainty evidence), equating to one additional quitter (95% CrI -2 to 5), had point estimates favouring the intervention over control, but CrIs encompassed the potential for no difference and harm. There was low-certainty evidence that tapering the dose of NRT prior to stopping treatment may improve effectiveness; however, 95% CrIs also incorporated the null (OR 1.14, 95% CrI 1.00 to 1.29; 111 RCTs, 33,156 participants). This might lead to an additional one quitter per 100 (95% CrI 0 to 2). Harms There were insufficient data to include nortriptyline and non-nicotine EC in the final SAE model. Overall rates of SAEs for the remaining treatments were low (average 3%). Low-certainty evidence did not show a clear difference in the number of people reporting SAEs for nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline, cytisine or NRT when compared to no pharmacotherapy/e-cigarettes or placebo. Bupropion may slightly increase rates of SAEs, although the CrI also incorporated no difference (moderate certainty). In absolute terms bupropion may cause one more person in 100 to experience an SAE (95% CrI 0 to 2).

Authors' Conclusions

The most effective interventions were nicotine e-cigarettes, varenicline and cytisine (all high certainty), as well as combination NRT (additive effect, certainty not rated). There was also high-certainty evidence for the effectiveness of nicotine patch, fast-acting NRT and bupropion. Less certain evidence of benefit was present for nortriptyline (moderate certainty), non-nicotine e-cigarettes and tapering of nicotine dose (both low certainty). There was moderate-certainty evidence that bupropion may slightly increase the frequency of SAEs, although there was also the possibility of no increased risk. There was no clear evidence that any other tested interventions increased SAEs. Overall, SAE data were sparse with very low numbers of SAEs, and so further evidence may change our interpretation and certainty. Future studies should report SAEs to strengthen certainty in this outcome. More head-to-head comparisons of the most effective interventions are needed, as are tests of combinations of these. Future work should unify data from behavioural and pharmacological interventions to inform approaches to combined support for smoking cessation.

### Adult smoking cessation-the use of E-cigarettes… [^114j4y4r]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- E-cigarettes, a continually changing and heterogeneous group of products, are used in a variety of ways. Consequently, it is difficult to make generalizations about efficacy for cessation based on clinical trials involving a particular e-cigarette, and there is presently inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes, in general, increase smoking cessation.
- However, the evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer that the use of e-cigarettes containing nicotine is associated with increased smoking cessation compared with the use of e-cigarettes not containing nicotine, and the evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer that more frequent use of e-cigarettes is associated with increased smoking cessation compared with less frequent use of e-cigarettes.
- Smoking cessation medications approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration and behavioral counseling are effective treatments for quitting smoking, particularly when used in combination.

Health Effects of E-Cigarette Use E-cigarettes are fairly new, and scientists are still learning about their long-term health effects. Here is what we currently know about the health effects of e-cigarettes: The Bottom Line About Adult Use of E-Cigarettes to Quit Smoking
- Research is uncertain on whether e-cigarettes, in general, increase smoking cessation.
- Some research suggests that using e-cigarettes containing nicotine is associated with greater smoking cessation than using e-cigarettes that don't contain nicotine, and more frequent use of e-cigarettes is associated with greater smoking cessation than less frequent use.
- In order for adult smokers to achieve any meaningful health benefits from e-cigarettes, they would need to fully switch to e-cigarettes and stop smoking cigarettes and other tobacco products completely.
- Among those who have switched completely, the ultimate goal should be to also stop using e-cigarettes completely to achieve the maximum health benefit.
- People who smoke should talk to their doctor about proven methods to quit. For E-Cigarette Resources, visit: Electronic Cigarettes. Proven Strategies to Quit Smoking Cigarettes Several evidence-based methods have been scientifically proven safe and effective for quitting smoking. These include: Completely switching is the only way to fully reduce smoking-related health risks. Smoking even a few cigarettes per day is still harmful to health. The use of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes can lead to the same, or in some cases higher, exposures to harmful chemicals as cigarette smoking alone. Adults who switch to e-cigarettes should also establish a goal for quitting them, to fully eliminate health risks from any tobacco product use.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^114LFYyY]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM) e-cigarette working group — methods and key questions are specified: The scope included primary key questions, "How effective are ENDS at helping people quit cigarette smoking?" and "What are the comparative risks of ENDS, compared to smoking cigarettes or non-exposure to smoking or vaping?", plus additional questions on secondhand aerosol harms, how product characteristics, marketing, perception, and availability affect incidence in subgroups, and whether policy measures reduce new vapers or exposure. The population included tobacco smokers and nonsmokers of all ages; interventions included any vaporized nicotine delivery system with or without other substances; comparators included placebo ENDS (non-nicotine devices), cigarette smoking, not smoking (never smoking or quitting), and Food and Drug Administration–approved pharmacotherapy; and outcomes included short- and long-term quit rates, incidence of new users of ENDS or other tobacco (especially among adolescents), use of other substances of abuse, and tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Evidence identification used a PubMed English-language literature search for a 10-year period from May 2007 to June 2017 with rapid review methods; for study selection, all abstracts were independently reviewed by two members for KQs 1 and 2, whereas for KQs 3–5 a single member reviewed abstracts for full-text review and inclusion.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation [^114k46iJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices which produce an aerosol formed by heating an e-liquid. Some people who smoke use ECs to stop or reduce smoking, but some organizations, advocacy groups and policymakers have discouraged this, citing lack of evidence of efficacy and safety. People who smoke, healthcare providers and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is an update conducted as part of a living systematic review.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of using electronic cigarettes (ECs) to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 May 2021, and reference-checked and contacted study authors. We screened abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) 2021 Annual Meeting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and randomized cross-over trials, in which people who smoke were randomized to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report abstinence from cigarettes at six months or longer or data on safety markers at one week or longer, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Our primary outcome measures were abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Secondary outcomes included the proportion of people still using study product (EC or pharmacotherapy) at six or more months after randomization or starting EC use, changes in carbon monoxide (CO), blood pressure (BP), heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and levels of carcinogens or toxicants or both. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses.

Main Results

We included 61 completed studies, representing 16,759 participants, of which 34 were RCTs. Five of the 61 included studies were new to this review update. Of the included studies, we rated seven (all contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 42 at high risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than in those randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 1.93; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1924 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 1 to 6). There was low-certainty evidence (limited by very serious imprecision) that the rate of occurrence of AEs was similar (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.19; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 485 participants). SAEs were rare, but there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differed between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.90: I² = 0; 4 studies, 1424 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, that quit rates were higher in people randomized to nicotine EC than to non-nicotine EC (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.13; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1447 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional seven quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 16). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.11; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 601 participants). There was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.38; I² = 0; 5 studies, 792 participants). Compared to behavioural support only/no support, quit rates were higher for participants randomized to nicotine EC (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.74; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 2886 participants). In absolute terms this represents an additional six quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 15). However, this finding was of very low certainty, due to issues with imprecision and risk of bias. There was some evidence that non-serious AEs were more common in people randomized to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.32; I² = 41%, low certainty; 4 studies, 765 participants), and again, insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.24; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1303 participants). Data from non-randomized studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons, hence evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing clinically significant harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care/no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain. More studies are needed to confirm the effect size. Confidence intervals were for the most part wide for data on AEs, SAEs and other safety markers, with no difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of harm from nicotine EC, but longest follow-up was two years and the number of studies was small. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates, but further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this review is now a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^114qT9HC]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) cessation efficacy in adults is characterized by limited evidence supporting the short-term efficacy of exclusive use of nicotine-containing ENDS in adults desiring to quit, with several RCTs demonstrating positive results compared with observational studies that often do not show benefit. These studies compared ENDS with no treatment, non-nicotine ENDS, or, in rare cases, NRT, and there is insufficient evidence comparing the efficacy of ENDS to established evidence-based treatments.

### Is the use of electronic cigarettes while smoking associated with smoking cessation attempts, cessation and reduced cigarette consumption? A survey with a 1-year follow-up [^116PCf4j]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Further evidence is needed on differences between the numerous types of e‐cigarettes, as products vary widely in their appearance, function, content, marketing and nicotine delivery 31, 32, 33, 34, and use and effects on smoking will vary considerably across different types. In this sample, the majority were using cigarette‐like products. These have been found to deliver less nicotine than more recently developed products 22, 32, 35, and in a sample of ex‐smokers who had quit using e‐cigarettes all had used more recently developed products 36, indicating that cigarette‐like e‐cigarettes may be less helpful.

Several limitations of the study should be noted. Follow‐up rate was 43%, resulting in small sample sizes for some analysis. Respondents who were followed‐up differed from those not followed‐up on some demographic variables, specifically age and gender, potentially reducing the generalizability to younger and female smokers. However, key smoking characteristics and e‐cigarette use were not associated with follow‐up. The survey did not include questions on the duration of use, so non‐daily e‐cigarette users will have included people who had just tried e‐cigarettes once or twice, as well as occasional users. This also means that we did not assess if respondents continued to use e‐cigarettes throughout the follow‐up period and not all baseline users may have continued to use them. Also, those initiating e‐cigarette use during the follow‐up period were included with baseline non‐users. Any short‐term use of e‐cigarettes around baseline and uptake during follow‐up will therefore have led to an underestimation of their effects on quit attempts and cessation. Additionally, the baseline sample including only smokers would have excluded any ex‐smokers who had used e‐cigarettes and successfully quit, thus potentially biasing the sample in favour of 'treatment failures'. The definition of cessation did not include a minimum time of abstinence, but relied upon respondents' self‐report. However, this method avoids recall bias, and in population surveys the risk of misreporting is reduced, as there is no expectation to report cessation 37. The online recruitment method is likely to have led to some selection bias, as internet use is linked to socio‐economic status and age; however, the socio‐economic divide has narrowed considerably between 2011 and 2013 38. The sample was self‐selected in so far as participants had volunteered for a market research company web panel; nevertheless, the overall sample characteristics were broadly similar to those of representative samples from a national household survey 22, 39.

### E-cigarettes more effective than nicotine replacement for cessation of tobacco use in adults… [^114QTjLr]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Are e-cigarettes an effective way to help patients quit smoking. Bottom Line Among adults who smoked a median of 15 cigarettes per day, those who were randomized to receive e-cigarettes were more likely to be abstinent at one year than those who received nicotine replacement. They also had less cough and phlegm production. Synopsis Many physicians have had patients who claimed to have stopped smoking by switching to e-cigarettes. But is this switch truly effective, and how durable are the effects. In this trial, adult smokers in the United Kingdom were recruited via social media and randomized to receive nicotine replacement or e-cigarettes. All participants were not currently using either approach and expressed no preference. Those randomized to use nicotine replacement could choose their preferred method, including nasal spray, inhaler, mouth spray, microtabs, gum, or patch.

Those randomized to use e-cigarettes received a starter kit and were encouraged to experiment with different flavors and strengths of e-liquids. The median age of participants was 41 years, approximately one-half were women, and the median number of cigarettes smoked per day was 15. Groups were balanced at the beginning of the study, and a total of 884 patients were randomized. The primary outcome, evaluated using the intention-to-treat principle, was self-reported abstinence confirmed by a carbon monoxide level of less than 8 ppm at one year. This occurred for 18% in the e-cigarette group and 9. 9% in the nicotine replacement group. Short-term abstinence at four weeks was also higher with the use of e-cigarettes. Respiratory symptoms of cough and phlegm were somewhat less common among those in the e-cigarette group at 52 weeks.

There was no difference in adverse events between groups, with nausea more common in the nicotine replacement group and throat irritation more common in the e-cigarette group. A total of 40% of the patients in the e-cigarette group were still using e-cigarettes at one year, so they were still hooked on nicotine, just not tobacco.

### E-cigarettes and smoking cessation in real-world and clinical settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Zgquq]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Smokers increasingly use e-cigarettes for many reasons, including attempts to quit combustible cigarettes and to use nicotine where smoking is prohibited. We aimed to assess the association between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking cessation among adult cigarette smokers, irrespective of their motivation for using e-cigarettes.

Methods

PubMed and Web of Science were searched between April 27, 2015, and June 17, 2015. Data extracted included study location, design, population, definition and prevalence of e-cigarette use, comparison group (if applicable), cigarette consumption, level of nicotine dependence, other confounders, definition of quitting smoking, and odds of quitting smoking. The primary endpoint was cigarette smoking cessation. Odds of smoking cessation among smokers using e-cigarettes compared with smokers not using e-cigarettes were assessed using a random effects meta-analysis. A modification of the ACROBAT-NRSI tool and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool were used to assess bias. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42015020382).

Findings

38 studies (of 577 studies identified) were included in the systematic review; all 20 studies with control groups (15 cohort studies, three cross-sectional studies, and two clinical trials) were included in random effects meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses. Odds of quitting cigarettes were 28% lower in those who used e-cigarettes compared with those who did not use e-cigarettes (odds ratio [OR] 0·72, 95% CI 0·57–0·91). Association of e-cigarette use with quitting did not significantly differ among studies of all smokers using e-cigarettes (irrespective of interest in quitting cigarettes) compared with studies of only smokers interested in cigarette cessation (OR 0·63, 95% CI 0·45–0·86 vs 0·86, 0·60–1·23; p = 0·94). Other study characteristics (design, population, comparison group, control variables, time of exposure assessment, biochemical verification of abstinence, and definition of e-cigarette use) were also not associated with the overall effect size (p ≥ 0·77 in all cases).

Interpretation

As currently being used, e-cigarettes are associated with significantly less quitting among smokers.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems or E-cigarettes: American College of Preventive Medicine's practice statement [^117RqtM2]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) — adult and youth use patterns and considerations are outlined: In the U.S. ENDS were introduced in 2007, and among adults the National Health Interview Survey 2016 reported that 15.4% of those aged 18 years and older had ever used an e-cigarette, up from 12.6% in 2014, with current use at 3.2% and the highest ever-use among ages 18–24 years at 23.5%; population studies show current smokers have the highest rates of e-cigarette use, followed by former smokers, with little use among never smokers. Among youth, tobacco product use has declined recently, but ENDS have surpassed combustible cigarettes as the most used youth tobacco product in the U.S.; concerns include increased vulnerability to nicotine addiction, potential long-term nicotine impacts on the developing brain, and emerging evidence that youth ENDS use is associated with increased future use of combustible cigarettes. Arguments favoring e-cigarettes include possible efficacy as a tobacco cessation tool or as a less dangerous alternative to combustible, toxin-laden, conventional cigarettes, whereas arguments against include lack of evidence supporting efficacy and harms, appeal to youth, and the risk of creating new vaping norms that may lead to increased tobacco smoking; numerous types of ENDS aerosolize refill liquids whose primary ingredients include nicotine, flavorings, propylene glycol, and glycerol, and there is poor correlation between labeling and nicotine content.

### Targeted smoking cessation for dual users of combustible and electronic cigarettes: a randomised controlled trial [^113VpvnH]. The Lancet: Public Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use (also known as vaping) has increased greatly over the past decade. In 2018, for example, 8 million adults in the USA alone reported vaping, primarily for the purpose of quitting or reducing smoking. The few randomised smoking cessation trials of e-cigarettes have indicated efficacy at least as high as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). However, many individuals continue to smoke while vaping, representing a type of dual use, which refers to use of two nicotine or tobacco products concurrently. It is estimated that 40·8% of e-cigarette users are also cigarette smokers (ie, dual users). Unlike exclusive vaping, which can be viewed as a harm reduction strategy, dual use is associated with a high exposure to toxicants at levels that can be similar or higher than that of cigarette smoking alone. Dual use might also lead to greater nicotine dependence, prolonging smoking and impeding cessation. Almost half of dual users continue both smoking and vaping when followed up for a year, and 44% return to exclusive smoking. Therefore, although dual users are interested in quitting smoking and are more likely to make quit attempts than smokers who do not vape, they still have difficulty achieving smoking abstinence. Many dual users report a reduction in smoking after the onset of vaping; yet even low rates of smoking are associated with poor health outcomes and increased mortality. Additionally, smoking cessation interventions with better established efficacy (eg, behavioural counselling and pharmacotherapies such as NRT) are limited by poor population uptake. Together, these findings suggest that an intervention to help dual users to achieve and maintain smoking abstinence, particularly one that is easily disseminated, could have high public health impact.

In this three-arm randomised controlled trial, we tested the hypothesis that a self-help intervention designed specifically for dual users would improve smoking abstinence compared with a no-treatment control and an existing, efficacious, and generic self-help smoking cessation intervention. Secondary aims were to identify responsive prespecified subgroups, assess changes in vaping and its covariation with smoking, and compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

### Electronic cigarettes: review of use, content, safety, effects on smokers and potential for harm and benefit [^115uLSwZ]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

We reviewed available research on the use, content and safety of electronic cigarettes (EC), and on their effects on users, to assess their potential for harm or benefit and to extract evidence that can guide future policy.

Methods

Studies were identified by systematic database searches and screening references to February 2014.

Results

EC aerosol can contain some of the toxicants present in tobacco smoke, but at levels which are much lower. Long-term health effects of EC use are unknown but compared with cigarettes, EC are likely to be much less, if at all, harmful to users or bystanders. EC are increasingly popular among smokers, but to date there is no evidence of regular use by never-smokers or by non-smoking children. EC enable some users to reduce or quit smoking.

Conclusions

Allowing EC to compete with cigarettes in the market-place might decrease smoking-related morbidity and mortality. Regulating EC as strictly as cigarettes, or even more strictly as some regulators propose, is not warranted on current evidence. Health professionals may consider advising smokers unable or unwilling to quit through other routes to switch to EC as a safer alternative to smoking and a possible pathway to complete cessation of nicotine use.

### Effects of interventions to combat tobacco addiction: cochrane update of 2019 and 2020 reviews [^112vCzNW]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To summarize evidence on tobacco addiction interventions published by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (CTAG) from 2019 to 2020.

Methods

Narrative summary of all new and updated Cochrane Reviews published by CTAG in 2019 and 2020, outlining key results and promising avenues for future research.

Results

CTAG published six new reviews and updated 15 reviews. There is high-certainty evidence that combining fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with transdermal patches helped more people to quit than single-form NRT [risk ratio (RR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15–1.36, 14 studies, n = 11356; I² = 4%] and moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting can increase quit rates more than using NRT from quit day onwards (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.08–1.44, nine studies, n = 4395; I² = 0%). Reducing smoking in order to quit completely results in similar quit rates to abrupt quitting (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.87–1.17; I² = 29%; 22 studies, n = 9219; moderate-certainty). Electronic cigarettes may help more people quit than NRT (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.21–1.93; I² = 0%; four studies, n = 1924; moderate certainty), nicotine-free electronic cigarettes (RR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.21–3.13; I² = 0%; five studies, n = 1447; moderate-certainty) and behavioural/no support (RR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.44–4.74; I² = 0%; six studies, n = 2886; very low-certainty). Varenicline may help prevent relapse in abstainers (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.08–1.41; I² = 82%; 11 studies, n = 1297; moderate-certainty), but behavioural support did not prevent relapse (RR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.87–1.11; I² = 52%; 11 studies, n = 5523; moderate-certainty). Financial incentives increased quit rates in the general population (RR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.28–1.73; I² = 33%; 30 studies, adjusted n = 20097; high-certainty) and during pregnancy (RR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.54–3.69; I² = 41%; nine studies, n = 2273; moderate-certainty). This overview also provides detail on a wider range of interventions.

Conclusions

There is high certainty that using nicotine replacement therapy from quit day increases smoking abstinence and no further research is required. Evidence is less certain that nicotine replacement increases abstinence when used in higher doses tailored to particular groups of smokers or use prior to quit day, and further research would be helpful. There is moderate-certainty evidence to support the use of e-cigarettes as cessation aids, but research on their role in preventing relapse would be particularly helpful.

### Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation… [^115uTQHd]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

e-Cigarettes with nicotine can be used to encourage smoking cessation, but continued use after cessation may be a risk factor for relapse. e-Cigarettes with nicotine used for smoking cessation are more effective than e-cigarettes without nicotine. 1 The study included two RCTs with 662 adults from New Zealand and Italy interested in smoking cessation and compared e-cigarettes with nicotine to e-cigarettes without nicotine. Patients using e-cigarettes abstained from smoking for at least six months at a higher rate than those using placebo e-cigarettes.

A 2019 pragmatic RCT with 886 patients from the United Kingdom who smoked cigarettes and were interested in quitting evaluated the one-year effectiveness of e-cigarettes with nicotine compared with other forms of nicotine replacement for smoking cessation. Patients had a median age of 41 years, and they smoked a median of 15 cigarettes per day. Researchers defined the primary outcome as patient-reported sustained abstinence at one year, corroborated by carbon monoxide testing. In the e-cigarette group, 18% of patients reported sustained abstinence at one year compared with 9. 9% in the nicotine-replacement group. 2 However, at the end of follow-up, 80% of abstinent patients in the e-cigarette group continued to use e-cigarettes, whereas only 9% of abstinent patients in the nicotine replacement group still used nicotine replacement.

A 2019 French cohort study enrolled 5, 400 adult smokers and 2, 025 adult former smokers who quit in 2010, the same year e-cigarettes became available in France. Researchers obtained annual surveys from patients about their cigarette and e-cigarette use for at least one year after enrollment. In multivariate analysis, patients who used e-cigarettes were more likely to quit smoking than those not using e-cigarettes.

### Overview of electronic nicotine delivery systems: a systematic review [^111UHNfj]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Rapid developments in e-cigarettes, or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), and the evolution of the overall tobacco product marketplace warrant frequent evaluation of the published literature. The purpose of this article is to report updated findings from a comprehensive review of the published scientific literature on ENDS.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors conducted a systematic review of published empirical research literature on ENDS through May 31, 2016, using a detailed search strategy in the PubMed electronic database, expert review, and additional targeted searches. Included studies presented empirical findings and were coded to at least one of nine topics: (1) Product Features; (2) Health Effects; (3) Consumer Perceptions; (4) Patterns of Use; (5) Potential to Induce Dependence; (6) Smoking Cessation; (7) Marketing and Communication; (8) Sales; and (9) Policies; reviews and commentaries were excluded. Data from included studies were extracted by multiple coders (October 2015 to August 2016) into a standardized form and synthesized qualitatively by topic.

Evidence Synthesis

There were 687 articles included in this systematic review. The majority of studies assessed patterns of ENDS use and consumer perceptions of ENDS, followed by studies examining health effects of vaping and product features.

Conclusions

Studies indicate that ENDS are increasing in use, particularly among current smokers, pose substantially less harm to smokers than cigarettes, are being used to reduce/quit smoking, and are widely available. More longitudinal studies and controlled trials are needed to evaluate the impact of ENDS on population-level tobacco use and determine the health effects of longer-term vaping.
