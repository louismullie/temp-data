## Question

Which of the following is least sensitive to the effect of Radiation: a) Ovarian Follicles b) Small Intestinal Epithelium c) Erythropoeitic cells of Bone Marrow d) Spermatogonia of Testicular Tubules e) Neurons of Cerebral Cortex

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tissue among ovarian follicles, small intestinal epithelium, erythropoietic bone marrow, spermatogonia, and cerebral cortical neurons is least sensitive to radiation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle of radiation sensitivity tied to proliferative activity. Then, I should verify which of the listed tissues are early-responding versus late-responding. Next, I will examine the specific vulnerabilities of each option, especially the CNS. Finally, I will synthesize and conclude which tissue is most radioresistant and why, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: rapidly dividing cells are more radiosensitive than quiescent cells, so tissues with high mitotic activity are early-responding, whereas slowly dividing or postmitotic tissues are late-responding and relatively radioresistant. This is why fractionation spares late-responding tissues more than early-responding ones, and it frames the entire analysis here [^116s5YZY].

> Now, I will examine the ovarian follicles. Oocytes and granulosa cells are highly proliferative and dependent on intact DNA repair, so they are classic early-responding radiosensitive tissues, with radiation commonly causing follicular depletion and infertility, which aligns with the principle of mitotic radiosensitivity [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the small intestinal epithelium. Enterocytes and crypt stem cells renew rapidly, making the gut mucosa one of the most radiosensitive tissues, explaining early radiation enteritis and the need for dose constraints in abdominal radiotherapy, so this is clearly early-responding and highly sensitive [^notfound].

> I will now examine erythropoietic bone marrow. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells divide frequently, so marrow is prototypically radiosensitive, with clinically important cytopenias reflecting early-responding tissue injury, which again fits the high mitotic activity paradigm [^notfound].

> Let me consider the testicular spermatogonia. Germinal epithelium undergoes continuous spermatogenesis, so spermatogonia are among the most radiosensitive cells in the body, with radiation-induced azoospermia a recognized toxicity, confirming their early-responding status [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neurons. I initially thought neurons might be uniformly radioresistant, but I should verify the nuance here. The adult cerebral cortex is largely composed of postmitotic neurons, which makes it a late-responding tissue and relatively radioresistant compared with the other options, yet radiation can still injure oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, and neural stem/progenitor niches, producing demyelination, vascular injury, and impaired neurogenesis with cognitive effects, so "least sensitive" does not mean "immune" to radiation effects [^116s5YZY] [^112R4EMa] [^116vAKvk].

> Wait, let me verify the stem cell caveat. The hippocampal dentate gyrus and subventricular zone contain cycling neural precursors that are radiosensitive, and experimental studies show that even modest X-ray doses can reduce immature neurons, reinforcing that the CNS's vulnerability is largely due to its progenitor compartments rather than mature cortical neurons per se [^117Vgqkg] [^116vAKvk].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the ranking. The early-responding, highly radiosensitive tissues here are ovarian follicles, small intestinal epithelium, erythropoietic marrow, and spermatogonia, whereas the cerebral cortical neurons, being postmitotic and part of a late-responding tissue, are the least sensitive among the listed options, acknowledging that the CNS's clinically relevant radiation injury reflects damage to progenitors and support cells rather than direct killing of mature neurons at typical therapeutic exposures [^116s5YZY] [^112R4EMa].

> Final answer: The neurons of the cerebral cortex are the least sensitive to radiation among the choices provided, because mature cortical neurons are postmitotic and the cortex behaves as a late-responding tissue, even though neural stem/progenitor cells and glia within the CNS remain radiosensitive and mediate many neurocognitive sequelae of cranial irradiation [^116s5YZY] [^116vAKvk] [^117Vgqkg].

The neurons of the cerebral cortex are the **least sensitive to radiation** among the listed options because they are **post-mitotic and have minimal turnover** [^116s5YZY], making them highly radioresistant compared with rapidly dividing tissues [^notfound]. In contrast, ovarian follicles, small intestinal epithelium, erythropoietic bone marrow, and spermatogonia are **rapidly dividing and highly radiosensitive**, with radiation causing significant apoptosis, depletion, or dysfunction in these tissues [^117Vgqkg]. Thus, the correct answer is **e) Neurons of cerebral cortex**.

---

## Radiation sensitivity of cerebral cortical neurons

- **Post-mitotic nature**: Cortical neurons are terminally differentiated and rarely divide, rendering them inherently radioresistant compared with proliferating tissues [^notfound].

- **Minimal turnover**: The adult cerebral cortex has negligible cell turnover, reducing susceptibility to radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis [^notfound].

- **Clinical evidence**: Cranial irradiation primarily damages proliferating neural progenitors and glial cells, not mature cortical neurons, supporting their relative radioresistance [^112R4EMa].

---

## Radiation sensitivity of other listed tissues

| **Tissue** | **Radiation sensitivity** | **Mechanism of radiation damage** |
|-|-|-|
| Ovarian follicles | High | Rapidly dividing oocytes and follicular cells undergo apoptosis and depletion, leading to infertility [^notfound] |
| Small intestinal epithelium | High | Rapidly renewing enterocytes and stem cells are damaged, causing mucosal injury, malabsorption, and diarrhea [^notfound] |
| Erythropoietic cells of bone marrow | High | Hematopoietic stem cells are radiosensitive, causing anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia [^notfound] |
| Spermatogonia of testicular tubules | High | Germ cells undergo apoptosis and depletion, leading to azoospermia and infertility [^notfound] |

---

## Comparative analysis

- **Cerebral cortical neurons**: Minimal radiation sensitivity due to post-mitotic status and low turnover [^notfound].

- **Other tissues**: High sensitivity due to rapid proliferation and active cell division, making them vulnerable to radiation-induced apoptosis and depletion [^116s5YZY].

---

## Conclusion

The neurons of the cerebral cortex are the **least sensitive to radiation** among the listed options because they are post-mitotic and have minimal turnover, whereas ovarian follicles, small intestinal epithelium, erythropoietic bone marrow, and spermatogonia are highly radiosensitive due to rapid proliferation [^116s5YZY].

### VEGF overexpression induces post-ischaemic neuroprotection, but facilitates haemodynamic steal phenomena [^113CbqZ2]. Brain (2005). Low credibility.

Therapeutic angiogenesis with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a clinically promising strategy in ischaemic disease. The pathophysiological consequences of enhanced vessel formation, however, are poorly understood. We established mice overexpressing human VEGF165 under a neuron-specific promoter, which exhibited an increased density of brain vessels under physiological conditions and enhanced angiogenesis after brain ischaemia. Following transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusions, VEGF overexpression significantly alleviated neurological deficits and infarct volume, and reduced disseminated neuronal injury and caspase-3 activity, confirming earlier observations that VEGF has neuroprotective properties. Brain swelling was not influenced in VEGF-overexpressing animals, while sodium fluorescein extravasation was moderately increased, suggesting that VEGF induces a mild blood-brain barrier leakage. To elucidate whether enhanced angiogenesis improves regional cerebral blood flow in the ischaemic brain, [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography was performed. Autoradiographies revealed that VEGF induces haemodynamic steal phenomena with reduced blood flow in ischaemic areas and increased flow values only outside the MCA territory. Our data demonstrate that VEGF protects neurons from ischaemic cell death by a direct action rather than by promoting angiogenesis, and suggest that strategies aiming at increasing vascular density in the whole brain, e.g. by VEGF overexpression, may worsen rather than improve cerebral haemodynamics after stroke.

### Genetic dissection of the glutamatergic neuron system in cerebral cortex [^115yLDeQ]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Diverse types of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons mediate the myriad processing streams and output channels of the cerebral cortex 1,2, yet all derive from neural progenitors of the embryonic dorsal telencephalon 3,4. Here we establish genetic strategies and tools for dissecting and fate-mapping subpopulations of pyramidal neurons on the basis of their developmental and molecular programs. We leverage key transcription factors and effector genes to systematically target temporal patterning programs in progenitors and differentiation programs in postmitotic neurons. We generated over a dozen temporally inducible mouse Cre and Flp knock-in driver lines to enable the combinatorial targeting of major progenitor types and projection classes. Combinatorial strategies confer viral access to subsets of pyramidal neurons defined by developmental origin, marker expression, anatomical location and projection targets. These strategies establish an experimental framework for understanding the hierarchical organization and developmental trajectory of subpopulations of pyramidal neurons that assemble cortical processing networks and output channels.

Introduction

The mammalian cerebral cortex is a complex yet highly organized brain structure, consisting of six layers of neurons that form specific circuits to support all higher-order brain functions. The formation of the cerebral cortex depends on the orderly production of a large number of diverse neurons, which largely occurs during embryonic development. The vast majority of cortical excitatory neurons originate from radial glial cells, the predominant population of neural progenitor cells in the developing cortex –. During cortical development, radial glial progenitors (RGPs) progress through a cellular program of proliferation, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis. At the early stage of cortical development (e.g. embryonic day (E) 10–11 in mice), RGPs predominantly undergo symmetric proliferative division to amplify themselves. As development proceeds, they switch to asymmetric neurogenic division to self-renew and, at the same time, to produce neurons either directly (direct neurogenesis) or indirectly via transit amplifying progenitors (TAPs) that divide mostly in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to give rise to neurons (indirect neurogenesis).

### Brain regional quantification of F-ring and D-/ E-ring isoprostanes and neuroprostanes in Alzheimer's disease [^114FJuem]. The American Journal of Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Isoprostanes (IsoP) are produced exclusively from free radical damage to arachidonic acid, a fatty acid that is evenly distributed throughout white matter and gray matter, whereas neuroprostanes (NPs) are generated analogously from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a fatty acid enriched in gray matter where it is concentrated in neurons. IsoP and NPs derive from endoperoxide intermediates that isomerize to D/E-ring forms or that are reduced to F-ring compounds. We quantified F-ring and D/E-ring IsoP and NPs in temporal and parietal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of nine definite Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 11 age-matched controls. Total NP levels (F-ring plus D/E-ring), but not total IsoP, were significantly greater in AD than controls (P: < 0.0001); only cerebral regions in AD patients had NPs greater than controls (P: < 0.05). The F-ring to D/E-ring ratio for NPs, but not IsoP, was 40 to 70% lower in all brain regions of AD patients compared to controls (P: < 0.005). These data extend results from in situ techniques, that have localized reactive products of lipid peroxidation primarily to neurons, by quantifying significantly greater free radical damage to the DHA-containing compartments in cerebrum in AD patients than controls, and suggest that one mechanism of increased oxidative stress may be diminished reducing capacity in DHA-containing compartments.

The neurovasculome: roles in brain homeostasis and cognitive health — cerebral blood vessels have an intimate and complex relationship with brain cells and the neurovasculome's goals are to provide energy substrates, control brain microenvironment composition, enable immune surveillance, and achieve these by regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF), controlling bidirectional molecular transfer across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), removing byproducts of brain activity, and directing immune cell traffic into and out of the brain.

### Human cerebral cortex development from pluripotent stem cells to functional excitatory synapses [^114GQcKf]. Nature Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

Efforts to study the development and function of the human cerebral cortex in health and disease have been limited by the availability of model systems. Extrapolating from our understanding of rodent cortical development, we have developed a robust, multistep process for human cortical development from pluripotent stem cells: directed differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to cortical stem and progenitor cells, followed by an extended period of cortical neurogenesis, neuronal terminal differentiation to acquire mature electrophysiological properties, and functional excitatory synaptic network formation. We found that induction of cortical neuroepithelial stem cells from human ES cells and human iPS cells was dependent on retinoid signaling. Furthermore, human ES cell and iPS cell differentiation to cerebral cortex recapitulated in vivo development to generate all classes of cortical projection neurons in a fixed temporal order. This system enables functional studies of human cerebral cortex development and the generation of individual-specific cortical networks ex vivo for disease modeling and therapeutic purposes.

### Radiation-induced tissue damage and response [^116s5YZY]. The Journal of Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Late responding tissues

The fairly distinct, if plastic, stem, progenitor, functional cell compartments with rapid turnover and acute responses to IR seen in hierarchical tissues 87 can be contrasted with late responding tissues with slow turnover, where it has been less easy to identify the contribution of stem cells to homeostasis and radiation‐induced regeneration. This distinction is important, as dose fractionation in the clinic spares slowly responding tissues more than those that show an early response.

With the exception of CNS‐ARS, the CNS is the classic late responding tissue. In adult brain, neural stem/progenitor cells have been identified in niches in the subventricular zone and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These are active sites of neurogenesis. Lineage tracing has shown that most stem/progenitor cells cycle and turnover slowly but can be activated to proliferate before migrating away to produce neurons or glia 88.

### Evolutionary changes leading to efficient glymphatic circulation in the mammalian brain [^111G6EnH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Although the cerebral cortex, a structure in the cerebral hemispheres comprising layered gray matter, is one of the most prominent features conserved in mammalian brains, its biological importance remains unclear. Our results raised the possibility that the cerebral cortex is a structure that facilitates the accumulation of cortical neurons close to the cortical surface so that a greater number of neurons can benefit from efficient glymphatic circulation. To test this possibility, we created imaginary monkey and human cerebral hemispheres possessing the same numbers of cortical neurons compared with real monkey and human cerebral hemispheres, but in which cortical neurons did not form gray matter and were evenly distributed throughout the hemispheres (Fig. 2a, e, lower panels, red). We then simulated CSF solute concentrations at cortical neurons using the (D / A) * value, and histograms showed, in both monkeys and humans, that more neurons in the hemispheres with a cerebral cortex benefitted from efficient glymphatic circulation (Fig. 2c, g, green) compared with the imaginary hemispheres in which neurons were evenly distributed throughout the cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 2c, g, purple). On average, neurons in hemispheres with a cerebral cortex were exposed to CSF solute concentrations that were almost 2 times higher than concentrations in those in which neurons were evenly distributed (Fig. 2d, h). These results indicate that many neurons in the cerebral cortex can benefit from efficient glymphatic circulation. It should be noted that the benefit to cortical neurons was 2.2 times higher in humans (Fig. 2h) but only 1.8 times higher in monkeys (Fig. 2d). This result suggests that the importance of the accumulation of neurons in the cerebral cortex is greater in larger brains.

### Potential neuronal repair in cerebral white matter injury in the human neonate [^112v4zYL]. Pediatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in the premature infant represents the major substrate underlying cognitive deficits and cerebral palsy and is characterized as focal periventricular necrosis and diffuse gliosis in the immature cerebral white matter. We have recently shown a significant decrease in the density of neurons in PVL relative to controls throughout the white matter, including the subventricular, periventricular, and subcortical regions. These neurons are likely to be remnants of the subplate and/or GABAergic neurons in late migration to the cerebral cortex, both of which are important for proper cortical circuitry in development and throughout adulthood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that intrinsic repair occurs in PVL to attempt to compensate for the deficits in white matter neurons. By using doublecortin (DCX) immunopositivity as a marker of postmitotic migrating neurons, we found significantly increased densities (p < 0.05) of DCX-immunopositive cells in PVL cases (n = 9) compared with controls (n = 7) in the subventricular zone (their presumed site of origin), necrotic foci, and subcortical white matter in the perinatal time-window, i.e. 35–42 postconceptional weeks. These data provide the first evidence suggestive of an attempt at neuronal repair or regeneration in human neonatal white matter injury.

### Radiation induced CNS toxicity – molecular and cellular mechanisms [^112R4EMa]. British Journal of Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy of tumours proximal to normal CNS structures is limited by the sensitivity of the normal tissue. Prior to the development of prophylactic strategies or treatment protocols a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of radiation induced CNS toxicity is mandatory. Histological analysis of irradiated CNS specimens defines possible target structures prior to a delineation of cellular and molecular mechanisms. Several lesions can be distinguished: Demyelination, proliferative and degenerative glial reactions, endothelial cell loss and capillary occlusion. All changes are likely to result from complex alterations within several functional CNS compartments. Thus, a single mechanism responsible cannot be separated. At least four factors contribute to the development of CNS toxicity: (1) damage to vessel structures; (2) deletion of oligodendrocyte-2 astrocyte progenitors (O-2A) and mature oligodendrocytes; (3) deletion of neural stem cell populations in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cortex; (4) generalized alterations of cytokine expression. Several underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in radiation induced CNS toxicity have been identified. The article reviews the currently available data on the cellular and molecular basis of radiation induced CNS side effects. http://www.bjcancer.com © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign

### E-I E-I woe: mossy cell regulation of granule cell activity in temporal lobe epilepsy [^116rQc9P]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

This study is really important for understanding MC role in SE. However, there are a few caveats. For one, the use of simulated SE in the slice electrophysiology experiments is an approximation of ongoing seizure activity since it is an in vitro model and can't recapitulate all of the physiological changes from prolonged status. Furthermore, SE is unlikely to be a fixed condition and levels of gamma -Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and timing of GABA depletion are likely to influence the exact effect of MC activation, along with development of changes from excitotoxicity. Future experiments exploring the impact of MC activation during development of status on downstream hippocampal circuits in vivo would provide valuable data to understand exactly when the gating function of the GC fails during SE. Given the relevance of MC in TLE, we believe that future experiments exploring other cell types and features of this microcircuit would be important. For example, how MC and basket cell activity are balanced or regulated in order to change GC activity in TLE would provide critical context to the results of this study. Further defining how MC activity becomes strongly excitatory may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of TLE. Targeting this microcircuit to restore excitatory–inhibitory homeostatic balance may help mediate the severity of TLE.

### Perioperative care of patients at high risk for stroke during or after non-cardiac, non-neurological surgery: 2020 guidelines from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^113Fn9aP]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Perioperative stroke — biomarkers and neurophysiological monitoring: S-100β, neuron-specific enolase, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 values vary greatly in the perioperative period and were not significantly elevated in a patient with hypoxic-ischemic injury, and although electroencephalographic slow-wave activity and oscillatory asymmetry correlate with stroke severity and outcomes and high-intensity transient signals from transcranial Doppler can detect cerebral emboli, these measures have not been rigorously tested in noncardiac, nonmajor vascular, or nonneurosurgical patients for detecting cerebral ischemia; accordingly, neither serum-based biomarkers (Level B-NR, Class III: No Benefit) nor neurophysiological monitoring (Level C-EO, Class III: No Benefit) are recommended for clinical detection of perioperative cerebral ischemia.

### Etomidate [^116yRfns]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY & OR TOXICOLOGY

Published studies in animals demonstrate that the use of anesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.

In primates, exposure to 3 hours of an anesthetic regimen that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer increased neuronal cell loss. Data in rodents and in primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with subtle but prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in neonates and young children who require procedures against the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data (See WARNINGS /Pediatric Neurotoxicity, PRECAUTIONS /Pregnancy, Pediatric Use).

### Elevated microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase-1 in Alzheimer's disease [^115vnVc5]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The proinflammatory prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) fluctuates over time in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the cerebral distribution and expression patterns of microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase (mPGES)-1 have not been compared with those of normal human brains.

Methods

Middle frontal gyrus tissue from AD and age-matched control brains was analyzed by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry with mPGES-1-specific antibodies.

Results

Western blotting revealed that mPGES-1 expression was significantly elevated in AD tissue. Furthermore, immunofluorescence of mPGES-1 was observed in neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells of control and AD tissue. Although mPGES-1 was consistently present in astrocytes of control tissue, it was present in only some astrocytes of AD tissue. Immunohistochemical staining suggested that mPGES-1 was elevated in pyramidal neurons of AD tissue when compared with controls.

Conclusions

The results suggest that mPGES-1 is normally expressed constitutively in human neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells but is up-regulated in AD.

### Remote control of neural function by X-ray-induced scintillation [^117Vgqkg]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The total dose of X-irradiation during the behavioral tests is far below the threshold for acute neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the brain. X-irradiation corresponding to the FC (~7 Gy) did not change locomotor behavior (Supplementary Fig. 12) and blood–brain barrier function (Supplementary Fig. 13). In a long-term observation, all the mice that experienced the FC survived for at least 8 weeks after radiation with no significant difference in body weight from non-X-irradiated control mice at the same age (Supplementary Fig. 14a). These results suggest that scintillator-mediated optogenetics can be used for days-long behavioral experiments in mice even with a relatively high dose of radiation. On the other hand, the total body X-irradiation is known to damage radiosensitive cell populations, depending on its cumulative dose. A high-dose X-irradiation reduced the number of immature neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Fig. 6a, b) through apoptotic cell death of neuronal precursor cells, (Supplementary Fig. 15). Consistent with previous reports, hippocampal neurogenesis was partially impaired, and the number of immature neurons was not recovered at 8 weeks after the FC radiation (Fig. 6a, b; Supplementary Fig. 14b–f). However, the PC, which causes considerably less radiation dose (~0.5 Gy), induced neither loss of immature neurons (Fig. 6a, b) nor apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 15) in the hippocampus. Although a high-dose X-irradiation caused an overall reduction in the number of bone marrow cells(Fig. 6c) without specificity of cell-types (Supplementary Fig. 16), the PC rather increased the number of the total bone marrow cells (Fig. 6c) presumably due to radio-resistance effects. Increasing the total radiation dose to ~1.5 Gy (three times the PC dose) significantly reduced the number of immature neurons in the hippocampus (Fig. 6a, b), whereas four times (~2 Gy) or less PC did not reduce the number of total bone marrow cells (Fig. 6c). Thus, reducing the radiation dose to less than two times of PC will allow for the safer application of scintillator-mediated optogenetics.

### Cobblestone malformation in LAMA2 congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) [^113zXVgy]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3.
Cobblestone pathology in the cerebral cortex. The surface contour of the cerebral cortex was pebbled in a diffuse, relatively symmetric distribution that affected all lobes in both hemispheres (A, B). Multifocal sites of dense gliosis were noted along the cerebral cortical surface (C, arrow, H&E stain; pv). A reticulin stain (D) revealed that the pial surface basement membrane was disrupted at these sites of gliosis (arrow). Large, dysmorphic neurons (either side of the arrow, D) were often present at these sites. Coronal sections further revealed that adjacent gyri were partially fused across the intervening sulci (E and F, arrows; left frontal lobe). Superficially displaced neurons were also evident with neuN immunoperoxidase staining (G); subtle abnormal clustering of neurons was also often present within upper layers of the cortex. The bracket in G marks a region of fusion between adjacent gyri; the arrow points to the sulcus. A pv is present within the sulcus. White matter from multiple sites was unremarkable (H, LFB stain; frontal lobe centrum semiovale). The scale bar in panel C is 200 µm for panels C and G, and 100 µm for panels D and H.

### A chronic increase in blood-brain barrier permeability facilitates intraneuronal deposition of exogenous bloodborne amyloid-beta1–42 peptide in the brain and leads to Alzheimer's disease-relevant cognitive changes in a mouse model [^117NUrP9]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
FITC-labeled A β 42 enters the brain parenchyma, shows selective affinity for pyramidal neurons, and is internalized within these cells. A–D) In the cerebral cortex of mice injected with PT and FITC-Aβ 42, FITC-Aβ 42 leaks out from blood vessels (white dashed circle in A) and is selectively internalized in pyramidal neurons (B–D). In neurons, FITC-Aβ 42 was localized within numerous discrete granules in the neuronal perikaryon, suggesting that cell surface-bound FITC-Aβ 42 is internalized and accumulates within a membrane-enclosed compartment. E, F) Background fluorescence in the cerebral cortex of mice not exposed to FITC-Aβ42 [i.e. PT-Sal (E) and Sal-only (F)] mice. No punctate immunofluorescence like FITC-Aβ 42 was seen in PT-Sal (E) and Sal-only (F) mice. PN, Pyramidal neurons: BV, blood vessel; Cap, capillary; PT, Pertussis toxin; Ctx, cerebral cortex. Scale bar = 50μm.

In PT-treated animals injected with unlabeled Aβ 42 (U-Aβ 42) peptide instead of the FITC-labeled peptide, the distribution of U-Aβ 42 in the brain following the long-term treatment course was investigated by bright field immunohistochemistry (red arrows, Fig. 6 A, B). As expected, PT-U-Aβ 42 treated mice demonstrated a U-Aβ 42 distribution of pattern within the brain parenchyma that closely resembled that of FITC-Aβ 42 -injected animals (red arrows, Fig. 6 A, B). Controls injected with saline in place of U-Aβ 42 showed no detectable U-Aβ 42 in the brain parenchyma (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, PT-Sal mice (not injected with U-Aβ 42) also showed increased intraneuronal Aβ 42, although less than that of PT-U-Aβ 42 treated mice, suggesting that endogenous mouse Aβ 42 is also able to enter the brain parenchyma via a compromised BBB and preferentially associate and accumulate within local neurons (Fig. 6 D).

### Pediatric advanced life support. neuroprognostication after pediatric cardiac arrest and ROSC: prediction of good neurological outcome [^111i7jku]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Evidence summary — ILCOR CoSTR 2023 describes that "A 2023 systematic review and Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) (Scholefield et al. 2023a; Berg et al. 2023) by ILCOR evaluated the use of lactate, lactate clearance, acid-base (pH) levels and neuronal biomarkers for the prediction of survival with good neurological or neurodevelopmental outcome after ROC (spontaneous or mechanical) following pediatric cardiac arrest". The review notes that "Newborn infants and patients in hypoxic coma from causes without cardiac arrest (e.g., respiratory arrest, toxidromes, drowning, hanging) were excluded from analysis except when a subpopulation of cardiac arrest patients could be evaluated separately". "Good neurological outcome was defined as a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1, 2 or 3, or a Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale Second edition score ≥ 70".

Perivascular macrophages and juxtavascular microglia — perivascular macrophages (PVMs) occupy perivascular spaces around venules, arterioles, and pial vessels and are not associated with capillaries, whereas juxtavascular microglia lie in parenchyma near vessels, primarily associate with capillaries, contact the capillary basement membrane without intervening astrocytic endfeet, are motile during development, and become predominantly stationary in mature mouse brain.

At the micro-level (single-cell), E/I can reflect the relative amount of excitatory glutamate versus inhibitory GABA synaptic inputs onto a single neuron, or the quantity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on individual cortical neurons and their dynamic configuration along the dendrite through the characteristic length constant of the postsynaptic dendrite. Accordingly, researchers using animal models may characterize E/I at this level by recording from the membrane using clamp recordings. Across a local population of cells, excitation and inhibition operate in unison where the excitatory current may increase while the inhibitory current decreases or the inhibitory current may decrease after a short time delay. Specifically, it has been proposed that the direct coupling between E and I lead to a winnertake-all theta-gamma code. The regulation of E/I balance can be seen to achieve homeostatic optimization supporting specific neuronal functions. The way E/I balance is conceptualized at the meso-level (local populations of neurons) may be a composite of the relative concentration of excitatory versus inhibitory neurotransmitters, and the amount of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons or excitatory versus inhibitory receptors within any local brain region. Inferences at this level can be made by examining cell types within a region of postmortem tissue, or by assessing the relative concentration of neurotransmitters using microdialysis. In living humans, researchers may use proton MRS to obtain a somewhat coarse quantification of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitter concentration within a relatively large volume of the brain (typically cm³ and including both gray and white matter).

At the macro-level E/I can be defined as the population-level activity, the result of large-scale interaction between neurons. This interaction can be examined within local regions or between more distal regions at the global network level. This latter scale of E/I reflects the recurrent connectivity from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which settle into a state of population activity that reflects the balance between the two. The activity of circuits at meso and macro-levels is a composite of this complex underlying neuronal activity — and so meso- and macro-scale processes also reflect neuronal excitation and inhibition at the microscale; for e.g. how EPSP and IPSP generate and reflect the properties that we see in the local field potential. This is likely true when we sum across multiple independent LFPs but also when we tap into specific networks i.e. coordinated long-range connectivity analysis. Having outlined the levels of inference, we suggest that future E/I research should explicitly specify the neuronal level that is being examined.

### Heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and cerebral malformations reflected by rotatin cellular dynamics [^116AcmLi]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The in utero development of the human cerebral cortex, starting at 8 weeks of gestation, is a complex process depending on different developmental steps including neurogenesis, neuronal migration, post-migrational organization and connectivity. Interruption of any of these pathways may result in a malformation of cortical development, classically divided into disorders of neuronal proliferation (e.g. microcephaly or megalencephaly), neuronal migration (e.g. lissencephaly and neuronal heterotopia) and cortical organization (e.g. polymicrogyria). Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a cortical malformation characterized by a reduced brain size at birth with an occipitofrontal circumference of three standard deviations (SD) below the age- and sex-matched norm. Multiple genes involved in pathways of mitotic spindle formation, centrosome and centriole duplication, DNA replication, repair and damage response have been linked to MCPH. Several processes regulating neuronal migration are linked to microtubule structure and function, including participation of centrosomes (the microtubule organizing centre) and primary cilia (microtubule-based sensory organelles). In contrast, the mechanisms leading to cortical organization are heterogeneous and disorganization, as seen in polymicrogyria, has for example been associated with variants of tubulin genes, such as TUBA1A (OMIM#602529), TUBB2B (OMIM#612850), TUBB3 (OMIM#602661) and TUBB (OMIM#191130).

### Reviewing vascular influences on neuronal migration, cortical development, and neurodevelopmental disorders: focus on autism, ADHD and schizophrenia [^111DPaqo]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The contribution of CNS ECs to neurogenesis has been primarily elucidated through in vitro studies. Vascular models that inhibit cerebral vessel growth are not ideal for studying neurogenesis, as a hypoxic environment is known to induce neurogenesis. CNS EC-specific Cre animal models and viral models are now available and can be utilized to study neurovascular interactions and validate the in vitro neurogenesis findings.

Moreover, the interaction between blood cerebral vessels and radially migrating neurons, or projection neurons, is not well studied. During cortical development, the number of projection neurons is significantly higher, and they are in close contact with blood cerebral vessels. According to Segarra et al. cerebral vessels participate in the migration of projection neurons through the Dab1-Reelin pathway. However, an alternative argument suggests that Dab1 EC knockout affects normal vascular development, which may indirectly influence neurogenesis and neuron migration. Additionally, this study did not examine interneurons, leaving it unclear whether the observed effects are general or specific to projection neurons.

Finally, several brain disorders are accompanied by defects in cortical development (e.g. Autism, ADHD, epilepsy). Understanding the vascular role and the precise mechanisms of neurovascular communication that are disturbed in these conditions is crucial. Elucidating these mechanisms can provide insights into how vascular abnormalities contribute to cortical malformations and inform the development of targeted therapies to correct or mitigate these defects. Additionally, many neurological diseases injure the normal cortical layering (e.g. stroke, TBI Alzheimer's disease, and the damage is permanent. NP transplantation can be a promising approach; however, it has not successfully integrated neurons into the desired cortical layers. Several studies have claimed that transplanted NPs stay close to cerebral vessels. However, the adult cerebral vessels likely lack the developmental mechanisms to orchestrate the migration of these NPs in the cortex. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to understand the neurovascular interactions that orchestrate the migration of NPs in the cortex and to utilize these developmental mechanisms to achieve cortical regeneration.

Despite the crucial role of CNS cerebral vessels in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and cortical development, our understanding of their involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and ADHD is still in its infancy. Investigating neuronal or cortical defects in embryonic vascular models is essential for gaining deeper insights into these diseases. Additionally, testing new vascular deletion models is important for elucidating their significance in the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

### The role of dietary antioxidant insufficiency on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier [^1165QKRH]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Our previous studies implicated vitamin E deficiency as a risk factor for equine motor neuron disease, a possible model of human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and showed direct effects of this deficiency on brain vascular endothelium. To gain better understanding of the pathogenesis of equine motor neuron disease, we determined the effects of dietary antioxidant insufficiency and the resultant brain tissue oxidative stress on blood-brain barrier permeability. Rats (n = 40) were maintained on a diet deficient of vitamin E for 36 to 43 weeks; 40 controls were fed a normal diet. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier in the cerebral cortex was investigated using rhodamine B, and lipid peroxidation was measured as a marker for oxidative stress. Animals on the vitamin E-deficient diet showed less weight gain and had higher brain lipid peroxidation compared with the controls. Fluorometric studies demonstrated greater rhodamine B in the perivascular compartment and central nervous system parenchyma in rats on the deficient diet compared with controls. These results suggest that a deficiency in vitamin E increases brain tissue oxidative stress and impairs the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. These observations may have relevance to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurologic diseases.

### Quantitative functional imaging of the brain: towards mapping neuronal activity by BOLD fMRI [^115g7Hkc]. NMR in Biomedicine (2001). Low credibility.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) measurements of energy metabolism (i.e. cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption, CMR(O2)), blood circulation (i.e. cerebral blood flow, CBF, and volume, CBV), and functional MRI (fMRI) signal over a wide range of neuronal activity and pharmacological treatments are used to interpret the neurophysiologic basis of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) image-contrast at 7 T in glutamatergic neurons of rat cerebral cortex. Multi-modal MRI and MRS measurements of CMR(O2), CBF, CBV and BOLD signal (both gradient-echo and spin-echo) are used to interpret the neuroenergetic basis of BOLD image-contrast. Since each parameter that can influence the BOLD image-contrast is measured quantitatively and separately, multi-modal measurements of changes in CMR(O2), CBF, CBV, BOLD fMRI signal allow calibration and validation of the BOLD image-contrast. Good agreement between changes in CMR(O2) calculated from BOLD theory and measured by (13)C MRS, reveals that BOLD fMRI signal-changes at 7 T are closely linked with alterations in neuronal glucose oxidation, both for activation and deactivation paradigms. To determine the neurochemical basis of BOLD, pharmacological treatment with lamotrigine, which is a neuronal voltage-dependent Na(+) channel blocker and neurotransmitter glutamate release inhibitor, is used in a rat forepaw stimulation model. Attenuation of the functional changes in CBF and BOLD with lamotrigine reveals that the fMRI signal is associated with release of glutamate from neurons, which is consistent with a link between neurotransmitter cycling and energy metabolism. Comparisons of CMR(O2) and CBF over a wide dynamic range of neuronal activity provide insight into the regulation of energy metabolism and oxygen delivery in the cerebral cortex. The current results reveal the energetic and physiologic components of the BOLD fMRI signal and indicate the required steps towards mapping neuronal activity quantitatively by fMRI at steady-state. Consequences of these results from rat brain for similar calibrated BOLD fMRI studies in the human brain are discussed.

### Genetic dissection of the glutamatergic neuron system in cerebral cortex [^114kqeQX]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Diverse types of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons mediate the myriad processing streams and output channels of the cerebral cortex, yet all derive from neural progenitors of the embryonic dorsal telencephalon. Here we establish genetic strategies and tools for dissecting and fate-mapping subpopulations of pyramidal neurons on the basis of their developmental and molecular programs. We leverage key transcription factors and effector genes to systematically target temporal patterning programs in progenitors and differentiation programs in postmitotic neurons. We generated over a dozen temporally inducible mouse Cre and Flp knock-in driver lines to enable the combinatorial targeting of major progenitor types and projection classes. Combinatorial strategies confer viral access to subsets of pyramidal neurons defined by developmental origin, marker expression, anatomical location and projection targets. These strategies establish an experimental framework for understanding the hierarchical organization and developmental trajectory of subpopulations of pyramidal neurons that assemble cortical processing networks and output channels.

### Mutations in ARFGEF2 implicate vesicle trafficking in neural progenitor proliferation and migration in the human cerebral cortex [^1178sect]. Nature Genetics (2004). Medium credibility.

Disruption of human neural precursor proliferation can give rise to a small brain (microcephaly), and failure of neurons to migrate properly can lead to an abnormal arrest of cerebral cortical neurons in proliferative zones near the lateral ventricles (periventricular heterotopia). Here we show that an autosomal recessive condition characterized by microcephaly and periventricular heterotopia maps to chromosome 20 and is caused by mutations in the gene ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide-exchange factor-2 (ARFGEF2). By northern-blot analysis, we found that mouse Arfgef2 mRNA levels are highest during embryonic periods of ongoing neuronal proliferation and migration, and by in situ hybridization, we found that the mRNA is widely distributed throughout the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). ARFGEF2 encodes the large (> 200 kDa) brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited GEF2 protein (BIG2), which is required for vesicle and membrane trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Inhibition of BIG2 by BFA, or by a dominant negative ARFGEF2 cDNA, decreases cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting a cell-autonomous regulation of neural expansion. Inhibition of BIG2 also disturbed the intracellular localization of such molecules as E-cadherin and beta-catenin by preventing their transport from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. Our findings show that vesicle trafficking is an important regulator of proliferation and migration during human cerebral cortical development.

### Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ns-398 protects neuronal cultures from lipopolysaccharide-induced neurotoxicity [^113b7Cge]. Stroke (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The prostanoid-synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is markedly upregulated after cerebral ischemia and may participate in the mechanisms by which postischemic inflammation contributes to the late stages of ischemic brain injury. In the present study, we sought to provide additional evidence for a role of COX-2 in the mechanisms of neurotoxicity associated with inflammation.

Methods

Nine-day-old neuronal-glial cultures, prepared from the cerebral cortex of newborn C57BL/6J mice, were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent proinflammatory agent. The contribution of COX-2 was investigated by using the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398.

Results

LPS produced a dose-dependent (0.001 to 10 microg/mL) and selective neuronal death that was well developed 72 hours after treatment. The effect was associated with a marked increase in the concentration of the COX reaction product prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). NS-398 (10 micromol/L) blocked the PGE(2) increase, attenuated the TNF-alpha increase, and prevented the neuronal death produced by LPS. TNF-alpha-blocking antibodies attenuated LPS-induced neuronal death, but the protection was less pronounced than that afforded by NS-398. LPS failed to elevate PGE(2) or to produce cell death in neuron-enriched cultures, suggesting that glial cells are required for these effects.

Conclusions

COX-2, in part through TNF-alpha-related mechanisms, contributes to LPS-induced neuronal death. The data support the hypothesis that COX-2, in addition to its role in glutamate excitotoxicity, participates in the cytotoxicity associated with inflammation.

### Leptomeningeal neurons are a common finding in infants and are increased in sudden infant death syndrome [^111rbReW]. Acta Neuropathologica (2009). Low credibility.

Developmental abnormalities of the brain, in particular, the brainstem potentially affecting centers for breathing, circulation and sleep regulation, are thought to be involved in the etiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In order to investigate whether leptomeningeal neurons could serve as morphological indicators for a developmental failure or retardation in cerebral maturation, we evaluated the density of isolated leptomeningeal neurons (without associated glia) in 15 brain regions of 24 SIDS and 8 control cases, representing part of the German Study on sudden infant death. Leptomeningeal neurons were encountered in 79% of SIDS and 68% of control cases. More leptomeningeal neurons in SIDS versus control cases were found in lower pons (p = 0.002), upper pons (p = 0.016), cerebellar hemispheres (p = 0.012), lower medulla oblongata (p = 0.039), and temporal lobe (p = 0.041). Summarizing the data according to gross anatomical region of origin (i.e., brainstem, cerebellum or cerebrum), higher numbers of leptomeningeal neurons in SIDS cases were only found in the brainstem (p = 0.006 vs. 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). Our data show that single leptomeningeal neurons are present in most normal infantile brains. The age-dependent increase of leptomeningeal neurons among SIDS cases may either (a) represent a delayed maturation or retardation, i.e., a later or slower reduction of neurons or a delayed peak in occurrence (shift toward an older age), or (b) may be interpreted as a generally increased occurrence of leptomeningeal neurons among SIDS cases as a result of a diffuse developmental abnormality during central nervous system maturation.

### Co-dependent excitatory and inhibitory plasticity accounts for quick, stable and long-lasting memories in biological networks [^1158QPsU]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

To investigate the network's response to perturbations, we delivered various stimulus patterns to the network (Methods). Before the external stimulation, network neurons were in a state of self-sustained activity, not receiving any external input. During a 1-s stimulation, used to perturb the network's dynamics, each of the neurons received external excitatory spikes with a constant, pattern-specific and neuron-specific firing rate (Methods). Randomly selected stimulus patterns (uniformly distributed firing rates) resulted in relatively muted responses (Fig. 8a, b, 'stimulus R'. similar to the naive network responses (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). To identify specific patterns that affected the firing rate dynamics more greatly, we calculated a hypothetical impact of a neuron on the network dynamics, defined as its baseline firing rate (in the self-sustained state) multiplied by its total output weights (according to Fig. 7g, j), giving us a measure of how much a variation in firing rate of a particular neuron would affect the network. To quantify observed network responses, we calculated the ℓ₂-norm of the firing rate deviations from baseline, which takes into account both positive and negative deviations from baseline equally (that is, it is the sum of the square of the individual firing rates minus the baseline; Methods), allowing us to find large transients even when the rate deviations were increased and decreased in equal amounts. The most impactful perturbation stimuli were observed in a network with asymmetric E-E connectivity (Fig. 7f–h). Here, individual neuron responses ranged from small firing rate deflections to large, transient events during or after the delivery of the stimulus that could last several seconds (Fig. 8a, b, 'stimuli 1–4'), similar to in vivo recordings during sensory activity and movement productionin mammalian systems. The maximum response amplitude resulted from a stimulation pattern in which excitatory neurons with big hypothetical impact and inhibitory neurons with small hypothetical impact received the strong excitatory input currents (Fig. 8a, b, 'stimulus 1'). Other combinations (for example, shuffling 75% of the 'stimulus 1' pattern; Methods) generated intermediate response amplitudes (Fig. 8a, b, 'stimuli 2–4'). Both naive networks and networks with symmetric connectivity (Fig. 7i, α = 0.9 and α = 1.4) failed to generate large deviations from baseline after stimulus offset (Extended Data Fig. 10), confirming that co-dependent plasticity shaped the connectivity structure to allow for transient amplification. Finally, the activity of transiently amplified population dynamics could be used to control the activity of a readout network with two output units to draw complex patterns (Fig. 8c, d).

### Distinct manifestations of excitatory-inhibitory imbalance associated with amyloid-β and tau in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^113KjVi6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This is a clinical investigation to characterize the associations between aberrant neural circuit activity, AD proteinopathy, and hypometabolism, providing critical insights into the distinct roles of Aβ and tau in E/I imbalance in patients with AD. Our findings demonstrate that E/I imbalance in AD involves aberrant intrinsic neuronal and synaptic processes, as well as deficits in long-range synaptic input integration, indicating abnormalities across different levels of neural circuit organization. In AD patients, Aβ pathology was associated with both types of E/I dysfunction: intrinsic neuronal/synaptic abnormalities, reflected in altered neural excitability, and deficits in long-range input integration, reflected in increased neural fragility. In contrast, tau pathology distinctly correlated with neural excitability, highlighting its role in aberrant local neuronal and synaptic processes contributing to E/I imbalance. Furthermore, neural excitability was tightly correlated with regional hypometabolism, independent of tau burden. A key finding was the selective increase in neural fragility in AD-EPI+ compared to AD-EPI −, indicating distinct E/I abnormalities associated with the AD epileptic phenotype. These findings highlight the distinct mechanisms of E/I imbalance associated with Aβ and tau pathology and the potential of targeting specific manifestations to enable precise therapeutic interventions to improve cognitive outcomes in AD.

### Synaptic scaling rule preserves excitatory-inhibitory balance and salient neuronal network dynamics [^116DeQ1o]. Nature Neuroscience (2016). Medium credibility.

The balance between excitation and inhibition (E-I balance) is maintained across brain regions though the network size, strength and number of synaptic connections, and connection architecture may vary substantially. We use a culture preparation to examine the homeostatic synaptic scaling rules that produce E-I balance and in vivo-like activity. We show that synaptic strength scales with the number of connections K as ∼, close to the ideal theoretical value. Using optogenetic techniques, we delivered spatiotemporally patterned stimuli to neurons and confirmed key theoretical predictions: E-I balance is maintained, active decorrelation occurs and the spiking correlation increases with firing rate. Moreover, the trial-to-trial response variability decreased during stimulation, as observed in vivo. These results-obtained in generic cultures, predicted by theory and observed in the intact brain-suggest that the synaptic scaling rule and resultant dynamics are emergent properties of networks in general.

### Age-related dysregulation of homeostatic control in neuronal microcircuits [^111ihvpA]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

Increased excitatory synaptic strength without a balanced change in inhibition may drive the heightened neuronal activity we measured in vivo in late adult animals after overstimulation (Fig. 2a–k). We tested the correlation between synaptic plasticity (structural E:I ratio; Methods) and estimates of neuronal activity (using c-Fos) on a cell-by-cell basis. We found an age-related increase in c-Fos intensity after overstimulation positively correlated with the structural synaptic E:I ratio (Fig. 3h). Our results suggest that in 12-month-old animals, overstimulation increases the E:I ratio, as opposed to the decrease seen in young adult animals (Fig. 3a). The increased E:I ratio is due to reduced inhibitory synaptic plasticity and a shift from excitatory synaptic weakening to strengthening after overstimulation (Fig. 3i).

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113WiZJb]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Single-cell studies — The section highlights that cell type– and subtype-specific marker genes have generally been defined by studying healthy young mice and that more work is needed to confirm their validity across brain regions, age, sex, species, and disease states. It states that although cell type–specific Cre-driver mouse lines have become indispensable in neurovascular studies, they lack the specificity to allow targeting of subclusters of vascular cell types, and intersectional approaches using mice harboring > 1 recombinase are still needed to obtain cellular specificity for some vascular cell types. It adds that investigations of the proteome, epigenome, lipidome, and metabolome in different brain regions, as well as gray matter versus WM, would be valuable because these approaches are essential to elucidate the functional role of vascular cell subclusters.

### Oxidized proteins in astrocytes generated in a hyperbaric atmosphere induce neuronal apoptosis [^115KjQGR]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2007). Low credibility.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the oxidative damage to astrocytes on neuronal cell survival using cultures of rat cerebral astrocytes and neurons. The exposure of astrocytes to hyperbaric oxygen induced a time-dependent apoptotic cell death, as observed by DNA ladder assessment. When astrocytes damaged by oxidative stress were cocultured with normal neurons from the cerebrum of a newborn rat, neuronal cell death was markedly induced, although normal astrocytes not subjected to hyperoxia cocultured with normal neurons showed no neuronal cell apoptosis. It was found that either the supernatant from the homogenate of astrocytes cultured in hyperbaric oxygen atmosphere or a protein mixture extracted from the supernatant induced neuronal cell death. The level of protein carbonyls, an index of protein oxidation analysis, in cultured astrocytes increased significantly with oxidative stress, and vitamin E inhibited the increase in the level of such oxidized proteins in astrocytes. Furthermore, a two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis of a protein mixture extracted from the supernatant showed several changes in proteins. These results imply that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxidative stress attack astrocytes to induce oxidatively denatured proteins in the cells that act as a neurotoxic factor, and that vitamin E protects neurons by inhibiting astrocyte apoptosis caused by oxidative stress.

### Synaptic inputs from stroke-injured brain to grafted human stem cell-derived neurons activated by sensory stimuli [^111T6Mvy]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Transplanted neurons derived from stem cells have been proposed to improve function in animal models of human disease by various mechanisms such as neuronal replacement. However, whether the grafted neurons receive functional synaptic inputs from the recipient's brain and integrate into host neural circuitry is unknown. Here we studied the synaptic inputs from the host brain to grafted cortical neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells after transplantation into stroke-injured rat cerebral cortex. Using the rabies virus-based trans-synaptic tracing method and immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that the grafted neurons receive direct synaptic inputs from neurons in different host brain areas located in a pattern similar to that of neurons projecting to the corresponding endogenous cortical neurons in the intact brain. Electrophysiological in vivo recordings from the cortical implants show that physiological sensory stimuli, i.e. cutaneous stimulation of nose and paw, can activate or inhibit spontaneous activity in grafted neurons, indicating that at least some of the afferent inputs are functional. In agreement, we find using patch-clamp recordings that a portion of grafted neurons respond to photostimulation of virally transfected, channelrhodopsin-2-expressing thalamo-cortical axons in acute brain slices. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that the host brain regulates the activity of grafted neurons, providing strong evidence that transplanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons can become incorporated into injured cortical circuitry. Our findings support the idea that these neurons could contribute to functional recovery in stroke and other conditions causing neuronal loss in cerebral cortex.

### Default-mode network functional connectivity is closely related to metabolic activity [^113zETX2]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

Resting‐state functional connectivity research has advanced our understanding of brain function in healthy subjects and clinical disorders. However, its underlying neurophysiological and metabolic mechanisms are still not completely understood [e.g. Brookes et al. 2011, Raichle, 2010, Wehrl et al. 2013, Wu et al. 2009]. Measuring more directly neuronal activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), Brookes et al. (2011) have shown a significant similarity between RSNs derived from MEG and fMRI supporting a neuronal basis of these hemodynamic networks. Further, the BOLD signal is triggered by the metabolic demands of increased brain activation. During neuronal activity, increases in blood flow are paralleled by increases in local glucose and oxygen consumption. About 80–90% of the total cortical glucose consumption is used for supplying energy to excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission [e.g. Bonvento et al. 2002; Lauritzen, 2005; Logothetis and Wandell, 2004; Shulman et al. 2001]. Thus, the BOLD signal is based on interactions between cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO 2) and glucose (CMRGlc), cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume [e.g. Buxton et al. 1998; Heeger and Ress, 2002; Raichle, 1987, 2010] that are in turn related to glutamatergic neurotransmission and there is a considerable interest in elucidating this complex interplay.

### Evolutionary changes leading to efficient glymphatic circulation in the mammalian brain [^112PkrDt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The cerebral cortex leads to increased CSF exposure in cortical neurons

We next applied our model to the larger brains of monkeys and humans. We used images of monkey and human brains that are available online (monkey; human, 10.1038/s41597-019-0254-8 and 10.3389/fnana.2020.536838) (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Failure of clearance mechanisms — impaired perivascular clearance is implicated in neurological disorders, with reduced tracer movement observed in experimental models including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microinfarcts, apolipoprotein E isoforms trafficking, and hypertension; shared impaired vessel function and, in patients with cerebral small-vessel disease, loss of vessel function may contribute to accumulation of proteins such as Aβ in vessel walls, potentially causing a feed-forward cycle of smooth muscle cell loss, impaired clearance, continued protein buildup, and eventual vessel wall breakdown with ischemia or hemorrhage; deeper understanding may clarify roles in cognitive dysfunction and reveal intervention targets.

### Effects of hypoglycaemia on neuronal metabolism in the adult brain: role of alternative substrates to glucose [^1164shTs]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is characterized by decreased blood glucose levels and is associated with different pathologies (e.g. diabetes, inborn errors of metabolism). Depending on its severity, it might affect cognitive functions, including impaired judgment and decreased memory capacity, which have been linked to alterations of brain energy metabolism. Glucose is the major cerebral energy substrate in the adult brain and supports the complex metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes, which are essential for synaptic activity. Therefore, hypoglycaemia disturbs cerebral metabolism and, consequently, neuronal function. Despite the high vulnerability of neurons to hypoglycaemia, important neurochemical changes enabling these cells to prolong their resistance to hypoglycaemia have been described. This review aims at providing an overview over the main metabolic effects of hypoglycaemia on neurons, covering in vitro and in vivo findings. Recent studies provided evidence that non-glucose substrates including pyruvate, glycogen, ketone bodies, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate, are metabolized by neurons in the absence of glucose and contribute to prolong neuronal function and delay ATP depletion during hypoglycaemia. One of the pathways likely implicated in the process is the pyruvate recycling pathway, which allows for the full oxidation of glutamate and glutamine. The operation of this pathway in neurons, particularly after hypoglycaemia, has been re-confirmed recently using metabolic modelling tools (i.e. Metabolic Flux Analysis), which allow for a detailed investigation of cellular metabolism in cultured cells. Overall, the knowledge summarized herein might be used for the development of potential therapies targeting neuronal protection in patients vulnerable to hypoglycaemic episodes.

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114VYm9N]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Need for integrated approaches in neurovascular biology and cognitive impairment emphasizes that neurovascular biology in relation to cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases has been explored only in discrete studies and specialized contexts, leaving a comprehensive understanding elusive. It states that technical advances to explore neurovascular function in vivo at the cellular and molecular levels, coupled with cutting edge imaging modalities to probe both cerebrovascular and brain function in humans, provide the bases for potentially transformative leaps in elucidating the role of vascular health in brain health at the mechanistic level. The statement calls for an ideal research approach that is sufficiently comprehensive to support exploration of the integrated brain system together, rather than specialists focusing on their own individual elements: neurons, astrocytes, vascular cells, inflammation, and cell lineage tracing. It adds that the resulting discoveries could inspire human interventions in collaboration with vascular neurologists, neurointensivists, and neurosurgeons, and highlights the opportunity to examine neurovascular interactions from the developmental-cellular-molecular level to the network-system-organ level in health and disease by bringing together technologies, approaches, and expertise from different fields to gain an understanding unattainable within a single discipline.

### Cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease: the expression of amyloid-beta and apolipoprotein E in human hippocampus [^111HVa9y]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Growing evidence suggests a synergistic and perhaps etiological relationship between vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Moreover, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has also been shown to be associated with AD and cerebral ischemia. It seems that cerebral ischemia may play an important, both direct and indirect, role in the pathogenesis of AD. We investigated the expression and distribution of Abeta1–40, beta1–42 and ApoE in human hippocampus after cerebral ischemia in this study to determine the role of cerebral ischemia in Alzheimer's disease. Our study has demonstrated that the accumulation of both Abeta1–40 and beta1–42 were increased dramatically and consistently after cerebral ischemia. Neuronal ApoE immunoreactivity was also significantly increased in all ischemic groups compared with controls. The most likely stimulus for the increased Abeta1–40, Abeta1–42 and ApoE immunoreactivity in the CA1 and CA3 neurons is the ischemic conditions, and their upregulation, in turn, may partly explain the contribution of cerebral ischemia to the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore our observations provide a basis for establishing therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing ischemic insults and subsequent neurodegeneration in AD.

### Functions and dysfunctions of neocortical inhibitory neuron subtypes [^113ByiPJ]. Nature Neuroscience (2017). Medium credibility.

Neocortical inhibitory neurons exhibit remarkably diverse morphology, physiological properties and connectivity. Genetic access to molecularly defined subtypes of inhibitory neurons has aided their functional characterization in recent years. These studies have established that, instead of simply balancing excitatory neuron activity, inhibitory neurons actively shape excitatory circuits in a subtype-specific manner. We review the emerging view that inhibitory neuron subtypes perform context-dependent modulation of excitatory activity, as well as regulate experience-dependent plasticity of excitatory circuits. We then review the roles of neuromodulators in regulating the subtype-specific functions of inhibitory neurons. Finally, we discuss the idea that dysfunctions of inhibitory neuron subtypes may be responsible for various aspects of neurological disorders.

### Disorders of intermediary metabolism: toxic leukoencephalopathies [^116YyzoJ]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Myelination starts in the latter half of gestation. It is initiated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Three sequential steps can be distinguished: (1) initial ensheathment of axons by premyelin sheaths generated by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells; (2) initial insertion of myelin basic protein (MBP) into transitional sheaths; and (3) generation of mature MBP-rich myelin. Different inborn errors of metabolism can interfere with different stages of these physiological processes, causing white-matter diseases, i.e. toxic leukoencephalopathies. Some inborn errors of metabolism disturb the formation of myelin by being toxic to oligodendrocytes or by interference with the biosynthesis of cholesterol and lipids, e.g. globoid cell leukodystrophy and phenylketonuria. Remethylation defects, e.g. methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, cobalamin C, D, E, F and G defects, interfere with the expression, processing and insertion of MBP. The concept of excitotoxicity, which has been developed in neurons, has recently been modified and has been extended to the oligodendroglial lineage. Mitochondriopathies and cerebral organic acid disorders may cause secondary excitotoxicity resulting in toxic encephalopathies, which may affect both neurons and oligodendrocytes. This review aims to present relevant diseases, summarizing recent knowledge on mechanisms and formulating testable hypotheses of pathophysiology leading to new and improved treatment strategies.

### Pyramidal cell regulation of interneuron survival sculpts cortical networks [^111kkzjo]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Complex neuronal circuitries such as those found in the mammalian cerebral cortex have evolved as balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Although the establishment of appropriate numbers of these cells is essential for brain function and behaviour, our understanding of this fundamental process is limited. Here we show that the survival of interneurons in mice depends on the activity of pyramidal cells in a critical window of postnatal development, during which excitatory synaptic input to individual interneurons predicts their survival or death. Pyramidal cells regulate interneuron survival through the negative modulation of PTEN signalling, which effectively drives interneuron cell death during this period. Our findings indicate that activity-dependent mechanisms dynamically adjust the number of inhibitory cells in nascent local cortical circuits, ultimately establishing the appropriate proportions of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cerebral cortex.

### Ketamine hydrochloride [^114oB4Qk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology

Published studies in animals demonstrate that the use of anesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.

In primates, exposure to 3 hours of an anesthetic regimen that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer increased neuronal cell loss. Data in rodents and in primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with subtle but prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in neonates and young children who require procedures against the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)].

In published studies, intraperitoneal administration of ketamine at doses greater than 40 mg/kg induced vacuolation in neuronal cells of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices in adult rats, similar to what has been reported in rodents administered other NMDA receptor antagonists. These vacuoles were demonstrated to be reversible and did not progress to degeneration or neuronal death up to doses of 80 mg/kg (1.2 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg based on body surface area). A no-effect level for neuronal vacuolation was 20 mg/kg intraperitoneal (0.3 times a human dose of 10 mg/kg on a body surface area basis). The window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in humans from the onset of puberty through adulthood. The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown.

### The neurovasculome: key roles in brain health and cognitive impairment: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111bBnVa]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Neurovasculature and brain health background notes that disturbances in blood flow delivery and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability appear to occur before the onset of symptoms and before evidence of neurodegeneration, and autopsy studies have found brain infarcts in almost half of patients diagnosed with AD during life with many brains showing atherosclerosis or arteriolosclerosis. Improved cardiovascular health has been shown to correlate with improved brain health and reduced incidence of dementia later in life. Reflecting high energy demands, blood is delivered by an intricate network of blood vessels stretching > 400 miles that are densely packed into the brain substance. Over the past decade, close interactions between brain and vascular cells have culminated in the establishment of the neurovascular unit concept.

### The novel brain penetrant ataxia-telangiectasia mutated inhibitor WSD0628 provides robust radiosensitization of brain tumor patient-derived xenografts [^113MqUYB]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Brain metastases often are treated with a single, high dose of radiation using radiosurgery. Therefore, we evaluated the integration of WSD0628 with a "radiosurgical" dose of radiation (12.5 Gy) in a melanoma brain metastatic PDX — M12. Radiation alone significantly extended median survival compared to sham treatment (39 and 17 days, respectively; p = 0.004; Figure 5C). Because the duration of DNA repair may extend beyond 24 hours following high doses of radiation, WSD0628 was dosed just prior to radiation and then 24 hours later. This combination resulted in profound prolongation in survival with 4 of 5 mice euthanized at 190 days without clinical signs of tumor burden (P = 0.002 relative to RT only), and H&E analysis of brains in this study demonstrated tumor control in all mice treated with combination therapy (Figure 5D; Supplementary Table 4). In these combination therapy mice, a small number of residual melanoma cells were admixed with numerous melanin-laden macrophages (melanophages), highlighted by CD68 immunostain. Within this "scar" region, modest GFAP staining intensity was consistent with reactive gliosis (Figure 5E). To assess the potential impact of radiation combined with WSD0628 on neuronal toxicity, the density of NeuN-positive neurons was quantitated in the contralateral basal ganglia and compared to untreated athymic nude mice. This demonstrated no significant difference in NeuN-positive cells across the 3 treatment groups (P = 0.36 between RT alone vs WSD0628 + RT; Figure 5E /F). Collectively, these data highlight the potential for profound enhancement of radiation sensitivity without notable enhancement in neuronal toxicity.

### Local structural balance and functional interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal dendrites [^114FRWE2]. Nature Neuroscience (2004). Medium credibility.

Theoretical and experimental studies on the computation of neural networks suggest that neural computation results from a dynamic interplay of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic inputs. Precisely how E/I synapses are organized structurally and functionally to facilitate meaningful interaction remains elusive. Here we show that E/I synapses are regulated across dendritic trees to maintain a constant ratio of inputs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. This structural arrangement is accompanied by an E/I functional balance maintained by a 'push-pull' feedback regulatory mechanism that is capable of adjusting E/I efficacies in a coordinated fashion. We also found that during activity, inhibitory synapses can determine the impact of adjacent excitatory synapses only if they are colocalized on the same dendritic branch and are activated simultaneously. These fundamental relationships among E/I synapses provide organizational principles relevant to deciphering the structural and functional basis for neural computation within dendritic branches.

### Tracking the evolution of epialleles during neural differentiation and brain development: D-aspartate oxidase as a model gene [^115ktXXW]. Epigenetics (2017). Low credibility.

Specific epiallele patterns distinguish different purified brain cell populations

The high degree of epipolymorphism found both in total brain and separated brain areas could be potentially explained by cellular heterogeneity. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether different purified brain cells, namely neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglial cells, displayed cell type-specific methylation features. First, we performed quantitative methylation analysis and showed that different cell types exhibited different average methylation degree, with astrocytes being the less methylated and microglial cells the most methylated (Fig. 6A). Analysis of epiallele frequency distribution indicated that, as was also observed in separated brain areas, that higher average methylation levels were associated with higher percentage of hypermethylated epihaplotypes [see, as an example, microglia (green line) vs. astrocytes (purple line) in Fig. 6B]. Conversely, lower average methylation was associated with higher frequency of specific mono- and di-methylated conformations. However, specific epialleles, although enriched at different degrees, showed peaks that were clearly coincident across cell types and, for the most part, also with peaks observed in whole brain tissue samples (compare Figs. 4 and 5). These observations again point to the existence of a hierarchy among epialleles that is highly conserved across different brain derived cells. In summary, we confirmed that most of the methylation rules observed in brain tissues applied also for isolated brain cells, including the high percentage of intermediate epialleles, high degree of epipolymorphism, and high conservation of epialleles frequency among the same type of cells among individuals. Our data strongly suggest that, within a cell population, either in whole brain, separated brain areas, or isolated primary cells, the epiallele frequency distribution occurs in a non-stochastic manner. In particular, we observed a spatial specificity by means of some CpG sites (−363, −330, −242) being prone and some (−318, −125, −175) being more resistant to methylation. However, in a subset of cells for each lineage, in a proportion consistent with the level of average methylation, methylation spread from susceptible sites by recruiting nearby CpGs, increasing the number of molecules in which resistant CpGs became methylated. In the future, it would be particularly intriguing to explore the potential contribution of epiallele distribution analysis to the reliable evaluation of cell function and cell type-specific enrichment in given areas, during lifetime and/or in pathological conditions.

The generation and targeting of appropriate numbers and types of neurons to where they are needed in the brain is essential for the establishment, maintenance and modification of neural circuitry.

### GABA excitation in the adult brain: a mechanism for excitation-neurogenesis coupling [^114coLaM]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

The production of new neurons in the adult hippocampus is exquisitely regulated, and alterations in this process may underlie both normal and pathological hippocampal function. In this issue of Neuron, Tozuka et al. describe electrophysiological recordings that target proliferating progenitor cells in adult mouse hippocampal slices. They report that GABAergic synaptic inputs directly depolarize the proliferating progenitors, thereby activating molecular players that favor neuronal differentiation and providing a mechanism for direct excitation-neurogenesis coupling in vivo.

### Sub-threshold neuronal activity and the dynamical regime of cerebral cortex [^117TWXsu]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Spiking neuronal network

We consider a network of N E excitatory and N I inhibitory neurons randomly connected. We denote by Λ the adjacency matrix of the network connectivity, defined aswith probability p a = K a / N a andotherwise. Here, a, b ∈ { E, I } and i, j = 1. N a. Each neuron thus receives, on average, K E and K I synaptic inputs.

Neurons are modeled as leaky integrate-and-fire elements. The membrane potential of neuron (i, a), obeyswhere C is the capacitance, is the leak current whose reversal potential is V l and g l the leak conductance. Whenever the voltage reaches a threshold, it is reset to.

Following the reduction procedure explained above, the recurrent input, into neuron (i, a) is modeled aswhere E b is the synaptic reversal potential and:Here, τ s y n is the synaptic time constant and the sum is over all spikes emitted by neuron (j, b) at times t j b < t.

As in Eq. (12), the parameterinterpolates the synapses from being fully conductance synapses to fully current synapses. The parametermodels the attenuation of the synaptic activity as a function of its distance from the soma, with smallfor synapses that are far from the soma. Note that results of multi-compartment simulations shows thatandare correlated. Yet, in the homogeneous case, for whichand synaptic strengths are the same for all neurons within a population (Figs. S5–6), we absorb the parameter α into the synaptic strengths, g a b.

Importantly, in the mean-field limit, the sub-threshold voltage distributions only depend on the mean and variance of the changes in synaptic conductance, and not on their specific distributions (e.g. uniform or log-normal). Thus, for simplicity, the synaptic conductances in our model, depend only on the population types (, withindependent of the number of connections). In fact, even in this case, because of the distribution of, there is a distribution of EPSPs and IPSPs values.

Finally, we model the external input, aswithbeing a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unity variance andis of. Here, to simplify simulations, we modeled the feed-forward synapses with an average parameter ρ e x t and absorbed the attenuation parameter into the input strength.

iPSC-derived 3D cerebral organoids mimic human fetal brain development and contain organized tissue

Cerebral organoids could recapitulate human brain development at a considerable level of detail in many aspects such as the establishment of discrete regions (e.g. forebrain and choroid plexus) of the central nervous system. Cerebral organoids were most similar to layers of neurons called the cortex and choroid plexus. Our following data showed the consistent results with previous reports on iPSC-derived cerebral organoids. The 2-month cerebral organoids exhibit well-organized elaborate cellular laminar organization and architectures, i.e. neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons were located in the different layers of the organoid tissues. SOX2-positive NSCs were located on the apical side and differentiated MAP2-positive neurons from NSCs were located on the basal side (Fig. 1E-a). Neuronal cells did also express the neuronal markers CTIP2 and FOXP2 (Figs. 1 E-b and 1E-c, respectively). CTIP2 identifies migrating neurons and deep cortical layers V/VI, whereas FOXP2 expression in the developing cortex is restricted to subpopulations of post-mitotic neurons in deep cortical layers (V/VI). These elaborate cellular laminar organization and architectures are very similar to what was observed in human brains –. Moreover, the organoids contained forebrain- and choroid plexus-like brain regions (Fig. 1F-a and b, respectively).

Neurocritical Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Cerebral microdialysis for cerebral metabolism — Brain metabolism in humans can be monitored at bedside using cerebral microdialysis, and brain extracellular concentrations of energy metabolism markers, including lactate, pyruvate, and glucose, are accurately measured by microdialysis. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), cerebral microdialysis may contribute to prognostication and abnormalities appear to be associated with long-term tissue damage, and in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) microdialysis may provide insight into local energy substrate delivery and on markers of delayed cerebral ischemia. Cerebral microdialysis has an excellent safety record, but it is a focal measurement with different metabolite concentrations when inserted in pathological versus preserved brain areas, so microdialysis should be interpreted on the basis of location defined by post-insertion CT. Metabolite collection also occurs over time (e.g., 60 min) and so data is delayed rather than real-time, and when used with other monitors microdialysis can enhance understanding of brain physiology and provide novel insights into pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment modalities that directly affect brain metabolism and function.

### The hyh mutation uncovers roles for alpha snap in apical protein localization and control of neural cell fate [^117A6aKB]. Nature Genetics (2004). Medium credibility.

The hyh (hydrocephalus with hop gait) mouse shows a markedly small cerebral cortex at birth and dies postnatally from progressive enlargement of the ventricular system. Here we show that the small hyh cortex reflects altered cell fate. Neural progenitor cells withdraw prematurely from the cell cycle, producing more early-born, deep-layer cerebral cortical neurons but depleting the cortical progenitor pool, such that late-born, upper-layer cortical neurons are underproduced, creating a small cortex. hyh mice carry a hypomorphic missense mutation in the gene Napa encoding soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein alpha (alpha Snap), involved in SNAP receptor (SNARE)-mediated vesicle fusion in many cellular contexts. A targeted null Napa mutation is embryonically lethal. Altered neural cell fate is accompanied by abnormal localization of many apical proteins implicated in regulation of neural cell fate, including E-cadherin, beta-catenin, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and INADL (inactivation-no-afterpotential D-like, also known as protein associated with Lin7, or Pals1). Apical localization of the SNARE Vamp7 is also disrupted. Thus, alpha Snap is essential for apical protein localization and cell fate determination in neuroepithelial cells.

A distinct feature of the nervous system is the intricate network of synaptic connections among neurons of diverse phenotypes. Although initial connections are formed largely through molecular mechanisms that depend on intrinsic developmental programs, spontaneous and experience-driven electrical activities in the developing brain exert critical epigenetic influence on synaptic maturation and refinement of neural circuits. Selective findings discussed here illustrate some of our current understanding of the effects of electrical activity on circuit development and highlight areas that await further study.

### From mechanisms to markers: novel noninvasive EEG proxy markers of the neural excitation and inhibition system in humans [^1159RLEz]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The coordination of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) activity is a fundamental property of brain function — a specific ratio of E and I is thought to govern local and global network dynamics in the typically developing brain. Throughout this article, we use the term 'balance' — to refer to this optimal quantity of E and I that creates a state of low firing rates where excitatory activity does not either run away or die out after the arrival of an external stimulus/signal, as opposed to their equity. Converging evidence from genetic, postmortem, and preclinical studies suggests that disruptions to different components of excitatory and inhibitory processes are involved in a variety of clinical conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and generalized learning disabilities.

The theory that E/I imbalance underlies neurodevelopmental disorders has been difficult to test for two reasons. First, the E/I system is complex, yet most authors are unspecific in defining what they mean by E/I imbalance. For instance, E/I can be defined at multiple interacting levels, of the primary excitatory versus inhibitory neurotransmitters: glutamate and GABA, the E/I potentials within a neuron, or the E/I conductance between locally connected neurons versus entire networks of neurons at the system level. Hence, the failure to more precisely define E/ I balance clouds the synthesis of findings across different studies. Second, direct and indirect measurement of E/I at any given level in the living human brain is challenging. Methods such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) provide useful indicators of E/I in terms of (respectively) receptor occupancy, neurotransmitter concentration, and neurotransmitter metabolism. However, they have a poor temporal resolution, are expensive and/or invasive; and (in the case of MRS and TMS) are generally limited to examining a relatively small number of brain regions at one time. As such, these methods alone offer an incomplete explanation of E/I.

Neuroimmune mechanisms — innate and adaptive immunity affect cognition, with neutrophils contributing to capillary stalling in a mouse model of Alzheimer disease (AD) and blockade of neutrophil–endothelium interactions improving cognitive function; in humans, hyperactivated neutrophils correlate with AD progression and a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlates with any dementia; perivascular macrophages are increased in aged and hypertensive rats and contribute to neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction via oxidative stress in hypertension or amyloid models; microglia are involved in deleterious amyloid and tau effects and neuroinflammation in mouse models; blood monocytes in mild cognitive impairment and AD show increased reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines with impaired migration and reduced Aβ phagocytosis; aging reduces naive T cells, decreases T-cell diversity, expands memory T cells, and increases adaptive immune cells in brain, including vascular-associated T cells in white matter of monkeys; clonally expanded interferon-γ–producing CD8+ T cells are described in aged mouse subventricular zone, and a higher proportion of activated CD8+ T cells is found in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD compared with healthy controls, correlating with AD-related cognitive decline; increased lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio is positively correlated with dementia incidence.

### Brain-wide correspondence of neuronal epigenomics and distant projections [^1142vGnh]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

To address these questions, we used epi-retro-seq to assay 33,034 neurons from 225 source-to-target combinations across the entire mouse brain. This approach combines retrograde labelling with single-nucleus methylation sequencing (snmC-seq), which allows identification of potential gene regulatory elements and prediction of gene expression in the same neuron. Gene expression can be predicted because non-CG (CH; in which H represents A, T or C) methylation of gene bodies is inversely related to RNA expression, and epigenetic elements regulating expression can be identified using methylation at CG (mCG) dinucleotides. It is also expected that epi-retro-seq can provide unique insight into developmental mechanisms that shape connectivity because CH methylation accumulates during and peaks at the end of the developmental critical period, and mCG is reconfigured during synaptic development.

### Clinicopathological features of adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease [^115MN2jC]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

We also investigated the frequency distribution of intranuclear inclusion-positive neurons and astrocytes in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia of Subject S-5: sporadic NIID case, and Subject F1–2: familial NIID case (Fig. 3). The frequency of intranuclear inclusion in neurons was ∼5–30% in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia, with a slightly lower frequency in the hippocampus. Frequencies of astrocytes in both cases were similarly between 10% and 30%. Thus, the frequency distribution of intranuclear inclusion of neurons and astrocytes was similar among sporadic and familial NIID cases.

### Etomidate injection (etomidate) [^117C8eog]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY AND/OR PHARMACOLOGY

Published studies in animals demonstrate that the use of anesthetic agents during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the wi ndow of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.

In primates, exposure to 3 hours of an anesthetic regimen that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer increased neuronal cell loss. Data in rodents and in primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with subtle but prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in neonates and young children who require procedures against the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data (see WARNINGS, Pediatric Neurotoxicity and PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy and Pediatric Use).

### Neuronal ensembles: building blocks of neural circuits [^111ym5Xq]. Neuron (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuronal ensembles, defined as groups of neurons displaying recurring patterns of coordinated activity, represent an intermediate functional level between individual neurons and brain areas. Novel methods to measure and optically manipulate the activity of neuronal populations have provided evidence of ensembles in the neocortex and hippocampus. Ensembles can be activated intrinsically or in response to sensory stimuli and play a causal role in perception and behavior. Here we review ensemble phenomenology, developmental origin, biophysical and synaptic mechanisms, and potential functional roles across different brain areas and species, including humans. As modular units of neural circuits, ensembles could provide a mechanistic underpinning of fundamental brain processes, including neural coding, motor planning, decision-making, learning, and adaptability.

### Etomidate [^1129TzC5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus. In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring. With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human. The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits (See WARNINGS /Pediatric Neurotoxicity, PRECAUTIONS /Pregnancy, ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY AND/OR PHARMACOLOGY).

Labor and Delivery

There are insufficient data to support use of intravenous etomidate in obstetrics, including Caesarean section deliveries. Therefore, such use is not recommended.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when etomidate is administered to a nursing mother.

Pediatric Use

There are inadequate data to make dosage recommendations for induction of anesthesia in patients below the age of ten (10) years; therefore, such use is not recommended (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as etomidate, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis. Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.

Results

Patient-derived Scz organoids exhibit ventricular entropy and neuropathology

To study neurodevelopmental aspects of Scz we generated self-assembling, self-maturating, and human-derived cerebral organoids. Cerebral organoids recapitulate transcriptomic and epigenomic programs of fetal development that drive the assembly of ventricular progenitor zones that give rise to neuronal ensembles. This broadly mimics the first trimester of human brain development, and these organoids have already been successfully used to understand mechanisms of cortical development and disease. Recent organoid models often apply exogenous growth factors (e.g. BDNF, NT-3, and EGF) and/or pathway modulators (e.g. TGFβ and WNT pathway inhibitors) to forcibly direct the differentiation of progenitors towards a neuronal fate or promote their survival by reducing apoptosis. However, factors such as BDNF and related neurotrophins, TGFβ, and WNT signaling (as well as other morphogens) are longstanding contributors to Scz pathophysiology and may play a role in the ontogenesis of disease during early neurodevelopment. Indeed, these same factors and pathways have hypothesized roles in early disease development via their effects on stem cells and neuronal programming. Another consideration was the degree to which cerebral organoids faithfully recapitulate cellular diversity of the developing cortex. Notably, cerebral organoid models have reported concordant expression of all major developing neural cell-types found in the developing cortex including late originating lineages also implicated in post-mortem schizophrenia studies (e.g. oligodendroglia and astrocytes). Therefore, given our particular interest in disease modeling, we adapted a morphogen-free organoid protocol that recapitulates cell-types of interest whilst avoiding the potentially confounding effects of exogenous morphogen factor exposure.

### Equalizing excitation-inhibition ratios across visual cortical neurons [^116uxkkJ]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The relationship between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I ratio), two opposing forces in the mammalian cerebral cortex, affects many cortical functions such as feature selectivity and gain. Individual pyramidal cells show stable E/I ratios in time despite fluctuating cortical activity levels. This is because when excitation increases, inhibition increases proportionally through the increased recruitment of inhibitory neurons, a phenomenon referred to as excitation-inhibition balance. However, little is known about the distribution of E/I ratios across pyramidal cells. Through their highly divergent axons, inhibitory neurons indiscriminately contact most neighbouring pyramidal cells. Is inhibition homogeneously distributed or is it individually matched to the different amounts of excitation received by distinct pyramidal cells? Here we discover that pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex each receive inhibition in a similar proportion to their excitation. As a consequence, E/I ratios are equalized across pyramidal cells. This matched inhibition is mediated by parvalbumin-expressing but not somatostatin-expressing inhibitory cells and results from the independent adjustment of synapses originating from individual parvalbumin-expressing cells targeting different pyramidal cells. Furthermore, this match is activity-dependent as it is disrupted by perturbing pyramidal cell activity. Thus, the equalization of E/I ratios across pyramidal cells reveals an unexpected degree of order in the spatial distribution of synaptic strengths and indicates that the relationship between the cortex's two opposing forces is stabilized not only in time but also in space.

Conclusions and future directions — The overview states that great strides have been made in defining the critical role of the neurovasculome in brain health and its pathogenic involvement in brain diseases, with proteomic and transcriptomic studies revealing a remarkable molecular diversity of vascular and vascular-associated cells. It notes that functional roles of cerebral blood vessels beyond the delivery of O2 and critical nutrients include clearance of toxic byproducts of brain activity, regulation of neuroimmune trafficking, and provision of factors essential for maintaining neuronal homeostasis, and that failure of these mechanisms has been convincingly linked to brain diseases in animal models, especially those involving impaired cognition. It adds that these advances have unveiled an unexpected level of complexity that raises additional questions, requiring new approaches and strategies to find answers.

### Intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA confers target gene knockdown and robust neuroprotection in the postischemic brain [^117TqZfW]. Molecular Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Noninvasive intranasal drug administration has been noted to allow direct delivery of drugs to the brain. In the present study, the therapeutic efficacy of intranasal small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery was investigated in the postischemic rat brain. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled control siRNA was delivered intranasally in normal adult rats using e-PAM-R, a biodegradable PAMAM dendrimer, as gene carrier. Florescence-tagged siRNA was found in the cytoplasm and processes of neurons and of glial cells in many brain regions, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, cerebral cortex, and striatum, in 1 hour after infusion, and the FITC-fluorescence was continuously detected for at least 12 hours. When siRNA for high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which functions as an endogenous danger molecule and aggravates inflammation, was delivered intranasally, the target gene was significantly depleted in many brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and striatum. More importantly, intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA markedly suppressed infarct volume in the postischemic rat brain (maximal reduction to 42.8 ± 5.6% at 48 hours after 60 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)) and this protective effect was manifested by recoveries from neurological and behavioral deficits. These results indicate that the intranasal delivery of HMGB1 siRNA offers an efficient means of gene knockdown-mediated therapy in the ischemic brain.

In the control group cases, the parenchyma of both the gray and white matter regions of the cerebral cortex displayed preserved histoarchitecture. Most neuronal cell bodies exhibited well‐defined nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli. Some nuclei presented dispersed (fine) chromatin, and glial cells were evenly distributed throughout the tissue (Figure 3a–d). The leptomeningeal region showed normal thickness and no apparent alterations (Figure 3e–f).

(e–f) Meningeal region with preserved structure and typical thickness (solid black line). (a–f) 400×. Staining: Hematoxylin and Eosin.

The antigen for DENV was detected in the cerebral cortex in 7 cases (Table 2). There was intense cytoplasmic staining, possibly endothelial cells in vessels located in gray and white matter. Endothelial cell nuclei are typically oval or elongated and aligned with the axis of the blood vessel. They display dispersed chromatin, with predominance of euchromatin, and lack the dense heterochromatin network that characterizes microglial cells (Figure 4a, DENV). Additionally, immunostaining was observed in cortical parenchymal cells, suggestive of macrophages or glial cells (Figure 4b, DENV). No evident staining was observed in neuronal cell bodies. This staining pattern was also observed in some cases in the leptomeninges region (Figure 4c, DENV). As expected, any detection was observed in samples of non‐dengue cases (Figure 4a‐c, C).

### GABAergic dysfunction in excitatory and inhibitory (E / I) imbalance drives the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease [^111rrWA4]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To propose a new hypothesis that GABAergic dysfunction in excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) imbalance drives the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Background

Synaptic dysfunction and E/I imbalance emerge decades before the appearance of cognitive decline in AD patients, which contribute to neurodegeneration. Initially, E/I imbalance was thought to occur first, due to dysfunction of the glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. However, new evidence has demonstrated that the GABAergic system, the counterpart of E/I balance and the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the central nervous system, is altered enormously and that this contributes to E/I imbalance and further AD pathogenesis.

New Hypothesis

Alterations to the GABAergic system, induced by multiple AD pathogenic or risk factors, contribute to E/I imbalance and AD pathogenesis.

Major Challenges For The Hypothesis

This GABAergic hypothesis accounts for many critical questions and common challenges confronting a new hypothesis of AD pathogenesis. More specifically, it explains why amyloid beta (Aβ), β-secretase (BACE1), apolipoprotein E4 gene (APOE ε4), hyperactive glia cells, contributes to AD pathogenesis and why age and sex are the risk factors of AD. GABAergic dysfunction promotes the spread of Aβ pathology throughout the AD brain and associated cognitive impairments, and the induction of dysfunction induced by these varied risk factors shares this common neurobiology leading to E/I imbalance. In turn, some of these factors exacerbate GABAergic dysfunction and E/I imbalance. Moreover, the GABAergic system modulates various brain functions and thus, the GABAergic hypothesis accounts for nonamnestic manifestations. Furthermore, corrections of E/I balance through manipulation of GABAergic functions have shown positive outcomes in preclinical and clinical studies, suggesting the potential of the GABAergic system as a therapeutic target in AD.

Linkage To Other Major Theories

Dysfunction of the GABAergic system is induced by multiple critical signaling pathways, which include the existing major theories of AD pathogenesis, such as the Aβ and neuroinflammation hypotheses. In a new perspective, this GABAergic hypothesis accounts for the E/I imbalance and related excitotoxicity, which contribute to cognitive decline and AD pathogenesis. Therefore, the GABAergic system could be a key target to restore, at least partially, the E/I balance and cognitive function in AD patients.

An Excitatory and Epileptogenic Effect of Dentate Gyrus Mossy Cells in a Mouse Model of Epilepsy

Botterill JJ, Lu YL, LaFrancois JJ, Bernstein HL, Alcantara-Gonzalez D, Jain S, Leary P, Scharfman HE. Cell Rep. 2019;29(9):2875–2889.e6. doi:

The sparse activity of hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells (GCs) is thought to be critical for cognition and behavior, whereas excessive DG activity may contribute to disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy. Glutamatergic mossy cells (MCs) of the DG are potentially critical to normal and pathological functions of the DG because they can regulate GC activity through innervation of GCs or indirectly through GABAergic neurons. Here, we test the hypothesis that MC excitation of GCs is normally weak, but under pathological conditions, MC excitation of GCs is dramatically strengthened. We show that selectively inhibiting MCs during severe seizures reduced manifestations of those seizures, hippocampal injury, and chronic epilepsy. In contrast, selectively activating MCs was proconvulsant. Mechanistic in vitro studies using optogenetics further demonstrated the unanticipated ability of MC axons to excite GCs under pathological conditions. These results demonstrate an excitatory and epileptogenic effect of MCs in the DG.

### Α-klotho expression in human tissues [^111LoKWw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

α-Klotho is present in endocrine tissues

Examination of endocrine tissue revealed α-Klotho expression in follicular epithelial cells of the thyroid (Figure 4 A), in the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas (Figure 4 B), in medullary cells of the adrenal gland (Figure 4 C), and in testosterone producing Leydig cells (Figure 3 F) of the testis.

Figure 4.
α-Klotho protein expression and distribution in human endocrine and neuronal tissues: IHC, positive staining (brown) was found in principal cells of the thyroid epithelium (A), islet cells of the pancreas (B), and catecholamine-producing medullary cells of the adrenal gland (C). When brain and spinal cord were stained, primarily neuronal cells were found to express α-Klotho protein, such as in the cerebral cortex (D), Purkinje cells between the molecular and granular layer in the cerebellum (E), motoneurons in the gray matter of the ventral horns of the spinal cord (F), and neuron cell bodies in the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the intestine (G). Insets are larger magnifications of neuronal cell bodies. n ≥ 5 for each tissue.

α-Klotho is present in neuronal cells

We next examined α-Klotho expression in neural tissues. Expression was found in neuronal cells of the cerebral cortex (Figure 4 D). In the cerebellum, α-Klotho was expressed primarily in Purkinje cells between the molecular and granular layer (Figure 4 E). In the spinal cord, α-Klotho was present in the motor neurons in the gray matter of the ventral horn (Figure 4 F). In the myenteric plexus, α-Klotho protein was found in ganglial neuronal cell bodies (Figure 4 E).

### Neural precursor cells and central nervous system radiation sensitivity [^116vAKvk]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The tolerance of normal brain tissues limits the radiation dose that can be delivered safely during cranial radiotherapy, and one of the potential complications that can arise involves cognitive impairment. Extensive laboratory data have appeared recently showing that hippocampal neurogenesis is significantly impacted by irradiation and that such changes are associated with altered cognitive function and involve, in part, changes in the microenvironment (oxidative stress and inflammation). Although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how these changes evolve, new in vitro and in vivo approaches have provided a means by which new mechanistic insights can be gained relevant to the topic. Together, the data from cell culture and animal-based studies provide complementary information relevant to a potentially serious complication of cranial radiotherapy and should enhance our understanding of the tolerance of normal brain after cranial irradiation.

### Molecular and cellular dynamics of the developing human neocortex [^1136SiyW]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

In early neonatal and adult mammalian brains, neurogenesis continues in the VZ/SVZ of the lateral ventricles, producing mostly GABAergic interneurons that migrate to the olfactory bulb. However, in our perinatal PFC sample, which included the VZ/SVZ, we found a large number of glutamatergic EN-newborn cells and a smaller number of IPC-ENs, specifically in the SVZ (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Notably, the count of EN-newborn cells was 10.3× higher than IN-dLGE-immature cells, the putative GABAergic interneurons for the olfactory bulb or the white matter. Whether these late-born EN-newborn cells will migrate to the cortical grey matter, the subcortical white matter or the olfactory bulb remains to be determined.

2 THE AVIAN PHOTOPERIODIC RESPONSE

The annual changes in day length, also referred to as photoperiod, are the primary environmental cue that most birds use to time seasonal reproduction and migration. Across most avian species, the vernal increase in photoperiod stimulates reproductive development and maturation, leading to a physiological state commonly termed "photostimulated". Photostimulated birds are characterized by the elevated production of circulating sex steroids (e.g. testosterone and estrogens), large‐sized gonads, and gametogenesis. Prolonged exposure to long photoperiod (i.e. > 12 h of light) in many bird species leads to reproductive inhibition and the involution of reproductive organs, a physiological state called photorefractoriness. Two types of photorefractoriness have been characterized in birds and have been termed absolute and relative photorefractoriness. The two criteria used to differentiate the types of photorefractoriness are (1) spontaneous gonadal involution despite continued exposure to long photoperiod and (2) lengthening the photoperiod has no effect on the gonads once photorefractoriness is established. Birds that are absolute photorefractory adhere to both criteria. Birds that are relative photorefractory, such as the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), must experience a decline in photoperiod to demonstrate gonadal involution. Birds must experience short photoperiod days (i.e. < 12 h of light) in order to develop a physiological sensitivity to long photoperiod, a state called "photosensitive". In some avian species, such as the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), exposure to only 10 short day lengths is sufficient to re‐sensitize the brain to long photoperiod, as indicated by an increase in GnRH1, and the birds become physiologically responsive to light stimulation. In hens, the timing of the ovulatory cycle and egg laying is in part dependent on dark phase duration. GnRH1 cells in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus are a cellular correlate of the avian photoperiodic response. In birds that display absolute photorefractoriness, the number of GnRH1‐expressing cells in the preoptic area increases during photostimulation and then declines to nearly undetectable levels during the onset of photorefractoriness. The development of a photosensitive state is characterized by the gradual increase in the amount of GnRH1. GnRH release into the hypophyseal portal system is also regulated by photoperiodic cues and is controlled by tanycytes originating in the ependymal layer of the third ventricle. In quail, short photoperiod is associated with extended tanycyte terminals, which prevents GnRH nerve endings from contacting the basal lamina membrane. Exposure to stimulatory long photoperiods induces a retraction in tanycytes and permits GnRH release stimulating gonadotropin secretion. Long photoperiods stimulate thyrotropin‐stimulating hormone subunit beta (Tshβ) expression in the pars tuberalis, which subsequently signals the synthesis of deiodinase type‐2 (Dio2) in tanycytes. Increased Dio2 synthesis facilitates the production of local triiodothyronine, which causes tanycytes to retract. Over the past few years, significant attention has been devoted to understanding the link between light detection and the GnRH1 system in birds.

### Whole-neuron synaptic mapping reveals spatially precise excitatory / inhibitory balance limiting dendritic and somatic spiking [^114YDyjo]. Neuron (2020). Medium credibility.

The balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E and I) synapses is thought to be critical for information processing in neural circuits. However, little is known about the spatial principles of E and I synaptic organization across the entire dendritic tree of mammalian neurons. We developed a new open-source reconstruction platform for mapping the size and spatial distribution of E and I synapses received by individual genetically-labeled layer 2/3 (L2/3) cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) in vivo. We mapped over 90,000 E and I synapses across twelve L2/3 PNs and uncovered structured organization of E and I synapses across dendritic domains as well as within individual dendritic segments. Despite significant domain-specific variation in the absolute density of E and I synapses, their ratio is strikingly balanced locally across dendritic segments. Computational modeling indicates that this spatially precise E/I balance dampens dendritic voltage fluctuations and strongly impacts neuronal firing output.

Neurovascular coupling — mechanisms and measurement gaps: A major question is how vasoactive signals from neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, and perivascular cells are integrated to produce the coupling response; for example, astrocytes may not be necessary for the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response but may trigger a larger increase in CBF when engaged. Mechanisms of retrograde propagation and the relative contributions of cell types remain to be elucidated, and new imaging technologies such as 3‑photon microscopy, optical coherence tomography, and functional ultrasound imaging will provide tools to examine deep-brain neurovascular function not accessible noninvasively with conventional imaging methods, enabling definition of disease-altered coupling at regional levels.

### Pinocembrin protects against β-amyloid-induced toxicity in neurons through inhibiting receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-independent signaling pathways and regulating mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis [^112G6MWG]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Oral pinocembrin treatment inhibited neuronal degeneration in cerebral cortex against A β 25–35 -induced toxicity

FJB is a very useful maker for neuronal degeneration. In the sham group, FJB-positive neurons were hardly observed in the cerebral cortex (Figure 2B, a). However, FJB-positive neurons were dramatically increased in the cerebral cortex of the Aβ 25–35 group (P < 0.001, Figure 2B, b, e). Pinocembrin treatment significantly inhibited neuronal degeneration in the cerebral cortex, showing a decreased number of FJB-positive neurons in the pinocembrin-treated groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.001, Figure 2B, c-e). This result suggests that pinocembrin was effective in inhibiting the Aβ 25–35 -induced neuronal degeneration.

Oral pinocembrin treatment inhibit RAGE expression in cerebral cortex against A β 25–35 -induced toxicity

To assess the RAGE changes in the cerebral cortex, transcription and protein expression were studied following behavioral tests. An increased fold level of RAGE transcripts was observed in the cerebral cortex of Aβ 25–35 -treated mice (P < 0.001, Figure 2C). Western blot studies displayed increased RAGE protein expression in the cerebral cortex (P < 0.001, Figure 2D), which was consistent with the changes of the level of RAGE transcripts. Pinocembrin treatment significantly inhibited the upregulation of RAGE transcripts in accordance with its protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001, Figure 2C, D), suggesting that pinocembrin was effective in inhibiting the overexpression of RAGE in Aβ 25–35 -treated mice.

Pinocembrin increased cell viability, but did not attenuate Aβ 1–42 secretion and scavenge intracellular ROS of APPsw cells in the presence of copper

In order to better resemble the in vivo Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, instead of directly using single Aβ treatment, we used a copper-treated APPsw overexpressing cell system. As shown in Figure 3A, cell viability was significantly decreased in the presence of 300 μM copper in APPsw cells (P < 0.001). Pinocembrin enhanced the cell viability at 1.0 μM, 3.0 μM and 10.0 μM in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Pinocembrin did not show a significant effect in the APPsw cells without copper treatment for 24 h.
