Homeobox sequences

Answer Choices:
A. are present in the genome of many animal species
B. are found in prokaryotes but not in eukaryotes
C. were identified as the integration sites for bacterial viruses
D. represent integration sites for transposable elements

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement about homeobox sequences is correct among four options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what homeobox sequences are and where they are found. Then, I should verify whether they exist in prokaryotes versus eukaryotes. Next, I will check whether homeobox sequences have been identified as viral integration sites. After that, I need to examine whether they serve as preferred integration sites for transposable elements. Finally, I will weigh the evidence and select the best-supported option, correcting any misconceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the definition and distribution of homeobox sequences. Homeoboxes are conserved DNA motifs that encode homeodomain transcription factors, which are central to developmental gene regulation in animals; they are a hallmark of animal genomes and are notably enriched in developmental gene clusters such as the Hox clusters, which are themselves enriched in unique, evolutionarily constrained regions of mammalian genomes, indicating broad presence across animal species [^146e6825].

> Wait, let me verify the prokaryote versus eukaryote point. Homeoboxes are eukaryotic sequences; they are not a feature of prokaryotic genomes, so option B claiming they are found in prokaryotes but not eukaryotes is backwards and incorrect. I should double-check that this aligns with comparative genomics and developmental biology literature, which consistently treat homeobox genes as animal-specific regulatory innovations rather than prokaryotic elements [^notfound].

> Next, I should review whether homeobox sequences have been identified as integration sites for bacterial viruses. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the provided references extensively discuss transposable elements and retroviral integration preferences, but I do not see evidence that homeobox sequences per se are recognized as canonical integration sites for bacterial viruses; instead, viral integration studies emphasize preferences for transcriptionally active regions, CpG islands, or specific chromatin features, not homeobox motifs as targets, so option C appears unsupported here [^efdf9dfe] [^fb244c23].

> I will now examine whether homeobox sequences represent integration sites for transposable elements. Let me think about this carefully: transposable elements do show nonrandom integration biases, often targeting accessible chromatin, promoters/enhancers, or regions of DNA flexibility, and they can shape regulatory landscapes, but the documents do not indicate that homeobox sequences themselves are preferred integration motifs or hotspots; rather, TEs can insert near genes and regulatory elements, occasionally contributing to regulatory innovation, which is distinct from homeoboxes serving as integration sites, so option D overstates the relationship [^efdf9dfe] [^3cfcad39].

> Putting this together, the best-supported answer is option A, that homeobox sequences are present in the genome of many animal species. This is consistent with their conservation across animals and their enrichment in developmental gene clusters, whereas options B, C, and D are either factually reversed or not supported by the provided evidence [^146e6825].

---

The correct answer is **A. are present in the genome of many animal species**. Homeobox sequences are conserved DNA motifs that encode homeodomain proteins, which regulate development and are found across animals, including vertebrates and invertebrates [^notfound]. They are **not found in prokaryotes**, so option B is incorrect. Options C and D are also incorrect because homeobox sequences are not known to be integration sites for bacterial viruses or transposable elements; instead, transposable elements often insert near genes and can influence their regulation, but they do not specifically target homeobox sequences [^efdf9dfe] [^3cfcad39].

---

## Distribution of homeobox sequences

Homeobox sequences are **highly conserved** across the animal kingdom, including vertebrates (e.g. humans, mice) and invertebrates (e.g. Drosophila, C. elegans) [^notfound]. They are notably enriched in developmental gene clusters such as the Hox clusters, which are themselves enriched in unique, evolutionarily constrained regions of mammalian genomes [^146e6825]. Homeobox sequences are **absent from prokaryotic genomes**, which lack the complex developmental regulatory networks seen in eukaryotes [^notfound].

---

## Function of homeobox sequences

Homeobox sequences encode homeodomain proteins that function as transcription factors, regulating gene expression during development. They are critical for **body plan patterning**, organogenesis, and cell fate specification. Mutations in homeobox genes can cause developmental disorders and congenital anomalies, underscoring their importance in normal development [^notfound].

---

## Relationship with transposable elements and viral integration

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements that can insert into new genomic locations, sometimes near genes, and can influence gene regulation [^efdf9dfe]. However, TEs **do not specifically target homeobox sequences** for integration. Instead, they often insert near transcriptionally active regions, including promoters and enhancers, which may coincidentally include homeobox genes [^fb244c23]. Similarly, viral integration sites, such as those of retroviruses, are not specifically targeted to homeobox sequences but rather to regions of active transcription and open chromatin [^fb244c23].

---

## Conclusion

Homeobox sequences are **present in the genomes of many animal species**, encoding transcription factors essential for development. They are absent from prokaryotes and are not known to serve as integration sites for bacterial viruses or transposable elements. Therefore, the correct answer is **A. are present in the genome of many animal species**.

### Integration site selection by retroviruses and transposable elements in eukaryotes [^efdf9dfe]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2017). Medium credibility.

Transposable elements and retroviruses are found in most genomes, can be pathogenic and are widely used as gene-delivery and functional genomics tools. Exploring whether these genetic elements target specific genomic sites for integration and how this preference is achieved is crucial to our understanding of genome evolution, somatic genome plasticity in cancer and ageing, host-parasite interactions and genome engineering applications. High-throughput profiling of integration sites by next-generation sequencing, combined with large-scale genomic data mining and cellular or biochemical approaches, has revealed that the insertions are usually non-random. The DNA sequence, chromatin and nuclear context, and cellular proteins cooperate in guiding integration in eukaryotic genomes, leading to a remarkable diversity of insertion site distribution and evolutionary strategies.

### Genome-wide analysis of transposon and retroviral insertions reveals preferential integrations in regions of DNA flexibility [^c077a232]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

In contrast to transposable elements, retroviral vectors such as MMLV have a limited insert packaging size (usually < 8 kb) and their production requires specialized technical expertise. However, retroviruses are currently the most efficient way to make a large number of insertions in the zebrafish genome, producing a high number of integrations for a given experiment. The high copy number potential and high mutation rate were key features in the successful use of the MMLV retroviral vector in an insertional mutagenesis screen that targeted a large number of protein coding genes in the zebrafish genome.

One important consideration affecting the choice of transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences. Integrations occurring in the 5′-end of genes are advantageous for creating insertional mutants. However, vectors that only target actively transcribed gene regions have limited use in capturing genes that are expressed at low levels, or those regulated by alternative promoters and enhancers. Similarly, while targeting enhancer regions might be an advantage for enhancer traps and detecting open chromatin, transgene expression might suffer from the variability imposed by positional effects. Moreover, targeting of specific repetitive elements might lead to transgene inactivation, while targeting of 3′-UTR sequences might lead to changes in posttranscriptional regulation.

Integration bias has been reported for transposons and retroviruses in a number of systems (e.g.;). Integration target sites are thought to be relatively random at large genomic scales, although there have been reports of association with genetic elements such as transcriptional start sites, strong enhancers or promoters, UTRs, and CpG islands. At the nucleotide sequence level, different integrating elements have shown various degrees of sequence bias. MMLV shows a weak preference for T/A nucleotides just outside the 4 bp site of integration. In contrast, Ac/Ds and Tol2 are not reported to show specific integration motifs. However, these analyses have been limited by the number of genomic features analyzed, and the reliance on a small number of sites in some studies. Crucially, the available insert collections generated in zebrafish were either selected based on reporter gene expression or phenotypes, and only represent integrations that have been incorporated in the germ-line.

Mapping pBac transposon insertion sites in D. virilis

To assist with genetic experiments in D. virilis, we mapped the insertion locations for all pBac lines generated in our lab for a previously published study. We mapped 58 transposon insertions from 39 pBac (enhancer-lacZ) strains plus nine new pBac { 3XP3 :: EYFP-attP } strains. Some strains contained multiple insertions and some insertions mapped to contigs that are not currently associated with Muller arm chromosomes. These results are shown in Figure 6 and are available in a Geneious file and.

Species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup, including the species D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, and D. santomea, have long served as model systems for studying evolution. However, studies in these species have been limited by a paucity of genetic and transgenic reagents. Here, we describe a collection of transgenic and genetic strains generated to facilitate genetic studies within and between these species. We have generated many strains of each species containing mapped piggyBac transposons including an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) gene expressed in the eyes and a ϕ C31 attP site-specific integration site. We have tested a subset of these lines for integration efficiency and reporter gene expression levels. We have also generated a smaller collection of other lines expressing other genetically encoded fluorescent molecules in the eyes and a number of other transgenic reagents that will be useful for functional studies in these species. In addition, we have mapped the insertion locations of 58 transposable elements in D. virilis that will be useful for genetic mapping studies.

### Population-scale long-read sequencing uncovers transposable elements associated with gene expression variation and adaptive signatures in drosophila [^97b87c3c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

High quality reference genomes are crucial to understanding genome function, structure and evolution. The availability of reference genomes has allowed us to start inferring the role of genetic variation in biology, disease, and biodiversity conservation. However, analyses across organisms demonstrate that a single reference genome is not enough to capture the global genetic diversity present in populations. In this work, we generate 32 high-quality reference genomes for the well-known model species D. melanogaster and focus on the identification and analysis of transposable element variation as they are the most common type of structural variant. We show that integrating the genetic variation across natural populations from five climatic regions increases the number of detected insertions by 58%. Moreover, 26% to 57% of the insertions identified using long-reads were missed by short-reads methods. We also identify hundreds of transposable elements associated with gene expression variation and new TE variants likely to contribute to adaptive evolution in this species. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the genetic variation present in natural populations to genomic studies, which is essential if we are to understand how genomes function and evolve.

### Dynamic interactions between transposable elements and their hosts [^10405ee7]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2011). Medium credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) have a unique ability to mobilize to new genomic locations, and the major advance of second-generation DNA sequencing has provided insights into the dynamic relationship between TEs and their hosts. It now is clear that TEs have adopted diverse strategies - such as specific integration sites or patterns of activity - to thrive in host environments that are replete with mechanisms, such as small RNAs or epigenetic marks, that combat TE amplification. Emerging evidence suggests that TE mobilization might sometimes benefit host genomes by enhancing genetic diversity, although TEs are also implicated in diseases such as cancer. Here, we discuss recent findings about how, where and when TEs insert in diverse organisms.

### Genetic and transgenic reagents for., and… [^d3b0f8cc]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

We were motivated by the phenotypic variability and genetic accessibility of these species to establish a set of reagents that would allow, simultaneously, a platform for site-specific transgenesis and reagents useful for genetic mapping studies. Therefore, we set out to establish a collection of strains carrying transposable elements marked with innocuous dominant markers for four of the most commonly studied species of the D. melanogaster species subgroup: D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, and D. santomea. We chose the piggyBac transposable element to minimize bias of insertion sites relative to gene start sites and integrated transposable elements carrying EYFP and DsRed driven by a 3XP3 enhancer, which is designed to drive expression in the eyes. A large subset of the lines described here also include a ϕC31 attP landing site to facilitate site-specific transgene integration. Here, we describe the establishment and mapping of many lines of each species carrying pBac { 3XP3 :: EYFP, attP } and pBac { 3XP3 :: DsRed }. We have characterized a subset of the pBac { 3XP3 :: EYFP, attP } lines from each species for ϕC31 integration efficiency of plasmids containing an attB sequence. In addition, we have integrated transgenes carrying the even-skipped stripe 2 enhancer to characterize embryonic expression generated by a subset of attP landing sites. We have employed CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the 3XP3 :: EYFP gene in a subset of lines to facilitate integration of reagents for neurogenetics. We also describe several other genetic and transgenic reagents that may be useful to the community, including the map positions for pBac transposons integrated in the D. virilis genome.

### Regulatory transposable elements in the encyclopedia of DNA elements [^3cfcad39]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) comprise ~50% of our genome, but knowledge of how TEs affect genome evolution remains incomplete. Leveraging ENCODE4 data, we provide the most comprehensive study to date of TE contributions to the regulatory genome. We find 236,181 (~25%) human candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) are TE-derived, with over 90% lineage-specific since the human-mouse split, accounting for 8–36% of lineage-specific cCREs. Except for SINEs, cCRE-associated transcription factor (TF) motifs in TEs are derived from ancestral TE sequence more than expected by chance. We show that TEs may adopt similar regulatory activities of elements near their integration site. Since human-mouse divergence, TEs have contributed 3–56% of TF binding site turnover events across 30 examined TFs. Finally, TE-derived cCREs are similar to non-TE cCREs in terms of MPRA activity and GWAS variant enrichment. Overall, our results substantiate the notion that TEs have played an important role in shaping the human regulatory genome.

Results

Generation and mapping of pBac{3XP3::EYFP-attP} strains

We generated many strains carrying pBac { 3XP3 :: EYFP-attP } and pBac { 3XP3 :: DsRed } insertions, mapped these, and culled the collection to unique lines that could be maintained as homozygotes. The final collection includes 184 D. simulans lines, 122 D. mauritiana lines, 104 D. yakuba lines, 64 D. santomea lines, and 9 D. virilis lines. Maps indicating the insertion site locations are shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6, and are provided as searchable Geneious files in. Details of the transgenic strains are provided in.

### Maize transposable elements / as insertion mutagenesis tools in… [^f83cf02d]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

For three ADE2 revertant clones, the genomic reinsertion sites were identified by FPNI-PCR of the 3′-end of Ds-NAT1 (Figure 2B and Table S2 in). Two of the Ds-NAT1 elements reintegrated in chromosome 3, 174- and 266-kb distal and proximal to the ADE2 locus, respectively. The third element transposed to chromosome 5. Amplification and sequencing of both Ds-NAT1 flanking sequences revealed the canonical 8-bp target site duplications generated upon integration of the Ds-NAT1 transposable elements (Figure 2B). Thus, transposition occurred, both close to the original insertion site as well as on a different chromosome.

### Primate-specific transposable elements shape transcriptional networks during human development [^25a20ab0]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The human genome contains more than 4.5 million inserts derived from transposable elements (TEs), the result of recurrent waves of invasion and internal propagation throughout evolution. For new TE copies to be inherited, they must become integrated in the genome of the germline or pre-implantation embryo, which requires that their source TE be expressed at these stages. Accordingly, many TEs harbor DNA binding sites for the pluripotency factors OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and KLFs and are transiently expressed during embryonic genome activation. Here, we describe how many primate-restricted TEs have additional binding sites for lineage-specific transcription factors driving their expression during human gastrulation and later steps of fetal development. These TE integrants serve as lineage-specific enhancers fostering the transcription, amongst other targets, of KRAB-zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) of comparable evolutionary age, which in turn corral the activity of TE-embedded regulatory sequences in a similarly lineage-restricted fashion. Thus, TEs and their KZFP controllers play broad roles in shaping transcriptional networks during early human development.

### Genome-wide analysis of transposon and retroviral insertions reveals preferential integrations in regions of DNA flexibility [^b099eba7]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

Integrations in repetitive sequences

Repetitive elements, which account for 52.2% of the zebrafish genome, have been shown to have roles in chromosome structural organization, gene regulation, genome integrity, and evolution. Therefore, we examined the integration preferences for the various repetitive element families, such as DNA transposons, LINEs, and SINEs, present in the zebrafish genome. DNA transposon sequences and low-complexity repeats were consistently underrepresented in sites of integration. However, we observed varying preferences for the other types of repetitive elements. Specifically, we noticed that LTR sequences were overrepresented in MMLV integration sites, while SINE, LINE, and simple repeats were underrepresented. In contrast, we observed a weak overrepresentation of Ds integration sites overlapping SINE and LTR elements, but no significant over or underrepresentation of sites overlapping simple repeats.

### Transposable elements as instructors of the immune system [^c8d498df]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile repetitive nucleic acid sequences that have been incorporated into the genome through spontaneous integration, accounting for almost 50% of human DNA. Even though most TEs are no longer mobile today, studies have demonstrated that they have important roles in different biological processes, such as ageing, embryonic development, and cancer. TEs influence these processes through various mechanisms, including active transposition of TEs contributing to ongoing evolution, transposon transcription generating RNA or protein, and by influencing gene regulation as enhancers. However, how TEs interact with the immune system remains a largely unexplored field. In this Perspective, we describe how TEs might influence different aspects of the immune system, such as innate immune responses, T cell activation and differentiation, and tissue adaptation. Furthermore, TEs can serve as a source of neoantigens for T cells in antitumour immunity. We suggest that TE biology is an important emerging field of immunology and discuss the potential to harness the TE network therapeutically, for example, to improve immunotherapies for cancer and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

### Epigenetic inheritance is unfaithful at intermediately methylated CpG sites [^f75436c0]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) are potentially mobile genetic units that can be transcriptionally repressed by DNA methylation. However, we found that many CpGs within TEs are intermediately methylated (Fig. 3C). Therefore, we asked whether intermediate methylation associates with either the age and/or has a particular distribution within TE sequences. For example, recently integrated TEs are more likely to retain transcriptional potential and therefore may be preferentially targeted by DNA methylation. We assessed the relationship between methylation status of a CpG and the evolutionary age of the TE it overlaps (where age is measured as the percent divergence of the individual element from the TE consensus sequence) (Supplementary Fig. 23). Globally, TE sequence divergence does not correlate with DNA methylation level nor fidelity (Supplementary Fig. 23B and C). Intermediate methylation of CpGs within TEs is thus unlikely to be related to the age of the element. Moreover, we could not find an association between intermediate methylation levels and the position of a CpG within a TE. Using SINEs as a tractable model, we observed that methylation levels are similar irrespective of the CpG position along the element (Supplementary Fig. 23D), even though like genes, SINEs are structured and have their own promoter regions. Taken together, these results indicate that intermediate CpG methylation within TEs is not dependent on TE sequence divergence and is equally distributed along TE sequences, at least in SINEs.

Besides being frequently found in intergenic regions, TEs can also exist in genic regions such as promoters and introns (Supplementary Fig. 24), but rarely in exons. Given that promoters and gene bodies generally have distinct patterns of methylation, we tested whether intermediate methylation levels at TEs can be determined by the genomic features of the TE insertion site. We observed that TEs in promoters are generally hypomethylated and TEs in introns tend to be hypermethylated (Fig. 3C). TEs in intergenic regions tend to be less methylated than those in introns, but higher than those in promoters. Indeed, intermediate methylation of CpGs within TEs is more likely to occur within intergenic regions, which is consistent with our observation that CpGs in intergenic TEs have lower fidelity scores compared to those in promoters and introns (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the lack of transcriptional activity at the insertion locus is strongly associated with intermediate methylation within TEs, and in turn its fidelity.

### Genome-wide analysis of transposon and retroviral insertions reveals preferential integrations in regions of DNA flexibility [^8a3a73dd]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

NGS of selected Ds lines produced 5473 putative inserts with fragment counts ranging from 5–10,000. To obtain a high-confidence integration set, we performed PCR validation of a subset of NGS-identified sites. We also examined the sequencing results of single insert lines and obtained NGS fragment counts for TAIL-identified sites. Based on these observations, a putative integration site was deemed high-confidence if it was detected with > 50 counts.

Based on findings with the selected set, we devised similar criteria for the unselected Ds set, although we lowered the general fragment count cut-off to 7 as we expected inserts to be diluted in each sample. We noticed that recognition sequences for restriction enzymes used during the NGS protocol were highly prevalent in single fragment putative inserts. Therefore, we applied a more stringent cut-off criterion of 50 fragment counts for these sites, so that no more than 10% of the total sites contained the restriction enzyme recognition sequences.

### Unique mobile elements and scalable gene flow at the prokaryote-eukaryote boundary revealed by circularized asgard archaea genomes [^3e656334]. Nature Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

Non-tandem repeats in the Ca. Heimdallarchaeum spp. overlap prominently with one of the most pervasive mechanisms of gene transfer within and between genomes, that is, a total of 11 families of transposases/integrases, 7 of which have multiplied and transposed to result in up to 27 copies within an individual genome (Fig. 2a). These and other transposases/integrases found in Asgard archaea primarily cluster with various small families within the 96,367 transposase/integrase sequences recovered from the prokaryotic Genome Taxonomic Database (GTDB)(Fig. 2c). Despite the under-representation of archaeal sequences in public databases and in the transposase/integrase dataset in this study, they have representatives in almost all clusters. The intermingled evolutionary relationship between archaeal and bacterial transposases/integrases documented in this study can potentially be both the result of, and contributor to, the gene flow observed between these two domains –.

The circular genomes of Ca. Heimdallarchaeum spp. contain seven CRISPR–Cas systems (Fig. 2b), including five complete operons (labelled C1–3, 5, 6), one array-free operon (C7) and one orphan array (C4) (see Extended Data Fig. 5 for the complete gene organizations). Contrasting the overall gene conservation between the two genomes, these CRISPR–Cas systems exhibit strong variability and site-specific integration (Fig. 2d). For example, C5 and C6 exhibited a complete local operon swap, while C3 and C4 were integrated immediately next to transfer RNA genes, a feature often exploited by bacteriophagesand other Heimdallarchaeal mobile elements (see examples in Fig. 3 below).

Materials and Methods

Ds integration lines

The Ds integration lines were generated as described previously. Briefly, we coinjected one-cell stage zebrafish embryos with pDsDELGT4 (a gene and enhancer trap construct flanked by Ds sequences) together with in vitro transcribed Ac transposase mRNA. The resulting founder lines were then selected based on expression of either EGFP or mCherry indicating successful enhancer and gene trapping, respectively. To study Ds integration preferences in the absence of external selection, pDsDELGT4 plasmid was microinjected into 576 embryos at the one-cell stage as described above. Injected embryos were grown for 3–5 d to obtain sufficient DNA, pooled into groups of 6 and subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS).

### Genome-wide analysis of transposon and retroviral insertions reveals preferential integrations in regions of DNA flexibility [^addfa81b]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

To test if integration was correlated with gene activity, we calculated the gene expression levels of the genes targeted by integrations (Figure 3 and). We measured the median expression level of genes across various time-points as well as an overall expression level (the sum of the individual expression) using published RNA-seq data. We noticed that, on average, genes targeted by Tol2 and MMLV tended to have higher expression in the early embryo. In contrast, genes targeted by Ds did not show any gene expression difference from matched controls.

We also analyzed whether these genes shared any particular pattern of expression, categorizing the genes as having maternal only expression, zygotic only expression, or both maternal and zygotic expression (maternal-zygotic). Ds integrated similarly in genes with each of these expression patterns. In contrast, Tol2 and MMLV integrated preferentially into zygotically expressed genes, and not maternal genes. Since MMLV injections were performed at the 1000 to 2000 cell stage and after zygotic genome activation, our GO and gene expression analyses are consistent with MMLV preferentially integrating into actively transcribed genes from the onset of zygotic genome activation.

Epigenetic marks involved in gene regulation, such as histone modification and differential DNA methylation, might facilitate integration into specific gene regions. Although the overall frequency of integrations within CpG islands was low, we found an increased preference of all integrations toward CpG islands both within and outside promoters, suggesting that regulated regions are preferred regardless of the integration vector used. Similarly, while DNA methylation status was not a key determinant of integration preference, regions of higher CpG DNA methylation at 1-cell and midblastula transition (MBT) stages of development showed a twofold increase in Ds integrations compared to matched controls. This correlation was found for DNA methylation both within and outside gene regions.

Next, we examined whether integrations overlap with chromatin modifications marking active promoter and enhancer elements. All insertion sites, including those that do not overlap with gene regions, preferentially targeted regions rich in chromatin modifications associated with active promoters and enhancers (tri and monomethylation of Histone 3 Lysine 4) suggesting that integration sites in intergenic regions might represent unannotated genes or novel enhancer elements.

### Regulatory transposable elements in the encyclopedia of DNA elements [^8d1fc53c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

When TEs insert themselves into the genome, the newly integrated copy and its progenitor are typically identical in sequence and therefore have the same sequence potential for cis -regulatory activity. However, only a small subset of TE copies within any given subfamily overlaps with cCREs. What influences some TE copies to retain or evolve cis -regulatory activity? One likely influential factor is the genomic context of the TE and its proximity to functional sequences such as genes and cis -regulatory elements. Consistent with this model, we demonstrate that TEs with either cCREs or TFBSs have shorter genomic distance to non-TE cCREs or TFBSs compared to other TEs. Among TEs, the distance between LTR elements with cCREs/TFBSs and non-TE cCREs/TFBSs is the highest, indicating the relatively independent activity of LTRs, possibly due to high density of TFBSs in LTRs. Based on the observation that TF bound TEs are close to non-TE TFBSs, we propose that the clustering of TFBSs from TE insertions introduces functional redundancy that can promote the turnover of TFBSs during evolution, as is prominent in mammals –. By examining the binding profiles of 30 TFs in human and mouse leukemia cell lines, we estimate that TEs have contributed 3–56% of all putative TFBS turnover events depending on the TF. Together these results suggest that the insertion of TEs near existing cis -regulatory elements is a major driver of TFBS evolutionary turnover.

### Patterns of selection in the evolution of a transposable element [^2ed40155]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that can duplicate themselves and relocate from 1 chromosomal locus to another. They are divided into 2 main classes; class I elements [long-terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons] spread via a copy-and-paste pathway that involves an RNA intermediate, whereas class II elements (DNA transposons) transpose via a cut-and-paste pathway; both can result in a net increase of the TE copy number. TEs typically transmit vertically within hosts through the germline, but increasing evidence suggests that horizontal transfer of TEs can occur between species. Due to their activity over evolutionary time, TEs account for ∼50% of most primate genomes and up to 80–90% of the genome of some plants. As such, TE activity is a major determinant of DNA sequence diversity and a key driver of species evolution.

TEs can be potentially harmful because they can integrate into genes and disrupt their function. They can also insert into promoters and regulatory sequences in the vicinity of genes, which can reduce expression levels by attracting silencing mechanisms and increasing local DNA methylation levels. TEs can also have negative consequences because they generate ectopic recombination, impose an energetic cost on genomes, and trigger intragenomic conflict when they capture fragments of host genes. Generally, TEs are thought to reduce host fitness and they have even been implicated with various diseases such as cancer in humans. However, TEs can potentially be advantageous for many of the same reasons, for example by providing exons or introducing promoter and enhancer elements near genes. In plants, there are several well-documented cases of agriculturally important traits that are caused by TE insertions.

### A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements [^cd57d22a]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2007). Medium credibility.

Our knowledge of the structure and composition of genomes is rapidly progressing in pace with their sequencing. The emerging data show that a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes is composed of transposable elements (TEs). Given the abundance and diversity of TEs and the speed at which large quantities of sequence data are emerging, identification and annotation of TEs presents a significant challenge. Here we propose the first unified hierarchical classification system, designed on the basis of the transposition mechanism, sequence similarities and structural relationships, that can be easily applied by non-experts. The system and nomenclature is kept up to date at the WikiPoson web site.

### Retrotransposons in the development and progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^e2606a6d]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

One component of the human genome that has been largely overlooked in conjunction with neurodegenerative diseases until recently is the group of endogenous transposable elements (TEs), even though such structures contribute to nearly half of our genome. Their role in evolution, disease, regulation of gene expression, response to environmental stimuli and their ability to generate genetic diversity both within a population and within an individual have led to them no longer being considered 'junk' DNA but an important part of the human genome. Two classes of TEs can be identified in mammalian genomes:

DNA transposons are widely represented in different taxa of organisms including vertebrates. Functional transposons encode a transposase protein, flanked by two terminal inverted repeats (figure 1A), and move by a 'cut-and-paste' mechanism that involves excising an element and its reinsertion at a new genomic location. S6 On insertion, a sequence in the target site is duplicated, generating a target site duplication (TSD). S7 DNA transposon sequences account for around 3% of the human genome but, with the exception of at least one family of PiggyBac elements in little brown bats, S8 no functional DNA transposons have been identified in mammals to date.
Retrotransposons comprise approximately 42% of the human genome and propagate via a 'copy-and-paste' mechanism, meaning that retrotransposon transcripts are reverse-transcribed into a complementary DNA (cDNA) intermediate which is integrated into a new site of the host genome by retrotransposon-encoded proteins. Retrotransposons can be subdivided into long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons (figure 1B). This review will bring retrotransposons into sharper focus and discuss how their activity could contribute to the development and progression of ALS.

### Transposable elements in mammalian chromatin organization [^fea24741]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA elements that comprise almost 50% of mammalian genomic sequence. TEs are capable of making additional copies of themselves that integrate into new positions in host genomes. This unique property has had an important impact on mammalian genome evolution and on the regulation of gene expression because TE-derived sequences can function as cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters and silencers. Now, advances in our ability to identify and characterize TEs have revealed that TE-derived sequences also regulate gene expression by both maintaining and shaping 3D genome architecture. Studies are revealing how TEs contribute raw sequence that can give rise to the structures that shape chromatin organization, and thus gene expression, allowing for species-specific genome innovation and evolutionary novelty.

Transcription factors and transposable elements may promote paternal epigenetic inheritance.

A Table summarizing what is known regarding the enrichment or disruption of epigenetic marks at specific classes of transposable elements in sperm or embryos from mice or men. B Diagram illustrating the divergence of transposable element copies after integration in the genome and relationships to transposable element age. For each transposable element integrated in the genome, a percent divergence score can be calculated from its consensus sequence. A low percent divergence score reflects a "young" transposable element that has more recently been integrated in the genome as it has not yet accumulated many sequence substitutions (stars), deletions, insertions, truncations, or undergone recombination. Conversely, a high percent divergence corresponds to an "old" transposable element. These old transposable elements may have diverged too far from the original transcription factor binding site, preventing the recognition by transcription factors and downstream activity. Because young transposable elements retain their recognizable transcription factor binding site, they have higher activity and may be epigenetically silenced if not beneficial to the host. Panel created with BioRender.com. C Narrow sperm H3K4me3 peaks that overlap the insulator transcription factor CTCF, important for the 3D chromatin organization in cells, retain H3K4me3 in the pre-implantation embryo. Broad H3K4me3 peaks are not enriched for CTCF in sperm and lose H3K4me3 in the pre-implantation embryo, conferring that CTCF may play a role in the transmission of sperm H3K4me3 post-fertilization. The insulator protein CTCF acts alongside cohesin to regulate topological associated domains in cells by folding domains into loop structures. In line with this, Hi-C experiments have shown a high conservation between the 3D chromatin organization in sperm and in pre-implantation embryos post zygotic genome activation, highlighting the interplay between architectural proteins, and inherited histone modifications in sperm.

### Measuring and interpreting transposable element expression [^73e7ed1b]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2020). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) are insertional mutagens that contribute greatly to the plasticity of eukaryotic genomes, influencing the evolution and adaptation of species as well as physiology or disease in individuals. Measuring TE expression helps to understand not only when and where TE mobilization can occur but also how this process alters gene expression, chromatin accessibility or cellular signalling pathways. Although genome-wide gene expression assays such as RNA sequencing include transposon-derived transcripts, most computational analytical tools discard or misinterpret TE-derived reads. Emerging approaches are improving the identification of expressed TE loci and helping to discriminate TE transcripts that permit TE mobilization from chimeric gene-TE transcripts or pervasive transcription. Here we review the main challenges associated with the detection of TE expression, including mappability, insertional and internal sequence polymorphisms, and the diversity of the TE transcriptional landscape, as well as the different experimental and computational strategies to solve them.

### Human endogenous retroviruses: transposable elements with potential? [^e68ef2e6]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are a significant component of a wider family of retroelements that constitute part of the human genome. These viruses, perhaps representative of previous exogenous retroviral infection, have been integrated and passed through successive generations within the germ line. The retention of HERVs and isolated elements, such as long-terminal repeats, could have the potential to harm. In this review we describe HERVs within the context of the family of known transposable elements and survey these viruses in terms of superantigens and molecular mimics. It is entirely possible that these mechanisms provide the potential for undesired immune responses.

### Genome-wide analysis of transposon and retroviral insertions reveals preferential integrations in regions of DNA flexibility [^7f31b27f]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

We found the presence of DNA flexibility features to be conserved among different types of integrations and in different species. However, the specific features differ from system to system, likely resulting from differences in their mechanisms of integration, or the presence of different cofactors. The ability of hAT transposons to function in diverse species suggests that they might not require specific cofactors, or rely on very highly conserved cofactors. In contrast, several groups have identified bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins as the major host factors that specifically interact with MMLV integrase and mediate the preferential integration of MMLV near TSS.

In summary, our genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of selection are remarkably similar and can be found across the genome. A strict motif associated with target site was not found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral integrations in maize and mouse cells. Our findings show that structural features influence the integration of heterologous DNA in vertebrate genomes, and can facilitate efficient targeted genome engineering.

### Unique mobile elements and scalable gene flow at the prokaryote-eukaryote boundary revealed by circularized asgard archaea genomes [^2b345d54]. Nature Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

HeimV2 (44 kbp), integrated at the same site as HeimM2, may be a hybrid between a virus and a previously undescribed class of transposons, which we tentatively call aloposons, in reference to the twin giants Aloadae in Greek mythology. They share the following features (Fig. 3d). First, they all contain tandem genes encoding proteins 3,000–6,000 amino acids in size, which we refer to as Otus and Ephialtes, the Aloadae twins. Second, they all integrate at different tRNA sites downstream of the giant genes. Aloposon2 in Ca. H. endolithica and Aloposon3 in Ca. H. aukensis represent a highly conserved element that has transposed from one tRNA site to the other during its coevolution with its host. Third, they all encode four consecutive genes upstream of the giant genes, including a gene encoding a bacterial MinD/ParA-like AAA family ATPase. Additionally, we found tandem giant genes in two Thorarchaeota MAGs showing distant homology to the Heimdallarchaeum giant proteins, as well as many unrelated giant genes across the Asgard archaea, some of which may also be part of Asgard mobile elements (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Putative virus HeimV1 (30 kbp) is a circular element with a highly polycistronic gene arrangement and an enrichment in nucleic acid-processing enzymes, viral structural proteins and viral gene homologues (Fig. 3e). As shown in Fig. 3f, HeimV1 exists in two states. Besides the genome-integrated lysogenic state found in one of the incubations, where its sequencing read abundance was at the same level as its genomic neighbourhood, in another enrichment incubation, HeimV1 showed an anomalously high read abundance relative to the host Ca. H. endolithica, suggestive of active replication. PCR and Sanger sequencing further confirmed the circularized state of HeimV1 as well as its integration between the host transposase and tRNA genes. Furthermore, the detailed sequencing read abundance profile across HeimV1 shows the characteristic V shape of an unsynchronized, bidirectionally self-replicating population of circular DNA elements (Fig. 3f). Such a well-defined profile can only emerge if the replications in each HeimV1 circular element initiate at a defined origin of replication.

### Processed pseudogenes acquired somatically during cancer development [^d6596a6b]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Mutation underpins both the evolution of species and the development of cancer. In the germline, repetitive DNA, such as long interspersed elements (LINE) and Alu repeats, form a sizable proportion of the human genome. LINE elements continue to propagate in the genome through their retrotransposition machinery. Essentially, a functional LINE element, when transcribed and translated by the host machinery, encodes two proteins that co-ordinate reverse transcription of the mRNA template and its integration back into the genome at a distant site from the original element. Insertion of transposable elements has considerably reshaped the human genome over evolutionary time. A role for retrotransposition as a mutational force in somatic cells has been increasingly recognized in the last few years, documented to occur during both normal neurogenesisand cancer development.

Germline pseudogenes, representing cDNA copies of mRNA transcripts, are a by-product of LINE-mediated retrotransposition. This copying of DNA sequence through an mRNA intermediate creates several distinctive genomic features of pseudogenes, including the presence of polyA tails, absence of intronic sequence and target-site duplications. In the germline, processed pseudogenes influence evolution through gene duplication, novel exons, gene fusions, sequestration of miRNAsand antisense transcript production.

Formation of processed pseudogenes has not been systematically studied in cancer. From a screen of 660 cancer samples, we find that somatically acquired pseudogenes are present in 2.6% of cancers, especially lung and colorectal cancers. We find a diverse array of transcriptional consequences, including expression from UTR and intronic insertions, as well as inactivation of transcription from exonic insertions.

### Genome-wide analysis of transposon and retroviral insertions reveals preferential integrations in regions of DNA flexibility [^2fe7adf8]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

DNA transposons and retroviruses are important transgenic tools for genome engineering. An important consideration affecting the choice of transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences. Previous large-scale analyses of Ds transposon integration sites in plants were done on the basis of reporter gene expression or germ-line transmission, making it difficult to discern vertebrate integration preferences. Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon integration sites in zebrafish with Tol2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome. No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral integrations in maize and mouse cells. Our findings show that structural features influence the integration of heterologous DNA in genomes, and have implications for targeted genome engineering.

### Comprehensive identification of transposable element insertions using multiple sequencing technologies [^79beeabe]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Detection of LTR recombination-associated dimorphic HERV copies

As shown in Fig. S16, we first extract all the annotated reference LTR repeats from RepeatMasker. Second, for each extracted LTR repeat, we check whether reads are clipped aligned at the boundary. If so, we collect all these clipped reads for each LTR repeat and perform local assembly. Third, we align the two flanking regions of the LTR repeat to the assembled contigs. If both of the flanking regions are well aligned, we extract the middle part as the candidate HERV copy. Finally, we align the LTR repeat to the candidate copy, and if it is aligned to both ends of the candidate copy, and also the middle part is masked as HERV by RepeatMasker, we designate the site as a dimorphic HERV copy driven by LTR recombination.

### Hypomethylation marks enhancers within transposable elements [^e33034f2]. Nature Genetics (2013). Medium credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) make up 50% of the human genome and are usually considered a mutational burden. A new study uses signatures of DNA hypomethylation to identify tissue-specific enhancers within TEs, providing fresh evidence that mobile DNA has a non-negligible role in genome regulation and evolution.

### Population-scale long-read sequencing uncovers transposable elements associated with gene expression variation and adaptive signatures in drosophila [^4d8ec545]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite their crucial role and high prevalence in most eukaryotic genomes, transposable elements (TEs) and other structural variants (SVs) remain largely understudied. This is mainly a consequence of the limitations of high throughput sequencing read length, tightly restricted to short-reads in the last decades –. Short-reads not only limited the annotation of SVs to what inference methods were able to identify –, but also required a reference genome to map the reads, which has at least three major drawbacks: (i) the information about the genetic background and genomic context of the SVs are usually lost; (ii) the analyses are biased to what is possible to identify using a specific reference genome; and (iii) repetitive sequences in the reference genome are not well characterized when they are longer than the sequenced reads. In the particular case of TEs, the limitations of using short-reads are exacerbated even further for two reasons: sequence divergence of the copies, and their extremely repetitive nature. Such a complexity has severely restricted inter- and intra-species TE dynamics studies, a crucial aspect that needs to be addressed in order to better understand the organization, function, and evolution of genomes.

During the last years, technological developments in DNA sequencing read length have lead not only to an improvement in the quality and completeness of reference genomes –, but also to a significant rise in the number of high-quality genomes for multiple individuals of the same species, opening a new era in comparative population genomics. The ability of long-reads to span repetitive regions of the genome, together with the relative low price of generating sequences for several individuals, has opened up the possibility of resolving and comparing previously absent or misassembled regions in the genome. which can lead to a significant improvement in our ability to study TE structure, activity and dynamics in different organisms.

Drosophila melanogaster represents one of the best model animals for studying TEs, not only for having one of the best annotated eukaryotic genomes, but also for containing several active TE families. Interestingly, even in such a well-studied organism, long-read sequencing approaches have made novel insights into the evolutionary dynamics of TEs. However, these studies do not take full advantage of the variability present in the populations analyzed, as they mainly use standard homology-based approaches (e.g. RepeatMasker and RepBase) for annotating and analyzing TEs, which limits their analysis to TE families already present in the available libraries.

### Transcriptional activities of the sleeping beauty transposon and shielding its genetic cargo with insulators [^3b43b460]. Molecular Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposable element shows efficient transposition in human cells, and provides long-term transgene expression in preclinical animal models. Random chromosomal insertion of SB vectors represents a safety issue in human gene therapeutic applications, due to potential genotoxic effects associated with transposon integration. We investigated the transcriptional activities of SB in order to assess its potential to alter host gene expression upon integration. The untranslated regions (UTRs) of the transposon direct convergent, inward-directed transcription. Transcription from the 5'-UTR of SB is upregulated by the host-encoded factor high-mobility group 2-like 1 (HMG2L1), and requires a 65-base pair (bp) region not present in commonly used SB vectors. The SB transposase antagonizes the effect of HMG2L1, suggesting that natural transposase expression is under a negative feedback regulation. SB transposon vectors lacking the 65-bp region associated with HMG2L1-dependent upregulation exhibit benign transcriptional activities, at a level up to 100-times lower than that of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) long terminal repeat (LTR). Incorporation of chicken beta-globin HS4 insulator sequences in SB-based vectors reduces the transactivation of model promoters by transposon-borne enhancers, and thus may lower the risk of transcriptional activation of host genes situated close to a transposon insertion site.

### Integron cassettes integrate into bacterial genomes via widespread non-classical attG sites [^1b255bbd]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Integrons are genetic elements involved in bacterial adaptation which capture, shuffle and express genes encoding adaptive functions embedded in cassettes. These events are governed by the integron integrase through site-specific recombination between attC and attI integron sites. Using computational and molecular genetic approaches, here we demonstrate that the integrase also catalyses cassette integration into bacterial genomes outside of its known att sites. Once integrated, these cassettes can be expressed if located near bacterial promoters and can be excised at the integration point or outside, inducing chromosomal modifications in the latter case. Analysis of more than 5×10 5 independent integration events revealed a very large genomic integration landscape. We identified consensus recombination sequences, named attG sites, which differ greatly in sequence and structure from classical att sites. These results unveil an alternative route for dissemination of adaptive functions in bacteria and expand the role of integrons in bacterial evolution.

### Structural basis of Ty3 retrotransposon integration at RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes [^ea06d7d8]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Retrotransposons are endogenous elements that have the ability to mobilise their DNA between different locations in the host genome. The Ty3 retrotransposon integrates with an exquisite specificity in a narrow window upstream of RNA Polymerase (Pol) III-transcribed genes, representing a paradigm for harmless targeted integration. Here we present the cryo-EM reconstruction at 4.0Å of an active Ty3 strand transfer complex bound to TFIIIB transcription factor and a tRNA gene. The structure unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying Ty3 targeting specificity at Pol III-transcribed genes and sheds light into the architecture of retrotransposon machinery during integration. Ty3 intasome contacts a region of TBP, a subunit of TFIIIB, which is blocked by NC2 transcription regulator in RNA Pol II-transcribed genes. A newly-identified chromodomain on Ty3 integrase interacts with TFIIIB and the tRNA gene, defining with extreme precision the integration site position.

### High-definition mapping of retroviral integration sites identifies active regulatory elements in human multipotent hematopoietic progenitors [^fb244c23]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Integration of retroviral vectors in the human genome follows nonrandom patterns that favor insertional deregulation of gene expression and increase the risk of their use in clinical gene therapy. The molecular basis of retroviral target site selection is still poorly understood. We used deep sequencing technology to build genomewide, high-definition maps of > 60 000 integration sites of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)- and HIV-based retroviral vectors in the genome of human CD34(+) multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and used gene expression profiling, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and bioinformatics to associate integration to genetic and epigenetic features of the HPC genome. Clusters of recurrent MLV integrations identify regulatory elements (alternative promoters, enhancers, evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions) within or around protein-coding genes and microRNAs with crucial functions in HPC growth and differentiation, bearing epigenetic marks of active or poised transcription (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9Ac, Pol II) and specialized chromatin configurations (H2A.Z). Overall, we mapped 3500 high-frequency integration clusters, which represent a new resource for the identification of transcriptionally active regulatory elements. High-definition MLV integration maps provide a rational basis for predicting genotoxic risks in gene therapy and a new tool for genomewide identification of promoters and regulatory elements controlling hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell functions.

### Comprehensive identification of transposable element insertions using multiple sequencing technologies [^188716bc]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) help shape the structure and function of the human genome. When inserted into some locations, TEs may disrupt gene regulation and cause diseases. Here, we present xTea (x-Transposable element analyzer), a tool for identifying TE insertions in whole-genome sequencing data. Whereas existing methods are mostly designed for short-read data, xTea can be applied to both short-read and long-read data. Our analysis shows that xTea outperforms other short read-based methods for both germline and somatic TE insertion discovery. With long-read data, we created a catalogue of polymorphic insertions with full assembly and annotation of insertional sequences for various types of retroelements, including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses. Notably, we find that individual genomes have an average of nine groups of full-length L1s in centromeres, suggesting that centromeres and other highly repetitive regions such as telomeres are a significant yet unexplored source of active L1s. xTea is available at https://github.com/parklab/xTea.

### Regulatory transposable elements in the encyclopedia of DNA elements [^ce4b6a88]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We investigated whether cCRE-enriched TF motifs likely originated from the ancestral TE or arose through mutations after insertion. We first asked what percentage of cCRE-enriched motifs can be identified in the TE's consensus sequence, which represents their ancestral TE sequence. Of 1183 motifs, 541 (46%) are found in consensus sequences (Supplementary Fig. 3C). Notably, SINEs have the lowest percentage (mean of 12%) among TE classes. To increase resolution and specificity, we extended our analysis to consider motif location for individual TE copies. If a TF motif is truly derived from its ancestral TE insertion, we expect the motif to be in the same relative position as the consensus sequence's motif. Thus, we inferred the ancestral origin of each TE's motifs based on the presence or absence of the motif within 10 bp of a consensus motif (Fig. 3A). At a mean of 7%, SINEs once again have the lowest percentage of ancestrally derived TF motifs (percent ancestral origin) for cCRE-associated motifs across TE subfamilies (Fig. 3B). We also observed that cCRE-associated TF motifs have significantly higher percent ancestral origin compared to randomly selected motifs for DNA transposons (p = 1.2 × 10 −8), LINEs (p = 8.7 × 10 −8), LTRs (p < 2.2 × 10 −16), and ERV internal regions (ERV-int) (p = 0.0067). This suggests that ancestral TE sequences serve as an important source of TF motifs in cCREs for most but not all TE classes. For SINEs, the percentage of cCRE-associated motifs of ancestral origin was not different from random expectation (p = 0.86), indicating that the ancestral TE sequence does not generally explain the presence of TF motifs enriched within SINE-derived cCREs.

### Patterns of selection in the evolution of a transposable element [^3fc6ac3c]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

We have shown that the number of vN and vS in an alignment of TE sequences from a single genome, declines as a function of the frequency of the variants in the alignment. This is consistent with the action of negative selection; elements that accumulate nonsynonymous mutations are less likely to transpose and hence have progeny, and hence have a high frequency in the alignment.

### Lateral gene transfers and the origins of the eukaryote proteome: a view from microbial parasites [^7c5f96da]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Novel genes derived from a number of processes; including gene duplications, de novo gene formation, and LGT; contribute to genomic and phenotypic plasticity and can drive adaptive evolution. LGT in prokaryotes is recognised to play a major role in providing novel protein coding genes and contributing adaptive traits, including the archetypical resistance to antibiotics. The frequency and origins of LGT among eukaryotes and its impact on their biology is still relatively poorly understood but is also increasingly recognised as a significant source of novel genes. Compared to prokaryotes identifying LGT in eukaryotes is more difficult due to the confounding effect of their (i) complex origins involving at least two prokaryotic lineages, (ii) more complex genome architecture and protein coding capacities, (iii) sparse and biased taxonomic sampling of genome sequence data and (iv) lack of phylogenetic resolution for the major eukaryotic lineages. These factors, along with the intrinsic difficulties of inferring single gene phylogenies, render annotations and evolutionary inferences of eukaryotic protein coding genes often less reliable and more sensitive to sequence database taxa sampling and to different parameters of evolutionary models in bioinformatic tools.

Protein coding genes in eukaryote nuclear genomes are currently thought to have originated from DNA from at least two distinct prokaryotic lineages, an archaeal source, thought to represent the original host that evolved into a nucleated cell and an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont that eventually evolved into mitochondria. Additional nuclear genes of bacterial origin can be identified among eukaryotes possessing plastids, derived from a cyanobacterial primary endosymbiont or from secondary/tertiary endosymbioses involving eukaryotic endosymbionts with primary/secondary plastids. Eukaryotic nuclear genes derived from endosymbionts are defined as endosymbiotic gene transfers (EGT), which for convenience we differentiate here from LGT from other sources. Mobile genetic elements, including viruses and transposable elements, can also be integrated into nuclear genomes. We shall focus here on eukaryotic genes of prokaryotic origins in microbial parasites and discuss how these data are pertinent to the question of the relative contribution of prokaryotic LGT during eukaryote diversification more generally. Notably, in a given eukaryotic genome the number of genes of bacterial origin are typically more numerous (∼2/1 ratio across 14 genomes analysed in) and significantly more variable than those that can be traced to an archaeal origin, highlighting the higher evolutionary plasticity of the former. The growing list of LGT identified from various prokaryotic donor lineages in different eukaryotic lineages suggests that LGT has played a significant role in shaping eukaryote protein coding capacity throughout eukaryote diversification.

The majority of the Reps from pCRESS7 and pCRESS9 are encoded by extrachromosomal plasmids (Supplementary Table 1). By contrast, the vast majority (97.5%) of Reps found in other groups are encoded within mobile genetic elements site-specifically integrated into bacterial chromosomes (Supplementary Table 1; Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Note 1). Notably, none of the elements encoded any homologs of currently known viral structural proteins (Supplementary Note 1). Collectively, these observations indicate that viral-like Reps in bacteria are encoded by diverse extrachromosomal and integrated plasmids.

### 3D hotspots of recurrent retroviral insertions reveal long-range interactions with cancer genes [^b47aa495]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Genomically distal mutations can contribute to the deregulation of cancer genes by engaging in chromatin interactions. To study this, we overlay viral cancer-causing insertions obtained in a murine retroviral insertional mutagenesis screen with genome-wide chromatin conformation capture data. Here we find that insertions tend to cluster in 3D hotspots within the nucleus. The identified hotspots are significantly enriched for known cancer genes, and bear the expected characteristics of bona fide regulatory interactions, such as enrichment for transcription factor-binding sites. In addition, we observe a striking pattern of mutual exclusive integration. This is an indication that insertions in these loci target the same gene, either in their linear genomic vicinity or in their 3D spatial vicinity. Our findings shed new light on the repertoire of targets obtained from insertional mutagenesis screening and underline the importance of considering the genome as a 3D structure when studying effects of genomic perturbations.

### Chromatin loops are an ancestral hallmark of the animal regulatory genome [^958d5ef7]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

To understand what distinguishes placozoan GP1 genes, we analysed loop anchor sequences in both species using genomic sequences as background. We identified an enriched motif at chromatin loop anchor regions in both placozoan species (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 8i, j) and found that GP1 promoters frequently contained insertions of Mutator DNA transposable elements (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 8e), with the terminal inverted repeat (TIR) sequence of this transposon containing the identified sequence motif. To further explore this association, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including all intact Mutator TIR sequences in four placozoan species (Extended Data Fig. 8k and Supplementary Data 1). This analysis revealed a Mutator family shared across species and with consensus TIR sequences resembling the motif found in chromatin loops anchors (Extended Data Fig. 8k). The connection between chromatin loops and the Mutator transposable element suggests a potential evolutionary and functional relationship. One possibility is that an architectural protein in placozoans evolved to recognize the sequence motif within the Mutator TIRs, leading to 'domestication' of these sites as regulatory elements. Alternatively, the presence of the motif and Mutator TIR sequences may indicate targeted integration of Mutator transposons into promoter regions of highly expressed genes. Overall, our analyses showed that roughly one-third of T. adhaerens and C. collaboinventa genes are part of promoter hubs mediated by chromatin loops and that these contacts are associated with the presence of conserved Mutator DNA transposons harbouring a specific sequence motif.

### Retroviruses integrate into a shared, non-palindromic DNA motif [^43c6a2e2]. Nature Microbiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Many DNA-binding factors, such as transcription factors, form oligomeric complexes with structural symmetry that bind to palindromic DNA sequences 1. Palindromic consensus nucleotide sequences are also found at the genomic integration sites of retroviruses 2–6 and other transposable elements 7–9, and it has been suggested that this palindromic consensus arises as a consequence of the structural symmetry in the integrase complex 2,3. However, we show here that the palindromic consensus sequence is not present in individual integration sites of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but arises in the population average as a consequence of the existence of a non-palindromic nucleotide motif that occurs in approximately equal proportions on the plus strand and the minus strand of the host genome. We develop a generally applicable algorithm to sort the individual integration site sequences into plus-strand and minus-strand subpopulations, and use this to identify the integration site nucleotide motifs of five retroviruses of different genera: HTLV-1, HIV-1, murine leukaemia virus (MLV), avian sarcoma leucosis virus (ASLV) and prototype foamy virus (PFV). The results reveal a non-palindromic motif that is shared between these retroviruses.

Results

DNA methylation around HBV integration sites mirrors the hypomethylation of HCC patients

In order to explore methylation profiles in cell-free-based WGBS data, we conducted a pilot study with 5 cfDNA samples using relative high-depth WGBS: one healthy individual (D1), one patient with chronic hepatitis (D2), one patient with cirrhosis (D3), and two HCC patients (D4 and D5 of before and after surgery). The final read count equated to a mean of 58 million (M) reads per sample (Additional file 2: Table S1). The average DNA methylation across the genome (Methyl genome) was much lower in the HCC patient (D4; 53.56%) compared to the healthy individual and patient with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (74.76%, 75.13%, and 75.65%; Additional file 1: Fig. S1A; Additional file 2: Table S1). We found the genome distribution of CpGs in WGBS data tended to be located at intronic, intergenic, and repeat regions (Fig. 1 a).

### A direct comparison of two nonviral gene therapy vectors for somatic integration: in vivo evaluation of the bacteriophage integrase phiC31 and the sleeping beauty transposase [^995c499e]. Molecular Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

In this study we performed a head-to-head comparison of the integrase phiC31 derived from a Streptomyces phage and the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase, a member of the TC1/mariner superfamily of transposable elements. Mouse liver was cotransfused with a vector containing our most robust human coagulation factor IX expression cassette and the appropriate recombinase recognition site and either a phiC31- or a SB transposase-expressing vector. To analyze transgene persistence and to prove somatic integration in vivo we induced cell cycling of mouse hepatocytes and found that the transgene expression levels dropped by only 16 to 21% and 56 to 66% in mice that received phiC31 and SB, respectively. Notably, no difference in the toxicity profile was detected in mice treated with either recombinase. Moreover we observed that with the integrase-mediated gene transfer, transgene expression levels were dependent on the remaining noncoding vector sequences, which also integrate into the host genome. Further analyses of a hot spot of integration after phiC31-mediated integration revealed small chromosomal deletions at the target site and that the recombination process was not dependent on the orientation in which the phiC31 recognition site attached to the pseudo-recognition sites in the host genome. Coupled together with ongoing improvements in both systems this study suggests that both nonviral vector systems will have important roles in achieving stable gene transfer in vivo.

### Chromatin loops are an ancestral hallmark of the animal regulatory genome [^1c07dbf4]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Finally, we analysed evolutionary conservation of the sequences at the loop anchor points. To this end, we calculated genome-wide conservation scores from alignments of M. leidyi genome with three other ctenophore species (Bolinopsis microptera, Pleurobrachia bachei and H. californensis). Chromatin loop anchors, both at intronic and intergenic regions, showed higher sequence conservation compared to other introns or random genomic regions, respectively (Fig. 4g). The promoters of genes involved in distal contacts showed lower conservation score compared to other promoters (Fig. 4g), with conservation levels similar to those of random intergenic regions. Moreover, these promoters had a high frequency of transposable element integrations and elevated DNA methylation (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9o). Furthermore, we found that genes located within enhancer–promoter loop regions in M. leidyi have higher syntenic conservation across ctenophore species compared to other genomic regions of similar size (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 9p). Overall, the conservation of loop anchor regions across ctenophore species and the increased syntenic linkage of genes suggest that gene positioning is constrained by genome architecture. These findings indicate that the distal chromatin contacts identified in M. leidyi represent an evolutionary conserved mechanism of genome regulation present in both lobate and cydippid ctenophores.

### Widespread contribution of transposable elements to the rewiring of mammalian 3D genomes [^6758f1bb]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Transposable elements (TEs) are major contributors of genetic material in mammalian genomes. These often include binding sites for architectural proteins, including the multifarious master protein, CTCF, which shapes the 3D genome by creating loops, domains, compartment borders, and RNA-DNA interactions. These play a role in the compact packaging of DNA and have the potential to facilitate regulatory function. In this study, we explore the widespread contribution of TEs to mammalian 3D genomes by quantifying the extent to which they give rise to loops and domain border differences across various cell types and species using several 3D genome mapping technologies. We show that specific families and subfamilies of TEs have contributed to lineage-specific 3D chromatin structures across mammalian species. In many cases, these loops may facilitate sustained interaction between distant cis-regulatory elements and target genes, and domains may segregate chromatin state to impact gene expression in a lineage-specific manner. An experimental validation of our analytical findings using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete a candidate TE resulted in disruption of species-specific 3D chromatin structure. Taken together, we comprehensively quantify and selectively validate our finding that TEs contribute to shaping 3D genome organization and may, in some cases, impact gene regulation during the course of mammalian evolution.

### Differential pre-mRNA splicing alters the transcript diversity of helitrons between the maize inbred lines [^d3013545]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

Helitrons represent a novel family of highly abundant transposable elements in the genomes of species representing all eukaryotic kingdoms. An autonomous Helitron is proposed to encode DNA helicase and a replication initiator protein. These are similar to bacterial transposons, which transpose via a rolling circle mechanism. Typically, unlike other known transposable elements, Helitrons do not contain repeats of their terminal ends and do not duplicate the host sequence upon insertion. Rather, they insert between host dinucleotide AT in the vast majority of cases, and bear conserved TC and CTRR nucleotides at their 5′ and 3′ terminal ends, respectively.

Although Helitrons are proposed to multiply via strand replacement and synthesis, similar to the copy-and-paste mechanism, recent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of their somatic excisions in maize indicates these elements also can transpose via a cut-and-paste mechanism. Despite their importance, unequivocal genetic or biochemical evidence of their activity and movement to date remains elusive in any species. The presence of nearly identical copies of long Helitrons inserted in different regions of the genome points to their recent mobility in the maize genome. Our earlier report of two maize mutants caused by the recent insertion of Helitrons provided the first genetic evidence of their mobility in the present day maize genome. Recently, Helitrons were reported to be the most abundant DNA transposon in the maize genome. An improved version of the computational-based searches estimates the presence of more than 31,000 Helitrons. These constitute > 6% of the total maize genome. These Helitrons are prolific in capturing thousands of gene pieces and mobilizing them into different regions of the genome. Gene piece capture appears random, and the advantage of this to the host or the element remains unclear. The captured gene pieces display varying degrees of sequence similarity to their putative progenitors. It remains unclear whether this reflects the evolutionary time of their capture or natural selection. Several contrasting mechanisms for gene capture by Helitrons have been proposed but each lacks supporting experimental evidence. In addition to coding regions, Helitrons have mediated massive movement of a diverse collection of host sequences, including promoters, poly-A addition sites and binding sites for various regulatory proteins across the genome. Emerging reports indicate that in addition to coding regions, Helitrons also have captured and multiplied various host regulatory sequences that display functionality. These point to their possible important roles in physiological processes and adaptation of organisms to their environment.

### Caenorhabditis elegans transposable elements harbor diverse transcription factor DNA-binding sites [^f9be3c81]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Transposable elements are powerful agents of evolution that can diversify transcriptional programs by distributing transcription factor DNA-binding sites throughout genomes. To investigate the extent that transposable elements provide transcription factor-binding motifs in Caenorhabditis elegans, we determined the genomic positions of DNA-binding motifs for 201 different transcription factors. Surprisingly, we found that almost all examined transcription factors have binding motifs that reside within transposable elements, and all types of transposable elements have at least 1 instance of a transcription factor motif, demonstrating that transposable elements provide previously unappreciated numbers of transcription factor-binding motifs to the C. elegans genome. After determining the occurrence of transcription factor motifs in transposable elements relative to the rest of the genome, we identified DNA-binding motifs for 45 different transcription factors that are greater than 20-fold enriched within transposable elements compared to what would be expected by chance. Consistent with potential functional roles for these transposable element-enriched transcription factor-binding sequences, we determined that all transcription factor motif types found in transposable elements have instances of residing within accessible chromatin sites associated with transcription factor binding. The overwhelming majority of transcription factor-binding motifs located within transposable elements associate with their cognate transcription factors, suggesting extensive binding of transcription factors to sequences within transposable elements. In addition, transposable elements with accessible or transcription factor-bound motifs reside in the putative promoter regions of approximately 12% of all protein-coding genes, providing widespread possibilities for influencing gene expression. This work represents the first comprehensive analysis of transposable element-transcription factor interactions in C. elegans and demonstrates that transposable element-provided transcription factor-binding sites are prevalent in this important model organism.

### Retrotransposon-derived elements in the mammalian genome: a potential source of disease [^95a0f412]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2004). Low credibility.

The plethora of genomic information gathered by the sequencing of the human and mouse genomes has paved the way for a new era of genetics. While in the past we focused mainly on the small percentage of DNA that codes for proteins, we can now concentrate on the remainder, i.e. the noncoding sequences that interrupt and separate genes. This portion of the genome is made up, in most part, of repetitive DNA sequences including DNA transposons, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements) and SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements). Some of these elements are transcriptionally active and can transpose or retrotranspose around the genome, resulting in insertional mutagenesis that can cause disease. In these cases, insertions have occurred in the coding sequence. However, recent evidence suggests that the main effect of these elements is their ability to influence transcription of neighbouring genes. The elements themselves contain promoters that can initiate transcription of flanking genomic DNA. Furthermore, they are susceptible to epigenetic silencing, which is often stochastic and incomplete, resulting in complex patterns of transcription. This review discusses some diseases in both human and mouse that are caused by these repetitive elements.

### Regulatory transposable elements in the encyclopedia of DNA elements [^3aaac596]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

TEs make up a large portion of most mammalian genomes, and many studies have shown that TEs contribute to their regulatory landscape. However, the extent to which TEs supply different types of regulatory elements and the factors that allow them to evolve as regulatory elements are not well understood. In this study, we utilize cCREs to define the contribution of TEs to the human regulatory space, finding that ~25% of all cCREs are TE-derived. This overall contribution is similar to previous estimates by Pehrsson et al. who studied the overlap of TEs with active regulatory states in the RoadMap Epigenome Project. We observed that TEs do not contribute to the different types of cCREs equally; they contribute more substantially to gene-distal enhancers than to gene-proximal enhancers and promoters. This pattern is likely driven by selection against TE insertions in the proximity of genes. Regardless of their cCRE type, we found that TE-derived cCREs are more likely to be restricted to one or a few cell/tissue types compared to non-TE cCREs. This result suggests that TEs could be important for regulatory innovation by providing gene regulatory elements that are active in a limited number of cellular contexts. The documented contribution of TEs to gene regulation in rapidly-evolving processes such as innate immunity and placentation support this hypothesis.

### Transposable element islands facilitate adaptation to novel environments in an invasive species [^ecf513eb]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Here we explore the genomes of C. obscurior from two invasive populations (Brazil BR and Japan JP) to identify signatures of divergence on a genomic level and to determine how the species can rapidly adapt to different habitats. We find clear phenotypic differences between the populations and strong correlation between accumulations of TEs ('TE islands') and genetic variation. Our results suggest that TE islands might function as spring wells for genetic diversification in founder populations of this invasive species. The distinct organization of TE islands, their gene composition and their regulation by the genome adds compelling evidence for the role of TEs as players in differentiation, adaptation and speciation.

### Integrative pan cancer analysis reveals epigenomic variation in cancer type and cell specific chromatin domains [^19cc029c]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Next, we surveyed transcription factor-binding site (TFBS) enrichment in 15 chromatin states using data generated in human H1-ES cells and K-562 cells. Coverage for TFBS was predominantly enriched in several chromatin states including 3 (transcription at 5′), 4 (active genes), 5 (active bivalent), 12 (bivalent/weak transcription), and 14 (H3K4me3 only), and to a lesser extent 2 (bivalent active; Supplementary Fig. 3a). TFBS enrichment around TSS sites was predominantly observed for chromatin states 3 and 5 (transcription at 5′, active bivalent enhancers), whereas TFBS enrichment around transcription end sites (TES) was observed for multiple states: highest TFBS enrichment was observed for chromatin states 3 and 5, followed by 2, 12, and 14 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We also evaluated enrichment of repetitive DNA elements in the 15 chromatin states. Long interspersed elements (LINE) and long-terminal repeat (LTR) elements were enriched in chromatin states 1, 6, 8–9, 11–12, while states 2–5, 13–15 displayed decreased enrichment (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Repeat family members such as ERVK were enriched in states 1, 6, 9, 11–12 (Supplementary Fig. 3d), low complexity repeats were enriched in states 1 and 14, while RC/Helitron transposable elements (TE) were enriched in states 1–2, and 6. RNA repeats were enriched in states 2, 5 and 12, while SINE repeats were enriched in states 1, 6–8. Moreover, satellite repeats were mainly enriched in state 10, 12, and 15. In addition, an investigation of repeat subfamily members revealed dynamic organization of repeat elements in the 15 chromatin states (Supplementary Fig. 3e). Inspection of a UCSC browser view of a ChromHMM genome annotation across 60 cell lines representing 9 cancer types showed enrichment of chromatin states at a representative locus (Supplementary Fig. 3f).

### Widespread contribution of transposable elements to the rewiring of mammalian 3D genomes [^a4ee2e7f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Thus, we provide evidence of how bursts of lineage-specific TE activity can provide CTCF binding sites resulting in lineage-specific higher-order chromosomal structures that rewire local gene regulation, pushing regulatory innovation, ultimately permitting the emergence of novel evolutionary phenotypes. Taken together, our observations and results represent the regulatory innovation that TEs bring to host genomes.

By analyzing publicly available high-resolution Hi-C datasets from four different species, we aimed to identify, quantify, and validate TE transposition as a widespread phenomenon that contributes to lineage-specific genome folding patterns and consequently lineage-specific gene regulation across multiple mammalian species. We found that 8–37% of loop anchor and TAD boundary CTCF sites were derived from repeats in the 37 cell types that were profiled. We outline lineage-specific contribution of TE classes, families, and subfamilies to loop anchor and TAD boundary CTCF sites, highlighting TE families like MIR (common), tRNA (dog), and B2 (mouse) SINEs, L1 (common) and L2 (all but mouse) LINEs, ERV-family (common) of LTRs and hAT-Charlie (humans) family of DNA transposons that have contributed extensively to CTCF sites involved in 3D genome folding. Further, we characterize lineage-specific chromatin loops, showing that a significant fraction (14–18%) of these are anchored at TE-derived CTCF binding sites. A substantial fraction (27–28%) of these TE-derived, lineage-specific loops were predicted to be enhancer-promoter loops, representing the regulatory innovation TEs unintentionally bring along as they infect and invade the host genome. We also find that some of these lineage-specific TE-derived loops contribute to divergent gene expression due to lineage-specific transcriptional regulation. Finally, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete a candidate TE (L1MC1) that was predicted to anchor an enhancer-promoter loop as well as a TAD domain boundary in human lymphoblastoid cell lines. Upon deletion of the element, we see collapse of the novel loop as well as the domain boundary, underscoring the importance of TEs in the context of 3D genome remodeling and regulatory innovation. Taken together, our findings shed light on the extent to which TEs have contributed to loop anchor and TAD boundary CTCF sites in mammalian species, consequently rewiring the 3D genome and accelerating regulatory crosstalk and innovation.

### PiRNA-guided CRISPR-like immunity in eukaryotes [^df45cb23]. Trends in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Eukaryotic genomes contain virus-derived sequences called endogenous virus elements (EVEs). The majority of EVEs are related to retroviruses, which integrate into the host genome in order to replicate. Some retroviral EVEs encode a function; for example, some produce proteins that block infection by related viruses. EVEs derived from nonretroviral viruses - also recently found in many eukaryotic genomes - are more enigmatic. Here, we summarize the evidence that EVEs can act as templates to generate Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), whose canonical function is sequence-specific silencing of transposable elements (TEs) to maintain genomic integrity. We argue that EVEs may thus enable heritable, sequence-specific antiviral immune memory in eukaryotes - analogous to CRISPR-Cas immunity in prokaryotes.

### Population genomics supports baculoviruses as vectors of horizontal transfer of insect transposons [^807c3063]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

MAR1 and IFP2 are DNA transposons that transpose via a cut-and-paste mechanism typically generating specific target site duplications (TSDs) upon insertion. Consistently, all junctions between the AcMNPV genome and the MAR1 or IFP2 elements identified in our chimeric reads corresponded to the expected TSD of the Tc1-Mariner (TA) and piggyBac (TTAA) TE superfamilies, respectively (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). In addition, all TE/virus junctions identified within the chimeric reads started at the first or last nucleotide position of the MAR1 or IFP2 consensus sequences. Importantly, we selected chimeric reads encompassing five MAR1 and three IFP2 copies, and independently confirmed their integration in AcMNPV by PCR/sequencing (using the same viral genomic DNA used for ultra-deep sequencing), demonstrating that the chimeric reads that we identified are authentic TE insertions in AcMNPV, rather than sequencing artefacts (see Methods). By contrast, HaSE3, which is a short interspersed element that retrotransposes via a copy-and-paste mechanism, does not generate conserved TSDs upon insertion (Supplementary Data 3). Therefore, genuine retrotransposition of HaSE3 into AcMNPV could not be confidently assessed. Consequently, HaSE3 was not considered for further analysis. Altogether, our analyses of the sequence organization of chimeric reads and experimental tests demonstrate that multiple copies of at least two eukaryotic TE families became integrated in AcMNPV via bona fide transposition.

The IFP2 copies we identified here correspond to the element initially characterized as an in vitro insertion in the AcMNPV genome after virus passage in a T. ni cell line. IFP2 was later shown to be integrated in the genomes of T. ni and other noctuid mothsas well as tephritid flies. It has also been widely used as a genetic tool for transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis in a broad range of organisms. MAR1 has previously been described in the silkworm Bombyx mori (as MAR1_BM) and the large blue Maculinea arion (as Macmar1). We experimentally confirmed the presence of MAR1 copies in the genome of T. ni by inverse PCR and by sequencing several copies from uninfected insects (see Methods).

### Horizontal transfer and evolution of transposable elements in vertebrates [^eebeb76d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Horizontal transfer of transposable elements (HTT) is an important process shaping eukaryote genomes, yet very few studies have quantified this phenomenon on a large scale or have evaluated the selective constraints acting on transposable elements (TEs) during vertical and horizontal transmission. Here we screen 307 vertebrate genomes and infer a minimum of 975 independent HTT events between lineages that diverged more than 120 million years ago. HTT distribution greatly differs from null expectations, with 93.7% of these transfers involving ray-finned fishes and less than 3% involving mammals and birds. HTT incurs purifying selection (conserved protein evolution) on all TEs, confirming that producing functional transposition proteins is required for a TE to invade new genomes. In the absence of HTT, DNA transposons appear to evolve neutrally within genomes, unlike most retrotransposons, which evolve under purifying selection. This selection regime indicates that proteins of most retrotransposon families tend to process their own encoding RNA (cis-preference), which helps retrotransposons to persist within host lineages over long time periods.

### Population genomics supports baculoviruses as vectors of horizontal transfer of insect transposons [^22714a2e]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Horizontal transfer (HT) of genetic material is the transmission of DNA between organisms by means other than parent-to-offspring inheritance. HT is pivotal to the biology and evolution of prokaryotes and is increasingly recognized as an important factor in the evolution of eukaryotes. Contrasting with our detailed understanding of prokaryote-to-prokaryote HT, the mechanisms and vectors underlying eukaryote-to-eukaryote HT are poorly known. Multiple events of gene HT have been characterized between eukaryotes, yet the majority of eukaryote-to-eukaryote HTs uncovered so far involve transposable elements (TEs). TEs are pieces of DNA capable of excising or copying themselves from a genomic locus, and also capable of integrating into another locus. They are the single most abundant component of most eukaryotic genomes and have a profound impact on genome evolution.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how TEs can be shuttled between eukaryotic organisms. For example, the findings of almost identical TEs in blood-sucking parasites and their vertebrate hosts suggest that host–parasite relationships can facilitate TE HTs. In addition, viruses have been proposed as candidate vectors allowing DNA from one organism to be transferred to the germ line of another organism. In vitro transposition of TED and IFP2 TEs from insect cells to virus was first reported in the 1980s (refs). Later, in vivo transposition of Tc1-like TEs was shown to occur from insect larvae to virus. These early studies demonstrated that viruses can receive a genetic load from eukaryotes and highlighted the potential of viruses in mediating TE HT between host organisms. In the past few years, the identification of a few TEs embedded in viral genomesor in sequences packaged in viral particles of polydnaviruseshas sparked a renewed interest in the old hypothesis that viruses may act as vectors of TE HT. However, in these studies, either the donor species from which the TE likely originated was identified but the TE was not found in any putative receiving organism, or the potential receiving organisms were identified but no evidence was provided showing that the TE is present in the putative donor genome. To date, no single example has been reported of a TE for which additive evidence exists that it is able to naturally (that is, in vivo) transpose in a viral genome, and that it has experienced HT in the field between potential donor and receiving organisms naturally interacting with the virus in an ecologically relevant setting.

### Retargeting mobile group II introns to repair mutant genes [^1b445c07]. Molecular Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Retroposable elements such as retroviral and lentiviral vectors have been employed for many gene therapy applications. Unfortunately, such gene transfer vectors integrate genes into many different DNA sequences and unintended integration of the vector near a growth-promoting gene can engender pathological consequences. For example, retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer induced leukemia in 2 of 11 children treated for severe combined immunodeficiency, raising significant safety issues for gene transfer strategies that cannot be targeted to specific sequences. Here, we examine the use of a mobile retroposable genetic element that can be targeted to introduce therapeutic sequences site specifically into mutant genes. The data demonstrate that the mobile group II intron from Lactococcus lactis can be targeted to insert into and repair mutant lacZ (approved gene symbol GLB1) and beta-globin (approved gene symbol HBB) genes with high efficiency and fidelity in model systems in bacteria. These results suggest that these mobile genetic elements represent a novel class of agents for performing targeted genetic repair.

In this study, we have presented a comprehensive analysis to explore the long-range chromatin interactions between clusters of cancer-causing retroviral insertions in the mouse genome. We found a significant co-localization of ICs that is markedly more pronounced for regions with insertions across multiple independent tumours. This is an indication that 3D hotspots of recurrent mutations are under selective pressure. To identify such hotspots, we defined CLICs, that is, pairs of loci with insertions that engage in frequent chromatin interactions. We found that insertions in CLICs are mutually exclusive, which is indicative of a shared target gene. Moreover, we observe an increased effect on gene expression by taking into account linearly distal yet spatially co-located insertions, supporting the hypothesis that insertions can act on targets by long-range chromatin interactions. About half of the CLICs are associated with known cancer genes, and are enriched for regulatory elements.

Combined, our analyses suggest that long-range interactions, which arise as a result of the 3D organization of the genome, play an important role in determining the genes that are targeted by insertions. This is in line with a recent comprehensive survey of 3D contacts across different developmental contexts, which show that in many cases the long-range spatial contacts between promoters and enhancers are stable across cell types including in cellular contexts where the promoter is not active (unproductive or poised contacts). Therefore, introduction of strong transcription-promoting elements, encoded in the LTRs of a virus, by IM might transform unproductive (poised) 3D connections into productive ones, leading to activation of the target promoter. The traditional definition of a CIS and the subsequent search for the most likely target gene in its genomic vicinity, may therefore lack power to identify true cancer genes. We found, for instance that 126 (~30%) of the previously identified CIS loci are co-localized with known cancer genes by long-range chromatin interaction (Supplementary Table 2). These known cancer genes might be more likely target genes than the originally reported genes in the direct genomic neighbourhood of the insertions. While we show that an integrative analysis of insertional mutations with Hi-C data from a different source yields valuable results, such results do not unequivocally establish a relation between mutations and their targets in the same cells. Ultimately, it is, therefore, desirable to establish target genes based on the chromatin conformation capture data that was derived from the same source as the mutations. If those data become available, our approach provides the necessary framework to integrate these data.

### A helitron transposon reconstructed from bats reveals a novel mechanism of genome shuffling in eukaryotes [^8eca962b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Due to their numbers and mobility, transposable elements are important players in genome evolution. Transposable elements can amplify to high copy numbers despite control by silencing mechanisms. However, accumulation of disabling mutations in their sequences leads to transpositional inactivation and subsequent extinction. Thus, ancient transposable elements can often be discovered and annotated only by bioinformatic means. Helitrons, a novel group of DNA transposons widespread throughout eukaryotes, were discovered by in silico genome-sequence analysis (reviewed in refs).

Helitron transposition displays a number of features unusual for DNA transposons, such as lack of target site duplications (reviewed in refs). Furthermore, putative Helitron transposases do not contain an RNase-H-like catalytic domain, but encode a 'RepHel' motif made up by a replication initiator (Rep) and a DNA helicase (Hel) domain. Rep is a nuclease domain of the HUH superfamily of nucleases involved in catalytic reactions for endonucleolytic cleavage, DNA transfer and ligation. HUH nucleases cleave exclusively single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and have a key role in the initiation of 'rolling-circle replication' of certain bacteriophages such as φX174 (ref.), ssDNA viruses and bacterial plasmids (reviewed in ref.), as well as in 'rolling-circle' transposition of IS 91 family bacterial transposons.

The key elements of the proposed rolling-circle transposition mechanisminvolve two tyrosine (Tyr) residues in the active site of IS 91 's HUH transposase. Briefly, the model proposes a site-specific nick at the 5′-end of the transposon, with the transposase forming a 5′-phosphotyrosine intermediate. The 3′-OH at the nick serves to initiate DNA synthesis while one transposon DNA strand peels off. The nick generated in the target DNA possibly by the second active site Tyr leads to the resolution of the 5′-phosphotyrosine. Once the entire transposon has been replicated, the transposase catalyses a second strand-transfer event by nicking the 3′-end of the transposon and joining it to the 5′-end of the target site. It has been suggested that Helitrons are the first eukaryotic rolling-circle transposons, although definite information involving their transposition mechanism remains elusive due to the lack of an active element isolated from any species.

### Limits of sequence and functional conservation [^46456df4]. Nature Genetics (2010). Medium credibility.

Sequence conservation of noncoding DNA across species can indicate functional conservation. However, a new study demonstrates notable differences between human and mouse stem cell regulatory networks, suggesting caution in generalizing from sequence to functional conservation.

### Insertional transformation of hematopoietic cells by self-inactivating lentiviral and gammaretroviral vectors [^f85ea495]. Molecular Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Gene transfer vectors may cause clonal imbalance and even malignant cell transformation by insertional upregulation of proto-oncogenes. Lentiviral vectors (LV) with their preferred integration in transcribed genes are considered less genotoxic than gammaretroviral vectors (GV) with their preference for integration next to transcriptional start sites and regulatory gene regions. Using a sensitive cell culture assay and a series of self-inactivating (SIN) vectors, we found that the lentiviral insertion pattern was approximately threefold less likely than the gammaretroviral to trigger transformation of primary hematopoietic cells. However, lentivirally induced mutants also showed robust replating, in line with the selection for common insertion sites (CIS) in the first intron of the Evi1 proto-oncogene. This potent proto-oncogene thus represents a CIS for both GV and LV, despite major differences in their integration mechanisms. Altering the vectors' enhancer-promoter elements had a greater effect on safety than the retroviral insertion pattern. Clinical grade LV expressing the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) protein under control of its own promoter had no transforming potential. Mechanistic studies support the conclusion that enhancer-mediated gene activation is the major cause for insertional transformation of hematopoietic cells, opening rational strategies for risk prevention.

### A novel target-specific gene delivery system combining baculovirus and sequence-specific long interspersed nuclear elements [^359be438]. Virus Research (2007). Low credibility.

Transposable elements are valuable for somatic and germ-line transformation. However, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) have not been used because of poor information on the transposition mechanism. We have developed a novel gene delivery system combining baculovirus AcNPV and two silkworm LINEs, SART1 and R1, which integrate into specific sequences of telomeric repeats and 28S ribosomal DNA, respectively. When two LINEs containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene recombined into AcNPV were infected into fifth instar larvae of the silkworm, we observed target-specific retrotransposition of LINEs at 72h post-infection, using polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing. Telomere- and 28S rDNA-specific transposition occurred in all nine tissues tested, including the ovary and testis. This is the first demonstration of site-specific gene delivery in living larvae. Insertion efficiencies were dependent on the virus titer for injection and the host strains of Bombyx mori. Using this system, we successfully detected the intergeneration transmission of retrotransposed sequences. In addition, AcNPV-mediated SART1 also transposed into telomere of another lepidopteran, Orgyia recens, suggesting that this system is useful for a wide variety of AcNPV-infectious insects. Site-specific gene delivery by virus-mediated LINE will be a potential gene therapy tool to avoid harmful unexpected insertions.

### Completed genomic sequence ofHER1410 reveals a-containing chromosome, two megaplasmids, and an integrative plasmidial prophage [^06579e38]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous tailed bacteriophages preying Bacillus cereus sensu lato have been previously identified and, among them, a recently accepted genus of the Tectiviridae family, Betatectivirus was established. The recently renewed interest in the study of tectiviruses stems from the narrow host specificity of some members for dangerous human pathogens, their complex diversity and variability patterns, and a possible phylogenetic relationship with some groups of eukaryotic viruses and mobile elements. In the study of betatectiviruses, B. thuringiensis GBJ002, HER1410, and B. cereus HER1047 strains have been used as hosts for tectiviral infections. These three strains represent different serotypes and have been especially useful to study tectiviruses features such as virus entry and host cell physiology. However, despite their importance to this field of research, none of them have been sequenced to date. In particular, Bacillus thuringiensis HER1410 is extensively used as a host of Bam35, the model species of Betatectivirus, for the molecular and structural studies on this virus. Further, HER1410 has shown high sensitivity to different Bacillus phages families. This has allowed the identification of several novel tectiviruses. Also, this strain can be infected by other tectiviruses and myoviruses (A. Gillis et al. unpublished data). HER1410 mutants resistant to GIL01cp 25, a lytic variant of tectivirus GIL01, are susceptible to myovirus VP4 showing, in this case, the specificity of bacterial resistance. Besides, HER1410 has been also included in B. cereus group studies on hemolytic activity and temperature dependent growth rates.

This study aims to characterize Bacillus thuringiensis HER1410, known as a sensitive host of a large variety of Bacillus phages and a reference strain to study tectiviruses. A combination of short and long-read sequencing methods was applied, known to allow the full resolution of bacterial genomes and delineation of plasmids. We successfully resolved the chromosome and identified and characterized three extrachromosomal elements comprising the HER1410 genome and present a detailed overview of these components, focusing on the key elements in B. cereus group such as the description of MGEs, virulence factors and phylogeny.

### Detection and annotation of unique regions in mammalian genomes [^146e6825]. G3 (2025). Medium credibility.

The sliding window analysis is highly sensitive to window length, where an increase leads to a decrease in yield (Fig. 6a). This corresponds to our intuition that a long region is less likely to escape transposon insertions over long periods of time than a short region. With decreasing yield, the proportion of intersecting promoters also decreases from more than half to 0 (Fig. 6b). Similarly, the proportion of enriched biological processes declines from over 30% to 0 with increasing window length (Fig. 6c).

For each of the 9 mammalian orders we investigated, the 2 genomes sampled closely tracked each other's graph of the average enrichment ratio as a function of window length (Fig. 7). Given that the longest URs contain loci like the Hox clusters, that is, a large number of genes of 1 narrow functional category, we expected a steady increase in enrichment ratio as a function of window length. However, across the orders, the trajectories varied between plateauing in most orders, and steadily increasing in primates and shrews (Eulipotyphla).

Still, the classical observation that URs are enriched for developmental genes is true for all 18 taxa investigated (Figs 8 and 9). Now, URs are not the only sequence property associated with function, CpG islands are a classical sequence feature associated with transcription initiation in vertebrates. It was previously found that in the human and mouse, and 88% of URs at least 10 kb long intersect a CpG island. This large overlap between the 2 features might suggest that URs are essentially CpG islands. However, the specific enrichment for developmental genes observed in URs is only true for CpG islands longer than 2 kb. The overlap between URs and long CpG islands is much smaller than between URs and CpG islands in general. In the human, 35% of URs intersect CpG islands of 2 kb or more; in the mouse, this fraction is down to 19%.

### Paleovirology of bornaviruses: what can be learned from molecular fossils of bornaviruses [^c2e24186]. Virus Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) are virus-derived sequences embedded in eukaryotic genomes formed by germline integration of viral sequences. As many EVEs were integrated into eukaryotic genomes millions of years ago, EVEs are considered molecular fossils of viruses. EVEs can be valuable informational sources about ancient viruses, including their time scale, geographical distribution, genetic information, and hosts. Although integration of viral sequences is not required for replications of viruses other than retroviruses, many non-retroviral EVEs have been reported to exist in eukaryotes. Investigation of these EVEs has expanded our knowledge regarding virus-host interactions, as well as provided information on ancient viruses. Among them, EVEs derived from bornaviruses, non-retroviral RNA viruses, have been relatively well studied. Bornavirus-derived EVEs are widely distributed in animal genomes, including the human genome, and the history of bornaviruses can be dated back to more than 65 million years. Although there are several reports focusing on the biological significance of bornavirus-derived sequences in mammals, paleovirology of bornaviruses has not yet been well described and summarized. In this paper, we describe what can be learned about bornaviruses from endogenous bornavirus-like elements from the view of paleovirology using published results and our novel data.

### Efficient nuclease-directed integration of lentivirus vectors into the human ribosomal DNA locus [^5153ceb9]. Molecular Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Lentivirus vectors (LVs) are efficient tools for gene transfer, but the non-specific nature of transgene integration by the viral integration machinery carries an inherent risk for genotoxicity. We modified the integration machinery of LVs and harnessed the cellular DNA double-strand break repair machinery to integrate transgenes into ribosomal DNA, a promising genomic safe-harbor site for transgenes. LVs carrying modified I-PpoI-derived homing endonuclease proteins were characterized in detail, and we found that at least 21% of all integration sites localized to ribosomal DNA when LV transduction was coupled to target DNA cleavage. In addition to the primary sequence recognized by the endonuclease, integration was also enriched in chromatin domains topologically associated with nucleoli, which contain the targeted ribosome RNA genes. Targeting of this highly repetitive region for integration was not associated with detectable DNA deletions or negative impacts on cell health in transduced primary human T cells. The modified LVs characterized here have an overall lower risk for insertional mutagenesis than regular LVs and can thus improve the safety of gene and cellular therapy.

### DNA-guided transcription factor interactions extend human gene regulatory code [^92d5150d]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Several groups have reported that clusters of low-affinity motifs are important in development and plasticity. This illustrates the fact that biological optimality and biochemical optimality are not the same thing; during development, it is necessary to carefully calibrate the response of particular regulatory elements to changes in TF activities, and it is therefore not always beneficial to use the most biochemically active sequence. However, given that most composite motifs contain low-affinity sites for one or both members of the TF pair, and that developmental enhancers are commonly conserved outside of known individual TF motifs, care should be taken to establish that the flanking sequences of any biologically active low-affinity motifs do not contain elements that enable high-affinity cooperative binding of TF–TF pairs. The advantage of using composite motifs instead of individual low-affinity motifs in developmental control of gene expression is fourfold: (1) combining two TFs enables integration of positional information; (2) low affinity of individual TFs to the composite motifs allows dual TF functionality: a TF can act as a partner, and also independently on its own motifs to affect other housekeeping or developmental functions; (3) because high-affinity composite motifs can be occupied at a lower TF concentration than individual low-affinity motifs, using composite motifs allows increased specificity of gene expression; and (4) the change in specificity associated with composite motif formation greatly increases the cooperativity coefficient of binding of the two TFs to the composite site, which enables genes to respond very sharply to changes in TF concentration (Fig. 5e). Consistently with these biochemical advantages, we find here that composite motifs are present in highly conserved developmental enhancers. Notably, we found that specific composite motifs were formed between marker TFs of almost all cell types formed during perhaps the best-studied dorsoventral patterning event in development — the specification of neuronal cell types in the spinal cord. The utility of composite motifs in development is directly related to their biochemical cooperativity; this allows the gene regulatory activity of the composite motif to be more than the sum of the activities of the individual TFs. It also enables more specific gene expression, more exact cell-fate determination across a developmental field and the formation of sharper developmental boundaries. However, because the composite motifs and specific spacings and orientations of TF pairs have a higher information content than individual motifs, their use is likely to be more common in elements that require highly optimized and/or specific activities (for example, signal integration during development).

### Adeno-associated virus integration: virus versus vector [^04b30356]. Gene Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Although a large percentage of the world population is seropositive for exposure to various strains of adeno-associated virus (AAV), a human parvovirus, AAV has never been identified as an etiologic agent of human disease. Most likely contributing to the pronounced lack of pathogenicity is the fact that AAV is a naturally defective virus that requires a helper virus for productive replication of its genome. Another unusual aspect of wild-type AAV biology is the ability of the virus to establish latent infection by preferential integration of its genome into a specific locus of human chromosome 19. Site-specific integration was a major impetus for the development of recombinant AAV vectors, which typically lack all AAV coding sequences. It was soon realized, however, that expression of at least one species of the virally encoded initiator proteins, Rep78 or Rep68, is necessary for targeted integration of AAV-derived DNA constructs to occur. This article will present a chronological outline of studies characterizing site-specific integration of wild-type AAV sequences and the quasi-random target site selection observed with recombinant AAV vectors.

### Human artificial chromosomes for gene delivery and the development of animal models [^6ebc16fa]. Molecular Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Random integration of conventional gene delivery vectors such as viruses, plasmids, P1 phage-derived artificial chromosomes, bacterial artificial chromosomes and yeast artificial chromosomes can be associated with transgene silencing. Furthermore, integrated viral sequences can activate oncogenes adjacent to the insertion site resulting in cancer. Various human artificial chromosomes (HACs) exhibit several potential characteristics desired for an ideal gene delivery vector, including stable episomal maintenance and the capacity to carry large genomic loci with their regulatory elements, thus allowing the physiological regulation of the introduced gene in a manner similar to that of native chromosomes. HACs have been generated mainly using either a "top-down approach" (engineered chromosomes), or a "bottom-up approach" (de novo artificial chromosomes). The recent emergence of stem cell-based tissue engineering has opened up new avenues for gene and cell therapies. This review describes the lessons learned and prospects identified mainly from studies in the construction of HACs and HAC-mediated gene expression systems in cultured cells, as well as in animals.

### Etranacogene dezaparvovec (Hemgenix) [^e49b8945]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

Nonclinical studies were initiated with a predecessor of HEMGENIX product, rAAV5 expressing the wild type human coagulation factor IX (rAAV5-hFIX). HEMGENIX was developed by introducing a 2-nucleotide change in the transgene for hFIX, generating the naturally occurring Padua variant of Factor IX (rAAV5-hFIX-Padua).

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

No traditional nonclinical carcinogenicity or mutagenicity studies were conducted with HEMGENIX; such studies were not indicated. No adverse effects were observed in mating rates and fertility indices in healthy naïve female mice following mating with males that were administered the predecessor of HEMGENIX [see Use in specific populations (8.3)]. To evaluate vector integration, host genomic DNA was isolated from liver tissue obtained from healthy mice and NHPs following intravenous administration of the predecessor of HEMGENIX. For both species, the identified rAAV5-hFIX vector DNA sequences represented episomal forms that were not integrated into the host DNA. A low level of integrated rAAV5-hFIX DNA was distributed throughout the host genome with no predilection to specific integration sites, including in genes associated with malignant transformation in humans.

### Unistrand piRNA clusters are an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to suppress endogenous retroviruses across the drosophila genus [^cfcd184f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway prevents endogenous genomic parasites, i.e. transposable elements, from damaging the genetic material of animal gonadal cells. Specific regions in the genome, called piRNA clusters, are thought to define each species' piRNA repertoire and therefore its capacity to recognize and silence specific transposon families. The unistrand cluster flamenco (flam) is essential in the somatic compartment of the Drosophila ovary to restrict Gypsy-family transposons from infecting the neighbouring germ cells. Disruption of flam results in transposon de-repression and sterility, yet it remains unknown whether this silencing mechanism is present more widely. Here, we systematically characterise 119 Drosophila species and identify five additional flam-like clusters separated by up to 45 million years of evolution. Small RNA-sequencing validated these as bona-fide unistrand piRNA clusters expressed in somatic cells of the ovary, where they selectively target transposons of the Gypsy family. Together, our study provides compelling evidence of a widely conserved transposon silencing mechanism that co-evolved with virus-like Gypsy-family transposons.

### Comparative genomics sheds light on mammalian and avian gene regulation and phenotypic evolution [^0f4fcf53]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, this work provides a first approach to the identification of molecular changes underlying the evolution of morphological innovations in mammalian and avian basal lineages. Many of the elements identified here are likely to be critical for the evolution of specific traits in the two lineages under study. The association to a regulatory function was performed through different approaches, and we provide evidence that the elements may have contributed to functional changes through their function as transcriptional enhancers. We identified clusters of elements associated with typical mammalian and avian characteristics, where those regions associated with the nervous system predominated. Our work, together with other work describing acceleration processes in other branches of the vertebrate phylogenetic tree, brings us closer to unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of unique aspects of species biology.

### Novel PRD-like homeodomain transcription factors and retrotransposon elements in early human development [^39c478e1]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Statistical test for correlation analysis

For clustering of samples with correlation coefficient matrix (Fig. 1b, c)), (i) zero-read expressions in the normalized expression profile were masked, (ii) Spearman correlation coefficients for all pairs of the (partly masked) normalized expression values were calculated and (iii) the coefficient matrix was clustered by complete linkage and Euclidean distance. For clustering of TFEs, or of chromosome arms, with the normalized expression profile, zero-read expressions were not masked.

Promoter sequence analysis

We applied MEME(package version 4.9.0) for motif analysis within the active promoters. The promoters in our analysis are strand-specific sequences from 2,000-bp upstream to 500-bp downstream of the peak position within the clustered TFEs, and we assume that each promoter sequence may contain at most one occurrence of each motif. The significant motifs (E value < 1.0 × 10 −200 by MEME; red dots in Fig. 3a, b) were aligned to the promoters again by MAST(in the MEME package) to reveal actual motif distributions (P value < 1.0 × 10 −10; shown as white dots in Fig. 3a, c). The location of Alu elements within the promoters was based on Repeating Elements track by RepeatMasker in UCSC Genome Browser. The motifs were also compared with known motifsby TomTom.

### Endogenous pararetrovirus sequences are widely present in citrinae genomes [^fcf7dbfd]. Virus Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Endogenous pararetroviruses (EPRVs) are characterized in several plant genomes and their biological effects have been reported. In this study, hundreds of EPRV segments were identified in six Citrinae genomes. A total of 1034 EPRV segments were identified in the genomes of sweet orange, 2036 in pummelo, 598 in clementine mandarin, 752 in Ichang papeda, 2060 in citron and 245 in atalantia. Genomic analysis indicated that EPRV segments tend to cluster as hot spots in the genomes, particularly on chromosome 2 and 5. Large numbers of simple repeats and transposable elements were identified in the 2-kb flanking regions of the EPRV segments. Comparative genomic analysis and PCR experiments showed that there are highly conserved EPRV segments and species-specific EPRV segments between the Citrinae genomes. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the integration events of EPRVs could initiate in a common progenitor of Citrinae species and repeatedly occur during the Citrinae divergence.

### The abundant polyadenylated transcript 2 DNA sequence of the pathogenic protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica represents a nonautonomous non-long-terminal-repeat retrotransposon-like element which is absent in the closely related nonpathogenic species entamoeba dispar [^a3e14268]. Infection and Immunity (2002). Low credibility.

While comparing gene expression in the pathogenic organism Entamoeba histolytica and the closely related but nonpathogenic species Entamoeba dispar, we discovered that the E. histolytica abundant polyadenylated transcript 2 (ehapt2) and corresponding genomic copies are absent in E. dispar. Although polyadenylated, ehapt2 does not contain any overt open reading frame. Southern blot and sequence analyses revealed that about 500 copies of ehapt2 genomic elements were present in each cell and that the copies were distributed throughout the ameba genome. The various ehapt2 elements are regularly located in the vicinity of protein-encoding genes, downstream of pyrimidine-rich sequence stretches (40 to 125 bp; CT content, 79.2 to 85.5%), and are flanked by duplicated target sites of variable length. Target site duplications were obviously generated during integration of ehapt2 into the E. histolytica genome as one copy of the flanking repeat and the complete ehapt2 element are specifically absent in orthologous E. dispar genomic sequences. ehapt2 shares 3' sequences with EhRLE, a recently identified non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon-like element of E. histolytica, which contains a conceptual open reading frame for reverse transcriptase. Thus, ehapt2 has all of the properties of nonautonomous non-LTR retrotransposons. A comparison of various E. histolytica isolates suggested that transposition of ehapt2 takes place at a very low frequency as the genomic localization of ehapt2 elements was found to be well conserved. A mobile element such as ehapt2 could be a suitable mechanism to explain the infrequent and late transition of E. histolytica from a harmless gut commensal to an invasive pathogen.

### Cryptic inoviruses revealed as pervasive in bacteria and archaea across earth's biomes [^89a673bd]. Nature Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Clustering of inovirus genomes in putative species

Next, we sought to cluster these putative inovirus genomes along with the previously collected reference genomes to remove duplicated sequences and to select only one representative per species. This clustering was conducted according to the latest guidelines submitted to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for Inoviridae, that is, "95% DNA sequence identity as the criterion for demarcation of species", and included our 10,295 sequences alongside the 56 reference genomes. Notably, however, predictions spanning multiple tandemly integrated inovirus prophages had to be processed separately, otherwise they could lead to clusters gathering multiple species. To detect these cases of tandem insertions, we searched for and clustered separately all predictions with multiple pI proteins, as this gene is expected to be present in single copy in inoviruses (n = 800 sequences).

All non-tandem sequences were first clustered incrementally with priority given to complete genomes over partial genomes as well as fragments identified in microbial genomes over fragments from metagenomes. First, circular contigs and prophages with canonical att sites identified in a microbial genome were clustered, and all other fragments were affiliated to these seed sequences. Next, unaffiliated fragments detected in microbial genomes and with non-canonical att sites (that is, simple direct repeat) were clustered together, and other fragments were affiliated to this second set of seed sequences. Finally, the remaining unaffiliated sequences detected in microbial genomes were clustered together. This allowed us to use the more 'certain' predictions (that is, circular sequences and prophages with identified att sites) preferentially as seeds of putative species.

A similar approach was used to cluster sequences identified from metagenomes, as well as to separately cluster putative tandem fragments, that is, those including multiple pI proteins. All the clustering and affiliation was done with a threshold of 95% ANI on 100% of alignment fraction (according to the ICTV guidelines), with sequence similarity computed using mummer. Accumulation curves were calculated for 100 random ordering of input sequences using a custom perl script and plotted with ggplot2 (refs.).

### Endangered species hold clues to human evolution [^a3a6691a]. The Journal of Heredity (2010). Low credibility.

We report that 18 conserved, and by extension functional, elements in the human genome are the result of retroposon insertions that are evolving under purifying selection in mammals. We show evidence that 1 of the 18 elements regulates the expression of ASXL3 during development by encoding an alternatively spliced exon that causes nonsense-mediated decay of the transcript. The retroposon that gave rise to these functional elements was quickly inactivated in the mammalian ancestor, and all traces of it have been lost due to neutral decay. However, the tuatara has maintained a near-ancestral version of this retroposon in its extant genome, which allows us to connect the 18 human elements to the evolutionary events that created them. We propose that conservation efforts over more than 100 years may not have only prevented the tuatara from going extinct but could have preserved our ability to understand the evolutionary history of functional elements in the human genome. Through simulations, we argue that species with historically low population sizes are more likely to harbor ancient mobile elements for long periods of time and in near-ancestral states, making these species indispensable in understanding the evolutionary origin of functional elements in the human genome.

### Position-dependent function of human sequence-specific transcription factors [^3fd6d497]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Each cell of an organism interprets the same genome in a unique way. At the heart of this process are sequence-specific TFs that orchestrate regulatory programs and interpret the regulatory sequence grammar inscribed in the genome –. How these regulatory programs are encoded is still largely enigmatic. Many regulatory elements contain sequence motifs for similar sets of TFs and most TFs display widespread binding to regulatory sequences, with variable and sometimes minimal consequences for gene regulation –. Consequently, we are largely unable to predict gene expression patterns from DNA sequence alone, and it is unclear how the transcription of most human genes is regulated. Previous studies have shown that TF-binding-site spacing, orientation and copy number, and affinity of TF binding sites can influence transcriptional output. However, few generalizable rules exist for how TF binding sites construct gene regulatory programs, restricting our ability to rationally interpret our genome or understand how mutations in regulatory sequences impact gene regulation or manifest in disease.

In silico NGS pipeline validation — limitations of read-level variant insertion approaches are outlined, noting that reliance on correctly mapped reads means it will not model aligner errors in difficult-to-map regions, poison motif–induced errors are not modeled, larger variants are challenging to model perfectly, and certain raw data types cannot be easily manipulated by current tools to introduce variants.

### Self-synthesizing transposons: unexpected key players in the evolution of viruses and defense systems [^30a8c292]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Self-synthesizing transposons are the largest known transposable elements that encode their own DNA polymerases (DNAP). The Polinton/Maverick family of self-synthesizing transposons is widespread in eukaryotes and abundant in the genomes of some protists. In addition to the DNAP and a retrovirus-like integrase, most of the polintons encode homologs of the major and minor jelly-roll capsid proteins, DNA-packaging ATPase and capsid maturation protease. Therefore, polintons are predicted to alternate between the transposon and viral lifestyles although virion formation remains to be demonstrated. Polintons are related to a group of eukaryotic viruses known as virophages that parasitize on giant viruses of the family Mimiviridae and another recently identified putative family of polinton-like viruses (PLV) predicted to lead a similar, dual life style. Comparative genomic analysis of polintons, virophages, PLV and the other viruses with double-stranded (ds)DNA genomes infecting eukaryotes and prokaryotes suggests that the polintons evolved from bacterial tectiviruses and could have been the ancestors of a broad range of eukaryotic viruses including adenoviruses and members of the proposed order 'Megavirales' as well as linear cytoplasmic plasmids. Recently, a group of predicted self-synthesizing transposons was discovered also in prokaryotes. These elements, denoted casposons, encode a DNAP and a homolog of the CRISPR-associated Cas1 endonuclease that has an integrase activity but no capsid proteins. Thus, unlike polintons, casposons appear to be limited to the transposon life style although they could have evolved from viruses. The casposons are thought to have played a pivotal role in the origin of the prokaryotic adaptive immunity, giving rise to the adaptation module of the CRISPR-Cas systems.

### Chromatin profiling identifies putative dual roles for H3K27me3 in regulating cell type-specific genes and transposable elements in choanoflagellates [^e5075727]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The ability to stably repress genes in a cell type-specific manner is a crucial component of animal developmental gene regulation. This is achieved partly by the Polycomb-repressive system. Here, we present evidence for a putative dual role for PRC2 and its modification H3K27me3 in the regulation of transposable elements and cell type-specific genes in S. rosetta.

Recent work has highlighted the previously underappreciated role of PRC2 in regulating transposable elements across diverse eukaryotes leading to a hypothesis that this role may have descended from the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Our data suggest this function was retained in S. rosetta for silencing retrotransposons (Fig. 5). Yet, we also show that H3K27me3 is largely absent on DNA transposons. In the case of some DNA transposons, we see both ATAC-seq signal and active hPTMs present along with RNA-seq reads, potentially indicating they are active. It is possible that H3K9me3 may silence these TEs in S. rosetta as in diverse eukaryotes, but we were unable to profile H3K9me3 in S. rosetta. Commercial antibodies for H3K9me3 failed in our hands–perhaps due to a difference of the histone H3 of S. rosetta in which the tenth position is a threonine rather than the serine that is present in the vast majority of species. This experimental hurdle and the importance of H3K9me3 for TE silencing in diverse eukaryotes compels future characterization of histone modifications in S. rosetta. We do find enrichment for H3K27me3 in the sub-telomeric regions on the few contigs where telomeres are annotated, but in these cases, we do not see any transposable elements in these regions. Unfortunately, most super-contigs in the current genome sequence do not extend all the way to the telomere yet those telomeres do share a common sub-telomeric sequence. It may therefore be that they have an accumulation of transposable elements. Future improvements in the genome assembly will reveal if all chromosomes have sub-telomeric H3K27me3, as is the case in other species like Cryptococcus neoformans, and its possible functions.

### A segmental genomic duplication generates a functional intron [^eb36aa9a]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

An intron is an extended genomic feature whose function requires multiple constrained positions-donor and acceptor splice sites, a branch point, a polypyrimidine tract and suitable splicing enhancers-that may be distributed over hundreds or thousands of nucleotides. New introns are therefore unlikely to emerge by incremental accumulation of functional sub-elements. Here we demonstrate that a functional intron can be created de novo in a single step by a segmental genomic duplication. This experiment recapitulates in vivo the birth of an intron that arose in the ancestral jawed vertebrate lineage nearly half-a-billion years ago.
