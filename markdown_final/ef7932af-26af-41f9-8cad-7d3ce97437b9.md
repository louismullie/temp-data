## Question

Treatment of spinal stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and baseline assessment. Then, I should stratify symptom severity and set goals. Next, I will initiate non-surgical first-line care, followed by escalation to interventional options if needed. After that, I need to evaluate indications and timing for surgery, select surgical approaches based on anatomy and instability, and address postoperative rehabilitation. Finally, I should review long-term outcomes, special populations, and the role of shared decision-making and follow-up monitoring, making sure to double-check any areas where the evidence is limited or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline severity, because I need to ensure we are dealing with true neurogenic claudication rather than vascular claudication or radiculopathy. Typical features include buttock or leg pain worse with standing/walking and relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion, with confirmatory MRI reserved for procedural planning or if surgery is contemplated, given the high prevalence of asymptomatic stenosis on imaging in older adults [^115sLCjW] [^115vPstn]. I should double-check functional baselines using validated measures such as the Oswestry Disability Index, Roland-Morris, and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire to track response over time and guide escalation decisions [^116bUen6] [^111Pw1tF] [^112VJcum].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until I classify severity and set realistic goals. I will stratify as mild, moderate, or severe based on pain intensity, walking tolerance, disability, and neurogenic claudication impact, while also considering the natural history: roughly one-third improve, half remain stable, and 10–20% worsen over 1–3 years without surgery, which helps frame expectations and the threshold for operative referral [^115vPstn]. Let me verify that we align goals with the patient: reduce pain, improve walking distance, enhance function, and avoid or delay surgery when feasible [^115sLCjW].

> Next, I should review first-line non-surgical care and be honest about the evidence gaps. Education, activity modification toward flexion-based activities, NSAIDs as first-line analgesics if tolerated, and structured exercise therapy are reasonable starting points, even though guideline bodies rate much of the non-surgical evidence as insufficient or low quality, especially for medications and passive modalities [^113aKgF7] [^115S6J2T] [^1147pdWY]. Wait, let me verify the exercise components most likely to help: supervision, lumbar flexion–biased movement, trunk stabilization, stretching, and cycling-based aerobic conditioning are repeatedly associated with better outcomes in component analyses, while balance training remains underrepresented and may warrant more attention [^111sfndi] [^114svWF5] [^111qWJP1].

> I should confirm duration and dosing for conservative therapy. A pragmatic approach is a 6–12 week structured program, with at least two supervised sessions per week when feasible, while reassessing function every 4–6 weeks to track response and adjust the plan, recognizing that some patients improve meaningfully with conservative care alone over time [^114oaAsd] [^115vPstn]. But wait, what if the patient is already quite disabled at baseline? In more severe cases, earlier surgical discussion may be appropriate if function fails to improve within 3 months of optimized non-surgical care [^116bUen6].

> If symptoms persist beyond an adequate trial, I will now examine interventional options. Epidural steroid injections can offer short-term relief and may serve as a bridge to rehabilitation or surgery, yet long-term benefits are unproven, so I should set expectations accordingly and avoid repeated injections without a durable plan [^115vPstn]. I need to check whether facet interventions are appropriate: medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation may help when facet arthropathy contributes to pain, and axial bracing can be considered when dynamic instability is suspected, ideally under a pain specialist's guidance [^112VJcum] [^1116TzMk]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said ESI is universally recommended; let me reconsider — evidence is mixed and guidelines vary, so shared decision-making and a time-limited trial is prudent [^115Tqihe].

> I will now examine surgical indications and timing. Indications include persistent, function-limiting neurogenic claudication despite a structured 3–6 month conservative program, progressive neurological deficits, or cauda equina syndrome, which requires urgent decompression [^115vPstn] [^115ASn3i]. Let me verify expected benefits: randomized and observational data, including SPORT, show that decompression yields faster and larger improvements in pain and function than non-surgical care at 6–24 months, with benefits persisting in many patients through 2–4 years, though effect sizes can be modest and not universal [^116bUen6] [^115vPstn]. Hold on, I should verify long-term durability; 5–10 year outcomes suggest sustained improvement in a majority, albeit with reoperation risks and residual symptoms in some cohorts [^114kJbop] [^112e2TXp].

> Let me think about surgical approach selection, because this is where nuance matters. For isolated stenosis without instability, standard decompressive laminectomy remains the reference procedure; adding fusion is not routinely indicated and may increase complications without clear functional benefit in many scenarios, particularly in the absence of documented instability or high-grade spondylolisthesis [^115vPstn]. I should double-check the randomized trials and meta-analyses: decompression alone performs at least as well as decompression plus fusion for most outcomes in degenerative spondylolisthesis, and interspinous spacers can be considered in carefully selected patients with mild-to-moderate stenosis, though reoperation rates are higher than with conventional decompression [^114Feoye] [^114Feoye]. Wait, I should confirm the latest MRI data: a recent RCT showed more new adjacent-level stenosis after fusion than after decompression alone at 2 years, reinforcing caution with routine fusion unless instability is present [^1154givQ].

> Next, I should review minimally invasive and device-based options. Indirect decompression with interspinous spacers can provide symptom relief in appropriately selected patients with preserved flexion and limited dynamic instability, but I need to counsel on higher reoperation risk and the need for strict selection criteria [^111EpKuS]. I need to ensure we follow MIST guidance: choose minimally invasive strategies based on anatomy, severity, prior failures, and comorbidity, and escalate thoughtfully if relief is incomplete or transient [^1135RqWc]. But wait, what if surgery is contraindicated or declined? Spinal cord stimulation may be considered in refractory cases after anatomically directed options are exhausted, acknowledging variable evidence and the need for careful patient selection [^115gzkvu].

> I should confirm the role and content of postoperative rehabilitation, because outcomes can hinge on it. Moderate-quality evidence supports structured, active rehabilitation over usual care, with meaningful improvements in function and pain at 6–12 months, so I will prescribe a supervised program emphasizing flexion-biased movement, core stabilization, and progressive walking or cycling, ideally initiated within a few weeks after surgery as tolerated [^111rP4dc]. Hold on, I should verify dosing; twice-weekly supervised sessions for 6–12 weeks with home reinforcement is reasonable, with earlier focus on activity resumption and graded exposure to provocative positions [^114oaAsd].

> Now, I will evaluate long-term outcomes and surveillance. At 2–4 years, many patients maintain clinically meaningful improvements after decompression, while a subset develops recurrent stenosis or adjacent segment disease, and about 13–20% undergo reoperation in large series, underscoring the need for ongoing activity and weight management to mitigate recurrence risk [^116bUen6] [^111Pw1tF]. Let me verify patient-reported outcomes at 8–10 years: roughly half to two-thirds report sustained pain relief and many would choose surgery again, though expectations should be tempered regarding residual symptoms and the possibility of future procedures [^114kJbop] [^116FUjDA].

> I need to ensure we address special populations and comorbidities. Older adults often tolerate decompression well, but complication risk rises with age and cardiopulmonary disease, so preoperative optimization and shared decision-making are essential. Obesity and diabetes increase wound complications and may influence approach selection and timing [^115sLCjW]. For patients with multilevel disease or suspected tandem stenosis, I should double-check for cervical or thoracic contributions when recovery is atypical, as unrecognized tandem stenosis can impair outcomes and alter surgical planning toward staged or simultaneous decompression strategies [^112MwJWn]. Let me reconsider medication choices in the elderly: NSAIDs may be contraindicated in some, so acetaminophen or cautious short-course opioids may be needed, with close monitoring and deprescribing plans [^1117wdfP].

> But wait, what about evidence-based practice patterns versus real-world utilization? Despite trials showing no clear long-term advantage of routine fusion, national data show rising fusion rates after 2016, highlighting the lag between evidence and practice and reinforcing the need to individualize decisions and resist inertia [^113yb3tQ] [^115vPstn]. I should double-check that my recommendations align with contemporary guidelines favoring decompression alone unless instability is present, and document the rationale if fusion is chosen to ensure transparency [^115vPstn].

> Finally, I should confirm that shared decision-making is embedded throughout. Patients should be counseled on the modest average benefit of surgery, the risks of complications and reoperation, and the reality that a meaningful minority improve with conservative care alone. This conversation should be revisited at each inflection point to align treatment with values and preferences [^116zFgjE]. Hold on, I should verify that our monitoring cadence is appropriate: reassess at 6–12 weeks after initiating or changing non-surgical therapy, at 3–6 months if contemplating surgery, and periodically after procedures to detect recurrence or new disease, adjusting the plan accordingly [^notfound].

Treatment of spinal stenosis should begin with **conservative management** (NSAIDs, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes) for mild-to-moderate symptoms [^113aKgF7] [^115S6J2T]. Epidural steroid injections can provide **short-term relief** but are not definitive [^115vPstn]. Surgery (decompression with or without fusion) is indicated for persistent, disabling symptoms or neurological deficits, with decompression alone sufficient for most patients and fusion reserved for instability or spondylolisthesis [^114cDxTV] [^113ndrGL]. Minimally invasive options (interspinous spacers, endoscopic decompression) may help selected patients, but evidence is limited and patient selection is key [^1135RqWc] [^111EpKuS]. Shared decision-making is essential to balance benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^116zFgjE].

---

## Non-surgical management

### Pharmacological interventions

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for pain and inflammation; monitor GI, renal, and cardiovascular risks [^113wCkBx].
- **Acetaminophen**: Alternative for mild pain or when NSAIDs are contraindicated.
- **Opioids**: Short-term use only for severe pain unresponsive to other therapies; monitor closely [^notfound].
- **Neuropathic agents**: Gabapentin or pregabalin for radicular pain; evidence is limited [^1148SNvW].

---

### Physical therapy and exercise

- **Flexion-based exercises**: Emphasize lumbar flexion, core strengthening, and aerobic conditioning (e.g. cycling) [^111qWJP1].
- **Supervised programs**: Preferably supervised or structured home programs for adherence and safety [^112SYSxJ].
- **Balance training**: Consider to reduce fall risk and improve function [^notfound].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **weight loss** to reduce mechanical load and symptoms, and **activity modification** with reduced prolonged standing/walking and use of assistive devices. Smoking cessation may improve healing and reduce complications if surgery is needed.

---

### Interventional procedures

Interventional options include **epidural steroid injections** for short-term relief in radicular symptoms, though long-term benefits are limited [^115vPstn], and **facet joint injections** for facet-mediated pain. Medial branch radiofrequency ablation is considered for persistent facetogenic pain.

---

## Surgical management

### Indications for surgery

Indications include **persistent symptoms** — neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy despite 3–6 months of conservative care — and **neurological deficits** such as progressive motor weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction, or cauda equina syndrome. Mechanical instability, including degenerative spondylolisthesis or significant motion on flexion-extension films, is also an indication [^114cDxTV].

---

### Surgical techniques

| **Technique** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Decompressive laminectomy | - Standard for most LSS <br/> - Central/lateral recess stenosis | - Effective symptom relief <br/> - Preserves motion | - Potential instability |
| Laminotomy | - Limited stenosis <br/> - Minimally invasive approach | - Less tissue disruption <br/> - Faster recovery | - Limited decompression |
| Foraminotomy | - Foraminal stenosis <br/> - Radiculopathy | - Targeted nerve root decompression | - Limited indication |
| Fusion (with decompression) | - Instability <br/> - Spondylolisthesis <br/> - Revision surgery | - Stabilizes spine <br/> - Reduces reoperation | - Higher complication rate <br/> - Longer recovery |
| Interspinous spacers | - Mild-to-moderate LSS <br/> - Dynamic stenosis | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Motion-preserving | - Limited evidence <br/> - Reoperation risk |

---

### Outcomes and complications

Outcomes: Surgery improves pain and function more than conservative care in selected patients, with benefits lasting 2–4 years [^116bUen6] [^111Pw1tF]. Complications include infection, bleeding, nerve injury, dural tear, and **reoperation**; risk is higher with fusion and in older adults [^115vPstn].

---

## Minimally invasive procedures

- **Interspinous spacers**: For mild-to-moderate LSS with dynamic stenosis; motion-preserving but limited evidence [^111EpKuS].
- **Endoscopic decompression**: Emerging option with less tissue disruption; long-term data pending [^1114VGya].
- **Spinal cord stimulation**: Consider for refractory pain after failed surgery or when anatomy limits decompression [^115gzkvu].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

Patient factors include age, comorbidities, symptom severity, and preferences. Disease factors include stenosis severity, level, architecture, and the presence of instability. Evidence level varies, with **strong evidence supporting decompression** and limited evidence for some minimally invasive options [^114Feoye].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging directions include **biologics** to target inflammation and regeneration, though evidence is early, and **advanced imaging** to improve patient selection and planning. Shared decision-making remains central to align treatment with patient values and expectations [^116zFgjE].

---

Treatment of spinal stenosis should be **individualized**, starting with conservative measures and escalating to surgery for persistent symptoms or neurological deficits. Decompression alone is effective for most; fusion is reserved for instability. Minimally invasive options can help selected patients, but evidence is evolving.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — long-term comparative outcomes (Amundsen et al): A matched cohort study of 100 patients divided into three groups (19 surgical for severe symptoms, 50 medical/interventional for moderate symptoms, 31 randomly re-assigned) reported good results with medical/interventional treatment in 70% at six months, 64% at one year, and 57% at four years, versus surgery in 79% at six months, 89% at one year, and 84% at four years; among those randomized to medical/interventional care, good results were 39% at six months, 33% at one year, and 47% at four years, and 56% reported being worse at six months, while those randomized to surgery had good results of 92% at six months, 69% at one year, and 92% at four years. At 10 years, 10 died, 19 crossed to surgery, and 39 remained in the medical/interventional group, of whom 70% experienced excellent results. This study provides Level II therapeutic evidence that moderate to severe presentations achieve a good result about 90% of the time with surgery compared with only about 40% with medical/interventional care, and Level IV evidence that severe presentations have good outcomes with decompression 80–90% of the time while moderate symptoms have about 70% good results with medical/interventional treatment.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — medical/interventional management may be considered to provide long-term (2–10 years) improvement in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and has been shown to improve outcomes in a large percentage of patients (Grade of Recommendation: C). Because of limited evidence, long-term results were defined as studies with two or more years of follow-up, and among patients with mild to moderate disease initially managed medically/interventionally and followed up to 10 years, approximately 20–40% will ultimately require surgical intervention, while among those not requiring surgery, 50–70% have improvement in pain.

Natural history of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — evidence review scope and findings: For inclusion, studies required symptomatic patients with characteristic clinical features and confirmatory imaging demonstrating diminished space in the lumbar spinal canal. The group reviewed the 2007 version of the guideline which included 38 references from 1966–2006 and an additional 21 articles from database searches for studies published between January 2006 and February 2010, but all identified studies failed to meet inclusion criteria because they did not adequately pre-sent data about natural history and did not report results of untreated control patients; works frequently cited as natural history studies were actually reports of one or more medical/interventional treat-ment measures. The 2007 guideline had considered patients with minimal medical/interventional treat-ment representative of the natural course, but the 2010 work group determined that any treatment may affect natural history and such studies would be more appropriately in-cluded in the medical/interventional treatment section. Because of these limitations, the work group was unable to definitively an-swer the question related to natural history and instead noted that consensus statements would follow.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (NASS guideline) — levels of evidence assignment and downgrading criteria state that "The levels of evidence range from Level I (high quality randomized controlled trial) to Level V (expert consensus)". "Levels of evidence have very specific criteria and are assigned to studies prior to developing rec-ommendations. Recommendations are then graded based upon the level of evidence". Study design sets only a potential level of evidence; for example, "a therapeutic study designed as a randomized controlled trial would be considered a potential Level I study", but execution flaws can lead to downgrading, where "reasons to downgrade the results of a potential Level I randomized controlled trial to a Level II study would include, among other possibilities: an under-powered study (patient sample too small, variance too high), inadequate randomization or masking of the group assignments and lack of validated outcome measures".

### Rehabilitation following surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis [^111rP4dc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of back pain that can also give rise to pain in the buttock, thigh or leg, particularly when walking. Several possible treatments are available, of which surgery appears to be best at restoring function and reducing pain. Surgical outcome is not ideal, and a sizeable proportion of patients do not regain good function. No accepted evidence-based approach to postoperative care is known-a fact thathas prompted this review.

Objectives

To determine whether active rehabilitation programmes following primary surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis have an impact on functional outcomes and whether such programmes are superior to 'usual postoperative care'.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from their first issues to March 2013: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, most recent issue), the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PEDro.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effectiveness of active rehabilitation versus usual care in adults (> 18 years of age) with confirmed lumbar spinal stenosis who had undergone spinal decompressive surgery (with or without fusion) for the first time.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials by using a predeveloped form. We contacted authors of original trials to request additional unpublished data as required. We recorded baseline characteristics of participants, interventions, comparisons, follow-up and outcome measures to enable assessment of clinical homogeneity. Clinical relevance was independently assessed by using the five questions recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG), and risk of bias within studies was determined by using CBRG criteria. We pooled individual study results in a meta-analysis when appropriate. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) when the same measurement scales were used in all studies and the standardised mean difference (SMD) when different measurement scales were used. Whenreported means and standard deviations of the outcomes showed that outcome data were skewed, we log-transformed data for all studies in the comparison and performed a meta-analysis on the log-scale. Results of analyses performed on the log-scale were converted back to the original scale. We used a fixed-effect inverse variance model to measure treatment effect when no substantial evidence of statistical heterogeneity was found. When we detected substantial statistical heterogeneity, we used a random-effects inverse variance model. The primary outcome measure was functional status as measured by a back-specific functional scale. Secondary outcomes included measures of leg pain, low back pain and global improvement/general health. We considered statistical significance and clinical relevance of outcomes. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of evidence for each outcome on the basis of five criteria, for which evidence was ranked from high to very low quality, depending on the number of criteria met.

Main Results

Our searches yielded 1,726 results, and a total of three studies (N = 373 participants) were included in the review and meta-analysis. All studies were deemed to have low risk of bias; no study had unacceptably high dropout rates. Also, no unacceptably unbalanced dropout rates, unacceptably low adherence rates or non-adherence to the protocol or clearly significant unbalanced baseline differences were noted for the primary outcome. Outcomes in the short term (within six months postoperative)Evidence of moderate quality from three RCTs (N = 340) shows that active rehabilitation is more effective than usual care for functional status (log SMD -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.44 to 0.00, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in standardised functional score) of 20%, 95% CI 0% to 36%) and for reported low back pain (log MD -0.18, 95% CI-0.35 to -0.02, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 16%, 95% CI 2% to 30%). In contrast, evidence of low quality suggests that rehabilitation is no more effective than usual care for leg pain (log MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.19, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 16%, 95% CI 21% worsening to 41% improvement). Low-quality evidence from two RCTs (N = 238) indicates that rehabilitation has no additional benefit on general health status as compared to usual care (MD 1.30, 95% CI -4.45 to 7.06). Outcomes in the long term (at 12 months postoperative)Evidence of moderate quality from three RCTs (N = 373) shows that rehabilitation is more effective than usual care for functional status (log SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.05, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in standardised functional score) of 23%, 95% CI 5% to 37%), for reported low back pain (log MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.05, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 18%, 95% CI 5% to 30%]. Evidence of moderate quality (N = 373) and for leg pain (log MD -0.24, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.01, corresponding to an average percentage improvement (reduction in VAS score) of 21%, 95% CI 1% to 37%). In contrast, evidence of low quality from two studies (N = 273) suggests that rehabilitation is no more effective than usual care with respect to improvement in general health (MD -0.48, 95% CI -6.41 to 5.4). None of the included papers reported any relevant adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that active rehabilitation is more effective than usual care in improving both short- and long-term (back-related) functional status. Similar findings were noted for secondary outcomes, including short-term improvement in low back pain and long-term improvement in both low back pain and leg pain, although limited impact was observed in relation to improvements in general health status. The clinical relevance of these effects is medium to small. Our evaluation is limited by the small number of relevant studies identified, and further research is required.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114svWF5]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical messages

For patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis:
Common exercise components are supervision, lumbar flexion, and aerobic fitness exercises.
Additional components that improve patient outcomes are stretches, strength/trunk muscle exercises, and cycling exercise for aerobic fitness.
Adding a psychologically informed approach might help.
Balance exercises warrant more research.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114oaAsd]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

The fourth key trial that we identifiedhas been published after these systematic reviews were undertaken and adds to the growing evidence of exercise benefits in people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. This is a high-quality randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a personalised and supervised group exercise programme combined with a psychologically informed approach compared to best practice physiotherapy.

The majority of exercise interventions in the trials we reviewed relied on theoretical rationales proposed by earlier authors, and/or on evidence from other populations. These rationales include theory-driven recommendations of flexion-based/lordosis-reducing exercises and trunk muscle control exercises for relieving the posture-related symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. However, little or no detail was provided to explain the selection of specific exercise intervention parameters and components.

The value of a psychologically informed approach is now recognised in the management of chronic back pain. Whilst only two recent exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication incorporated a psychologically informed approach and education, both were classed as successful interventions, reporting sustained improvements in walking capacity. In a population that is known to have poor activity levelsand high levels of depression, psychologically informed approaches may be another important factor in optimising exercise prescription.

The majority of exercise interventions in the included trials were supervised and performed at least twice weekly over a duration of at least 6 weeks. Whilst no conclusions could be drawn about the impact of exercise dose and supervision on intervention success, these parameters are consistent with the literature in other musculoskeletal conditions that suggests twice-weekly supervised strength and fitness exercises are most likely to provide a meaningful improvement in pain and function.

### Diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis… [^112HYCqj]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600 000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis. Observations. Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10% to 20% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated.

Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy on the Oswestry Disability Index. Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score, but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion.

Conclusions and Relevance Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.

### Evaluation and treatment of tandem spinal stenosis [^112MwJWn]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Tandem spinal stenosis (TSS) refers to simultaneous narrowing of noncontiguous regions of the spinal canal, typically the cervical and lumbar region. Symptomatic TSS may be present in more than 10% of patients presenting with spinal symptoms secondary to stenosis in any one region. Clinical presentation may present challenges because of a mixture of upper and lower motor neuron lesions that can confuse and mislead the clinician. Stenosis at another level may only be detected late, when there is failure to improve after treatment, and, if not detected, can result in either poor treatment outcomes or catastrophic complications. There is no uniform agreement in the management of TSS, and the reported surgical strategies include both simultaneous and staged approaches with each having positive and negative features. This article aims to provide the reader with details on the prevalence, evaluation, and guidance in treatment strategy for TSS.

### Management of lumbar spinal stenosis [^115sLCjW]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) affects more than 200,000 adults in the United States, resulting in substantial pain and disability. It is the most common reason for spinal surgery in patients over 65 years. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome of pain in the buttocks or lower extremities, with or without back pain. It is associated with reduced space available for the neural and vascular elements of the lumbar spine. The condition is often exacerbated by standing, walking, or lumbar extension and relieved by forward flexion, sitting, or recumbency. Clinical care and research into lumbar spinal stenosis is complicated by the heterogeneity of the condition, the lack of standard criteria for diagnosis and inclusion in studies, and high rates of anatomic stenosis on imaging studies in older people who are completely asymptomatic. The options for non-surgical management include drugs, physiotherapy, spinal injections, lifestyle modification, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. However, few high quality randomized trials have looked at conservative management. A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any specific type of non-surgical treatment. Several different surgical procedures are used to treat patients who do not improve with non-operative therapies. Given that rapid deterioration is rare and that symptoms often wax and wane or gradually improve, surgery is almost always elective and considered only if sufficiently bothersome symptoms persist despite trials of less invasive interventions. Outcomes (leg pain and disability) seem to be better for surgery than for non-operative treatment, but the evidence is heterogeneous and often of limited quality.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: an evidenced-based approach [^112VJcum]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Algorithm for Spinal Stenosis Treatment

The traditional treatment algorithm for LSS consists of conservative management (physical therapy, medication, education, exercise), followed by ESI, and finally open surgical decompression. As shown in this paper, recently several minimally invasive procedures have been developed, thereby expanding the treatment options. The MIST guideline provides guidance on the treatment choice of different minimally invasive procedures depending on the patient's disease characteristics. The algorithm proposed here (Figure 1) serves as a guide to help clinicians improve treatment selection for patients diagnosed with LSS or who have a suspicion of LSS. The following points are considered of special interest:

Figure 1
Lumbar Spinal Stenosis management algorithm.

Following suspicion of LSS, and based on physical examination and ZCQ score, conservative treatment may be initiated. The presence of so-called red flags should always lead to (additional) imaging studies and consultation with neurological specialists.
When physical therapy and medication have failed, other treatments such as diagnostic medial branch block (MBB), intra-articular facet injections, and medial branch RFA of the lumbar facet joint nerve may be considered.
Assessment of instability is of utmost importance to assess if minimally invasive surgical options are suitable for a patient. When instability is suspected, this may be confirmed by examination of flexion and extension films, as well as the presence of significant spondylolisthesis. Other factors that may point to instability are facet joint hypertrophy with fluid collection or facet cyst formation. If patients are deemed unstable with grade > 2 spondylolisthesis, they are not suitable candidates for minimally invasive indirect decompression with an interspinous spacer.
Invasive decompression surgery should be considered in a stepwise manner: from limited open decompression with one to three segments to limited level fusion and finally extensive decompression and fusion.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^113GhT8s]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis guideline methodology — evidence selection, grading, and consensus thresholds are specified as follows: For literature selection, if Level I, II or III literature is available to answer a clinical question, the work group was not required to review Level IV or V studies. For evidence analysis, at least two work group members reviewed each selected article and assigned levels of evidence, and the consensus level — defined as the level upon which two-thirds of reviewers were in agreement — was assigned. Expert consensus was incorporated only where Level I-IV evidence is insufficient, and consensus-based recommendations indicate that Level I-IV evidence is insufficient and that the recommendation is based only on expert consensus. Recommendation voting used a nominal group technique with independent anonymous ratings on a scale ranging from 1 to 9; consensus was obtained when at least 80% of members ranked a recommendation a 7, 8 or 9, with up to three rounds of discussion and voting if the 80% threshold was not attained, after which, if still unresolved, no recommendation was adopted. The guideline notes that study classification depends on the question asked, for example a randomized control trial may be a Level I therapeutic study but could be Level II prognostic evidence if untreated control data are analyzed prognostically.

### Patterns in decompression and fusion procedures for patients with lumbar stenosis after major clinical trial results, 2016 to 2019 [^113ndrGL]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2016, 2 prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs), published in the New England Journal of Medicine sought to answer one of the most basic clinical questions in spinal surgical procedures: are patients with lumbar stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis optimally treated with decompression alone or in addition to lumbar fusion? Taken together, the results of these large studies, which were later extended by an even larger third RCT in 2021, suggest that addition of fusion confers only a modest decrease in long-term reoperation rates, without long-term functional benefit, compared with decompression alone among patients with lumbar stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis. Despite this high-quality evidence, recent updates to major spine society guidelines have been sparse. Furthermore, in the US, rates of decompression with fusion procedures for any number of indications have substantially increased over the last 20 years, even in excess of lumbar spinal pathology diagnoses in an aging population and despite the higher surgical risk profiles and aggregate and excess health care expenditures. The disproportionate growth in decompression with fusion procedures is likely dependent on multiple factors, including individual surgeon preferences, practice setting, surgeon experience, available implant technologies (including minimally invasive and anterolateral instrumentation options) and their aggressive marketing, and potential economic incentives. Given these recent patterns, it is unclear whether the results of these major studies, have changed domestic surgical practice since their publication. We hypothesized that the results of these studies, would result in a relative decrease in the use of decompression with fusion compared with decompression alone for patients undergoing surgical procedures for lumbar stenosis and degenerative spondylolisthesis from 2016 to 2019. As a secondary objective, we sought to assess which patient and hospital characteristics, if any, were associated with the decision to perform decompression with fusion compared with decompression alone in this patient population.

### Comparative clinical effectiveness of nonsurgical treatment methods in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized clinical trial [^115Tqihe]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a degenerative condition of the spine prevalent in 30% of older adults. Lumbar spinal stenosis is associated with substantial functional limitation of walking, disability, and increased risk of falling. Lumbar spinal stenosis accounts for the fastest growth in lumbar surgery in older adults in the United States. The rate of complex fusion procedures for this condition has increased by 137% between 1998 and 2008. These surgical procedures lead to significant costs, risks, complications, and rehospitalizations. However, evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions and treatment options for patients with LSS.

The North American Spine Society has published a clinical guideline for the treatment of LSS. The only 2 interventions recommended as evidence based and effective were epidural steroid injection and surgical decompression. This guideline concluded that there was insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of nonsurgical treatments, including pharmacologic treatments, physical therapy, exercise, and spinal manipulation. Yet, the only nonsurgical intervention favorably recommended by the North American Spine Society has been contradicted by recent reviews that concluded that the evidence for the effectiveness of epidural injections is of low quality.

Since publication of the North American Spine Society guideline, several systematic reviews have corroborated the evidence gap about nonsurgical treatments for LSS. To help bridge this gap, we performed a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of 3 nonsurgical interventions on symptoms and physical function (primary aims) as well as physical activity (secondary aim) in patients with LSS. Exploratory aims included analyses of the number of adverse events, attrition/adherence rates, fall rates, and number of cointerventions.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis [^115RgXi6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a debilitating condition associated with degeneration of the spine with aging.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of different types of surgery compared with different types of non-surgical interventions in adults with symptomatic LSS. Primary outcomes included quality of life, disability, function and pain. Also, to consider complication rates and side effects, and to evaluate short-, intermediate- and long-term outcomes (six months, six months to two years, five years or longer).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two trials registries up to February 2015. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings related to treatment of the spine.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical versus non-operative treatments in participants with lumbar spinal stenosis confirmed by clinical and imaging findings.

Data Collection and Analysis

For data collection and analysis, we followed methods guidelines of the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009) and those provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).

Main Results

From the 12,966 citations screened, we assessed 26 full-text articles and included five RCTs (643 participants). Low-quality evidence from the meta-analysis performed on two trials using the Oswestry Disability Index (pain-related disability) to compare direct decompression with or without fusion versus multi-modal non-operative care showed no significant differences at six months (mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.12 to 2.80) and at one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to 2.66). At 24 months, significant differences favoured decompression (MD -4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96). Low-quality evidence from one small study revealed no difference in pain outcomes between decompression and usual conservative care (bracing and exercise) at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.59), four years (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.00 to 56.48) and 10 years (RR 4.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 17.58). Low-quality evidence from one small study suggested no differences at six weeks in the Oswestry Disability Index for patients treated with minimally invasive mild decompression versus those treated with epidural steroid injections (MD 5.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.83; 38 participants). Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) results were better for epidural injection at six weeks (MD -0.60, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.28), and visual analogue scale (VAS) improvements were better in the mild decompression group (MD 2.40, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.88). At 12 weeks, many cross-overs prevented further analysis. Low-quality evidence from a single study including 191 participants favoured the interspinous spacer versus usual conservative treatment at six weeks, six months and one year for symptom severity and physical function. All remaining studies reported complications associated with surgery and conservative side effects of treatment: Two studies reported no major complications in the surgical group, and the other study reported complications in 10% and 24% of participants, including spinous process fracture, coronary ischaemia, respiratory distress, haematoma, stroke, risk of reoperation and death due to pulmonary oedema.

Authors' Conclusions

We have very little confidence to conclude whether surgical treatment or a conservative approach is better for lumbar spinal stenosis, and we can provide no new recommendations to guide clinical practice. However, it should be noted that the rate of side effects ranged from 10% to 24% in surgical cases, and no side effects were reported for any conservative treatment. No clear benefits were observed with surgery versus non-surgical treatment. These findings suggest that clinicians should be very careful in informing patients about possible treatment options, especially given that conservative treatment options have resulted in no reported side effects. High-quality research is needed to compare surgical versus conservative care for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Patterns in decompression and fusion procedures for patients with lumbar stenosis after major clinical trial results, 2016 to 2019 [^113yb3tQ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Did the use of lumbar decompression with fusion for the surgical treatment of lumbar stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis change after publication of 2 major randomized clinical trials in 2016 that demonstrated decompression with fusion was not superior to decompression alone?

Findings

In this cohort study of 121 745 patients undergoing elective surgical procedures for diagnoses of lumbar stenosis with degenerative spondylolisthesis during inpatient admission, rates of decompression alone decreased from 32.6% in 2016 to 9.6% in 2019, and rates of decompression with fusion increased from 67.4% in 2016 to 90.4% in 2019.

Meaning

These results suggest the findings of 2 major clinical trials have not yet produced changes in surgical practice patterns and warrant renewed focus.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111sfndi]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common spinal condition in older adults. The cluster of symptoms typically arising from lumbar spinal stenosis is referred to as neurogenic claudication and includes pain, aches, heaviness, and tingling radiating from the spine into the buttocks and legs, made worse by standing and walking and relieved by sitting.

Controversy around the benefits, costs and risks of surgical treatment, has led to a growing interest in non-surgical care including exercise to help people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. Exercise is commonly prescribedbased on the theoretical benefits of increased spinal flexibility, enhanced blood flow to spinal nerves, improvements in physical fitness, strength and balance, and benefits for mental well-being, confidence and self-efficacy. – A number of recent systematic reviews – have synthesised data from clinical trials and concluded that exercise as part of multimodal care improves some outcomes. However, these trials delivered exercise interventions with notably different characteristics and comparators. Conclusions drawn from such heterogeneous data may have limited use for clinicians and policymakers wanting to understand how individual or combined exercise intervention components might impact patient outcomes. Furthermore, there is recognition that decision-makers are interested in research evidence to explain how complex exercise interventions work in different contexts and to support real-world decision-making.

The concept for this systematic review was shaped by the views of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication and by the views of clinicians. Both have highlighted inconsistent guidance and lack of detail on specific components to guide exercise prescription. The aims of this review detailed in our protocol were to estimate exercise treatment effectiveness and to explore the key components of these exercise treatments. The first point has been addressed by others in systematic reviews and meta-analyses published recently. – We, therefore, undertook this review to synthesise the evidence relating to specific components within exercise interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. For the purposes of the review, we defined an exercise intervention as, 'A regular, structured and/or supervised exercise regimen'. This includes individual or group exercises, and supervised exercises or home exercises if following a structured programme, or a mixture.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113gdzmU]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We identified 13 randomised controlled trials that provide evidence about exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. We systematically explored the exercise intervention components that were commonly used and those that featured more frequently in trials with successful outcomes.

The intervention component analysis approach allowed us to highlight commonly used components that might warrant further attention in exercise interventions for this population. These include stretches, muscle strength and control exercises (general and core), and aerobic fitness exercises especially if performed in spinal flexion such as cycling. It also allowed us to identify potentially important components that are infrequently prioritised such as balance exercises. In contrast, traditional systematic reviews offer limited detail to guide clinicians and patients affected by lumbar spinal stenosis. Indeed, inconsistent terminology referring to exercise-based interventions (including terms such as rehabilitation, multimodal care and supervised-, directed-, home- and self-directed exercise), and questionable approaches to synthesising effectiveness data have exacerbated our understanding of the fragmented evidence concerning effective exercise components.

Four recent randomised controlled trials could be considered key sources contributing to the body of evidence in this field. Despite notable differences in interventions and comparators, systematic reviews have pooled data from all but the most recent of these trials. One recent systematic reviewconcluded that manual therapy with supervised exercise improves short-term walking capacity, and provides small improvements in pain and symptom severity compared with self-directed or group exercise. Data from one of the key trialswas, however, omitted without explanation, and data from exercise-based interventions were combined with data from other non-surgical interventions such as acupuncture under the heading of 'rehabilitation'. Two other systematic reviews used pooled headings of 'directed exercise + manual therapy versus self-directed or group exercise', and 'combined therapies versus home/group exercises'. These headings were used to encompass exercise interventions delivered in different formats (supervised or unsupervised, group or individual) and combined with different supplementary treatments (manual therapy, education, psychologically informed approach). Furthermore, these trials used very different comparator interventions (medical care, self-directed exercise, or structured home exercise with regular contact with a clinician). Because of such intervention heterogeneity, a recent Cochrane reviewchose not to meta-analyse the data. Instead, the authors undertook a narrative review of recent trials, updating findings from a previous review to conclude that there is moderate-quality evidence for a multimodal approach that includes manual therapy and exercise, with or without education.

### Nonsurgical treatment of pain in lumbar spine stenosis… [^114Dd6LE]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Epidural administration of corticosteroids is, of course, not curative; however, many patients who receive them experience a prolonged period of relief. If the interval of relief is good — for instance, six months or more — then this treatment is a practical alternative to surgery with its inherent risks. Patients with a difference in the length of their legs and pain on the side with the longer leg may respond to a lift to correct the shorter leg. Patients with clearly unilateral symptoms often respond to ligament prolotherapy on the painful side of the body. Patients with listhesis and/or disc disease that contributes to the stenosis often respond to prolotherapy at that level in the spine. Physical therapy and chiropractic treatments sometimes provide adequate relief. Dr. Matthews stated that so-called weakness of the sacroiliac ligament can mimic the symptoms of neurologic claudication.

He suggested that treatments such as "ligament prolotherapy, " chiropractic manipulation and corticosteroid injections be offered to patients in lieu of surgical decompression. He did not, however, address the risks or benefits of these treatment modalities or their long-term efficacy in relieving the symptoms of claudication, nor did he substantiate his claims with data from the existing literature. 1 found that 70. 8 percent of patients who underwent decompressive laminectomies for stenosis improved postoperatively. The follow-up period was from one to 11 years. Silvers and colleagues 2 noted a success rate of 93 percent after surgery for lumbar spine stenosis. Of course, the literature is replete with studies on decompressive surgery with wide-ranging improvement rates. However, most of the recent literature confirms that more than two thirds of symptomatic patients benefit from surgery.

As clearly stated in our article, patients with mild leg pain or symptoms of short duration may be offered physical therapy, analgesics or other nonsurgical therapies initially. Morbidly obese patients may indeed improve by following a weight loss program. We feel that while it is reasonable to recommend a non-surgical treatment regimen initially, patients who present to the primary care provider with unremitting, disabling leg and back pain caused by lumbar canal stenosis with appropriate radiologic correlation should be offered the option of surgical decompression. Surgical management is by far the most effective treatment for this disabling disease and delaying surgery with unproven "therapies" may result in the progression of symptoms and unnecessary prolonged suffering. This is clearly a disservice to our patients.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111qWJP1]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyse the components used in exercise interventions for people with symptoms of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis and identify components associated with successful interventions.

Data Sources

Eligible papers published up to April 2023 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and trial registry websites.

Review Methods

Literature searches were performed by an Information Specialist. We searched for randomised trials evaluating exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication symptoms (the primary symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis). Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool Version 2 and the TIDieR checklist for intervention reporting. Details of intervention components were extracted, tabulated, and synthesised using an intervention component analysis approach.

Results

We found thirteen trials reporting 23 exercise interventions delivered to 1440 participants. These featured 60 different components. Most exercise interventions included supervision and flexion-based exercises. Balance exercises were rarely included. Exercise components featured more frequently in successful interventions included stretches, strength or trunk muscle exercises, fitness exercises, especially cycling, and psychologically informed approaches. Interpretation is limited by low study numbers and heterogeneity. No conclusions could be drawn about exercise supervision or dose.

Discussion

Exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication typically feature multiple components. Common features such as supervision, lumbar flexion, and aerobic fitness exercises and also less common features such as stretches, strengthening exercises, and psychologically informed approaches warrant consideration for inclusion when designing and optimising exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — decompression versus no surgery outcomes are reported with Level IV evidence: a no care group (19 patients) was compared with decompressive surgery without fusion (44 patients); at follow-up, symptom-free rates were 42% in patients not operated upon, 33% in surgical patients with moderate stenosis, and 57% in surgical patients with severe stenosis; pain improvement occurred in 32% of the nontreatment group, 57% of the surgical moderate group, and 64% of the surgical severe group; pain rated worse occurred in 10% of the nontreated group, 20% of the surgical moderate group, and 7% of the surgical severe group; the treatment for the no-surgery group is not clearly defined; the study states decompression provides improvement in pain 50–60% of the time with 30–36% likely to worsen, and that medical/interventional management will provide pain relief about 33% of the time with about 10% likely to worsen.

### Contemporary management of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis [^112Wujsq]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common cause of impaired quality of life and diminished functional capacity in the elderly. Due to the advance of noninvasive imaging modalities, spinal stenosis is becoming more frequently identified, and has become the most frequent cause for spinal surgery in patients older than 65 years. Despite the ubiquitous nature of this condition, considerable controversy exists regarding the preferred treatment. Level I evidence that compares the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical treatment is lacking. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial, a study that evaluates the common surgical treatments for the lumbar spine, has addressed this deficiency and is discussed in this article.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11217szZ]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (2019 CRD42019137266). A systematic search was conducted to synthesise data from randomised controlled trials published between 1996 and May 2023. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklistto report the findings.

The eligibility criteria for inclusion of trials are presented in Table 1. Our protocol stipulated an age range of 65 years or older, which we amended after noting several relevant studies involving participants with lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms aged 50 upwards from a preliminary review of the literature.

Table 1.
Eligibility criteria for inclusion of studies.

Based on previous systematic reviews, – a robust search strategy was developed by an information specialist in health sciences. Electronic searches for eligible studies were conducted within the databases, including the ClinicalTrials.gov and ISRCTN trial registry websites. For all included studies, we also undertook backward and forward reference searching by hand.

After the screening of titles and abstracts by pairs of authors (CC, EW, or CC, SM) and the exclusion of duplicates, full texts were retrieved and were independently assessed by two authors (as above). Any discrepancies in selecting the studies were resolved through discussion.

For each included trial, we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2to assess the potential for bias across five domains (randomisation, intervention assignment, missing data, outcome measurement, and reporting). We used signalling questions from the Cochrane template to assess the domain-level judgements about the risk of bias and then reached an overall judgement about the risk of bias for each trial. The risk of bias was judged as 'low', with 'some concerns' and 'high'. We also assessed the quality of the reporting of exercise interventions using the TIDieR checklist (0–24 score, higher scores mean higher quality reporting). Scoring was completed by one author (CC) and checked by a second author (EW/SM). Any discrepancies in scoring were resolved through discussion.

### Best practices for minimally invasive lumbar spinal stenosis treatment 2.0 (MIST): consensus guidance from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) [^114psZTA]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common spinal disease of aging with a growing patient population, paralleling population growth. Minimally invasive treatments are evolving, and the use of these techniques needs guidance to provide the optimal patient safety and efficacy outcomes.

Methods

The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) identified an educational need for guidance on the prudent use of the innovative minimally invasive surgical therapies for the treatment of symptomatic LSS. The executive board nominated experts spanning anesthesiology, physiatry, orthopedic surgery, and neurosurgery based on expertise, publications, research, diversity and field of practice. Evidence was reviewed, graded using the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria for evidence and recommendation strength and grade, and expert opinion was added to make consensus points for best practice.

Results

The world literature in English was searched using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, BioMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Current Contents Connect, Scopus, and meeting abstracts to identify and compile the evidence (per section) for LSS-related pain. Search words were selected based upon the section represented. Identified peer-reviewed literature was critiqued using USPSTF criteria and consensus points are presented.

Discussion

The algorithm for patient selection in the management of symptomatic spinal stenosis is evolving. Careful consideration of patient selection and anatomic architecture variance is critical for improved outcomes and patient safety.

Conclusion

ASPN created a guidance for best practice for minimally invasive surgical treatment of symptomatic spinal stenosis.

### A pathway for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis [^1166dfGh]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent condition with varied presentation. Most common in older populations, symptoms typically include back, buttock, and posterior thigh pain. Diagnosis is typically based on physical examination and clinical history, but confirmed on imaging studies. Nonsurgical management includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, and epidural injections. If nonoperative management fails or patient presentation involves worsening symptoms, surgical intervention, most commonly in the form of a laminectomy, may be indicated. Recent literature has demonstrated improved pain and functional outcomes with surgery compared with conservative treatment in the middle to long term.

### Clinical assessment and management of lumbar spinal stenosis: clinical dilemmas and considerations for surgical referral [^111zCB6f]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Lumbar spinal stenosis is the leading indication for spine surgery in older adults. Surgery is recommended in clinical guidelines if non-surgical treatments have been provided with insufficient benefit. The difficulty for clinicians is that the current number of randomised controlled trials is low, which creates uncertainty about which treatments to provide. For non-surgical clinicians this paucity of data leads to a clinical dilemma of whether to continue managing the patient or refer to a spine surgeon. This Viewpoint aims to provide an update on the assessment of lumbar spinal stenosis, treatment recommendations, indications for referral to a spine surgeon, and current clinical dilemmas facing non-surgical clinicians and spinal surgeons.

### Surgical versus nonsurgical therapy for lumbar spinal stenosis [^116bUen6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Surgery for spinal stenosis is widely performed, but its effectiveness as compared with nonsurgical treatment has not been shown in controlled trials.

Methods

Surgical candidates with a history of at least 12 weeks of symptoms and spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis (as confirmed on imaging) were enrolled in either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort at 13 U.S. spine clinics. Treatment was decompressive surgery or usual nonsurgical care. The primary outcomes were measures of bodily pain and physical function on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) and the modified Oswestry Disability Index at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years.

Results

A total of 289 patients were enrolled in the randomized cohort, and 365 patients were enrolled in the observational cohort. At 2 years, 67% of patients who were randomly assigned to surgery had undergone surgery, whereas 43% of those who were randomly assigned to receive nonsurgical care had also undergone surgery. Despite the high level of nonadherence, the intention-to-treat analysis of the randomized cohort showed a significant treatment effect favoring surgery on the SF-36 scale for bodily pain, with a mean difference in change from baseline of 7.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 14.1); however, there was no significant difference in scores on physical function or on the Oswestry Disability Index. The as-treated analysis, which combined both cohorts and was adjusted for potential confounders, showed a significant advantage for surgery by 3 months for all primary outcomes; these changes remained significant at 2 years.

Conclusions

In the combined as-treated analysis, patients who underwent surgery showed significantly more improvement in all primary outcomes than did patients who were treated nonsurgically. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000411 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Surgical options for lumbar spinal stenosis [^114Feoye]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital charges for lumbar spinal stenosis have increased significantly worldwide in recent times, with great variation in the costs and rates of different surgical procedures. There have also been significant increases in the rate of complex fusion and the use of spinal spacer implants compared to that of traditional decompression surgery, even though the former is known to incur costs up to three times higher. Moreover, the superiority of these new surgical procedures over traditional decompression surgery is still unclear.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of surgery in the management of patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and the comparative effectiveness between commonly performed surgical techniques to treat this condition on patient-related outcomes. We also aimed to investigate the safety of these surgical interventions by including perioperative surgical data and reoperation rates.

Search Methods

Review authors performed electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science, LILACS and three trials registries from their inception to 16 June 2016. Authors also conducted citation tracking on the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

This review included only randomised controlled trials that investigated the efficacy and safety of surgery compared with no treatment, placebo or sham surgery, or with another surgical technique in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the studies for inclusion and performed the 'Risk of bias' assessment, using the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group criteria. Reviewers also extracted demographics, surgery details, and types of outcomes to describe the characteristics of included studies. Primary outcomes were pain intensity, physical function or disability status, quality of life, and recovery. The secondary outcomes included measurements related to surgery, such as perioperative blood loss, operation time, length of hospital stay, reoperation rates, and costs. We grouped trials according to the types of surgical interventions being compared and categorised follow-up times as short-term when less than 12 months and long-term when 12 months or more. Pain and disability scores were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. We calculated mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risks for dichotomous outcomes. We pooled data using the random-effects model in Review Manager 5.3, and used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included a total of 24 randomised controlled trials (reported in 39 published research articles or abstracts) in this review. The trials included 2352 participants with lumbar spinal stenosis with symptoms of neurogenic claudication. None of the included trials compared surgery with no treatment, placebo or sham surgery. Therefore, all included studies compared two or more surgical techniques. We judged all trials to be at high risk of bias for the blinding of care provider domain, and most of the trials failed to adequately conceal the randomisation process, blind the participants or use intention-to-treat analysis. Five trials compared the effects of fusion in addition to decompression surgery. Our results showed no significant differences in pain relief at long-term (mean difference (MD) -0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to 6.74). Similarly, we found no between-group differences in disability reduction in the long-term (MD 3.26, 95% CI -6.12 to 12.63). Participants who received decompression alone had significantly less perioperative blood loss (MD -0.52 L, 95% CI -0.70 L to -0.34 L) and required shorter operations (MD -107.94 minutes, 95% CI -161.65 minutes to -54.23 minutes) compared with those treated with decompression plus fusion, though we found no difference in the number of reoperations (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.92). Another three trials investigated the effects of interspinous process spacer devices compared with conventional bony decompression. These spacer devices resulted in similar reductions in pain (MD -0.55, 95% CI -8.08 to 6.99) and disability (MD 1.25, 95% CI -4.48 to 6.98). The spacer devices required longer operation time (MD 39.11 minutes, 95% CI 19.43 minutes to 58.78 minutes) and were associated with higher risk of reoperation (RR 3.95, 95% CI 2.12 to 7.37), but we found no difference in perioperative blood loss (MD 144.00 mL, 95% CI -209.74 mL to 497.74 mL). Two trials compared interspinous spacer devices with decompression plus fusion. Although we found no difference in pain relief (MD 5.35, 95% CI -1.18 to 11.88), the spacer devices revealed a small but significant effect in disability reduction (MD 5.72, 95% CI 1.28 to 10.15). They were also superior to decompression plus fusion in terms of operation time (MD 78.91 minutes, 95% CI 30.16 minutes to 127.65 minutes) and perioperative blood loss (MD 238.90 mL, 95% CI 182.66 mL to 295.14 mL), however, there was no difference in rate of reoperation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.51). Overall there were no differences for the primary or secondary outcomes when different types of surgical decompression techniques were compared among each other. The quality of evidence varied from 'very low quality' to 'high quality'.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this Cochrane review show a paucity of evidence on the efficacy of surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis, as to date no trials have compared surgery with no treatment, placebo or sham surgery. Placebo-controlled trials in surgery are feasible and needed in the field of lumbar spinal stenosis. Our results demonstrate that at present, decompression plus fusion and interspinous process spacers have not been shown to be superior to conventional decompression alone. More methodologically rigorous studies are needed in this field to confirm our results.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^111Pw1tF]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — surgical decompression versus medical/interventional care: Decompressive surgery is suggested to improve outcomes in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis (Grade of Recommendation: B). In a prospective comparative study, of the 125 patients included, 96 were treated surgically and 29 opted for medical/interventional treatment, and at two-year follow-up the average improvement in Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores for decompression, decompression with fusion and medical/interventional treatment were 6.9, 6.1 and 1.2 respectively; this provides Level II therapeutic evidence that patients considered surgical candidates who elect surgery have improvements greater than those electing medical/interventional treatment. In a randomized controlled trial of moderate lumbar spinal stenosis, of the 94 patients included, 50 received decompression and 44 individualized medical/interventional therapy; both groups improved during follow-up of one and two years, with greater improvement in the surgical group for disability, leg pain and back pain, walking ability did not differ, and the authors conclude that surgery should be suggested, but only after a trial of medical/interventional treatment. In the SPORT study, of the 654 patients included, 289 remained in the randomized controlled trial and 365 in the observational cohort; an as-treated analysis of 235 medical/interventional patients and 419 surgical patients showed a significant advantage for surgery for all primary outcomes, with changes significant at two years and maintained through four years; at four year follow-up, the medically/interventionally treated group "demonstrated only modest improvement over time", while in the surgical group 9% experienced dural tear and there was a 13% reoperation rate; collectively, these studies provide Level II therapeutic evidence that surgically treated patients maintain substantially greater improvement in pain and function through four years.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of spinal stenosis… [^111VVzaB]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Acquired stenosis is usually a result of degenerative disease but can also be caused by back surgery, disorders such as Paget's disease or ankylosing spondylitis, or trauma. Garfin and associates reviewed the pathophysiology and surgical management of spinal stenosis. Biomechanical and biochemical changes lead to decreased disc height with annular bulging, disc herniation and early osteophyte formation. The foraminal space narrows, resulting in nerve entrapment. A gradual shift in spinal alignment exacerbates the stenosis, exerting additional pressure on the neural elements. Decreased rotational accommodation coupled with altered motion cause inflammation of the cauda equina and, ultimately, pain. Compression combined with inflammation and irritation of the nerve root causes symptoms in the lower extremities. Decreased blood flow can be another factor related to symptoms.

Computed tomography without contrast material does not visualize neural elements well and is not recommended. Magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for surgical planning because the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the history, physical examination and radiographs. Nonoperative treatment includes education, reassurance, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics, if necessary. Aerobic conditioning is useful, and intermittent use of a corset-type brace can be of limited use. Epidural injection of steroids also seems to provide some relief. Operative treatment is indicated when pain is no longer tolerable and affects the patient's quality of life and when MRI reveals stenosis. The standard procedure is decompression laminectomy involving all levels determined to be compressed by preoperative imaging studies. An arthrodesis can be done if there is any deformity.

Complications are often determined by the patient's overall health status and comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary disease, diabetes and kidney disease. Complication rates are higher in patients over 80 years of age. The authors conclude that patients require careful screening for surgery because postoperative patient dissatisfaction is associated with poor preoperative functional status, the presence of multiple comorbidities and the predominance of back pain. editor's note: Decisions about surgery are generally based on the presence of persistent pain or the development of neurologic impairment. The shift from nonsurgical treatment to surgery requires consideration of the patient's perceptions and understanding of the problem. The best likelihood of achieving an acceptable result occurs when the physician and the patient share in the decision-making process. — r. s.

### Danish national clinical guidelines for surgical and nonsurgical treatment of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis [^112SYSxJ]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To summarize the recommendations from the national clinical guideline published by the Danish Health Authority regarding surgical and nonsurgical interventions in treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis in patients above the age of 65 years.

Methods

A multidisciplinary working group formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Seven of the recommendations were based on randomized controlled trials and three on professional consensus. The guideline recommends surgical decompression for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Supervised exercise and postsurgical supervised exercise are recommended due to the general beneficial effects of training on general health, even though there was no evidence on an effect on neurogenic pain. The guideline does not recommend manual therapy, paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids, neurogenic pain medication, muscle relaxants, and decompression combined with instrumented fusion as there was no evidence of the beneficial effect.

Conclusion

The recommendations are based on low to very low quality of evidence or professional consensus as well as patient preferences and positive or harmful effects of the intervention. The true treatment effect may therefore be different from the estimated effects, which is why the results should be interpreted with caution. The working group recommends intensified research in relation to all aspects of management of lumbar spinal stenosis. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### Decompression alone or decompression with fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis: a randomized clinical trial with two-year MRI follow-up [^1154givQ]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

In this RCT of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, new stenosis on two-year MRI was less common after decompression alone than after decompression and fusion, even for patients with a preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis. Adding fusion seems to worsen the radiological outcome by increasing adjacent level stenosis more than it prevents same-level restenosis. Our results support decompression without fusion as the surgical treatment of choice for lumbar spinal stenosis, even for patients with a degenerative spondylolisthesis.

Take home message

- This randomized clinical trial provides the first published two-year MRI follow-up after surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.

- Patients who had a fusion had a significantly higher rate of new stenosis on two-year MRI, even when a preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis was present.

- These findings provide support for the argument that decompression without fusion is the surgical treatment of choice for lumbar spinal stenosis, even for patients with a degenerative spondylolisthesis.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: how is It classified? [^117VcXVH]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of lumbar spinal stenosis is approximately 9.3%, with people most commonly affected in the sixth or seventh decade of life. Patients often have pain, cramping, and weakness in their legs that is worsened with standing and walking. Although the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial clearly demonstrated that surgery improves health-related quality of life, treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis varies widely from the type of decompression performed to the need for fusion. This variability can be attributed largely to the lack of an accepted classification system. A good classification system serves as a common language to define the severity of a condition, guide treatment, and facilitate clinical research.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115VQea5]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyse the components used in exercise interventions for people with symptoms of neurogenic claudication due to lumbar spinal stenosis and identify components associated with successful interventions.

Data sources

Eligible papers published up to April 2023 from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PEDro, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and trial registry websites.

Review methods

Literature searches were performed by an Information Specialist. We searched for randomised trials evaluating exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication symptoms (the primary symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis). Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool Version 2 and the TIDieR checklist for intervention reporting. Details of intervention components were extracted, tabulated, and synthesised using an intervention component analysis approach.

Results

We found thirteen trials reporting 23 exercise interventions delivered to 1440 participants. These featured 60 different components. Most exercise interventions included supervision and flexion-based exercises. Balance exercises were rarely included. Exercise components featured more frequently in successful interventions included stretches, strength or trunk muscle exercises, fitness exercises, especially cycling, and psychologically informed approaches. Interpretation is limited by low study numbers and heterogeneity. No conclusions could be drawn about exercise supervision or dose.

Discussion

Exercise interventions for people with neurogenic claudication typically feature multiple components. Common features such as supervision, lumbar flexion, and aerobic fitness exercises and also less common features such as stretches, strengthening exercises, and psychologically informed approaches warrant consideration for inclusion when designing and optimising exercise interventions for people with lumbar spinal stenosis.

4, 5 Patients with severe symptoms have exercise intolerance and greatly restricted walking capacity, and may have bladder dysfunction. 3, 6 Conservative treatment with pain-relieving agents seems to be the natural choice when symptoms are mild. 3, 5 Decompressive surgery to remove the bone and ligaments around the stenosis usually is recommended for patients with severe symptoms when conservative therapy has not provided adequate pain relief. 3, 5 Patients with moderate symptoms fall into a gray zone in which the most appropriate treatment is not obvious.

Definitive evidence-based conclusions about the efficacy of conservative or surgical treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis await the results of well-designed clinical trials.

4 contained a subgroup of patients with moderate symptoms. The patients who had surgery showed significantly better improvement, suggesting that surgery may be more beneficial than conservative treatment in patients with moderate pain. 5, 7 where treatment was deemed appropriate for patients with moderate symptoms. In the first trial, 7 44 patients with mild to moderate leg pain were randomized to receive conservative treatment or surgery. Although both treatment groups showed clinically and statistically significant improvement one year after treatment, only the surgery group continued to show improvement after two years. Treatment for Severe Symptoms Although the study 5 discussed above suggests that patients with severe symptoms benefit more from surgery than conservative therapy, this theory is based on the assumption that some patients with severe symptoms were misclassified and thus received conservative therapy initially and improved after they underwent surgery. In general, data are lacking on the effect of conservative treatment in patients with severe stenosis because these patients seem to receive surgery shortly after diagnosis.
5. Treatment for Neurogenic Claudication Evidence from four prospective uncontrolled trials that measured pre- and post-surgery walking ability suggests that these patients significantly improved after surgery.

Patients in these studies had severe lumbar spinal stenosis that resulted in greatly limited walking capacity and had received conservative therapy that failed to relieve their symptoms. One study.

### Diagnosis and management of lumbar spinal stenosis: a review [^115vPstn]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent and disabling cause of low back and leg pain in older persons, affecting an estimated 103 million persons worldwide. Most are treated nonoperatively. Approximately 600 000 surgical procedures are performed in the US each year for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Observations

The prevalence of the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis in US adults is approximately 11% and increases with age. The diagnosis can generally be made based on a clinical history of back and lower extremity pain that is provoked by lumbar extension, relieved by lumbar flexion, and confirmed with cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Nonoperative treatment includes activity modification such as reducing periods of standing or walking, oral medications to diminish pain such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physical therapy. In a series of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis followed up for up to 3 years without operative intervention, approximately one-third of patients reported improvement, approximately 50% reported no change in symptoms, and approximately 10% to 20% of patients reported that their back pain, leg pain, and walking were worse. Long-term benefits of epidural steroid injections for lumbar spinal stenosis have not been demonstrated. Surgery appears effective in carefully selected patients with back, buttock, and lower extremity pain who do not improve with conservative management. For example, in a randomized trial of 94 participants with symptomatic and radiographic degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, decompressive laminectomy improved symptoms more than nonoperative therapy (difference, 7.8 points; 95% CI, 0.8–14.9; minimum clinically important difference, 10–12.8) on the Oswestry Disability Index (score range, 0–100). Among persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and concomitant spondylolisthesis, lumbar fusion increased symptom resolution in 1 trial (difference, 5.7 points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 11.3) on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical dimension score (range, 0–100), but 2 other trials showed either no important differences between the 2 therapies or noninferiority of lumbar decompression alone compared with lumbar decompression plus spinal fusion (MCID, 2–4.9 points). In a noninferiority trial, 71.4% treated with lumbar decompression alone vs 72.9% of those receiving decompression plus fusion achieved a 30% or more reduction in Oswestry Disability Index score, consistent with the prespecified noninferiority hypothesis. Fusion is associated with greater risk of complications such as blood loss, infection, longer hospital stays, and higher costs. Thus, the precise indications for concomitant lumbar fusion in persons with lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis remain unclear.

Conclusions and Relevance

Lumbar spinal stenosis affects approximately 103 million people worldwide and 11% of older adults in the US. First-line therapy is activity modification, analgesia, and physical therapy. Long-term benefits from epidural steroid injections have not been established. Selected patients with continued pain and activity limitation may be candidates for decompressive surgery.

### Spinal stenosis… [^113MRvw3]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Spinal stenosis is a term used to describe a narrowing of the spinal canal, which contains the spinal cord and emerging nerve roots. It can occur in any portion of the spine. Because of limited space, changes in the bone or soft tissues can result in compression of the affected spinal cord and blood vessels. This narrowing can be congenital or acquired or a combination of both. Stenosis can be classified by location: central or lateral. Cord compression can also occur in patients with advanced cancer. The February 27, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about treatment options for cord compression due to metastatic cancer.

Conditions that result in spinal stenosis Osteophytes — formation of bony spurs associated with osteoarthritis Herniated disk — protrusion of a cartilage disk between vertebrae Malignancy — cancer Scarring and inflammation of supporting spinal ligaments Abscess — localized infection Spondylolisthesis — a shift or abnormal stacking of 2 vertebral bodies. Muscle weakness Localized or radiating pain Loss of bladder or bowel control Diagnosis and treatment Spinal stenosis can be diagnosed based on the history of symptoms, a physical examination, and imaging tests. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment may be conservative or surgical. As symptoms become debilitating, surgery may be considered a treatment option. The main goal of any surgical procedure is to remove pressure from the spinal cord or nerve roots.

This means that the tube of the spinal canal must be made larger by removing excess bone, ligaments, and abnormal tissues that are compressing the nerve roots. This type of surgical procedure is termed a decompressive laminectomy. If individuals have both spinal stenosis and instability of the spine, the surgical procedure should include a decompression coupled with a spinal fusion.

### Exercise treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and intervention component analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111tueao]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this review include a comprehensive search of the literature on exercise interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication and the use of an intervention component analysis approach. Instead of combining the data from heterogeneous trial interventions, we have undertaken a detailed exploration of components within different exercise interventions. We have used valid and recognised tools for evaluating the methodological quality and intervention reporting of included trials to provide additional context for our findings.

Our findings should be interpreted in the context of several considerations:

Firstly, readers should be aware that the key messages of this review are based on a limited number of available trials of varying methodological and reporting quality, with some inconsistency in findings, and where individual components sometimes feature in only one or two trials. By including evidence only from randomised controlled trials that fit clearly defined population, intervention, comparator and outcome reporting criteria, we sought to optimise the quality and relevance of data included in our synthesis, but less stringent inclusion criteria may have captured additional information. For transparency, a table of shortlisted trials that were excluded is presented. Because there are so few high-quality randomised controlled trials to draw on currently, it is likely that our interpretations of exercise intervention components may change as more evidence is obtained in the future.

Secondly, it is possible that trials published before 1996 may have been missed. However, hand searches of reference lists from the included trials and systematic reviews did not identify any additional relevant studies. Whilst several published protocols for potentially relevant ongoing or planned trials – were identified through grey literature, we were only able to contact the authors of one of thesefor which no results were available.

Finally, the coding of interventions as 'successful' or 'unsuccessful' relied on treatment effect data. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting our exploration of associations between intervention components and effectiveness.

Despite these limitations, our analyses provide some interesting insight into specific exercise intervention components that might show more promise than others, depending on the outcome of importance.

Further research to confirm effective exercise intervention components that target specific outcomes might be warranted to refine future exercise treatments for people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication. To this end, any future exercise intervention trials should carefully plan, evaluate and report exercise component details.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^112qaGEN]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the application of clinical methodology and decision-making thoroughly tested by duly controlled peer-reviewed studies. With the exponentially increasing number of publications, EBM aims to shift the traditional paradigm of making decisions based purely on the judgment of the physician or the experience of senior doctors to the use of results obtained from systematic and unbiased research in a patient-centered diagnosis and treatment model with the highest available evidence. The definition of EBM has evolved, but the most widely accepted definition was from Sackett et al. in 1996 and revised in 2000. In summary, it stated that clinicians should use the best, unbiased, clinically sound, and up-to-date data available on a patient basis in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

Neurosurgery and Orthopedic Surgery are the pioneers of spine surgery throughout the world. Neurosurgeons have utilized EBM and clinical guidelines to make sound decisions for the last three decades. However, the increasing number of guidelines have questioned the validity of these recommendations as they may stray away from the rigorous process outlined by The Institute of Medicine (IOM). Orthopedic Surgery also recognized the importance of EBM in the early 2000s, and journal sections reserved for "Evidence-Based Orthopedics" emerged. The classical paradigm of trying non-operative treatment first and operative treatment, if the first step fails, has shifted towards surgical treatment vs. other treatment options.

Evidence-Based Spine Surgery (EBSS) has also emerged parallel to the development of EBM. The North American Spine Society (NASS) and Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS) frequently publish guidelines with evidence-based suggestions to provide the highest evidence-based decisions in spinal pathologies. For example, EBSS supported by randomized controlled trials has shown discectomy for symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), decompression of spinal stenosis, and decompression with fusion of degenerative spondylolisthesis offer clinical benefit in relieving lower back and radicular pain compared to conservative treatment. However, pursuing EBSS as the sole deciding factor for diagnosing and treating spinal pathologies is unrealistic. Most of the publications on spine surgery are case-controlled retrospective cohorts or case series. Thus, the number of high-quality evidence parallel to spine surgery development is lacking. Considering the value of EBM and the probability of further implementation into decision-making, this study sheds light on the reception and application of EBM by spinal surgeons and the use of evidence-based modalities in their clinical practice.

### Spinal stenosis: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^114cDxTV]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Lumbar spinal stenosis is being diagnosed increasingly in older people as advanced imaging studies become more widely available and clinicians become more familiar with the presentation of this common condition. For symptomatic patients, the goal of treatment is pain relief and improved function, but there is little empiric evidence to support many of the common interventions used. The relative risks and benefits of various surgical and nonsurgical treatments are poorly understood, and the result has been wide variations in the evaluation and treatment of spinal stenosis across geographic regions. Current practice recommendations are based on expert opinion that incorporates available evidence into existing clinical and biologic paradigms. For most individuals, initial treatment should focus on patient education, medications to control pain, and exercise and physical treatments to regain or maintain activities of daily living. Surgical treatment most commonly is considered in patients not improving with nonsurgical care. Decompressive laminectomy is the standard surgical procedure for patients with spinal stenosis. The addition of fusion with or without instrumentation is considered when spinal stenosis is accompanied by degenerative spondylolisthesis or related to concerns about instability. We review the available evidence for nonsurgical and surgical interventions, and highlight comparative results wherever applicable.

Abstract

Objective

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) can lead to compression of the neural and vascular elements and is becoming more common due to degenerative changes that occur because of aging processes. Symptoms may manifest as pain and discomfort that radiates to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks. The traditional treatment algorithm for LSS consists of conservative management (physical therapy, medication, education, exercise), often followed by epidural steroid injections (ESIs), and when nonsurgical treatment has failed, open decompression surgery with or without fusion is considered. In this review, the variables that should be considered during the management of patients with LSS are discussed, and the role of each treatment option to provide optimal care is evaluated.

Results

This review leads to the creation of an evidence-based practical algorithm to aid clinicians in the management of patients with LSS. Special emphasis is directed at minimally invasive surgery, which should be taken into consideration when conservative management and ESI have failed.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis — work group consensus for mild symptoms states that, in the absence of evidence for or against any specific treatment, it is the work group's recommendation that medical/interventional treatment is considered for patients with mild symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis, and patients with mild symptoms are generally excluded from comparative studies because they would not be considered surgical candidates.

### Surgical management of spinal stenosis [^115Ph2SA]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Proper patient selection is the key to successful surgical management. The presence of the appropriate symptoms, signs and imaging findings — along with the individual psychologic and socioeconomic factors — play a significant role in the selection process. Patient education is important so that the patient's expectations from surgery are aligned with the surgeon's expectations. When the patient has been properly selected, and there has been adherence to the decision-making principles, along with meticulous surgical technique, good outcomes can be expected with surgical management of patients with spinal stenosis.

The overall objectives are
to narratively synthesise the existing evidence on exercise intervention components from randomised controlled trials that aim to improve outcomes of symptom severity, disability and walking in people with lumbar spinal stenosis and neurogenic claudication;
to tabulate the various exercise intervention components of the included trials;
to explore which exercise intervention components may be associated with a successful outcome (i.e. a significant difference in favour of exercise intervention) or unsuccessful outcome (i.e. no significant between-group difference, or significant difference in favour of non-exercise intervention).

### Is spinal stenosis better treated surgically or nonsurgically? [^1123rGkd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

For patients with clinical and radiographic lumbar spinal stenosis, is surgery or continued nonsurgical treatment a better option for improvements in baseline disability scores; and what proportion of patients treated surgically and nonsurgically get better, worse, or remain the same with time? We prospectively evaluated 125 consecutive patients for this non-randomized cohort study. Of the patients choosing surgery, 54 underwent decompression only and 42 had decompression and fusion for preexisting spondylolisthesis; twenty-nine patients declined surgery. At 2 years followup, the average improvements in Roland-Morris questionnaire score in the decompression only, decompression with fusion, and nonsurgical groups were 6.9, 6.1, and 1.2, respectively. The percentages of patients who were better, worse, or the same were similar for those who had decompression only (63.3%, 4.1%, and 32.7%, respectively) and decompression with fusion (61.5%, 2.6%, and 35.9%, respectively) but different from those treated without surgery (25.0%, 12.5%, and 62.5%, respectively). We observed no occurrences of cauda equina syndrome or severe neurologic dysfunction in any of the groups after 2 years. A majority of patients declining surgery had persistent symptoms. The majority of patients who choose surgery will be improved but will have residual symptoms and therefore should be counseled about realistic expectations.

Conclusions

The treatment of LSS is evolving and new options have been brought to clinical practice in recent years that have facilitated less invasive and potentially lower risk treatments. The judicious use of both open surgery and minimally invasive pain treatments requires careful attention to evidence, and in the lack of evidence to consensus opinion of an informed group. The MIST group has examined the peer-reviewed literature and given consensus guidance to best practices. As the literature for minimally invasive procedures for LSS continues to develop and techniques such as spinal endoscopy continue to become more widely available, the MIST group intends to include them in future editions. This process is intended to create a living document and future versions of guidance will follow as additional studies are completed.
