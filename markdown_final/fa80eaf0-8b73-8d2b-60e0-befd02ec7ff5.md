## Question

How does methotrexate work for ectopic pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how methotrexate works for ectopic pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacologic mechanism of methotrexate. Then, I should verify why that mechanism is particularly relevant to ectopic trophoblastic tissue. Next, I will review the clinical protocols and dosing regimens and how they operationalize that mechanism. After that, I need to check the expected time course of hCG decline and how we monitor response. Finally, I should consider predictors of success or failure, safety and contraindications, and fertility implications, and then synthesize a concise, clinically useful explanation.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that binds dihydrofolate reductase, interrupting purine synthesis and thymidine production, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and repair and halting rapidly dividing cells from replicating, which is precisely why it targets trophoblastic tissue in ectopic pregnancy [^117C4rFF] [^111YHbSp].

> Wait, let me verify why this matters biologically in ectopic pregnancy. Trophoblasts are among the most rapidly proliferating tissues in early gestation, so they are uniquely vulnerable to antifolate-mediated DNA synthesis blockade; methotrexate's effect is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic at these low, single-agent doses, leading to cessation of growth and eventual resorption rather than immediate destruction, which explains the need for serial hCG monitoring rather than instant resolution [^117C4rFF] [^11372QLV].

> I need to check the practical regimens next. The most common approach is single-dose intramuscular methotrexate 50 mg/m² on day 1, with hCG measured on days 4 and 7; if the day-4 to day-7 decrease is less than 15%, a second dose is given, and if hCG fails to decline appropriately after two doses, surgery is considered, which operationalizes the pharmacologic effect into a standardized protocol with built-in rescue [^115bZY3n] [^114cBQrz]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: a two-dose regimen on day 1 and day 4 can improve success in selected patients, particularly with higher initial hCG, and a fixed multidose regimen with leucovorin rescue exists but is less favored due to more adverse effects and complexity, so regimen choice should be individualized to hCG level and patient preference [^116EqEYL] [^114DyLGH] [^1167nkxK].

> Next, I should review the time course and monitoring. Let me think about this carefully: resolution of hCG typically takes 2 to 4 weeks but can extend to 8 weeks, and early transient rises in hCG can occur before decline, so weekly hCG checks until nonpregnant levels are essential to avoid premature intervention; importantly, the day-4 to day-7 decrease of at least 15% is the key decision point for retreatment, and some data suggest that an early day-0 to day-4 hCG fall can predict success earlier, though I should note that latter evidence is less robust and should be applied cautiously [^115T2a4d] [^114cBQrz] [^116Tjt8i].

> I will now examine predictors of success and failure. Higher initial hCG is consistently associated with lower success, with a marked increase in failure when hCG exceeds about 5,000 mIU/mL, and fetal cardiac activity is a strong predictor of failure; conversely, smaller mass size, absence of hemoperitoneum, and hemodynamic stability favor success, and the day-4 to day-7 hCG trajectory is the most actionable early indicator of response [^113GhQyW] [^11171aJq] [^114cBQrz]. But wait, what if the patient has a history of ectopic pregnancy? Recurrent ectopic pregnancy may respond less well to single-dose therapy, so multidose regimens should be considered in that subgroup to equalize success rates, which I should keep in mind during counseling [^114YPtgr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I should confirm adverse effects and contraindications. Common effects include gastrointestinal upset, stomatitis, and transient liver enzyme elevations, while serious complications like bone marrow suppression or pneumonitis are rare at these doses; absolute contraindications include significant renal or hepatic dysfunction, blood dyscrasias, active GI or respiratory disease, and inability to comply with follow-up, and NSAIDs should generally be avoided due to potential interaction, so careful screening and counseling are mandatory [^1125csCb] [^111EDbSk] [^113bD9kp]. I should double-check a critical pitfall: symptoms shortly after methotrexate can mimic rupture, so any new or worsening pain requires urgent evaluation to distinguish expected cramping from tubal rupture, which is why patients must have a low threshold to seek care and clinicians must maintain vigilance [^111fP9v3] [^114ndsrx].

> Next, I should review fertility implications. Let me verify the data: multiple studies and guidelines indicate methotrexate does not adversely affect ovarian reserve or subsequent fertility, and patients can be counseled accordingly; however, because methotrexate is teratogenic, patients should avoid conception for at least 3 months after treatment to allow folate repletion and drug clearance, even though the drug is cleared from serum well before that window [^114s27sh] [^117Nt5kA] [^113ustvX]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought clearance might justify a shorter interval, but given the teratogenic risk and the need to normalize folate status, the 3-month recommendation remains prudent despite serum kinetics [^115BCjaX].

> Let me synthesize this into a clinically coherent narrative. Methotrexate treats ectopic pregnancy by exploiting the rapid proliferation of trophoblastic tissue: it inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, starves cells of thymidine and purines, halts DNA synthesis, and induces growth arrest and resorption of the ectopic gestation; because this is a gradual process, success hinges on careful patient selection, appropriate regimen choice guided by hCG and clinical factors, and disciplined serial hCG monitoring with predefined retreatment thresholds, which together balance efficacy, safety, and fertility preservation [^117C4rFF] [^111F21SM] [^114cBQrz].

---

Methotrexate treats ectopic pregnancy by **inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase** [^117C4rFF], blocking DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing trophoblastic cells, which stops growth and leads to resorption [^111YHbSp]. It is given as a **single 50 mg/m² IM dose** [^115bZY3n], with a second dose if hCG does not fall by ≥ 15% from day 4 to 7 [^114cBQrz]; success is ~88–92% [^115oQHgB] and is lower with higher initial hCG or fetal cardiac activity [^11171aJq]. Methotrexate is for hemodynamically stable patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancy and no contraindications [^114psswV]; it preserves fertility [^117Nt5kA] and is less invasive than surgery, but requires close hCG monitoring [^114FJsKw] and has side effects such as nausea, stomatitis, and transient liver enzyme elevation [^111EDbSk].

---

## Mechanism of action

Methotrexate is a **folate antagonist** that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase [^117C4rFF], blocking conversion of folate to its active form and thereby halting DNA synthesis and cell division in rapidly proliferating trophoblastic tissue [^111YHbSp]. This arrests growth and leads to resorption of the ectopic gestation [^114eEGw9].

---

## Clinical protocols and administration

Methotrexate is administered via **intramuscular injection** [^115bZY3n], with several protocols:

| **Protocol** | **Dosage and administration** | **Monitoring and follow-up** |
|-|-|-|
| Single-dose | 50 mg/m² IM on day 0 [^115bZY3n] | - hCG on days 4 and 7 <br/> - Second dose if hCG decline < 15% from day 4 to 7 [^114cBQrz] |
| Two-dose | 50 mg/m² IM on days 0 and 4 [^116EqEYL] | - hCG on days 4 and 7 <br/> - Additional dose if hCG decline < 15% [^116EqEYL] |
| Multiple-dose | 1 mg/kg IM on days 1, 3, 5, 7; folinic acid rescue on days 2, 4, 6, 8 [^114DyLGH] | - hCG measured before each dose <br/> - Stop when hCG declines by ≥ 15% [^114DyLGH] |

---

The **single-dose regimen** is most commonly used due to its simplicity, lower side-effect burden, and comparable success rates [^117DkSF9].

---

## Success rates and influencing factors

Success rates vary with **patient selection and clinical factors**:

- **Overall success**: 88–92% with single-dose regimens [^116jCGW6].
- **hCG level**: Higher initial hCG (> 5,000 mIU/mL) increases failure risk [^113GhQyW].
- **Fetal cardiac activity**: Strongly predicts failure [^11171aJq].
- **Ectopic mass size**: Larger masses reduce success [^notfound].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Methotrexate is indicated for **carefully selected patients**:

- **Hemodynamic stability**: No signs of rupture or significant hemorrhage [^114psswV].
- **Unruptured ectopic pregnancy**: Confirmed on ultrasound [^notfound].
- **No contraindications**: Absolute or relative (see below) [^1125csCb].
- **Reliable follow-up**: Available for serial hCG monitoring [^114ndsrx].

---

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include **intrauterine pregnancy**, breastfeeding, immunodeficiency, active pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer disease, hepatic or renal dysfunction, blood dyscrasias, or hypersensitivity to methotrexate [^1125csCb]. Relative contraindications include **high initial hCG**, large ectopic mass, or fetal cardiac activity [^11171aJq].

---

## Side effects and complications

Methotrexate is generally well tolerated; **common side effects** include nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and transient liver enzyme elevation [^111EDbSk]. Serious complications are rare but include tubal rupture (0.5–3%) [^113DR9rB] and severe hematologic or hepatic toxicity, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [^115HVENS].

---

## Comparison with surgical management

Methotrexate offers several advantages over surgery:

- **Fertility preservation**: Tubal conservation and comparable future fertility [^117Nt5kA].
- **Less invasive**: Avoids surgery and anesthesia [^1162rqLf].
- **Cost-effective**: Lower direct costs than surgery in many settings [^116Gug46].

However, it requires **close follow-up** and has a small risk of treatment failure necessitating surgery [^114cBQrz].

---

## Post-treatment monitoring and follow-up

After methotrexate, **serial hCG measurements** are essential until levels reach nonpregnant values [^114FJsKw]. Resolution typically takes 2–4 weeks but can extend to 8 weeks [^115T2a4d]. Patients should avoid pregnancy for at least 3 months [^113ustvX] and report any abdominal pain or bleeding promptly [^113Bdxin].

---

Methotrexate is a **safe, effective, and less invasive alternative to surgery** for ectopic pregnancy, with success dependent on careful patient selection, appropriate protocol use, and close monitoring [^111F21SM].

### Single-dose methotrexate therapy for ectopic pregnancy… [^1162rqLf]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

In selected cases, a small unruptured ectopic pregnancy may be treated successfully with methotrexate. Use of single-dose methotrexate has been widely studied, but its success rate varies, leading critics to scrutinize its effectiveness, risk of side effects and associated complications. Morlock and colleagues compared the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of single-dose methotrexate with that of surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. A MEDLINE search for data from all relevant studies published between 1980 and 1998 was conducted to evaluate outcomes and costs for two first-line therapies for ectopic pregnancy: outpatient, fallopian tube–sparing laparoscopy and up to two doses of methotrexate. Decision-analysis models were constructed to estimate outcomes and costs for each treatment scenario. The primary outcome was resolution of the ectopic pregnancy. Secondary outcomes included complications and side effects, and these were classified as minor, serious or life-threatening.

Costs were attributed on the basis of protocols and costs at the authors' institution. Results from 30 patients were included in the analysis. The rate of resolution for laparoscopy averaged 91 percent, and that for methotrexate averaged 87 percent. Intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with laparoscopy averaged 2 and 9 percent, respectively. Minor complications associated with methotrexate therapy were reported by an average of 10 percent of patients, and serious complications were reported by an average of 7 percent. The cost savings per resolved unruptured ectopic pregnancy was estimated to be more than $3, 000 with methotrexate therapy. The authors conclude that single-dose methotrexate therapy is an effective and cost-saving therapy that preserves fallopian tubes in small, unruptured ectopic pregnancies.

### Methotrexate vs. salpingostomy for ectopic pregnancy… [^114zpXEE]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

In recent years, intramuscular methotrexate has gained attention as an alternative to sal-pingostomy for management of ectopic pregnancy. In addition, there is also interest in using serum human chorionic gonadotropin or progesterone levels to monitor resolution of ectopic pregnancy after intervention. Saraj and associates compared methotrexate and salpingostomy in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy and evaluated the role of serum hCG and progesterone levels as markers for resolution. Progesterone and hCG levels were determined at baseline, on days 4 and 7 after treatment, and weekly thereafter until the hCG level fell to less than 15 mIU per mL and the progesterone level declined to less than 1. 5 ng per mL. A second methotrexate injection was administered if the hCG level on day 7 had not decreased by 15 percent from the level on day 4. Six of the 38 patients required a repeat injection.

Serum hCG levels in patients receiving methotrexate decreased to less than 15 mIU per mL in 27. 2 ±
2. 3 days, compared with 20. 2 ±
2. 7 days in patients undergoing salpingostomy. Initially, hCG levels increased from 3, 162 ± 772 mIU per mL at baseline to 3, 547 ± 808 mIU per mL four days after methotrexate injection. In both treatment groups, serum progesterone levels decreased more rapidly than the hCG levels. They returned to less than 1. 5 ng per mL in
17. 6 ± 2. 2 days in the methotrexate group and in
7. 8 ± 1. 7 days in the surgery group. Unlike serum hCG levels, serum progesterone levels did not show an increase on the fourth day after treatment. The authors conclude that a single dose of intramuscular methotrexate is comparable to laparoscopic salpingostomy for the treatment of a small, unruptured ectopic pregnancy.

That serum progesterone levels resolved faster than serum hCG levels suggests that serum progesterone may be a better marker for monitoring resolution of ectopic pregnancy.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of single-dose and non-single-dose methotrexate protocols in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy [^114ucAUQ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

It remains unclear which methotrexate protocol for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy has a higher success rate or a higher adverse effect rate.

Objective

To compare the treatment success rates and adverse effect rates of single-dose and non-single-dose (two-dose and multi-dose) methotrexate protocols in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

Search Strategy

Various databases including Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched on July 1, 2017, using search terms including "methotrexate" and "pregnancy".

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing different methotrexate protocols for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to compare treatment success rates and adverse effect rates.

Main Results

The single-dose and non-single-dose protocols had similar success rates (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96–1.04; 11 trials, 1121 patients, I² = 18%). The non-single-dose protocols had a higher adverse effect rate than did the single-dose protocol (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59–0.91; nine trials, 934 patients, I² = 0%).

Conclusions

The single-dose methotrexate protocol was the optimal protocol for the medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^114zaSbZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The clear message from this study is that it is the cost of treatment failure and subsequent surgery that makes methotrexate less cost-effective in women with hCG concentrations of > 1500 IU/L. This finding is still the same after over 10 years of increasing experience and more standardised treatment. This means that, rather than minor monitoring or follow-up changes, there are two important areas for research to improve the cost-effectiveness of medical management of ectopic pregnancy. The first is the identification of clinical features or biomarkers predictive of methotrexate success and the second is the use of additional medical treatments or novel adjuncts that reduce treatment failures.

### Methotrexate treatment in cases of ectopic pregnancy… [^114ELiYL]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Study Description Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of methotrexate treatment in women with ectopic pregnancy who belong to a group for whom this treatment is relatively contraindicated. Background: Methotrexate is a medication commonly used in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. However, in certain conditions
- such as kidney or liver dysfunction
- methotrexate use may carry increased risks. These situations are known as relative contraindications. This study will retrospectively examine treatment outcomes in this specific patient population.

Purpose of the Study The aim of this study is to retrospectively examine the clinical data of patients who were treated with methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy at a training and research hospital between 2019 and 2024, in order to evaluate treatment response rates and the factors affecting treatment success. In particular, by analyzing the effectiveness of methotrexate therapy in patients with relative contraindications, the rate of transition to surgical intervention, and complications arising during treatment, the study aims to more clearly determine the suitability of medical treatment for this patient group. The hypothesis of the research is that methotrexate treatment may be effective and safe in ectopic pregnancy cases that meet appropriate criteria, even in the presence of relative contraindications.

In addition, certain clinical and laboratory parameters-such as initial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels, mass size, and the presence of fluid in the recto uterine pouch -are anticipated to play a significant role in predicting treatment success. β-hCG), ultrasound findings including the identified ectopic focus and the presence of free fluid in the recto uterine pouch, treatment duration, length of hospital stay, need for surgical intervention, time taken for β-hCG levels to become negative, and pre- and postoperative β-hCG levels in surgical cases. Response to methotrexate treatment will be defined as observing the expected decline in β-hCG levels over time and the completion of the process without the need for surgical intervention. Characteristics of patients who did not respond to treatment and required surgery will be analyzed separately to identify potential predictors of treatment failure.

Data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, and in addition to descriptive statistics, significance tests will be applied to evaluate the relationship between various parameters and treatment success.

### A cautionary tale: fatal outcome of methotrexate therapy given for management of ectopic pregnancy [^115HVENS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Medical therapy with methotrexate is a standard practice for the commonly encountered problem of ectopic pregnancy. Methotrexate is excreted predominantly by the kidney and should be used with extreme caution in renal insufficiency. All physicians who administer methotrexate must understand its mechanism of action, distribution, and elimination to minimize potential risks to the patient.

Case

A young, dialysis-dependent woman received a standard dose of methotrexate for an ectopic pregnancy. Prolonged methotrexate exposure resulted. The consequences-pancytopenia, desquamation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and profound bowel ischemia-ultimately led to her death.

Conclusion

Methotrexate, even at extremely low doses, can be fatal in patients with renal insufficiency. Alternative means of therapy should be sought for women with ectopic pregnancy and renal failure.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193 summary: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^117C4rFF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tubal ectopic pregnancy — methotrexate mechanism and alternatives: Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that binds to the catalytic site of dihydrofolate reductase, which interrupts the synthesis of purine nucleotides and the amino acids serine and methionine, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and repair and cell replication. Systemic methotrexate has been used to treat gestational trophoblastic disease since 1956 and was first used to treat ectopic pregnancy in 1982. There are no recommended alternative medical treatment strategies for ectopic pregnancy beyond intramuscular methotrexate, and although oral methotrexate therapy for ectopic pregnancy has been studied, the outcomes data are sparse and indicate that benefits are limited.

### Use of methotrexate in gynecologic and obstetric practice: what the radiologist needs to know [^11372QLV]. Radiographics (2021). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is the primary pharmaceutical agent that is used for management of disorders arising from trophoblastic tissue. Its widespread international use is mostly attributable to its noninvasive, safe, and effective characteristics as a treatment option for ectopic pregnancy (EP) and gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), with the large added benefit of fertility preservation. Although the effects of MTX usage are well documented in the gynecologic and obstetric literature, there is a scarcity of radiologic literature on the subject. Depending on the type of EP, the route of MTX administration and dosage may vary. US plays an essential role in the diagnosis and differentiation of various types of EPs, pregnancy-related complications, and complications related to MTX therapy, as well as the assessment of eligibility criteria for MTX usage. A knowledge of expected imaging findings following MTX treatment, including variability in echogenicity and shape of the EP, size fluctuations, changes in vascularity and gestational sac content, and the extent of hemoperitoneum, is essential for appropriate patient management and avoidance of unnecessary invasive procedures. A recognition of sonographic findings associated with pregnancy progression and complications such as tubal or uterine rupture, severe hemorrhage, septic abortion, and development of arteriovenous communications ensures prompt patient surgical management. The authors discuss the use of MTX in the treatment of disorders arising from trophoblastic tissue (namely EP and GTD), its mechanism of action, its route of administration, and various treatment regimens. The authors also provide a focused discussion of the role of US in the detection and diagnosis of EP and GTD, the assessment of the eligibility criteria for MTX use, and the identification of the sonographic findings seen following MTX treatment, with specific emphasis on imaging findings associated with MTX treatment success and failure.

### Predictors and clinical features of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for ectopic pregnancy [^117B8SEv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, MTX therapy for ectopic pregnancy is a safe, effective and superior choice for women with ectopic pregnancies who are asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable regardless of their initial serum β-hCG levels or adnexal mass sizes. The change in the β-hCG level between day 0 and day 4 is a good predictor of the treatment outcome.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193 summary: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^114cfhMs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 193 — Level C recommendations (consensus/expert opinion) specify that the minimum diagnostic evaluation of a suspected ectopic pregnancy is a transvaginal ultrasound evaluation and confirmation of pregnancy, and serial evaluation with transvaginal ultrasonography, or serum hCG level measurement, or both, often is required to confirm the diagnosis; a woman with a pregnancy of unknown location who is clinically stable and desires to continue the pregnancy, if intrauterine, should have a repeat transvaginal ultrasound examination, or serial measurement of hCG concentration, or both, to confirm the diagnosis and guide management; medical management with methotrexate can be considered for women with confirmed or high clinical suspicion of ectopic pregnancy who are hemodynamically stable, have an unruptured mass, and have no absolute contraindications to methotrexate; after administration of methotrexate treatment, hCG levels should be serially monitored until a nonpregnancy level is reached.

### Medical treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a committee opinion [^113uUCxA]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, is an effective treatment for early unruptured ectopic pregnancy. Several treatment regimens are available. Methotrexate is more effective when used to treat ectopic pregnancies with lower human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. However, there is no consensus on a threshold value that best predicts success or failure. Methotrexate can be used to treat ectopic pregnancies that occur in cornual, cervical, and cesarean scar locations, and it does not adversely affect ovarian reserve or subsequent fertility.

### Two-dose versus single-dose methotrexate for treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a meta-analysis [^1167nkxK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the treatment success and failure rates, as well as side effects and surgery rates, between methotrexate protocols.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library searched up to July 2018.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared women with ectopic pregnancies receiving the single-dose, two-dose, or multi-dose methotrexate protocols.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Odds of treatment success, treatment failure, side effects, and surgery for tubal rupture, as well as length of follow-up until treatment success, were compared using random and fixed effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses compared treatment success in the groups with high human chorionic gonadatropin (hCG) values and a large adnexal mass, as defined by individual studies. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess risk of bias.

Results

The 2-dose protocol was associated with higher treatment success compared to the single-dose protocol (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13, 3.00). The 2-dose protocol was more successful in women with high hCG (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.53, 6.84) and in women with a large adnexal mass (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.23, 6.9). The odds of surgery for tubal rupture were lower in the 2-dose protocol (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.26, 1.63), but this was not statistically significant. The length of follow-up was 7.9 days shorter for the 2-dose protocol (95% CI, -12.2, -3.5). The odds of side effects were higher in the 2-dose protocol (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01, 2.30). Compared to the single-dose protocol, the multi-dose protocol was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in treatment failure (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.28, 1.13) and a higher chance of side effects (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.24, 3.54). The odds of surgery for tubal rupture (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.41, 6.49) and time to follow-up (OR, -1.3; 95% CI, -5.4, 2.7) were similar.

Conclusion

The 2-dose methotrexate protocol is superior to the single-dose protocol for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy in terms of treatment success and time to success. Importantly, these findings hold true in patients thought to be at a lower likelihood of responding to medical management, such as those with higher hCGs and a large adnexal mass.

### Predictors and clinical features of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for ectopic pregnancy [^112cUr7b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancy is a common acute abdominal disease in obstetrics and gynecology with a reported incidence of approximately 2% and is a common cause of maternal death, accounting for 10% of maternal deaths. In recent years, its incidence has increased due to the increase in the prevalence of pelvic inflammatory diseases and the increased use of assisted reproductive technologies. Although traditional salpingectomy is a reliable treatment approach, it involves the loss of the fallopian tubes and the risks inherent in undergoing surgery. With improvements in diagnostic technology, most ectopic pregnancies can be identified early and treated with conservative methods. Medical management not only retains the fallopian tubes but also avoids the risk of pain and high costs associated with surgery. Methotrexate (MTX) has been validated and is widely used for the conservative treatment of ectopic pregnancy. However, the protocol suggests that initial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level and the size of the adnexal mass should be below certain cutoff values; for example, in China, this treatment is recommended for hemodynamically stable patients with initial β-hCG levels less than 2000 IU/L and the adnexal mass less than 4 cm in diameter. However, the question of whether some hemodynamically stable patients who wish to avoid surgery and do not meet the above criteria can avoid surgery by undergoing conservative treatment remains unanswered. The follow-up of patients treated with MTX requires the assessment of β-hCG levels on days 0, 4, and 7 after MTX is administered at a dose of 50 mg/m². A 15% decrease in the β-hCG level from day 4 to day 7 is defined as a factor indicating initial success that can be used as a basis for follow-up treatment decisions. However, patients treated with this protocol have to experience anxiety while waiting seven days to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of treatment. It is important to predict the outcome of this treatment earlier so that we can provide patient recommendations such as surgery or the continuation of follow-up. The β-hCG level on day 4 during the course of treatment might give us some indication of the success of the treatment. These questions remain unanswered. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors predictive of therapeutic success and related factors influencing the success rate of conservative treatment.

Ectopic pregnancy — methotrexate use parameters and administration options include that the ACOG 1998 Practice Bulletin recommended methotrexate be used only in patients with an hCG level between 6,000 and 15,000 mIU/mL, recommended a single dose of methotrexate (50 mg/m²), and noted a second similar dose may be required during follow-up to increase success; some investigators have used an injection of 1 mg/kg directly into the ectopic sac, which appears to be as effective as intramuscular injections and causes fewer side effects but is more invasive; a 5-day regimen of methotrexate administered orally was not shown to be more effective than placebo; and because of potentially lethal interactions of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with methotrexate, it may be advisable for patients to avoid using these drugs concurrently with methotrexate until further research in this specific use is available.

Ectopic pregnancy medical management — studies report methotrexate dosing, allocation, and outcomes. In a clinical trial, N = 62 women were randomized to methotrexate (50 mg/m²) IM, repeated on day 7 and subsequently as needed (n = 34), or laparoscopic surgery (n = 28); of the methotrexate group, 29 (85%) had resolution without surgery, 5 (15%) required surgery, and 3 (9%) had rupture, with exclusion criteria of β-hCG level ≥ 5,000 mIU/mL or adnexal mass ≥ 3.5 cm in diameter, and resolution based on β-hCG level resolution and clinical follow-up. In another clinical trial of N = 60 women randomized to oral methotrexate (2.5 mg daily ×5) or placebo, for each treatment arm (n = 30), 23 (77%) had resolution without surgery and 7 (23%) required surgery; treatment with very low-dose methotrexate (total 12.5 mg orally) did not affect the outcome of ectopic pregnancy, with resolution based on β-hCG level resolution and serial ultrasonography. In a prospective observational series of women (N = 120) with early ectopic pregnancy (≤ 3.5 cm) treated with methotrexate (50 mg/m² IM) with possible repeat on day 7, 113 (94.1%) had resolution without surgery and 7 (5.8%) required surgery, all for rupture, with resolution based on β-hCG level resolution and clinical follow-up.

### A pragmatic and evidence-based management of ectopic pregnancy [^116HbNFe]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of ectopic pregnancy is approximately 2% of all pregnancies, and it remains the leading cause of death in early pregnancy. Over 95% of ectopic pregnancies are tubal pregnancies, and the remainders are nontubal pregnancies. The highest risk factor for ectopic pregnancy is a previous tubal pregnancy followed by previous tubal surgery, tubal sterilization, tubal pathology, and current intrauterine device use. The apparent increase in the incidence of nontubal ectopic pregnancy including heterotopic pregnancy may be attributed to the increasing number of pregnancies because of in vitro fertilization treatment. In most cases, an ectopic pregnancy can be treated medically with a single dose of methotrexate. Surgical treatment is still needed in women who are hemodynamically unstable and in those who do not fulfill the criteria for methotrexate treatment. Usually surgical treatment can be performed by laparoscopy and in some cases by hysteroscopy. Laparotomy is rarely needed even in women with intraperitoneal bleeding.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^114mhfwP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the study has some limitations. We only took into account direct UK healthcare costs. Indirect costs, such as travel expenses and time off work, are undoubtedly important. In addition, we did not analyse the costs of conservative management although we predict that the costs may not be less than successful methotrexate treatment. Furthermore, we decided to focus solely on costs in this study but it is important to acknowledge that health benefits and quality of life are also extremely relevant. For example, if women in the surgery group have a better quality of life than the methotrexate group, this may be a more cost effective option overall.

### Risk factors for methotrexate treatment failure in tubal ectopic pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study [^111VJzsU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical and research implications

Predicting and reducing the risk of MTX treatment failure in TEP patients, as well as selecting appropriate patients for MTX treatment, remains a significant challenge. Still, according to the results of this study, one-quarter of TEP patients experienced treatment failure and were converted to surgeries after MTX management. The risk of failure was increased in patients who had higher gravidity and elevated pretreatment β-hCG levels and decreased in those who received one more dose of MTX. These factors could be considered when selecting patients for MTX treatment and may necessitate more intensive monitoring or alternative therapeutic approaches.

For instance, patients with higher gravidity and elevated pretreatment β-hCG levels might benefit from closer monitoring or be considered for other alternative treatments such as surgery. Additionally, the protective effect of receiving two doses of MTX highlights the potential benefit of a two-dose or even multiple-dose regimen, which could be adopted to improve treatment outcomes. The existing clinical guidelines for MTX treatment regimens include single-dose, two-dose, and multidose protocols, with variations in MTX dosage, dosing intervals, and number of doses. In this retrospective study, the dosing intervals for patients receiving two doses were not strictly in accordance with the intervals suggested in the guidelines. This discrepancy was attributed to the dynamic nature of patient conditions in clinical practice, as well as patients' cooperation for further treatment and concerns about potential side effects, which were factors beyond control. Our findings support the consideration of individualized dosing strategies based on these patient-specific factors.

Future studies should focus on further validating the findings of this study through larger, multicenter prospective trials to enhance the generalizability of these results. Previous meta-analyses have shown varying success rates for different MTX regimens, underscoring the necessity for standardized and individualized treatment protocols. Randomized controlled trials exploring the optimal dosing regimens and intervals of MTX in TEP patients are essential to confirm the most effective strategies for minimizing treatment failure.

Additionally, it is crucial to develop predictive models that integrate multiple risk factors, including gravidity, β-hCG levels, and MTX dosing. Moreover, future research should explore the underlying mechanisms of MTX treatment failure in TEP. Such studies could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches and more targeted management strategies.

### Success of methotrexate for the management of recurrent compared with primary ectopic pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YPtgr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of intramuscular (IM) methotrexate in patients with recurrent compared with primary ectopic pregnancy.

Data Sources

Systematic searches of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were conducted in February 2025.

Methods Of Study Selection

This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. All English-language, full-text studies in which adult patients (18 years of age or older) were treated with IM methotrexate and stratified by their history of a previous ectopic pregnancy were included. Patients with at least one prior ectopic pregnancy, regardless of which fallopian tube was affected and how it was managed, were defined as having recurrent ectopic pregnancy. We excluded studies that did not report patients requiring further treatment, those in which medical management through alternative routes (other than IM) or therapies were studied, and those investigating nontubal ectopic pregnancy or heterotopic pregnancies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Two investigators independently identified studies using the eligibility criteria. The primary outcome was treatment success, characterized by the complete resolution of ectopic pregnancy without the need for further treatment. The efficacy of single-dose and multidose (comprising both two doses and fixed multidose, ie, two or more doses) IM methotrexate regimens was evaluated. Outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) and 95% CI. From 6,349 search results, 15 observational studies comprising 3,944 patients (502 recurrent, 3,442 primary ectopic pregnancy) were included. Administration of a single dose of IM methotrexate was significantly less successful in patients with recurrent compared with those with primary ectopic pregnancy (RR 0.79, 95% CI, 0.63–1.00, P = 0.050). However, there was no statistical difference in success for patients receiving multidose treatment (RR 1.14, 95% CI, 0.71–1.84, P = 0.590).

Conclusion

Current observational data suggest that patients with recurrent ectopic pregnancy should be considered for multidose IM methotrexate to achieve similar rates of success compared with primary ectopic pregnancy.

### Predictors and clinical features of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for ectopic pregnancy [^112qZfMe]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MTX treatment is safe and effective. According to the statistics in the literature, the success rate of MTX treatment varies from 65 to 95%, with a mean rate of 82%, and the fertility rate with delivery after medical treatment for ectopic pregnancy is 67–80.7%, which is not less than that after conservative and radical surgery. Meanwhile, MTX does not damage ovarian function or increase the incidence of subsequent adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes in patients. An increasing number of patients with unruptured ectopic pregnancies are seeking MTX treatment; however, it is unknown which patients will benefit the most from it. Many studies have tried to identify the factors that influence the success rate before starting treatment with MTX, such as the initial β-hCG concentration, the size of the ectopic mass and a history of previous ectopic pregnancy. Most studies found that only the initial β-hCG level might be a predictor of successful MTX therapy in patients with ectopic pregnancy. The present results were consistent with those of previous studies. The success rate of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration less than 4000 IU/L was significantly higher than that of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration greater than 4000 IU/L. The size of the ectopic mass and a history of previous ectopic pregnancy were independent of the success rate. In contrast, Natale A et al. found no significant difference in initial β-hCG levels between the successful and unsuccessful treatment groups. A retrospective analysis of ectopic pregnancy over a 10-year period published by Alison Richardson found that even when the initial β-hCG level was greater than 3000 IU/L, medical management was still safe and successful, as 85.3% of women in this subgroup avoided surgery. Our results also suggested that the success rate of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration greater than 4000 IU/L was still higher than 50%. Thus, MTX should be more readily considered as a viable treatment option for asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable women with ectopic pregnancies regardless of their initial serum β-hCG levels or adnexal mass sizes, however, they need a longer follow-up duration for repeated doses of MTX and have an increased incidence of emergency surgical intervention.

Tubal ectopic pregnancy — candidates for medical management: Medical management with methotrexate can be considered for women with a confirmed or high clinical suspicion of ectopic pregnancy who are hemodynamically stable, who have an unruptured mass, and who do not have absolute contraindications to methotrexate administration. These patients generally also are candidates for surgical management, and the decision for surgical versus medical management should be guided by the initial clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data as well as patient-informed choice; women who choose methotrexate therapy should be counseled about the importance of follow-up surveillance.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^113cGJi5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancy is a common cause of morbidity and occasional mortality in women of reproductive age. It is managed expectantly, medically (with methotrexate) or surgically. Medical management of ectopic pregnancy is generally considered to be less expensive than surgery.

Expectant management is a conservative strategy that involves careful monitoring and assessment to establish whether the ectopic pregnancy will continue to resolve without the need for intervention. This conservative approach can only be used if the patient is stable, asymptomatic, at low risk of rupture and has decreasing serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) concentrations.

Medical management of ectopic pregnancy may be offered to patients with minimal symptoms, who are haemodynamically stable, have no more than a moderate amount of intra-abdominal free fluid on ultrasound scan and have an hCG concentration < 3000 IU/L. Medical management involves the intramuscular administration of methotrexate, usually in a single dose. After receiving methotrexate, patients require close monitoring until their serum hCG drops below 5 IU/l. Around 15–20% of women receiving a single dose of methotrexate will require a repeat dose of this chemotherapeutic agent.

Surgical management is indicated if the patient is not eligible for methotrexate or has symptoms or signs of tubal rupture. This usually involves a salpingectomy but a salpingotomy can be used, particularly when there is not a healthy contralateral tube, in an attempt to preserve fertility. In the absence of acute haemodynamic compromise a laparoscopic approach is preferable to an open approach and has been shown to be considerably cheaper.

Although there have been many studies evaluating the efficacy of the above management options, there are only a small number of studies that have evaluated the cost of treating ectopic pregnancy. Studies from the USA, Canada, New Zealand and France concluded that methotrexate had the potential to lead to significant savings if used as an alternative to laparoscopic surgery. However, it has been suggested that management with methotrexate is only cheaper than laparoscopic surgery when used for the treatment of patients with serum hCG concentrations < 1500 IU/l.

We hypothesised that further clinical experience with methotrexate, and the increasing use of guideline-based protocols, has reduced the cost of medical management. Using data from a large UK teaching hospital, we examined (1) whether the cost of medical management of ectopic pregnancy remained overall less expensive than surgical management for those patients that elected for surgery (despite being eligible for methotrexate) and (2) compared the cost of medical management for women with hCG concentrations 1500–3000 IU/L against those with similar hCG concentrations that elected for surgery.

### Methotrexate in pregnancy: still many unanswered questions [^1176QP4F]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate antagonist with known teratogenicity including abortifacient effects that interfere with DNA synthesis. We want to discuss on which findings teratogenicity is based and which open questions still exist. In this context, we introduce a recent Italian study by Zanetti et al on pregnancy outcomes after therapeutic use of MTX in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

MTX is on the WHO list of essential medicines. In addition to the approved indications for the drug treatment of malignancies and inflammatory disorders, it is used for the non-surgical treatment of ectopic pregnancy and elective termination of pregnancy (TOP). The dose differs according to indication and also plays a role in teratology. Paracelsius already pointed to the fact that the 'dose makes the poison'.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^113DR9rB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate outcomes and complication rates in ectopic pregnancy — In a Class I trial, "212 women with ectopic pregnancy received intramuscular methotrexate that was repeated as needed. This trial was remarkable for the high failure rate (22.9%) and for the low observed risk of tubal rupture (0.5%)". In another Class I study of 62 women, "Among the 34 women randomized to methotrexate therapy, the treatment failure rate was 15% and the rupture rate was 0%". A Class II trial of low-dose oral therapy reported: "(12.5 mg total)… Treatment failure occurred in 23% of patients. The rupture rate was not reported". Across Class III studies, "the treatment failure rates ranged from 3% to 29%", and rupture, when reported, "occurred in 0.5% to 19% of women treated". A structured review of multiple-dose regimens found "a 7% failure rate", with "12% of patients required rehospitalization". Regarding surgical need, a Class III observational study "included 177 women with ectopic pregnancies, 29 of whom had ruptured ectopic pregnancy prior to therapy… Nineteen percent of the women with unruptured ectopic pregnancy and 38% of women with ruptured ectopic pregnancy required surgery".

### Risk factors for methotrexate treatment failure in tubal ectopic pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study [^112C3KCd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) accounts for approximately 2% of all pregnancies. Notably, up to 18% of patients who visit the emergency department with early pregnancy-related abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding are diagnosed with EP. In early pregnancy, EP is the leading cause of pregnancy-related mortality, contributing to 2.7% of such fatalities. The majority of EPs occur within the fallopian tubes, termed tubal ectopic pregnancies (TEPs). In clinical practice, prompt and appropriate treatment is essential for reducing the mortality rate associated with EP.

The management of TEP includes expectant, medical (e.g. systemic methotrexate, MTX), and surgical management. MTX is a safe, noninvasive and effective treatment option. Previous studies have shown no significant difference between radical or conservative surgeries and MTX treatment in terms of subsequent live births and recurrent EP, and MTX is more cost-effective than conservative surgical interventions are. However, MTX treatment has a failure risk ranging from 10 to 36%, which raises concerns when this therapeutic option is selected. Identifying risk factors associated with MTX treatment failure is critical to guiding clinicians in selecting the most appropriate therapy for TEP patients, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing unnecessary treatments.

While several studies have attempted to identify predictors of MTX treatment failure, the risk factors remain poorly understood, and the existing findings are often conflicting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for the failure of MTX treatment in TEP patients to aid in clinical decision-making and provide evidence for the personalized selection of MTX treatment.

### Methotrexate in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy… [^114eEGw9]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Many women with ectopic pregnancies are now being treated with methotrexate instead of conventional surgery. One or more intramuscular injections of the medication usually cause resorption or spontaneous tubal abortion of the ectopic conceptus. To date, the success of methotrexate has been thought to depend on the levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone, and the absence of blood in the peritoneal cavity. The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of 350 women with singleton ectopic pregnancies who were treated with intramuscular methotrexate at their institution. A diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was established initially through the measurement of serum hCG and progesterone levels. Women with an hCG level of less than 50, 000 mIU per mL or a serum progesterone level of less than 25 ng per mL underwent further evaluation.

Women diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy were considered candidates for treatment with intramuscular methotrexate of the women. The authors conclude that in women with an ectopic pregnancy, the level of serum hCG is the best predictor of successful treatment with intramuscular methotrexate.

However, unlike previously published studies, in this study a high success rate was found in patients with hCG levels as high as 15, 000 mIU per mL. In addition, the presence of free peritoneal fluid, which is considered by many physicians to be a contraindication to methotrexate therapy, was not associated with treatment failure in this study.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^114ndsrx]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department management of patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy — Level B recommendations state to "Arrange outpatient follow-up for patients who receive methotrexate therapy in the ED for a confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy" and to "Strongly consider ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the differential diagnosis of patients who have received methotrexate and present with concerning signs or symptoms", while "Level A recommendations. None specified". and "Level C recommendations. None specified". Although this therapy may be appropriately initiated in the emergency department (ED), "follow-up care is essential", and "Patients who develop increasing pain and/or signs of hemodynamic instability after methotrexate therapy should receive stabilizing care and prompt diagnostic studies, such as abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography, to establish or exclude the diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy".

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^112Kzd6N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Outcomes and use of resources

The patients who received methotrexate were monitored carefully to ensure complete resolution of the ectopic gestation using serial assessment of hCG levels every 4–7 days until hCG < 5 IU/L. We defined treatment failure as those women in whom the physician responsible for the care opted for surgical management after methotrexate treatment. This was either due to failure of the hCG to fall, symptoms such as significant pain or clinical features of possible tubal rupture or intraperitoneal haemorrhage.

Out of the 48 patients initially medically managed with methotrexate, 13 required surgery (27%) due to treatment failure. Eight women required additional methotrexate (16.7%). Within this group of eight women, seven received one additional dose of methotrexate, one of whom then required subsequent surgery, and one received two additional doses of methotrexate. Seven of the 48 patients medically managed had an initial serum hCG level ≥ 1500 IU/l. Methotrexate therapy failed in four of these cases (57%) resulting in inpatient admission and surgery. The patients with initial hCG concentrations < 1500 IU/l were less likely to require surgery (Fisher's exact: P < 0.05) for failed methotrexate treatment (17%). The 48 women had a total length of stay of 33 days, of which 28.6 days were due to surgery following treatment failure.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^116jCGW6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Ectopic pregnancy — methotrexate therapy outcomes and predictors are summarized as follows: Selected patients with close follow-up have been safely treated with methotrexate, with success rates ranging from 64% to 94%. In a cohort of 120 women meeting criteria including an unruptured ectopic mass less than 3.5 cm, hemodynamic stability, and absence of hemoperitoneum, treatment was successful for 94% and 3.3% required a second intramuscular injection. In another series of 50 women treated intramuscularly, the success rate was 65% with the first injection and increased to 78% with a second injection. In 315 women, overall success without surgery was 90.1%, with 82.5% requiring only 1 injection; in 350 women, overall success without surgery was 91%, with more than 1 dose given to 20% of patients. The most important factor associated with single dose methotrexate failure was an elevated hCG level greater than 10,000 mIU/mL, while increased success was observed when no fetal cardiac activity was detected; gastrointestinal side effects of methotrexate therapy are similar to symptoms of ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

### Comparison of success rates in the medical management of ectopic pregnancy with single-dose and multiple-dose administration of methotrexate: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^114C9mux]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether success rate differs in single-dose versus multiple-dose administration of methotrexate (MTX) in medical management of unruptured ectopic pregnancies.

Design

Prospective randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Patient(S)

The study population included 108 patients presenting with unruptured ectopic pregnancies who fulfilled the criteria for medical management.

Intervention(S)

A single dose (study group) or multiple doses (control group) of MTX were administered IM.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Success rate of medical management in each group.

Result(S)

Of the 54 patients on the single-dose protocol, treatment was considered successful in 48 patients (88.9%). Of the 54 patients on the multiple-dose protocol, 50 participants responded to the treatment (92.6%). The difference between success rates in the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.7; odds ratio 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.17–2.4). In the single-dose and multiple-dose groups, 15 (27.8%) and 20 (37%) patients, respectively, had complications (P = 0.3).

Conclusion(S)

The results of our study showed that single-dose treatment with MTX could be as successful as multiple doses. The incidence of complications did not differ between the two groups. It appears that single-dose treatment could be the first line of treatment in selected patients.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^112j7Tyb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is a debate about the cost-efficiency of methotrexate for the management of ectopic pregnancy (EP), especially for patients presenting with serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels of > 1500 IU/L. We hypothesised that further experience with methotrexate, and increased use of guideline-based protocols, has reduced the direct costs of management with methotrexate.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cost analysis on women treated for EP in a large UK teaching hospital to (1) investigate whether the cost of medical management is less expensive than surgical management for those patients eligible for both treatments and (2) to compare the cost of medical management for women with hCG concentrations 1500–3000 IU/L against those with similar hCG concentrations that elected for surgery. Three distinct treatment groups were identified: (1) those who had initial medical management with methotrexate, (2) those who were eligible for initial medical management but chose surgery ('elected' surgery) and (3) those who initially 'required' surgery and did not meet the eligibility criteria for methotrexate. We calculated the costs from the point of view of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. We summarised the cost per study group using the mean, standard deviation, median and range and, to account for the skewed nature of the data, we calculated 95% confidence intervals for differential costs using the nonparametric bootstrap method.

Results

Methotrexate was £1179 (CI 819–1550) per patient cheaper than surgery but there were no significant savings with methotrexate in women with hCG > 1500 IU/L due to treatment failures.

Conclusions

Our data support an ongoing unmet economic need for better medical treatments for EP with hCG > 1500 IU/L.

Single-dose versus two-dose methotrexate — A systematic review and meta-analysis of three randomized controlled trials showed similar rates of successful resolution for the two-dose and single-dose protocols (RR, 1.09; 95% CI 0.98–1.20) and comparable risk of adverse effects (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.92–1.94). In women with high initial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, one trial found a nonstatistically significant trend toward greater success for the two-dose regimen when initial hCG was greater than 5,000 mIU/mL (80.0% versus 58.8%, P = 0.279) (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.47–1.16), and a second trial showed a statistically significant higher success rate for two-dose versus single-dose when initial serum hCG was 3,600–5,500 mIU/mL (88.9% versus 57.9%, P = 0.03) (OR 5.80; 95% CI, 1.29–26.2).

### A rare drug reaction to methotrexate after treatment for ectopic pregnancy [^116AYNbk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancies are commonly diagnosed and treated in physicians' offices. In the hemodynamically stable patient, therapy often includes treatment with methotrexate. Well-known adverse effects of this drug include mucositis, abdominal cramping, and malaise. We report a case of a rare drug reaction after treatment with methotrexate.

Case

A 34-year-old, gravida 2, para 0, at 7 weeks of gestation by last menstrual period was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy and treated with methotrexate. The patient had an anaphylactoid reaction shortly after administration of methotrexate.

Conclusion

Methotrexate is a commonly used therapy for ectopic pregnancies in the outpatient setting. Practitioners should be aware of the potential adverse reactions to methotrexate.

Post-methotrexate surveillance — After methotrexate treatment, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels should be serially monitored until a nonpregnancy level is reached, with early post-treatment rises possible before progressive decline. Failure of the hCG level to decrease by at least 15% from day 4 to day 7 requires additional methotrexate administration (single-dose or two-dose regimen) or surgical intervention, and pretreatment uterine aspiration status should guide evaluation for abnormal intrauterine gestation. Ultrasound surveillance of resolution is not routinely indicated. Resolution of serum hCG is usually complete in 2–4 weeks but can take up to 8 weeks, and resolution is significantly faster after two-dose than single-dose methotrexate (25.7 ± 13.6 versus 31.9 ± 14.1 days; P > .025).

### The influence of smoking on the efficacy of a single-dose methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy [^112zauYV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) occurs in approximately 2% of all pregnancies. In selected cases of unruptured tubal pregnancy, a single dose of methotrexate (MTX) is commonly administered. The first single‐dose MTX protocol (50 mg/m²) was introduced by Stovall et al. in 1991, who reported a success rate between 96.7% and 94.2%. However, subsequent studies have shown success rates ranging from 65% to 80% for the single‐dose protocol. This decline in success rates over time might be attributed to reduced tolerance for pain among both patients and physicians, as well as advancements in, and the simplicity of, laparoscopic surgery as an alternative treatment option.

As treatment failures rise, accurately predicting success and improving case selection become increasingly critical. Recent studies on MTX treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have identified current smoking status as an independent predictor of inadequate treatment response.,

While previous studies, have examined various risk factors for MTX treatment failure, smoking status has not been recognized as one.

The current study assesses potential risk factors for failure of single‐dose MTX treatment.

### Risk factors for methotrexate treatment failure in tubal ectopic pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study [^115vyUT8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this cohort, the overall failure rate of MTX treatment was 25.3%, which aligns with previously reported success rates ranging from 10 to 36%, underscoring the need to address MTX treatment failure. This study provides valuable insights into the risk factors associated with MTX treatment failure in patients with TEP. These findings underscore the significance of gravidity, pretreatment β-hCG levels, and the number of MTX doses as predictors of treatment outcomes, which can substantially inform clinical practice.

Adverse effects of systemic methotrexate administration — Adverse effects of methotrexate usually are dependent on dose and duration; gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis are the most common after multiple doses, and vaginal spotting is expected. Abdominal pain can occur 2–3 days after administration and, absent signs of rupture or significant hemoperitoneum, usually can be managed expectantly by monitoring hemoglobin and intraperitoneal fluid with transvaginal ultrasonography. Elevation of liver enzymes is a less commonly reported adverse effect and typically resolves after discontinuation; alopecia is rare at low doses; and pneumonitis has been reported, with counseling to report fever or respiratory symptoms.

### Establishing a human chorionic gonadotropin cutoff to guide methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy: a systematic review [^113GhQyW]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Successful medical management of an ectopic pregnancy is inversely associated with initial hCG level. The purpose of this publication is to assess whether there is a level of hCG above which failure rate substantially increases.

Design

A systematic review and summary analysis was performed, including studies reporting methotrexate treatment outcomes as stratified by various hCG ranges.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patient(S)

Review of published information regarding patients treated with methotrexate.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Success and failure rate of medical management.

Result(S)

Five observational studies, including 503 women, were found that reported successes in using single-dose methotrexate stratified by initial hCG concentration. Failure rates increase with increasing hCG levels. A substantial and statistically significant increase in failure rates is seen when comparing patients who have initial hCG levels of > 5,000 mIU/mL with those who have initial levels of < 5,000 mIU/mL (odds ratio: 5.45; 95% confidence interval: 3.04, 9.78). The failure rate for women who had an initial concentration between 5,000 and 9,999 mIU/mL was significantly higher than that for those who had initial levels between 2,000 and 4,999 mIU/mL (odds ratio: 3.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 12.33).

Conclusion(S)

Results support a substantial increase in failure of medical management with single-dose methotrexate when the initial hCG is above 5,000 mIU/mL. Methotrexate should be used with caution in patients with ectopic pregnancy who present with hCG levels above this level.

### Use of "2-dose" regimen of methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancy [^115x9HcX]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and acceptability of a novel dosing regimen of methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancy.

Design

Prospective study.

Setting

Three academic medical centers.

Patient(S)

One hundred one patients with ectopic pregnancy who elected to have medical therapy.

Intervention(S)

Intramuscular methotrexate 50 mg/m² was administered on days 0 and 4; additional doses of methotrexate were given on day 7 and/or day 11 if hCG levels did not decrease by 15% during the follow-up period.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Adverse events, acceptability, and resolution of pregnancy without surgical treatment.

Result(S)

With this protocol, 87% of patients were treated successfully. Of those protocols that were considered failures, only 3% of patients experienced rupture of ectopic pregnancy. Treatment was well-tolerated; most side effects were reported as mild and transient. Ninety-one percent of the 61.5% of patients who responded to the satisfaction questionnaire reported satisfaction with this regimen.

Conclusion(S)

This "2-dose" protocol minimizes the number of injections and surveillance visits, compared with the "multiple dose" regimen, and methotrexate is administered more frequently than with the "single dose" regimen. The protocol may optimize the balance between convenience and efficacy. In a limited number of women, no safety concerns were noted with up to 4 doses of methotrexate in a 2-week period without leucovorin rescue.

### Predictors and clinical features of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for ectopic pregnancy [^116Gcg55]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancy is a major life- and fertility-threatening women's health concern. As a result of advances in examination technology, an increasing number of ectopic pregnancies can be diagnosed early and treated with medical methods instead of surgery. The aim of this study was to summarize the clinical features and identify the predictors of success of methotrexate (MTX) treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 238 ectopic pregnancies treated with MTX in the Department of Gynecology of Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital from January 2017 to December 2017.

Results

Patients were divided into two groups: the successful treatment group (n = 166) and the failed treatment group (n = 72). The overall success rate of MTX therapy for ectopic pregnancy was 69.75%. The mean initial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was significantly lower in the successful treatment group than in the failed treatment group (2538.08 IU/L versus 3533.17 IU/L, P = 0.000). The treatment success rate of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration less than 4000 IU/L was significantly higher than that of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration greater than 4000 IU/L. However, the success rate of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration greater than 4000 IU/L was still relatively high (54.55%). β-hCG levels were significantly increased on the 4th day in the failed treatment group (P = 0.000). Compared to the initial β-hCG level, the day-4 β-hCG level increased by more than 8.21%, indicating that the treatment was effective. The diagnostic sensitivity was 88.6%, the specificity was 74.5%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.863 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.805–0.920).

Conclusions

MTX therapy as a treatment option is safe and effective for asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable patients with ectopic pregnancies who are interested in conservative treatment, regardless of the serum β-hCG level or adnexal mass size. The change in the β-hCG level between the initial day and the 4th day is an effective and early predictive tool for the success of MTX therapy for ectopic pregnancy.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193 summary: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^113eJp9B]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Expectant management of diagnosed ectopic pregnancy — candidate criteria and outcomes are outlined as follows: There may be a role for expectant management in specific circumstances; candidates should be asymptomatic; should have objective evidence of resolution (generally manifested by a plateau or decrease in human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] levels); and must be counseled and willing to accept risks including tubal rupture, hemorrhage, and emergency surgery. If the initial hCG level is less than 200 mIU/mL, 88% of patients will experience spontaneous resolution, with lower rates anticipated at higher hCG levels. In a single small randomized trial of women with hCG levels less than 2,000 mIU/mL, expectant management was not associated with a statistically significant lower treatment success than single-dose methotrexate for ectopic pregnancy, with 59% versus 76%, respectively (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9–1.8).

Three distinct treatment groups were identified: (1) those who had initial medical management with methotrexate, (2) those who were eligible for initial medical management but chose surgery ('elected' surgery) and (3) those who initially 'required' surgery and did not meet the eligibility criteria for methotrexate. We calculated the costs from the point of view of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. We summarised the cost per study group using the mean, standard deviation, median and range and, to account for the skewed nature of the data, we calculated 95% confidence intervals for differential costs using the nonparametric bootstrap method.

Results

Methotrexate was £1179 (CI 819–1550) per patient cheaper than surgery but there were no significant savings with methotrexate in women with hCG > 1500IU/L due to treatment failures.

Conclusions

Our data support an ongoing unmet economic need for better medical treatments for EP with hCG > 1500IU/L.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^111qRAXu]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Ethical approval

The study was discussed with the chair of Scotland A Research Ethics Committee and we were advised that no ethical approval was required for this project because it was seen as service evaluation, not research.

Study population and data collected

We conducted a retrospective analysis on all women treated either medically or surgically for tubal ectopic pregnancy at the RIE between January 2010 and February 2011. Women managed expectantly or where the diagnosis was not clear were excluded. All women had completed their treatment at least one month prior to data collection. Management criteria and eligibility for methotrexate followed national UK guidelines and was strictly assessed as part of an Integrated Care Pathway. All women suitable for methotrexate were offered methotrexate or the possibility of laparoscopic surgery during discussion with their physician. We identified three distinct treatment groups: (1) those who had initial medical management with methotrexate, (2) those who were eligible for initial medical management but chose surgery ('elected' surgery) and (3) those who initially 'required' surgery and did not meet the eligibility criteria for methotrexate.

For each subject we recorded a comprehensive management pathway including any resources used. Any resource recorded was directly related to the treatment of ectopic pregnancy and no other condition. These data included any outpatient appointments, hospital inpatient admissions, general practice (GP) appointments, surgery, ultrasound scans, methotrexate administration, haematological investigation, biochemical investigation and microbiological investigations. Age, BMI, postcode and serum hCG concentration at diagnosis were also recorded. We calculated the postcode deprivation using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) The SIMD ranks small areas (postcodes) from most deprived – ranked 1 – to least deprived – ranked 6,505, across all of Scotland in a consistent way.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^112mAfyS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first cost-analysis comparing medical and surgical management of ectopic pregnancy performed in the UK Healthcare system. The results support the general consensus that medical management of ectopic pregnancy remains economically more viable than surgical management for those patients eligible for both treatment approaches.

Earlier analysis in other health-care settings suggested that methotrexate is more expensive than laparoscopic surgery when the initial hCG is > 1500 IU/L. Mol et al 's review from 2008 concludes that laparoscopic surgery is the most cost–effective treatment for tubal EP. However, both economic studies cited show cost savings for medical management in patients with an initial hCG < 1500 IU/L. In the large teaching hospital used for our study only 7 out of 48 patients managed medically presented with an initial serum hCG > 1500 IU/L. Although guidelines do not rule out medical management for these patients it is clear other factors and clinician judgement often lead to surgical management.

Although we hypothesised that increased experience with methotrexate and the increasing use of protocols developed from evidence-based guidelines would have reduced the costs of medical management, our findings also suggest that medical management may not be less expensive than surgery for patients with initial serum hCG concentrations between 1500 and 3000 IU/l. This is due to the occurrence of treatment failure and is in agreement with Mol et al' s 1999 metanalysis of older economic evaluations of managements for ectopic pregnancy. Although the different healthcare systems may have different costs it is likely that cost differentials are similar and that our findings are applicable to other health care settings.

One of the main strengths of our study is that we performed a comprehensive detailed retrospective analysis of all patients managed in a specified time period. There were no missing data values and all direct UK health care costs were taken into account. The cost of post-treatment complications and secondary treatment were included, making this study comprehensive and realistic in reflecting the cost to UK health services. We had similar age, BMI and deprivation index baseline characteristics for each treatment group. A further strength was that, where possible, we used national hospital-cost databases (ISD Scotland, PSSRU) allowing hospitals across the UK to relate to the findings. Any costs not sourced from these databases were calculated with advice from a health economist.

### Has increased clinical experience with methotrexate reduced the direct costs of medical management of ectopic pregnancy compared to surgery? [^117CDNrB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

The cost for successful methotrexate treatment was significantly less (n = 35; mean = £255.67 ± 251.75; median = £159.01, range = £68.88 - £1334.26) than the cost for failed methotrexate treatment where surgery is required (n = 13; mean = £2695.61 ± 605.91, median = £2503.79, range = £1983.50 - £3948.58) (Mann Whitney: U = 0, P < 0.05). It is clear when comparing elective and required surgery costs that this difference could be explained by the added cost of surgery and subsequent inpatient admission time. All three groups showed right-skewed data reflecting a small proportion of patients with notably high costs. This group of patients reflect complications with treatment or initial treatment failure and explain the large standard deviations reported, particularly within the medically managed group.

### Systemic methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancy does not affect ovarian reserve [^112DEern]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether methotrexate (MTX) compromises ovarian reserve and future reproductive outcome in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), when it is used as first-line treatment for ectopic pregnancy (EP).

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

University-affiliated private IVF unit.

Patient(S)

Twenty-five women undergoing IVF-ICSI who were treated with MTX (1 mg/kg IM) for an EP after ART.

Intervention(S)

Evaluation of reproductive outcome and serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. Serum AMH was evaluated before administering MTX and ≥ 1 week after the resolution of the EP. Reproductive outcome was evaluated by comparing subsequent IVF-ICSI cycles after EP resolution.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Serum AMH levels, cycle length, gonadotropin dose required, peak serum E(2) level, oocytes collected, and embryos obtained.

Result(S)

Serum AMH levels before MTX were not statistically significantly different from those after treatment (3.7 ± 0.3 ng/mL vs. 3.9 ± 0.3 ng/mL). Patients undergoing a subsequent cycle after systemic treatment for EP had similar cycle durations (10.3 vs. 10.8 d), gonadotropin requirements (2,775 vs. 2,630.3 IU), peak E(2) levels (1,884.3 vs. 1,523.6 pg/mL), number of oocytes retrieved (12.1 vs. 10.5), and total number of embryos obtained (7.1 vs. 6.5).

Conclusion(S)

Single-dose MTX is a safe first-treatment choice that does not compromise future reproductive outcomes in women who are diagnosed with EP after ART.

### Methotrexate in pregnancy: still many unanswered questions [^116CYBhm]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Findings teratogenicity of MTX is based on

As often, teratogenicity in humans was discovered by case reports describing a similar phenotype of malformations (MTX embryopathy), at first after failed TOP. Already in the 50th, the teratogenic effects of aminopterin, a structurally similar but more potent folate antagonist was described. In 1968, the first case of an infant with MTX-induced congenital malformations after failed attempted TOP was published. Since then, multiple similar case reports have been reported, also after misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancies. The guideline dosage for the indication of ectopic pregnancy is a single intramuscular administration of 50 mg/m².

### Are early human chorionic gonadotropin levels after methotrexate therapy a predictor of response in ectopic pregnancy? [^113KZejZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels between days 0 and 4 as a predictor of methotrexate therapy success for ectopic pregnancy.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective study that evaluated posttreatment beta-hCG levels of 30 patients with ectopic pregnancy who had been treated with single-dose methotrexate therapy.

Results

beta-hCG levels decreased between days 0 and 4 in 40.0% of cases, and 100% of these cases had treatment success. beta-hCG levels increased in 60.0% of cases, and 61.8% of these cases had treatment success. In patients with increasing beta-hCG levels on day 4, we calculated the beta-hCG "difference variable" (beta-hCG level at day 4 minus day 0). The median beta-hCG difference variable between cases of treatment success and failure were statistically significant (P = 0.035).

Conclusion

beta-hCG level changes between days 0 and 4 after methotrexate therapy have clinical significance and predictive value. Decreasing beta-hCG levels is highly predictive of treatment success. The beta-hCG difference variable is a reliable predictor of success in cases with rising beta-hCG levels after methotrexate therapy.

Cost analysis of treatment

The resource costs for each patient management group are also shown in Table 2. The mean cost per patient in the initially medically managed group was £916.49 ± 1157.70 (median = £270.00, range = £68.88 – £3948.58). In the 'elected' surgery group, the mean cost per patient was £2095.49 ± 353.01 (median = £1922.30, range = £1738.80 – £3011.59). Finally, in the 'required' surgery group the mean cost per patient was £2399.47 ± 505.10 (median = £2403.38, range = £1822.59 - £4460.59). Of those suitable for either methotrexate or surgery, methotrexate treatment was £1179 (CI 819–1550) cheaper than surgery (reflecting potential savings per patient).

Materials and methods

General data collection

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 238 patients with tubal ectopic pregnancies who requested conservative medical treatment in the Department of Gynecology of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital from January 2017 to December 2017. Ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed by means of a standard set of criteria based on clinical and sonological parameters and serial β-hCG values, including the occurrence of persistent/rising β-hCG values without intrauterine evidence of pregnancy on sonography or histological examination and an adnexal mass or extrauterine gestational sac on sonography. All eligible women who consented to receive MTX treatment for ectopic pregnancy were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows: the patient had an unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy; the patient had no embryonic cardiac activity; the patient desired to retain her future fertility or had refused surgery (especially if the β-hCG level was < 2000 IU/L or if the adnexal mass was 4 cm or less); and the patient had no contraindications for MTX therapy. The presence of minimal free fluid in the pouch of Douglas was not a contraindication for MTX therapy as long as the patient was hemodynamically stable. Women who strongly desired to retain their reproductive function could receive conservative medical treatment on the basis of informed consent regardless of the initial β-hCG level and the size of the adnexal mass.

The exclusion criteria were acute ruptured ectopic pregnancy, nontubal ectopic pregnancy, conservative treatment drug contraindications and loss to follow-up. Successful treatment was defined as a β-hCG level that was normalized, an adnexal mass that was reduced or that had disappeared on B-mode ultrasound, and symptoms of abdominal discomfort that had eased without surgical intervention. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of MTX calculated to deliver a dose of 50 mg/m². Follow-up assessments were conducted once a week until a cure was achieved. Follow-up included assessments of the patient's general physical condition and abdominal symptoms; monitoring of chemotherapy side effects; blood β-hCG measurements and ultrasound examinations if necessary to check whether the embryo sac had disappeared; assessments to determine whether pelvic free fluid was reduced; and assessments to determine whether the ectopic pregnancy lesions were reduced.

### Predictors and clinical features of methotrexate (MTX) therapy for ectopic pregnancy [^116KRa91]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ectopic pregnancy is a major life- and fertility-threatening women's health concern. As a result of advances in examination technology, an increasing number of ectopic pregnancies can be diagnosed early and treated with medical methods instead of surgery. The aim of this study was to summarize the clinical features and identify the predictors of success of methotrexate (MTX) treatment of ectopic pregnancy.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of 238 ectopic pregnancies treated with MTX in the Department of Gynecology of Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital from January 2017 to December 2017.

Results

Patients were divided into two groups: the successful treatment group (n = 166) and the failed treatment group (n = 72). The overall success rate of MTX therapy for ectopic pregnancy was 69.75%. The mean initial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was significantly lower in the successful treatment group than in the failed treatment group (2538.08IU/L versus 3533.17IU/L, P = 0.000). The treatment success rate of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration less than 4000IU/L was significantly higher than that of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration greater than 4000IU/L. However, the success rate of the group with an initial β-hCG concentration greater than 4000IU/L was still relatively high (54.55%). β-hCG levels were significantly increased on the 4th day in the failed treatment group (P = 0.000). Compared to the initial β-hCG level, the day-4 β-hCG level increased by more than 8.21%, indicating that the treatment was effective. The diagnostic sensitivity was 88.6%, the specificity was 74.5%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.863 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.805–0.920).

Conclusions

MTX therapy as a treatment option is safe and effective for asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable patients with ectopic pregnancies who are interested in conservative treatment, regardless of the serum β-hCG level or adnexal mass size. The change in the β-hCG level between the initial day and the 4th day is an effective and early predictive tool for the success of MTX therapy for ectopic pregnancy.

### Risk factors for methotrexate treatment failure in tubal ectopic pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study [^115mkup7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Results in the context of what is known

Our findings align with several published studies that have explored risk factors for MTX treatment failure in TEP (Table 3). In previous studies, sample sizes ranged from 39 to 495 cases. Notably, Bixby et al. (n = 62) and Levin et al. (n = 294) reported outcomes for single-dose MTX treatment exclusively, whereas Helvacioglu et al. (n = 50) and Cho et al. (n = 39) focused solely on outcomes for two or more doses of MTX. Other studies also varied in their MTX treatment regimens, leading to considerable variability in the reported failure rates. Our center, which is a leading tertiary referral institution in China with a high level of expertise in obstetrics and gynecology, provides a representative assessment of MTX treatment outcomes, including both single-dose and multidose regimens. The observed failure rate of 25.3% through a period of 7 years in this cohort is therefore considered indicative.

### Two adolescents with ectopic pregnancies: experience with methotrexate [^113aWwsG]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

An ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening form of pregnancy that is increasing in frequency especially in adolescents. Whenever a woman of childbearing age, including adolescents, presents with abdominal pain, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy must be considered as a possibility because if it is not diagnosed and treated expediously and appropriately, there will be considerable morbidity and mortality. Methotrexate has been shown to be effective in the management of ectopic pregnancy, but few reports are described in the literature regarding its use in teenagers. We report the cases of 2 adolescents with ectopic pregnancies who were treated successfully with methotrexate.

### Using a decline in serum hCG between days 0–4 to predict ectopic pregnancy treatment success after single-dose methotrexate: a retrospective cohort study [^116Tjt8i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We have found that a fall in serum hCG between days 0–4 after single-dose methotrexate treatment of ectopic pregnancy (where the pre-treatment serum hCG is ≤ 3000 IU/L), predicts treatment success in 85% of cases, with no further intervention required (medical or surgical).

With this measure, prognostic information is obtained three days earlier than from the current, standard clinical measure, and with comparable accuracy. This raises the possibility of altering existing methotrexate protocols, with the aim of increasing medical treatment success rates, by intervening with an earlier repeat dose where early serum hCG levels are still rising; this would, however, require further investigation.

We believe that clinical staff caring for women with ectopic pregnancies, treated with single-dose methotrexate, can confidently use a falling serum hCG between days 0–4 of treatment to provide earlier prognostic information and reassurance to patients with this potentially life-threatening condition.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193 summary: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^1125csCb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tubal ectopic pregnancy — methotrexate contraindications and hCG-related failure rates: Before administering methotrexate, it is important to reasonably exclude the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy, and Box 1 lists absolute and relative contraindications to methotrexate therapy. Methotrexate administration should be avoided in patients with clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine, liver transaminases, or bone marrow dysfunction indicated by significant anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia; it should not be given to women with blood dyscrasias or active gastrointestinal or respiratory disease, and asthma is not an exclusion to the use of methotrexate. Methotrexate is directly toxic to the hepatocytes and is cleared from the body by renal excretion; therefore, methotrexate typically is not used in women with liver or kidney disease. Relative contraindications do not serve as absolute cut-offs; a high initial hCG level is considered a relative contraindication, and systematic review evidence shows a failure rate of 14.3% or higher when pretreatment hCG levels are higher than 5,000 mIU/mL compared with a 3.7% failure rate for hCG levels less than 5,000 mIU/mL.

### The influence of smoking on the efficacy of a single-dose methotrexate treatment for ectopic pregnancy [^1152Arvw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Other studies investigating prognostic indicators of successful MTX therapy also did not include smoking status as a variable.,

Studies on MTX treatment for rheumatoid arthritis have shown that current smoking is independently associated with inadequate treatment response. This effect was dose dependent (number of cigarettes per day) and was not observed in past smokers, suggesting that smoking cessation at the start of MTX treatment improves outcomes. Smoking activates the body's natural defense mechanisms, including the ATP‐binding drug efflux transporters protein family, which might contribute to reduced drug efficacy.

The main limitation of our study is its retrospective nature. Additionally, our findings might have been influenced by intervention bias resulting from existing guidelines. We did not analyze EP size or cardiac activity as other studies have done, and we included some pregnancies with unknown location when the EP was not confirmed by ultrasound, as outlined in our department's protocol. We used single‐dose MTX protocol with the less common 1 mg/kg regimen. While the 50 mg/m² MTX regimen is more widely used, the 1 mg/kg MTX regimen is also supported by the literature.,

Although some studies did not show a significant effect of smoking on MTX treatment success for EP, the available data is limited, and research from other fields supports our findings.
