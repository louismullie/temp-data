## Question

What does high EBV igg and low igm mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what it means to have high EBV IgG and low EBV IgM results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which EBV antibodies are being measured and their typical kinetics. Then, I should verify how to interpret a pattern of high VCA IgG with low or absent VCA IgM. Next, I will consider exceptions such as early primary infection, reactivation, and immunocompromised hosts. After that, I should review assay variability and when to add EBNA IgG or avidity testing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded interpretation and next steps, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the serologic markers and their timelines. VCA IgM appears early in primary EBV infection and typically disappears within 4 to 6 weeks, whereas VCA IgG appears during the acute phase, peaks at 2 to 4 weeks, declines slightly, and then persists for life; EBNA IgG emerges 2 to 4 months after infection and also persists for life, so its presence generally indicates infection at least several months earlier [^c0360103] [^4a351cb4] [^7945733d].

> Now, I should interpret the pattern of high VCA IgG with low or absent VCA IgM. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to ensure I'm aligning this with established patterns. In immunocompetent hosts, this profile most often reflects past infection with established latency, because VCA IgG persists and VCA IgM is absent after the early window, and EBNA IgG is usually present if enough time has elapsed since primary infection [^2d2b5cfa] [^4a351cb4] [^7945733d].

> Wait, let me verify exceptions that could confound this interpretation. Early primary infection can occasionally show VCA IgG without VCA IgM if testing is done before IgM rises or if IgM is below assay detection, and in that scenario EBNA IgG would be absent, so I should check for EBNA IgG to help distinguish early primary from past infection; additionally, in immunocompromised patients, serologic responses can be blunted or atypical, so I need to consider clinical context and, when indicated, EBV DNA testing to clarify active infection or reactivation [^2d2b5cfa] [^4a351cb4] [^7945733d].

> I will now examine the role of EBNA IgG because it is pivotal here. If EBNA IgG is present, that supports past infection rather than acute primary disease, whereas if EBNA IgG is absent, I should consider either very early primary infection or, less commonly, a nonresponse to EBNA; I should double-check the timing of symptoms and, if uncertain, repeat serology in 2 to 4 weeks to document evolution, since EBNA IgG typically appears after 2 to 3 months [^2d2b5cfa] [^4a351cb4] [^7945733d].

> But wait, what if I suspect reactivation rather than primary infection. Reactivation can produce IgM in some cases, so a low or absent IgM does not absolutely exclude reactivation; in that situation, I should correlate with clinical features and, when appropriate, consider EBV DNA by PCR, recognizing that routine PCR is not recommended for immunocompetent patients with suspected mononucleosis but may be useful in immunocompromised hosts or diagnostically challenging cases [^7945733d] [^2d2b5cfa].

> Next, I should review assay variability and when to add confirmatory testing. Different commercial platforms have varying sensitivities for VCA IgM and IgG and EBNA IgG, and discordant results can occur; if the clinical picture conflicts with serology, I should consider repeating testing on a different platform, adding heterophile testing, or performing EBV IgG avidity testing to distinguish low-avidity antibodies of recent infection from high-avidity antibodies of past infection, which can be especially helpful when IgM and IgG coexist and timing is unclear [^c0ff4752] [^0814bed6] [^7945733d].

> Let me synthesize the clinical interpretation. In most immunocompetent patients, high VCA IgG with low or absent VCA IgM indicates past EBV infection with established latency; if EBNA IgG is present, that further confirms remote infection, whereas if EBNA IgG is absent, I should consider early primary infection or an atypical serologic response and repeat testing or add EBV DNA PCR if clinical suspicion remains high; in immunocompromised patients, I should maintain a lower threshold for PCR and integrate clinical findings because serologies may be unreliable [^2d2b5cfa] [^4a351cb4] [^7945733d].

> I should confirm practical next steps. If the patient is symptomatic with a mononucleosis-like illness and heterophile is negative, I should order EBV-specific serology including VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA IgG; if results are discordant or the clinical course is atypical, I should repeat serology in 2 to 4 weeks or consider EBV DNA testing in select scenarios; if the patient is asymptomatic and the pattern is high VCA IgG with low IgM and positive EBNA IgG, no further action is needed beyond routine care, as this is consistent with remote infection [^7945733d] [^2d2b5cfa] [^4a351cb4].

High EBV IgG with low EBV IgM indicates **past EBV infection** with established latency, not acute infection [^2d2b5cfa]. IgG to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) persists for life, whereas IgM to VCA appears only in acute infection and typically disappears within 4–6 weeks [^4a351cb4]. This pattern is common in adults, as over 90% have prior EBV exposure [^4a351cb4]. Low IgM with high IgG **does not indicate active infection** or reactivation; if clinical suspicion for reactivation is high, consider EBV DNA PCR or early antigen (EA) testing, but routine PCR is not recommended in immunocompetent patients [^7945733d] [^2d2b5cfa].

---

## Serological markers of EBV infection

EBV serology relies on **three main antibodies**:

| **Antibody** | **Marker of** | **Typical timeline** |
|-|-|-|
| VCA IgM | Acute infection | Appears early, disappears within 4–6 weeks [^2d2b5cfa] |
| VCA IgG | Past or recent infection | Appears in acute phase, persists for life [^2d2b5cfa] |
| EBNA IgG | Past infection | Appears 2–4 months after infection, persists for life [^2d2b5cfa] |

## Interpretation of high EBV IgG and low EBV IgM

High EBV IgG with low IgM **indicates past infection** with established latency, not acute infection [^2d2b5cfa]. IgG to VCA and EBNA persists for life, whereas IgM to VCA appears only in acute infection and typically disappears within 4–6 weeks [^4a351cb4]. This pattern is common in adults, as over 90% have prior EBV exposure [^4a351cb4]. Low IgM with high IgG **does not indicate active infection** or reactivation; if clinical suspicion for reactivation is high, consider EBV DNA PCR or early antigen (EA) testing, but routine PCR is not recommended in immunocompetent patients [^7945733d] [^2d2b5cfa].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Past infection**: The patient has had a prior EBV infection, which is common in adults [^4a351cb4].
- **Latency**: EBV remains latent in B cells, with periodic reactivation possible, especially in immunocompromised hosts [^5818f6fc].
- **Not acute**: Low IgM with high IgG does not indicate acute infection or reactivation [^2d2b5cfa].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Different commercial assays may yield discrepant results; confirmatory testing may be needed [^c0ff4752].
- **Immunocompromised hosts**: Serologic patterns may be atypical; consider PCR or EA testing if reactivation is suspected [^7945733d].
- **Clinical context**: Always interpret results alongside symptoms and clinical findings [^189d186a].

---

## Recommended follow-up and additional testing

Routine follow-up is **not required** for asymptomatic patients with high IgG and low IgM. If reactivation is suspected — particularly in immunocompromised patients — consider EBV DNA PCR or EA testing, recognizing that routine PCR is not recommended in immunocompetent patients [^7945733d] [^2d2b5cfa].

---

High EBV IgG with low IgM indicates **past infection** with established latency, not acute infection. No routine follow-up is needed unless the patient is immunocompromised or has clinical features suggesting reactivation.

### Development of a diagnostic algorithm for Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases: a retrospective observational study [^dc9f85e2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to a spectrum of diseases. To investigate the characteristics of various EBV-associated diseases in China, we conducted a multi-center retrospective cohort study examining molecular and serological features. EBV DNA copy numbers in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while four EBV-specific antibodies were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay. Our study included 746 patients with EBV-related diseases and 350 control adults without EBV-associated diseases. Among the patient group, EBV DNA was detectable in 97.7% of PBMC samples and 92.6% of plasma samples, significantly surpassing the positivity rates observed in controls (46.7% in PBMCs and 4.6% in plasma). In terms of specific diseases, EBV DNA was positive in PBMCs in almost all the patients across most disease groups, except in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (87.4%), whereas the EBV DNA positivity rates in plasma varied considerably. Most disease groups exhibited low positivity rates for viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgM and high positivity rates for EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-IgG. Contrary, infectious mononucleosis demonstrated a high seropositivity rate (94.2%) for VCA-IgM but a low rate (0.8%) for EBNA-IgG. EBV DNA in plasma effectively distinguishes patients with EBV-associated diseases from control subjects, and incorporating PBMC EBV DNA further enhances diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, our findings delineate distinct patterns of EBV DNA presence, levels, and antibody responses across various EBV-associated diseases. We recommend that plasma EBV DNA testing be employed as the first-line diagnostic approach for high-risk individuals, with subsequent PBMC EBV testing conducted for those exhibiting negative plasma results. A comprehensive evaluation of both EBV DNA and serological markers is essential for accurate identification and differential diagnosis of EBV-related disorders.

### Measurement of EBV-IgG anti-VCA avidity aids the early and reliable diagnosis of primary EBV infection [^0814bed6]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Current serological methods for the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection still differentiate poorly between primary infection and reactivation. This is particularly true when IgG and IgM antibodies are present simultaneously and only a single serum sample is provided for analysis. The demonstration of the IgG avidity state has the potential to distinguish recent from past or reactivated infection. An analysis of the kinetics of avidity maturation of anti-VCA antibodies in primary EBV infection was undertaken with longitudinally collected sets of sera from 28 well-characterised EBV cases and in sera from 35 cases with previous EBV infection and recent primary infection due to HIV, CMV, or hepatitis A. Antibodies directed against the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) were sought, using a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA). In parallel with standard IgG anti-VCA detection, serum was incubated with 8 M urea to disrupt low-avidity complexes to allow calculation of the percentage avidity. In cases with primary EBV infection, the mean avidity rose from 54% at 6 weeks to 82% by 28 weeks after the onset of symptoms, but remained lower than that of the control sera (96%). The addition of the avidity measurement improved the sensitivity of IgG and IgM anti-VCA testing in diagnosis of primary EBV infection from 93% to 100%. The specificity of IgM anti-VCA testing alone was poor, with 14 of 35 cases (49%) demonstrating false-positive results, but it improved to 97% by the demonstration of high-avidity IgG anti-VCA. The combination of negative IgG anti-EBNA and low-avidity IgG anti-VCA had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The routine addition of IgG anti-VCA avidity estimation to diagnostic EBV serology is recommended.

### Association of clinical and serological parameters of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with Epstein-Barr virus antibody profile [^eb966537]. Journal of Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr viral infection is one of the known environmental factors involved in development of Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE). Though not much is known about the exact role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in SLE pathogenesis, the theory of switching of lytic and lysogenic cycles of EBV in memory B cells fits well with the periods of waning disease activity and intermittent flares in SLE patients. In this study, we investigate the association of EBV antibody profile with clinical and serological parameters in SLE. Eighty-seven clinically diagnosed SLE patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria and fifty healthy individuals were enrolled in this case control study. Anti-VCA IgM, anti-VCA IgG, and anti-EBNA IgG were detected by ELISA technique. Antibodies concentrations between two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney whereas the difference in categorical data was compared using Chi-square considering statistical significance at P < 0.05. This study demonstrated a significant increase in EBV VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM, and EBNA-IgG antibodies levels of SLE patients when compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05). High seroprevalence was seen in both the study groups for EBV VCA-IgG and EBNA-IgG antibodies when compared to VCA-IgM antibodies. A significant increase was noted in the anti-VCA-IgG levels with dsDNA autoantibody positivity (P < 0.05). Though there was no significant association between EBV antibody profile and clinical manifestations, 100% seropositivity for anti-VCA-IgG was seen in SLE patients with renal manifestations. Association of anti-VCA IgG levels with presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies suggests a possible role of EBV as an environmental trigger in pathogenesis of SLE.

### Mononucleosis and athletic participation: an evidence-based subject review [^6bd30e9c]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–specific serology — timing and diagnostic accuracy: VCA IgM appears early in infection and disappears at the 4–6-week mark; antibody to early antigen is usually short-lived, peaking at 3–4 weeks after onset; VCA IgG peaks at 2–4 weeks and persists for life; and EBNA antibody generally appears only after 2–4 months and also persists for life. VCA IgM and IgG antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis (sensitivity 97%, specificity 94%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 16.5 versus 9.7–28 for a positive heterophile test; when VCA IgM and IgG are negative, the negative likelihood ratio is 0.03 versus 0.14 to 0.18 for heterophile antibody tests. Because EBNA appears late and persists for life, its presence in the course of acute illness should lead one to consider diagnoses other than EBV.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^7945733d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) — heterophile antibody kinetics and serologic diagnosis in immunocompetent mononucleosis are outlined as follows: Heterophile antibodies usually become detectable 6–10 days following symptom onset, increase through the second or third week of the illness, and thereafter gradually decline over a year or longer; false negative results occur in approximately 10% and are especially common in children younger than 4 years. When rapid Monospot or heterophile testing is negative, additional laboratory tests may be considered, and EBV-specific antibody testing for IgG- and IgM-class antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) is recommended. VCA IgM (with or without VCA IgG) with absent EBNA IgG suggests recent primary infection, whereas anti-EBNA IgG indicates infection that occurred at least 6–12 weeks prior; EBNA IgG generally develops 2–3 months after primary infection and is detectable for life. Over 90% of adults have IgG-class antibodies to VCA and EBNA, but approximately 5%–10% of infected patients fail to develop antibodies to EBNA. Nucleic acid amplification tests, either qualitative or quantitative, are not recommended for routine diagnosis of EBV-associated disease in the immunocompetent patient.

### Comparison of elecsys and liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^b7670a4e]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study showed the similar performance of the Elecsys and the Liaison assays to determine EBV serological status. The Elecsys assay showed an excellent sensitivity for the determination of VCA IgG and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay. Nevertheless, the lack of sensitivity of the Liaison VCA and EBNA IgG markers is in most cases without clinical significance in a context of organ donation if the two markers are concomitantly performed. The Liaison VCA IgM marker was the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of early primary infection. In case of a suspected IM, serology follow‐up or further EBV testing should be carried out to avoid a false‐negative result of the VCA IgM marker at an early stage of infection. Given the differences in the performance of each single EBV marker in a given commercial assay, the use of more than one automated assay or further diagnostic approaches could be useful to resolve certain difficult profiles.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early-antigen serologic testing in conjunction with peripheral blood EBV DNA load as a marker for risk of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease [^e01ce772]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early-antigen (EA) serologic profile was examined in conjunction with peripheral blood EBV DNA load, to assess its value in evaluating the risk of developing posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The cohort included 26 pediatric recipients of solid-organ transplants, 6 of whom developed PTLD. All 6 patients had high peripheral blood EBV DNA loads. Of the remaining 20 patients who did not develop PTLD, 14 had high EBV DNA loads, and 6 had low EBV DNA loads. None of the patients who developed PTLD had significant EA immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers. However, all 14 patients with high EBV DNA loads and without PTLD had high EA IgG titers, either at the time of initial high EBV DNA load or during the ensuing weeks. Here, we report that EBV DNA load analysis, combined with EA serologic analysis, is a potentially useful prognostic marker for evaluating the risk of developing PTLD.

### Host virus and pneumococcus-specific immune responses in high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: implications for disease progression [^e1247fd3]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Despite a progressive reduction of (total) soluble Ig plasma levels from MBL to advanced CLL, similar levels of CMV-specific IgM and IgG, VCA-EBV-specific IgM and influenza-specific IgM and IgG were found among the five groups analyzed (i.e. healthy donors, MBL lo, MBL hi, early CLL and advanced stage CLL). Indeed, VCA-EBV-specific IgG levels were even increased in CLL patients versus healthy subjects. Furthermore, when the ratio between each of these Ab levels and the total plasma levels of the corresponding Ig isotype (IgM or IgG) were considered, progressively greater fractions of the above referred antigen-specific antibodies per-isotype were found from MBL hi to stage A and stage B/C CLL patients, respectively. Our findings on the antibody levels against CMV confirm previous results on CLL reported by Vanura et al. who also showed that, despite progressive decay of total IgM and IgG subclasses, the CMV-specific immune response may be preserved even in CLL cases with advanced disease. Here, we confirm and extend on these findings by showing for the first time that: i) this behavior is already detectable at the MBL hi stage; and ii) it is also common to other antibody responses against EBV and the influenza virus in non-vaccinated individuals, despite the mechanisms by which influenza infects cells are completely different from those of CMV and EBV. – As mentioned above, we did observe decreased titers of EBV-specific IgG levels in both MBL hi and CLL; interestingly, this was restricted to the antibody response against the EBNA-EBV antigen, but not the VCA-EBV antigen. The EBNA-EBV protein is located in the nucleus of infected host cells and it acts as a transcription factor for the virus, allowing for its replication inside the cell; in contrast, the VCA-EBV protein is a structural component of the capside of the virus. Therefore, the (humoral) immune response against the VCA-antigen might only occur if infected cells are lysed and active viral replications occurs. Therefore, our results suggest that like CMV, EBV probably undergoes a mild (undetectable) reactivation, whenever an immunodeficiency state has been acquired, but fully bloomed EBV and CMV infections can still be controlled, as reflected by the preserved production of specific antibodies against both viruses in MBL hi and CLL patientsand the detection of quantifiable EBV DNA in plasma of CLL cases but not MBL. Long-term monitoring of virus-specific Ig plasma levels in CLL versus MBL versus healthy donors is required to validate this hypothesis.

### Serological cross reactivity to CMV and EBV causes problems in the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E virus infection [^cd78f641]. Journal of Medical Virology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an important public health concern as a major cause of enterically-transmitted hepatitis worldwide. The detectable window of viraemia is narrow, and HEV IgM and IgG rise simultaneously in acute infection. Furthermore, previous investigators have shown HEV IgM false positive reactions occur against EBV, CMV and potentially hepatitis A. A retrospective analysis of HEV serology testing was performed at a London tertiary referral hospital over a 3-year period. A thousand four hundred and twenty three serum samples were tested for HEV serology, with 33 samples HEV IgM positive and 28 HEV IgM equivocal. One hundred and eleven samples were HEV IgG positive but IgM negative suggesting past infection. No patients with HEV IgM positivity had false positive reactions against hepatitis A. A high degree of EBV and CMV cross reactivity was noted, with 33.3% and 24.2% of HEV IgM positive samples also testing positive for EBV and CMV IgM, respectively. HEV RNA was detected in four HEV IgM positive samples, indicating true positivity, although three demonstrated cross reactivity against EBV. Only 13.3% of samples with positive HEV IgM were HEV PCR positive, highlighting a low positive predictive value of serology testing. Overall a high level of HEV, EBV and CMV IgM cross reactivity was demonstrated, indicating that serology is unreliable in the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis. It is concluded that that the diagnosis of viral hepatitis should be based on clinical features, raised transaminases, serology, and confirmatory PCR testing.

### A systematic study of Epstein-Barr virus serologic assays following acute infection [^29270052]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the presence of IgG and IgM antibody to viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM) and IgG antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during the acute illness and at 1, 2, 6, and 48 months in a prospective population-based case series of 95 persons with an acute illness serologically confirmed as Epstein-Barr virus infection. The acute illness was characterized by the presence of VCA-IgG and VCA-IgM (by ELISA) and by the absence of EBNA in most, but not all, patients. During follow-up, VCA-IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients, while the proportion with VCA-IgM declined and the number with detectable EBNA antibodies steadily increased. The primary differences between the 2 serologic test methods were the increased persistence of VCA-IgM during follow-up by ELISA and the earlier detection of EBNA by IFA. Clinicians should consider the illness stage and the laboratory technique to appropriately interpret serologic test results in suspected cases of mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.

### Elevated antinuclear antibodies and altered anti-epstein-barr virus immune responses [^e46ea250]. Virus Research (2015). Low credibility.

It has been shown that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is able to alter the immune response towards self-antigens and may enhance risk of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in genetically predisposed individuals. In this study, we evaluated the specific antibody immune response against EBV in patients with anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) in comparison with ANA-negative healthy controls. For this purpose, 92 patients with an high anti-ANA reactivity with or without concomitant extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) or double stranded DNA (dsDNA) positivity were selected and compared with 146 healthy donors. We found that anti-EBV-VCA and EA IgG concentrations were significantly higher in ANA-positive patients in comparison to the controls (VCA P < 0.0001 and EA P < 0,03) as well as in those ANA-positive patients that showed a concomitant ENA positivity (P = 0.0002). Interestingly, elevated anti-EBNA-1 IgG was found in a group of patients who had anti SSA/Ro antibodies. Anti-VCA IgM Abs were more frequently found in those patients with a very high titer of ANA (P = 0.06); moreover detection of anti-VCA IgM/IgG in absence of anti-EBNA-1 IgG was more frequent in the patient than in the control group. Both these conditions correlate with a recent EBV infection or reactivation. The data suggest that EBV, particularly during acute infection or in its reactivation phase, could be involved in the ANA and ENA autoantibody formation.

### Reduced response to Epstein-Barr virus antigens by T-cells in systemic lupus erythematosus patients [^acf37713]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The current results on reduced number of functional EBV-specific T-cells in the circulation cannot directly clarify whether EBV-specific T-cells in SLE patients are more locally present in sites of inflammation typical of SLE, including the skin and joints, and perhaps also are located at lymph nodes and secondary lymphoid organs. However, we believe that this would be reflected by the circulating T-cell population.

In order to control and maintain EBV in its latent stage and keep it from reactivation, cell-mediated immunity is fundamental. Thus, the fewer functional EBV-specific T-cells found in SLE patients possibly imply a poor control of EBV infection in the SLE patients.

The higher percentages of SLE patients positive for EBV directed antibodies, especially to the lytic cycle antigen EBV-EA/D compared with HCs, furthermore suggest poor control of EBV and indicate recent reactivations of EBV in the SLE patients, as EBV-EA/D is one of the first antigens expressed by EBV in the initiation of lytic cycle. Thus, an antibody response to EBV-EA/D with production of both IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies possibly suggest a more disseminated EBV infection, with both infected B-cells and epithelial cells in lytic cycle. However, elevated concentrations of total immunoglobulins are sometimes observed in SLE patients, which could be an influential factor in the increased EBV antibody levels. Still, we do not believe that this issue can fully explain the elevated EBV antibodies in SLE patients.

### Prevalence of primary versus reactivated Epstein-Barr virus infection in patients with VCA IgG-, VCA IgM-and EBNA-1-antibodies and suspected infectious mononucleosis [^c0c4515b]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, IgG- and IgM-antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and IgG-antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) can occur simultaneously both in late primary infection and during subclinical viral reactivation in immunocompetent persons, and the differential diagnosis is of importance.

Objectives

To study the prevalence of primary infection and serological reactivation in patients with suspected primary EBV infection and with all three parameters present.

Study Design

Fifty serum samples from 43 consecutive patients referred for suspected infectious mononucleosis and positive for VCA IgG-, VCA IgM- and EBNA-1-antibodies by EIA, were tested for IgG-antibody avidity with an EBV IgG immunoblot. Sera were also tested for heterophile antibodies (HA). To verify the presence of IgM-antibodies an EBV IgM immunoblot was performed when high-avidity IgG-antibodies were found.

Results and Conclusions

Of 43 patients with suspected primary EBV infection and VCA IgG-, VCA IgM- and EBNA-1-antibodies present, only 18 patients (42%) had a late primary infection. Twenty-one patients (49%) had high-avidity IgG-antibodies, indicating an IgM response due to reactivation, thus suggesting other causes for their symptoms. In 10 of these 21 patients the presence of IgM-antibodies was confirmed by immunoblot, indicating reactivation as a cause of IgM-antibodies in at least 23% of the 43 patients studied. Of 18 patients with primary infection, HA were detected in 16 (94%) of 17 patients tested. Only one (5%) of the patients with high-avidity antibodies had HA. Absence of HA in patients with this serological pattern is therefore a good indicator of reactivation, and conversely, the presence of HA is a good indicator of primary infection. In HA negative patients, avidity testing could be used for differential diagnosis.

### Seroepidemiology of EBV and interpretation of the "isolated VCA igG" pattern [^97ad89d7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of VCA IgG in the absence of VCA IgM and EBNA-1 IgG antibodies makes classifying EBV infection more difficult as this serological picture can be seen in the case of past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, or acute infections with the early disappearance or delayed onset of VCA IgM. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of this pattern in 2,422 outpatients with suspected EBV infection examined in 2005–2006, and to interpret its significance by means of immunoblotting. One hundred and seventy-seven (7.3%) of the patients were VCA IgG-positive, VCA IgM-negative and EBNA-1 IgG-negative, 15 of whom (8.5%) presented with heterophile antibodies. Analysis by age class showed that the prevalence of isolated VCA IgG ranged from 4.5% in the subjects aged 1–10 years to 9% in those aged > 60 years. Immunoblotting allowed 18.9% of the cases to be classified as acute and 81.1% as past infections, the latter being observed in about 37% of the patients aged less than 10 years and in 100% of those aged > 30 years. Therefore, in our case series, the presence of isolated VCA IgG was associated usually with past infection, particularly among adults. In children aged less than 10 years, it was associated mainly with acute infection but as past infection may be present in about one-third of such children, this possibility should not be overlooked.

### Surface immunoglobulin-deficient Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells in the peripheral blood of pediatric solid-organ transplant recipients [^41646ba1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous human herpesvirus, normally causes an asymptomatic latent infection with very low levels of circulating virus in the peripheral blood of infected individuals. However, EBV does have pathogenic potential and has been linked to several diseases, including posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), which involves very high circulating viral loads. As a consequence of immunosuppression associated with transplantation, children in particular are at risk for PTLD. Even in the absence of symptoms of PTLD, very high viral loads are often observed in these patients. EBV-infected B cells in the circulations of 16 asymptomatic pediatric solid-organ transplant recipients from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh were simultaneously characterized for their surface immunoglobulin (sIg) isotypes and EBV genome copy numbers. Patients were characterized as having high and low viral loads on the basis of their stable levels of circulating virus. Patients with high viral loads had both high- and low-copy-number cells. Cells with a high numbers of viral episomes (> 20/cell) were predominantly Ig null, and cells with low numbers of episomes were predominantly sIgM positive. Patients with low viral loads carried the vast majority of their viral load in low-copy-number cells, which were predominantly IgM positive. The very rare high-copy-number cells detected in carriers with low viral loads were also predominantly Ig-null cells. This suggests that two distinct types of B-lineage cells contribute to the viral load in transplant recipients, with cells bearing high genome copy numbers having an aberrant Ig-null cellular phenotype.

### Host virus and pneumococcus-specific immune responses in high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: implications for disease progression [^139a9257]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Overall, plasma levels of pathogen-specific IgM and IgG antibodies did not follow the pattern observed for total IgM and IgG plasma levels in the different groups of subjects analyzed (Figure 1). Thus, there was no reduction of specific IgM and IgG against CMV, EBV viral capside antigen (VCA) and influenza A and B in MBL hi and even in CLL patients versus both controls and MBL lo (Online Supplementary Figure S1). Regarding CMV-specific IgM and IgG titers and the amount of plasma IgM antibodies against VCA-EBV and the influenza virus, no significant differences were actually observed among individuals of the different groups studied (e.g. controls, MBL hi and CLL) (Online Supplementary Figure S1A, C and F). In contrast, VCA-EBV-specific IgG plasma levels were higher (P = 0.01) in CLL patients versus both controls and MBL lo cases (Online Supplementary Figure S1D). However, clear differences emerged (or they increased) when the ratio between the plasma levels of each of these pathogen-specific IgG antibodies (CMV-, VCA-EBV- and influenza-specific IgG) plasma levels and the overall amount of plasma IgG per subject/patient was considered (Figure 2). Thereby, the CMV-specific IgM/total IgM and CMV-, VCA-EBV-specific IgG/total IgG ratios were significantly higher in CLL (P ≤ 0.001), particularly in stage B/C CLL cases (P ≤ 0.02) versus healthy donors and MBLlo subjects. Likewise, the influenza-specific IgG/total IgG ratio tended to be higher (P = 0.056) for CLL patients compared to healthy donors and MBL lo cases (Figure 2). Of note, MBL hi also showed significantly higher anti-VCA-EBV-specific IgG/total IgG plasma levels than controls and MBL lo cases (Figure 2D). An exception to this general pattern was the EBNA-specific IgG plasma levels, which were found to be significantly reduced (vs. healthy donors) in both MBL hi (P = 0.01) and CLL patients (P = 0.002), particularly in stage B/C CLL (P = 0.002) (Online Supplementary Figure S1E).

### Humoral immune response to EBV in multiple sclerosis is associated with disease activity on MRI [^03755e60]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) plays a role in triggering or perpetuating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

We investigated 100 subjects (50 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 25 relapsing-remitting [RR] MS, 25 primary progressive [PP] MS) for 1) evidence of EBV reactivation and 2) disease activity as indicated by serial gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRIs over a 5-year period. EBV DNA in blood was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR and EBV serology for anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) immunoglobulin G (IgG), anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, and anti-EBV IgM. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis, analysis of variance, and logistic regression analysis.

Results

All subjects had serologic evidence of previous EBV infection, but no lytic reactivation was detected. Significant differences in EBNA-1 IgG titers were found between subgroups, highest in the RRMS cohort compared with PPMS (p < 0.001) and CIS (p < 0.001). Gd-enhancing lesions on MRI correlated with EBNA-1 IgG (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) and EBNA-1:VCA IgG ratio (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). EBNA-1 IgG also correlated with change in T2 lesion volume (r = 0.27, p = 0.044) and Expanded Disability Status Scale score (r = 0.3, p = 0.035).

Conclusions

The correlation between elevated Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and gadolinium-enhancing lesions suggests an association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity. The heightened immune response to EBV in MS is specifically related to EBNA-1 IgG, a marker of the latent phase of the virus. The lack of association between acute viral reactivation in the peripheral blood and Gd(+) lesions suggests a limited role of the former in driving disease activity.

### Time correlation between mononucleosis and initial symptoms of MS [^519c41ec]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows average age of MS onset vs average age of IM, binned in 5-year IM increments, and stratified by sex. The combined-sex plot is shown in figure e-2.1, and a plot of all 258 individual EIMS cases vs age at IM and at MS is given in figure e-2.3. Fractional case numbers for these data result from our approximation that pediatric cases missing from EIMS represent exactly 5% of total cases (258 EIMS + 13.5 pediatric). The male plot of < MS > vs < IM > is matched to linear and almost time invariant over all infection ages. The female data are noteworthy because they reflect a rapid drop in disease development time (< DMS >), starting with extreme (25.4 years) delay for early (5 years) infection, dropping down to only an 8-year delay for adult (∼25 years) infection, and indicating a uniquely severe transition through puberty for females. Statistical uncertainty in delayis shown for the most uncertain stratifications (male, figure 1, and both EBNA1, figure 2).

Figure 2
Age at MS vs average binned age of infectious mononucleosis, stratified by Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 titer level (epidemiologic investigation of MS)

Bracketed numbers indicate case number for datum. IM = infectious mononucleosis.

Figure 2 shows the average age of MS onset vs average age of IM, stratified by the EBNA1 titer level. These data could not be pediatric corrected. EIMS EBNA1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) (total) measurements significantly predated other data reported here. Consequently, a smaller sample of only 99 measurements exists, randomly distributed among our 259 cases. "High" and "low" titers refer to whether the measurement was above or below the median value measured for controls, with a high/low case number ratio of approximately 2.4:1. The "high-titer" data show a similar disease development behavior vs time of infection as seen in males. The "low-titer" disease development is similar to that seen in females. The EBNA1 blood titer level may be, like sex, primarily a genetic marker; that is, titer level variation may reflect genetic-based variation in response to EBV infection, with a high EBNA1 level suggesting a deficient immune response. However, it is also possible that the EBNA1 titer level variance reflects EBV variants.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^ea60d366]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Building on previous findings, the analysis shows that the seropositive group sustained higher, but declining, levels of NPC risk for 10 years after screening (Figure 2D), a finding attended by a decline in prediction during this period (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the risk sustained by seronegative individuals was markedly lowered in the first 2 years, but rose after 4 years to a level similar to that of both groups of study subjects combined.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^71f436ca]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Primary EBV infection in the patient on immunosuppressive therapy — management in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) focuses on holding therapy during acute infectious mononucleosis with close monitoring and serologies. Once acute infectious mononucleosis is diagnosed, one strategy is to hold immunosuppressive therapy and follow for cytopenia and hyperferritinemia at least weekly, and physicians may choose to check antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA) and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA). Immunoglobulin M (IgM) to VCA typically disappears within 4 to 6 weeks, IgG to VCA develops in the first few weeks and persists for life, and IgG to EBNA develops within 2 to 4 months and also persists for life; ideally, immunosuppression should be held until IgG VCA/EBNA is positive and the IgM to VCA is undetectable. Patients who develop cytopenia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypofibrinogenemia should be referred immediately for hospitalization and urgent evaluation for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), with present strategies including plasmapheresis, corticosteroids, etoposide, or calcineurin inhibitors; alternatively, if clinically recovered and IBD symptoms recur, EBV polymerase chain reaction can be checked and, if the copy number is low, it is reasonable to resume IBD therapy.

### Serum Epstein-Barr virus DNA load in primary Epstein-Barr virus infection [^a4ce07a2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Specific viral laboratory diagnosis of primary Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection is usually based on antibody-detection assays. During acute, lytic phase of infection, viral DNA can also be detected in serum. In the present study, the diagnostic utility of EBV DNA detection and quantitation in serum in primary EBV infection was investigated. The level of EBV DNA in the serum of 98 immunocompetent patients aged 1–47 years with symptomatic, antibody-confirmed EBV primary infection was assessed using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. The association between viral load and time after onset of disease, age and clinical and laboratory data was investigated. Quantitative PCR detected EBV DNA in 93 of 98 samples (94.9%), and the measured viral loads ranged from 3.8 × 10¹ to 6.6 × 10⁴ copies/ml. EBV DNA detection exhibited a sensitivity of 94.9% and a specificity of 97.4% for primary EBV infection. EBV DNA was always detectable until day 12 after onset of symptoms, whereas no further positive PCR results were found after a period of 22 days after onset of disease. Detection of EBV DNA also showed a clearer association with the clinical manifestation of disease than the presence of EBV specific VCA IgG antibodies of low avidity. EBV DNA load was found to correlate inversely with the time after onset of disease (P < 0.001), and higher viral load levels were detected in younger (P = 0.009) and in hospitalized patients (P = 0.038). The results indicate that real-time PCR is a reliable tool for diagnosis of primary EBV infection early in the course of disease. In addition, EBV DNA detection may serve as a useful diagnostic supplement in serologically indeterminate EBV infections.

### Transient elevation of triiodothyronine caused by triiodothyronine autoantibody associated with acute epstein-barr-virus infection [^6066c082]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

A unique 16-year old female patient presented after acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with severe primary hypothyroidism. Her thyroid test results were thyrotropin level (TSH) of 198 mU/L (normal, 0.4–4 mU/L), free thyroxine [FT(4)], 2.5 pmol/L (normal, 10–25 pmol/L), total triiodothyronine (TT(3)) > 19.5 nmol/L (normal, 1.3–2.7 nmol/L), and free triiodothyronine (FT(3)), 0.77 pmol/L (normal, 3.3–6.3 pmol/L). She had high titers of thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies. In vitro triiodothyronine (T(3))-binding measured by radioimmunoprecipitation was 86% (normal, up to 8.5%) and thyroxine (T(4))-binding 8.2% (normal, 6.4%). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) absorption, achieved by protein-G Sepharose beads, decreased TT(3) toward normal. Levothyroxine treatment normalized the low baseline FT(4) and FT(3) values, and suppressed TSH to normal. However, TT(3) remained highly elevated and returned to normal after 20 months, while T(3)binding gradually decreased. Thus, her severe hypothyroidism was masked by this unusual phenomenon. Thirty-four patients with EBV infection (15 with acute disease and 19 with previous infection) were tested for thyroid hormone levels. EBV antibodies (early antigen immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG and anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen [EBNA] IgG) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In 15 patients with acute EBV the mean TT(3) level was 2.47 ± 0.39 nmol/L (5 had TT(3) values above normal) compared to a mean TT(3) of 1.70 ± 0.53 nmol/L in 19 subjects with previous infection (p < 0.0005; only 1 had a TT(3) result above normal), with no differences in FT(4) and TSH concentrations between the two groups. Acute EBV infection may be associated with transient mild to severe TT(3) elevation as a result of assay interference by anti-T(3) autoantibodies.

### Modeling of EBV infection and antibody responses in Kenyan infants with different levels of malaria exposure shows maternal antibody decay is a major determinant of early EBV infection [^03730c11]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The combination of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and high malaria exposure are risk factors for endemic Burkitt lymphoma, and evidence suggests that infants in regions of high malaria exposure have earlier EBV infection and increased EBV reactivation. In this study we analyzed the longitudinal antibody response to EBV in Kenyan infants with different levels of malaria exposure. We found that high malaria exposure was associated with a faster decline of maternally derived immunoglobulin G antibody to both the EBV viral capsid antigen and EBV nuclear antigen, followed by a more rapid rise in antibody response to EBV antigens in children from the high-malaria-transmission region. We also observed the long-term persistence of anti-viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin M responses in children from the high-malaria region. More rapid decay of maternal antibodies was a major predictor of EBV infection outcome, because decay predicted time to EBV DNA detection, independent of high or low malaria exposure.

### Incidence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is elevated in COVID-19 patients [^cd67c60e]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

After primary EBV infection is resolved and latency is established, antibodies against the latent EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) are produced. Anti-EBNA-1 IgG antibodies are not present during the acute phase of EBV but become detectable 2–4 months after infection and persist for life. Detection of EBNA-1 IgG indicates a past infection. EBV reactivation results in expression of lytic gene products such as the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen-diffuse (EA-D). Anti-VCA IgM is detectable early in infection and reactivation but falls to undetectable levels in approximately 6 weeks. Anti-EA-D IgG also appears early after infection (3–4 weeks) and reactivation and typically falls to undetectable levels in approximately 4 months. Detection of antibodies against VCA IgM and EA-D IgG is an indicator of EBV reactivation (Fig. 1). However, diagnosing EBV reactivation on serology alone can produce different results depending on the patient's disease course and the instability of anti-EBV antibodies before the appearance of symptoms. EBV DNA is frequently detectable in plasma during early infection and reactivation. qPCR detection of EBV DNA is more sensitive than serology in terms of evaluating reactivation.

Fig. 1
Study Methodology.

This study aims to determine if COVID-19 positive patients experience increased levels of EBV reactivation compared to COVID-19 negative patients and differs from previous studies in that samples were collected at a time when the Omicron variant was the dominant strain in the area. Past reports on EBV reactivation were conducted largely before the Omicron variant emerged. Plasma samples from hospital patients determined to be COVID negative or COVID positive using PCR-based testing were studied. EBV DNA load was quantitated and serology toward EBV lytic genes were used as determinants of EBV reactivation (Fig. 1).

### Comparison of elecsys and liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^6d3d75ad]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Various versatile new automated assays for EBV serology have launched in the market and need to be analyzed by independent evaluators. To our knowledge, this study is the first independent evaluation of the Elecsys EBV immunoassay in comparison with the Liaison EBV assay. Our prospective study including 1043 patients showed substantial agreement between the Elecsys and Liaison assays, with 88% concordant serological profiles based on the results of the combination of three EBV markers.

The diagnosis of IM is based on clinical manifestations including sore throat, fever, lymphadenopathy, and asthenia, in conjunction with laboratory tests results. Serology remains the method of choice for the diagnosis of IM. In the present study, Elecsys and Liaison assays concluded in the same EBV primary infection profile for 70 sera, whereas 21 sera required further analysis because the results of one assay were suggestive of a primary infection but the other was not. These sera required complementary testing including 63 EBV analysis by Vidas assays, 18 heterophile testing, 13 immunoblot tests, 10 IFA, six PCR, and review of medical records to conclude. Among these 21 discordant results, seven sera were classified as EBV primary infection, five as seronegative, two as isolated VCA IgG, one as past infection, and six remained inconclusive. Among these seven sera newly classified as primary infection, the majority was suspect of early primary infection by the Liaison assay (n = 5) or the Vidas assay (n = 4) with detection of isolated of VCA IgM antibodies, whereas these sera were classified as seronegative (n = 5) or indeterminate (two sera with isolated VCA IgG at a low level) by the Elecsys assay. Of note, for three sera, the VCA IgM index determined by the Elecsys assay was very close to the cutoff (between 0.55 and 0.60).

### Antibody responses to Epstein-Barr virus in the preclinical period of rheumatoid arthritis suggest the presence of increased viral reactivation cycles [^a0a85237]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) demonstrate altered immune responses to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the presence and roles of EBV have not been fully explored during the pre-clinical disease period. This study was undertaken to determine if EBV infection, as evidenced by an altered anti-EBV antibody response, either plays an important role in driving the development of RA or is a result of expanded RA-related autoimmunity.

Methods

A total of 83 subjects with RA according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and 83 age-, sex-, and race-matched control subjects without RA were included in our study. We collected sera from RA subjects and matched controls during the pre-RA and post-RA diagnosis periods and tested the sera for the presence of 5 anti-EBV antibodies (anti-EBV nuclear antigen 1 IgG isotype, anti-viral capsid antigen [anti-VCA] isotypes IgG and IgA, and anti-early antigen [EA] isotypes IgG and IgA), 7 RA-related autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor measured by nephelometry [RF-Neph] as well as isotype-specific IgA-RF, IgM-RF, and IgG-RF, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibodies, including anti-CCP2, anti-CCP3, and anti-CCP3.1), 22 cytokines/chemokines, 36 individual anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, and IgG-cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies. Random forest classification, mixed modeling, and joint mixed modeling were used to determine differences in anti-EBV antibody levels between RA subjects and controls.

Results

Random forest analysis identified the presence of preclinical EBV antibodies in the serum that differentiated RA subjects from controls without RA. Specifically, IgG-EA antibody levels were higher in RA subjects (mean ± SD 0.82 ± 0.72 international standardized ratio [ISR]) compared to controls (mean ± SD 0.49 ± 0.28 ISR). In subjects with RA, elevated serum IgG-EA levels in the preclinical period before seroconversion were significantly correlated with increased serum IgM-RF levels (P = 0.007), whereas this correlation was not seen in control subjects without RA (P = 0.15). IgG-CMV antibody levels did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

Subjects whose serum IgG-EA antibody levels are elevated in the preclinical period will eventually develop RA, which suggests that EBV reactivation cycles are increased during the preclinical period of RA. A combination of RF and EBV reactivation may play an important role in the development of RA.

### Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) deficiency-clinical and molecular aspects [^1ff6be8a]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Immune Phenotype, Viral Burden and Lymphoproliferation

Common immunological features in ITK deficient patients are progressive hypogammaglobulinemia and beside global lymphopenia, a progressive loss of CD4+ T cells. Notably, we observe a declining proportion of naive CD45RA+CD4+ T cells. After gating on CD3+ T cells, NKT cells are determined as TCR Vbeta11 and TCR Valpha24 double-positive cells. As seen in other syndromes susceptible to EBV-LPD (e.g. patients with SAP, XIAP, CD27 and Coronin-1A deficiency) NKT cells are severely reduced in the peripheral blood of ITK deficient patients; hence a critical role has been postulated for NKT cells in the response to EBV infection. Patients with EBV-LPD show a rather high EBV viremia though the observed peak viral load in the eight reported patients was quite heterogeneous (10⁴–10⁸ copies/ μg DNA). As the serological phenotype at the time of manifestation differs among the patients, it is only hypothetical to predict the duration between primary infection and clinical immune dysregulation. We did not observe EBV-VCA-IgM in any ITK deficient person; though negative EBNA1-IgG in the first patient could suggest a rather short latency period. No EBV-VCA-IgG seronegative symptomatic EBV-LPD patient has been identified so far (as has been documented in SAP deficiency), leading to the assumption that EBV infection might be essential to cause immune dysregulation in particular LPD, lymphoma and autoimmunity in ITK deficiency. However, the ninth patient lacking EBV-LPD shows a seronegative EBV-VCA status, though revealing a low level of viremia (10³ copies/ μg DNA). In any case, the early detection and watchful clinical monitoring of ITK deficient patients prior to their first encounter to EBV would be highly desirable.

### HLA-E-restricted immune responses are crucial for the control of EBV infections and the prevention of PTLD [^9bf6a669]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The low-expressing HLA-E∗0101/0101 variant is overrepresented in patients with IM

To analyze the impact of HLA-E–restricted immune responses on the prevention of clinically evident IM, we first compared the prevalence of the HLA-E variants between patients with IM and EBV-seropositive persons who had, despite a past EBV infection, no history of IM. We recruited 578 patients with acute IM, 412 adolescent or adult and 166 pediatric subjects. IM was diagnosed clinically by the triad of fever, lymphadenopathy, and tonsillitis and was confirmed serologically by the detection of EBV–viral-capsid antigen (VCA)–specific IgM, in the absence of EBV–EBV nuclear antigen 1–specific IgG antibodies. In all patients with IM, EBV DNA was detected in plasma. Furthermore, we recruited 206 EBV-IgG–positive, VCA-IgM–negative healthy persons, who had a past but clinically inapparent EBV infection (asymptomatic EBV-seropositive individuals). These individuals were matched to the adolescent/adult cohort with IM in regard to age and sex (Table 1). In addition, we included a control cohort of 412 persons with unknown EBV serostatus, also matched to the adolescent/adult cohort with IM, to reflect the overall distribution of HLA-E∗0101/0103 variants in the population (control).

Table 1.
Characteristics of the study cohort

All groups were tested for their HLA-E∗0101/0103 variants. Asymptomatic EBV-seropositive individuals exhibited a significantly higher frequency of the HLA-E∗0103/0103 genotype and a lower frequency of the HLA-E∗0101 allele compared with the control (P < .0001; odds ratio [OR], 2.9; Figure 1 A-B). In contrast, the patients with IM showed a significantly higher frequency of the HLA-E∗0101/0101 genotype than the overall population (adolescent/adult IM: P < .0001; OR, 6.4 [Figure 1 C]; pediatric IM: P < .0001; OR, 5.9 [Figure 1 D]), whereas the HLA-E∗0103 allele occurred rarely in both groups with IM. Thus, the high-expressing HLA-E∗0103/0103 variant may be a protective factor against symptomatic IM.

### Antibodies as biomarkers for cancer risk: a systematic review [^a165497b]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cancer-promoting infectious agents

We identified 158 studies assessing the risk of cancer in relation to different antibodies against various infectious agents. All studies followed an observational type of study design. No clinical trials were identified. The most commonly described associations were for antibodies against Epstein–Barr Virus (n = 25), hepatitis B virus (HBV, n = 15), hepatitis C virus (HCV, n = 14), human papillomavirus (n = 29), H. pylori (n = 29), and chlamydia trachomatis (n = 6). No consistent associations were found with other infectious agents. An overview of the main findings is given in Table 3.

Table 3
Summary of results of associations between infection-related immunoglobulins with site-specific cancer risks. The strength of association is defined by the number of studies reporting on the association, the range of the hazard ratio/odds ratio/relative risks/standardized incidence ratio reported in each study, and the statistical significance.

Epstein–Barr virus

Antibodies against four major EBV antigens (viral capsid antigen (anti-VCA) IgA, IgM and IgG, early antigen (anti-EA) IgG, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA), and ZEBRA IgM) have been studied in association with the risk of various cancers. Several studies looking into the association between EBV immunoglobulins and nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) have found a positive association with all EBV antigens. For instance, a cohort study found that anti-EBNA1 neutralizing antibodies may be a sensitive biomarker for risk of NPC. This was supported by 2 other population-based studies. Moreover, a large cohort looking at anti-VCA IgA found a strong positive association with the risk of NPC. These results were also supported by two other cohort studies. Of the five studies that examined the risk of gastric cancer (GC), two epidemiological studies reported an increased risk of GC in patients with positive anti-VCA IgG. However, no significant associations were found between anti-EA antibodies and risk of GC. One case-control study with 321 cases of ovarian cancer reported a positive association with anti-EBV IgG, however, no association was found for anti-EBV IgA. No significant associations have been reported between EBV antibodies and risk of lymphoma and breast cancer.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^4c4dbe66]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

It is a special feature of NPC that patients commonly sustain high levels and a broad spectrum of serum EBV antibodies. The conditions conducive to such a state seem to be attributed not only to the regular presence of the virus in the tumour cells, but also to lymphoid stroma surrounding the tumour. This serologic feature is also observed among other NPC-like cancers, namely, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas, which have the same pathology and, like NPC, regularly harbour EBV. Earlier studies suggested that a combination of conditions required to evoke a vigorous antibody response to EBV might be met already in NPC carcinoma in situ, that is, at an early stage of disease shortly after a tumour has been initiated. This contention is generally in line with anecdotal observations that elevation of EBV antibody levels may precede NPC diagnosis by years in some individuals.

### The variability of the serological response to SARS-corona virus-2: potential resolution of ambiguity through determination of avidity (functional affinity) [^8cd03710]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

1.2 Variability of the serological response to other viral infections

The high variability of IgM and IgG responses toward SARS‐CoV‐2, as summarized in this review, is not unique for infections with this virus. High variability of IgM and IgG responses rather seems to be a regularly occurring phenomenon, though the frequency and impact of this phenomenon are often underestimated. There are a few examples of IgM preceding the IgG response in a substantial percentage of cases (as shown for hepatitis E acute infections), but many examples of parallel detectability of IgM and IgG, such as acute infections by hepatitis C, EBV (reviewed by De Pascale and Clerici) and SARS‐CoV‐1. In practice, parallel detection of IgM and IgG seems to represent the most prominent situation in routine serology of many viral systems.

Delayed IgM responses, that is, IgG occurring before IgM during acute infection, have been found for the serology of enteroviruses, HSV, measles virus, EBVand HCV.

IgM missing in a certain percentage of cases during acute infections has been reported for parvovirus B 19, HAV, EBV, Poliomyelitis virus, measles virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick‐borne encephalitis virus, rubella virus, HCV, and CMV.

Whereas missing or apparently late appearing IgM responses may have caused misdiagnosis of acute infections as past infections, the opposite problem was arising through the detection of persistently positive IgM responses for time periods of many months or even few years, as found for borrelia infection, rubella virus, EBV, Puumala virus, parvovirus B 19, HCV, and TBE virus.

### Epstein-Barr virus serology and gastric cancer incidence and survival [^b98c4808]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Cases tended to be older than controls and were more likely to be males, smokers, and HP positive (Table 1). Among all subjects, EBV VCA IgA was detectable in 2%, EA-D IgG in 14%, and EA-R IgG in 9%. VCA IgG EBNA and antibody titre levels were above the median in the controls in 37% of all subjects.

Overall, prediagnostic EBV seropositivity was not positively associated with gastric cancer in this population (Table 2). In fact, the direction and magnitude of the associations suggested that EBV seropositivity was associated with decreased risk, especially tumours originating in the gastric cardia. A restricted analysis of cases diagnosed ⩾2 years after serology strengthened the association for high VCA IgG but not EBNA.

There was no difference in survival by VCA IgG. Survival was longer among individuals with high vs low EBNA (hazard ratio (HR): 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51–0.98). This difference was found in cardia (HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.29–0.74) but not in non-cardia cancer cases (HR: 1.18, HR: 0.74–1.88) (Figure 1). Using the likelihood ratio test for multiplicative interaction, the HR for baseline EBNA seropositivity and gastric cancer varied by tumour location (P -value = 0.03). It is relevant to note, however, that the data become sparse in the tails of the survival curves, so these findings may be due to chance.

EBV-positive HLH

EBV-positive HLH includes a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from EBV-associated reactive, polyclonal LPD to monoclonal diseases. The most typical clinical presentations of HLH are fever, hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenia. According to the HLH-2004 guidelines, patients must fulfill five of the following eight criteria: (i) fever; (ii) splenomegaly; (iii) cytopenia affecting at least two of three lineages in the peripheral blood; (iv) hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia; (v) hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes; (vi) low or absent NK-cell activity; (vii) hyperferritinemia and (viii) high levels of sIL-2R.TCR gamma and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement have no clinical significance in patients with HLH. However, a high EBV-DNA load may be a risk factor for a poor outcome.

### Analysis of two laboratory tests for determination of EBV-IM in children [^85712c8d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to explore the application value of two laboratory tests in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated infectious mononucleosis (EBV-IM) in children. From January 2018 to December 2020, 166 patients with EBV-IM were included in this study. Two methods were used in the analysis. The results of both tests were compared and analyzed. The age of onset of EBV-IM is mainly distributed in the range of 0–6 years, and no difference by gender is observed. The sensitivity and specificity of EBV testing by PCR were 49.4% and 89.8%, respectively, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.714 (0.662–0.762). When using the immunofluorescence method to detect EBV antibodies, the two indices with the highest diagnostic efficacy were low-affinity EBV-CA IgG and EBV-CA IgM, and their AUC values were 0.798 (0.751–0.840) and 0.663 (0.609–0.713), respectively. When combining the two indices for testing, the AUC values of EBV-CA IgM + low-affinity EBV-CA IgG, EBV-DNA+EBV-CA IgM, and EBV-DNA+low-affinity EBV-CA IgG were 0.904 (0.867–0.933), 0.768 (0.719–0.812), and 0.963 (0.937–0.981), respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of the combined EBV-DNA+EBV-CA IgM + low-affinity EBV-CA IgG test was optimal compared with that of a single index or the combination of two indices, with an AUC of 0.999 (0.986–1.000; p < 0.05), sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 89.8%. The combined immunofluorescence and real-time PCR methods have high sensitivity and specificity and good application value in the clinical diagnosis of EBV-IM.

Characteristics and laboratory results for 24 suspected measles cases with discrepant measles-specific IgM and rRT-PCR test results, Japan*

*B19, human parvovirus B19; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CX, cross-reaction; E, equivocal; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; H, high; HHV-6, human herpesvirus 6; HHV-7, human herpesvirus 7; HPeV, human parechovirus; L, low; MCV, measles-containing vaccine; ND, not detected; RAI, relative avidity index; RI, reinfection; Unk, unknown. †IgM values indicate RU; IgG values indicate IU/L. ‡IgG avidity test results can help distinguish recent primary infection (characterized by a low RAI) from past infection (characterized by a high RAI). RAI < 40% indicated low-avidity antibodies, RAI 40%–60% equivocal, and RAI > 60% indicated high-avidity antibodies. §MCV indicates that an increased IgM titer might be influenced by vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine; CX indicates a cross-reaction of a febrile exanthematous virus infection other than the measles virus, respectively.

We measured measles-specific IgG titer and conducted measles IgG avidity testing on samples from the 24 persons with measles-specific IgM-positive and rRT-PCR­–negative results. We used results from those tests to distinguish between a recent primary infection and previous contact with either wild-type measles virus or vaccination as the cause of positive measles-specific IgM results. Among the 20 children, 16 had positive measles-specific IgG results (range 396.7 to > 5,000 IU/L). The 4 (cases 1, 2, 5, and 9) children who had negative measles-specific IgG results had their first MCV vaccination within 2 weeks before specimen collection (Table 2). Although all 4 adult cases had positive measles-specific IgG results, a 45-year-old patient (case 24) had a relatively low IgG titer (518.7 IU/L) compared with the other 3 adults (> 4,000 IU/L) who were all in their 20s (Table 2).

### Comparison of elecsys and liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^6afa0bd2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpes virus 4 (HHV‐4), infects more than 95% of adult individuals and persists over the lifetime in the infected host. Primary infection is usually asymptomatic but can cause infectious mononucleosis (IM), occurring most often in young adults.EBV is an oncogenic virus associated with epithelial cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 10% of gastric cancer cases, as well as lymphomas including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. A history of IM has been associated with an increase in the risk of EBV‐positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple sclerosis. Two recent reports supported the evidence that EBV is an etiological factor in multiple sclerosis.

EBV serology is mainly used for IM diagnosis and determination of the EBV status in the context of solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Its usefulness has also been explored in EBV‐associated malignancies, in particular in nasopharyngeal carcinoma with the anti‐EBV IgA‐specific antibody marker in combination with serum EBV DNA.EBV serology testing makes it possible to detect antibodies against different antigens produced at various stages of EBV infection such as viral capsid antigen (VCA), early antigen (EA), and EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA). In clinical practice, three markers are commonly evaluated for the serological diagnosis: anti‐VCA IgM, anti‐VCA (EA) immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti‐EBNA‐1 IgG antibodies, useful for the determination of EBV serological profiles. The results of these EBV markers are generally sufficient to conclude in a seronegative status, a primary infection, or a past infection.

### About Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) | EBV and mono… [^9053c978]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- EBV is one of the most common human viruses in the world and spreads through bodily fluids, primarily saliva.
- EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis and other illnesses.
- There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. What it is Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, is one of the most common human viruses in the world. EBV is also known as human herpesvirus 4 and is a member of the herpes virus family. Most people will get infected with EBV in their lifetime, especially in childhood, and will not have symptoms. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are not distinguishable from other mild, brief childhood illnesses. About mononucleosis. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of EBV infection can include:

- Fatigue
- Fever
- Inflamed throat
- Swollen lymph nodes in the neck
- Enlarged spleen
- Swollen liver
- Rash People who get symptoms from EBV infection, usually teenagers or adults, get better in 2 to 4 weeks.

However, some people may feel fatigued for several weeks or even months. Who is at risk After you get an EBV infection, the virus becomes latent in your body. In some cases, the virus may reactivate. This does not always cause symptoms, but people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates. Prevention There is no vaccine to protect against EBV infection. You can help protect yourself by reducing contact with people who have EBV infection. Make sure you avoid:

- Kissing
- Sharing drinks and food
- Using the same personal items that an infected person recently used. Testing and diagnosis Diagnosing EBV infection can be challenging because the symptoms are similar to other illnesses. EBV infection can be confirmed with a blood test that detects antibodies. About 9 out of 10 adults have antibodies that show that they have a current or past EBV infection. Keep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Epstein-Barr Virus.

Treatment and recovery Most people get better in 2 to 4 weeks. There is no specific treatment for EBV. However, some things can be done to help relieve symptoms such as:

- Drinking fluids to stay hydrated
- Getting plenty of rest
- Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever.

### Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis [^95bc0c27]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

This review of the considerable evidence linking Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection to risk and disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) builds on the background to the virus and its interactions with the human host available in the online supplement (see supplement, available online only). The evidence for a similarity in the geographic patterns of occurrence of MS and EBV infection (with infectious mononucleosis or EBV specific serology used as surrogate markers), when reviewed critically, is very limited. There is strong evidence however that people with MS are more likely to report a past history of infectious mononucleosis (thought to represent initial EBV infection at an older age), and higher titres of EBV specific antibodies are associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Elevated levels of the latter are apparent many years before MS onset (compared with non-MS controls) and there is a dose-response relationship between MS risk and antibody titre, with antibodies to the EBV nuclear antigen-1 particularly important. The evidence in relation to EBV DNA load in blood or CSF is conflicting, as is that in relation to T cell responses to EBV. Several hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the links between EBV and MS risk are reviewed and gaps requiring further research are identified.

### Epstein-Barr virus persistence and reactivation in neuromyelitis optica [^f642cbde]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been thought to be a key environmental factor in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of this study is to investigate the association of EBV infection with neuromyelitis optica (NMO).

Methods

We measured levels of serum antibodies against EBV antigens, including anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, anti-VCA IgG, anti-early antigen (EA) IgM, anti-EA IgG and anti-EBV nuclear antigen-1 IgG, in 50 patients with NMO (including 12 partial form with antiaquaporin 4 antibodies), 51 patients with MS, and 52 healthy controls, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibodies in 37 patients with NMO and 33 patients with MS with ELISA.

Result

Compared with patients with MS and normal participants, patients with NMO more frequently had serum anti-EA IgG antibodies (52%), indicating more active viral replication than patients with MS (26%) and controls (25%). The antibody titres were significantly higher in the NMO group than in the MS (p = 0.005) and control (p = 0.005) groups. The CSF antibody titres were also higher in patients with NMO than in those with MS (p = 0.03).

Conclusions

Our results raise the hypothesis that persistent, active EBV replication is present in NMO, and may contribute to the immunological alterations that play a pathogenetic role in the disorder.

### Evaluation of the abbot architect (™) Epstein-Barr virus viral capsid antigen IgM, viral capsid antigen IgG and nuclear antigen IgG assays in a pediatric and adult population [^425b410b]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The detection of antibodies against Epstein-Barr viral capsid (VCA) and nuclear (EBNA) antigens is routinely performed with different commercially available immunoassays.

Objectives

In this study, we evaluated the concordance and performance of the Architect(™) chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassays (CMIAs) using Captia(™) enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for VCA IgM, and standard immunofluorescence (IF) assays for VCA IgG and EBNA IgG as comparative techniques.

Study Design

Sera were selected from a heterogeneous population including pediatric and adult patients.

Results

Concordance between CMIAs and comparative assays was high with total agreement percentages of 84,1% (95% CI: 77.8–88.9) for VCA IgM, 90,6% (95% CI: 84.2–94.7) for EBNA IgG and 98,0% (95% CI: 93.9–99.6) for VCA IgG. Moreover, kappa statistic values showed good to excellent correlation with values of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.57–0.79) for VCA IgM, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.58–0.87) for EBNA IgG and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89–1.00) for VCA IgG. A correlation was observed between positivity levels on CMIAs and semi-quantitative fluorescence intensity on IF for VCA IgG and EBNA IgG assays. With regard to an accepted gold standard IF assays, CMIA was 98,1% (95% CI: 93.3–99.8) sensitive and 97,4% (95% CI: 86.5–99.9) specific for the detection of VCA IgG. For the detection of EBNA IgG, it was 92,2% (95% CI: 85.1–96.6) sensitive and 84,6% (95% CI: 65.1–95.6) specific.

Conclusion

In summary, we demonstrated that the CMIA EBV antibody detection panel has high performance and high concordance with other commercially available immunoassays.

### Epstein-barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon? [^3fd9536a]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion.

Only 1 of 1,047 patients (< 0.01%) was truly EBV-negative. Previous literature demonstrates a strong association between MS and EBV infection; in keeping with this, 41 patients (3.9%) showed no EBNA1-reactivity on initial screen. More detailed testing revealed a much higher rate of EBV seropositivity in CIS and MS patients than previously described.

There is significant antigenic diversity of anti–EBV-IgG responses in EBV carriers and patients with EBV-related disease. Serologic testing against multiple antigens is recommended to accurately define EBV status when examining the link between EBV infection and other diseases. In studies examining MS risk and EBV infection, the rate of EBV positivity in the population is highly dependent on the method used to determine EBV serostatus.

ELISA against 2 different EBV antigens provides a screening method; immunoblot on apparently seronegative samples increases sensitivity. The ETI-EBNA-G ELISA was validated for Food and Drug Administration's approval against a cell-based EBNA1-anticomplement immunofluorescence. The CoV for this ELISA is likely set relatively high, giving borderline values a negative interpretation. The in-house ELISA that we used utilizes the same peptide antigen, but was validated against purified EBNA1, increasing sensitivity and explaining the correlation between EBNA1 titers in the 2 ELISAs. Some EBNA1-IgG–negative sera are positive against other EBV antigens.

The fact that patients who were EBNA1-screen–negative were less likely to have OCBs provides an avenue for future research; there is likely a biological link between lower EBV immunoreactivity and OCB production. However, in our earlier study, while OCB predicted a second event, lower EBV reactivity did not — the relationship therefore is more complex than a simple linear or threshold effect. EBNA1-seropositivity occurs later than VCA seroconversion; low titers of anti–EBNA1-IgG may reflect recent EBV infection which has not yet triggered downstream biological events. It may be that patients who are EBNA1-screen–negative have a lower overall level of immune response, resulting in negative OCBs. However, the same relationship is not seen in the CMV-seronegative population, hinting at an EBV-specific link.

With only 1 of 1,047 patients in our large international cohort testing negative for EBV across multiple antigens and 2 platforms, it seems that while it is possible to be truly EBV seronegative and develop MS, this is extremely rare. It seems likely that this indicates a role for EBV in MS development, and further research is needed to examine this further.

### Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6 infections in patients with myalgic е ncephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome [^a459e448]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Association of herpesviruses CMV, EBV, and HHV‐6 with ME/CFS has been investigated for long time, however the results are inconsistent. 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 23, 24, 25, 26 To contribute to the understanding of ME/CFS, in the present study, we continued these investigations and determined prevalence and type of CMV, EBV, and HHV‐6 infections among Bulgarian patients with ME/CFS. We have simultaneously tested ME/CFS patients and healthy controls for the presence of CMV, EBV, and HHV‐6 DNAs in cell‐free plasma and PBMCs samples as well for the virus‐specific antibodies.

The key finding of this study is the higher prevalence of EBV active infection (presence of viral genome sequences in plasma with EBV‐CA IgM positivity and/or viral genomic sequences in plasma with elevated titers of EBV‐CA IgG without EBV‐CA IgM) observed in patients with ME/CFS compared to the controls (P = 0.0027). EBNA‐1 IgG positivity of these cases indicated reactivation of a latent virus infection rather than primary EBV infection. At the same time, the prevalence of latent EBV infection (EBV‐CA IgG and/or PBMCs EBV DNA positivity) was high but quite similar in both ME/CFS patients and controls. Many previous studies have shown that EBV is a common trigger of ME/CFS and a possible key factors in the development of the disease. In a subset of patients with ME/CFS, the disease starts with infectious mononucleosis. In addition, altered serological profiling of the EBV immune response has been demonstrated in ME/CFS cases indicating that the immune system of some patients with ME/CFS interact with the EBV in a way different from that of healthy controls. 27 Thus, Lerner et al 23, 24 found serum IgM class antibodies to EBV‐CA in patients with ME/CFS but not in controls and also reported elevated antibodies against EBV‐dUTPase and EBV DNA polymerase in a subset of patients with ME/CFS. Furthermore, elevated titers of early antigen (EA) IgG and antibodies to ZEBRA, a product of the immediate‐early EBV gene BZLF‐1, were detected in patients with ME/CFS. 28, 29 Loebel et al 30 in subsets of EBV‐positive ME/CFS patients have found elevated IgM response against EBV‐CA but a lack of antibodies against EBNA‐1. In a further global screening of serum antibody responses to an EBV peptide array, the same authors in serum of patients with ME/CFS revealed quite similar EBV IgG antibody response pattern as in sera of healthy controls except for the significantly enhanced IgG responses to several EBNA‐6 peptides. 25 On the contrary, according to a recent study, no increased EBV‐CA IgG reactivity over EBNA‐1 in ME/CFS cohorts is found and EBNA‐6 peptide IgG reactivity is not significantly different between the ME/CFS and healthy control samples. 27 In addition, some earlier studies also reported no differences in IgG titers against EBV‐CA, EBNA‐1 and EA. 10, 26, 31 In our present study, we observed elevated EBV‐CA IgG antibodies in most of ME/CFS patients with active EBV infection. At the same time, we do not detect a significant difference in EBV‐CA IgG and IgM positivity rates between patients with ME/CFS and the control group.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^7554b6f6]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

We have monitored Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) IgA antibody levels of 39 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases for up to 15 years before clinical onset of NPC, and assessed preclinical serologic status of another 68 cases. Our results identify a serologic window preceding diagnosis when antibody levels are raised and sustained. This window can persist for as long as 10 years, with a mean duration estimated to as 37 ± 28 months. Ninety-seven of these 107 NPC cases exhibited such a window. Cases that did not may reflect individual antibody response to EBV. Serologic screening at enrollment identified those cases who had already entered the window and became clinically manifested earlier (median = 28 months) than those who entered the window after enrollment (median = 90 months). The former account for 19 of 21 cases diagnosed within 2 years of screening. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk levels among seropositive subjects were also highest during this period. Both prediction rates and risk levels declined thereafter; cases detected at later times were composed of increasing proportions of individuals who entered the serological window after screening. Our findings establish EBV antibody as an early marker of NPC and suggest that repeated screening to monitor cases as they enter this window has considerable predictive value, with practical consequences for cancer treatment.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^9645ac96]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a major tumour in China and elsewhere in Asia, as well as in restricted areas of Africa. It has a strong association with the human herpesvirus, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), with general elevation of serum EBV antibody level being an outstanding feature of the tumour. EBV antibody screening in sera of populations in high incidence areas for NPC can be useful in predicting onset of the cancer. This is presumed to reflect rises in antibody levels at an early stage in cancer development.

To investigate the relationship between the serologic changes and disease progression, we have conducted a prospective study in a high-incidence area in southern China. The study has extended over 16 years (between 1986 and 2002) and has involved 42 048 adult subjects. Recruitment extended over 18 months, when each study subject was given a serologic test and a clinical examination. Seropositive subjects identified as having high-serum IgA antibody against EB viral capsid antigen (VCA) at enrollment to the study were clinically and serologically followed up on eight subsequent occasions between years 3 and 13. Some seronegative subjects, having low IgA VCA at the time of enrollment, were similarly examined on these occasions. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases were detected either by clinical examination conducted during follow-up, when they symptomatically presented to the out patients department (OPD) of our hospital, or could be traced to other hospitals. We found that cumulative NPC incidence was 20 times higher for the seropositive subjects than seronegative subjects.

We describe here changes in the preclinical serologic status observed during the intervals between enrollment and clinical manifestation of the tumour. The results reveal a window of about 3 years immediately preceding clinical onset, when the antibody level was elevated and maintained at high levels. It was further shown that virtually all cases entered this serologic window. Those who had already entered the window at the time of enrollment were at a more advanced stage of preclinical tumour development than those who entered the window only after enrollment.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high-and intermediate-risk regions [^43287ae2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). Medium credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research priorities

Here, we summarize the key knowledge gaps identified during the meeting to help define priorities for research in this area in the coming years. Although we avoid prescribing specific studies to address existent gaps, there is a consensus that, to the extent possible, randomized clinical trials should be considered to address these important knowledge gaps.

With sufficient evidence to support the implementation of screening programs, subsequent monitoring of short-term (incidence, stage distribution) and long-term (morbidity, overall mortality) impact of the programs will be important. We therefore recommend that plans for monitoring the impact of NPC screening programs be developed and implemented in parallel with the development and implementation of the screening programs themselves.

Unanswered questions on screening for the early detection of and morbidity and/or mortality reduction from NPC

Serum antibody and plasma DNA EBV have been shown to be highly sensitive tests to screen for prevalent, asymptomatic early stage NPC. However, no formal head-to-head comparison of these tests has been performed in a large study cohort except one for evaluation among high-risk individuals with a positive family history of NPC. Future studies should consider concurrent testing to allow for direct comparisons between alternative screening strategies, including their cost-effectiveness. These studies might also address the potential complementary roles of the 2 EBV-based biomarkers.

Initial recommendations made above focus on 1-time or at most 2-time screening efforts. The interval at which screening should be repeated is not well understood and requires further formal evaluation.

### Evaluation the architect EBV VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA-1 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassays to assess EBV serostatus prior transplantation [^b64d40ed]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Prior to transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells or solid organ, donor and recipient EBV serostatus has to be determined to assess risks of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Sensitivity of EBV Viral capsid antigens (VCA) IgG and EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) is critical to define past infection and a good specificity of VCA IgM is required to avoid any disqualification of cord blood (CB) units. Architect™ EBV antibody panel (Architect assay) providing a high throughput was compared to a semi-automated ELISA (Etimax assays Diasorin) to assess sensitivities and specificities of VCA and EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgM on 419 sera collected from immunocompromised patients (n = 184) and from pregnant women who agreed to give CB cells (n = 235). Intra and inter-assay coefficient of variations ranged from 1.63% to 4.8% for VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA-1 IgG. Index of VCA IgG and IgM and EBNA IgG of the two assays were highly correlated. The concordance in the interpretation between the two assays was moderate for VCA IgM (kappa = 0.5), substantial for VCA IgG (kappa = 0.60) and good for EBNA-1 IgG (kappa = 0.75). Using serial dilutions of positive controls and in accordance with clinical results VCA IgG and EBNA IgG were detected at lower dilutions with Architect than Etimax. Conversely, 96.1% (74/77) of samples negative with Architect and positive with Etimax for VCA IgM did not have any heterophile antibodies and had VCA IgG and EBNA IgG antibodies supporting past infections. Architect™ EBV serology panel provided good sensitivities and specificities for EBV serostatus determination prior to transplantation.

Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently have an intrathecal production of antibodies to different common viruses, which can be detected by elevated antiviral antibody indices (AIs). There is a strong and consistent association of MS and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.

Objective

To systematically compare the frequencies of intrathecal antibody production to EBV, measles virus, rubella virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in patients with MS.

Methods

Review of the English and German literature on the frequencies of intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody production, as defined by an elevated AI, to EBV, measles virus, rubella virus, VZV and HSV in adult and pediatric patients with MS.

Results

In nine original studies identified, the frequencies of an intrathecal production of antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (33/340, 9.7%), EBV viral capsid antigen (12/279, 4.3%) and antigens from EBV-infected cell lines (14/90, 15.6%) in adult patients with MS were clearly lower (p ≤ 0.03 for all pairwise comparisons) than the frequencies of an intrathecal production of antibodies to measles virus (612/922, 66.4%), rubella virus (521/922, 56.5%), VZV (470/922, 51%; data from 17 original studies) and HSV (78/291, 26.8%; data from 6 original studies). Though based on a lower number of original studies and patients, findings in children with MS were essentially similar. As in adults and children with MS the seroprevalence of EBV is higher than the seroprevalences of the other investigated viruses, the lower frequency of elevated EBV AIs became even more pronounced after correction of the frequencies of elevated antiviral AIs for the seroprevalences of the respective viruses.

Conclusions

Given the very high seroprevalence of EBV in MS, the frequency of intrathecally produced antibodies to EBV in patients with MS is paradoxically low compared to that of other common viruses. These findings are compatible with the recently proposed hypothesis that in individuals going on to develop MS antiviral antibody-producing cells may invade the brain predominantly at the time of and triggered by acute primary EBV infection, before anti-EBV IgG producing cells have yet occurred.

### Antibody responses to EBV and native MOG in pediatric inflammatory demyelinating CNS diseases [^e699ef5b]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been discussed as a possible causative agent in inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS. Cross-reactivity between EBV and myelin proteins has been proposed as a potential mechanism by which EBV could elicit an autoimmune response targeting the CNS. Recently, high antibody titers to native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (nMOG) were found in children affected by the first inflammatory demyelinating event. The relation between antibody responses to EBV and nMOG has not been addressed in children so far.

Methods

We investigated the occurrence of antibodies to nMOG, EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), and early antigen (EA) in a case-control study including children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM, n = 19), children with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, n = 25), children with other neurologic diseases (n = 28), and healthy children (n = 30). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the extracellular part of nMOG were assessed by a cell-based assay, and EBV-specific IgG antibodies to EBNA-1 and IgM antibodies to EA were assessed by ELISA.

Results

Serum IgG antibodies to EBNA-1 were present in 43% of controls (25/58), 42% of children with ADEM (8/19), and 64% of children with CIS (16/25), whereas IgM antibodies to EA were detected in only 16% of children with ADEM (3/19). High antibody titers to nMOG were only found in children with ADEM and CIS but were not related to the seropositivity to EBV. Moreover, in EBV-seropositive children, we did not observe any correlation between anti-EBNA-1 and anti-nMOG IgG antibody titers.

Conclusion

High serum immunoglobulin G titers to native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein are found in a significant number of children affected by clinically isolated syndrome or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. These antibodies are not related to the antibody response to Epstein-Barr virus.

### High Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA loads in HIV-infected patients: correlation with antiretroviral therapy and quantitative EBV serology [^8e41b902]. AIDS (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA loads in peripheral blood of HIV carriers to determine base-line values and diagnostic relevance of viral load in relation to quantitative serology; to compare EBV presence in parallel plasma and unfractionated whole blood samples; and to correlate EBV DNA load to HIV, CD4 T-cell counts and HAART.

Design

One-hundred and nine random patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during 1999 and 99 patients on anti-HIV monotherapy during 1993–1996 were included.

Methods

EBV DNA load was determined by quantitative competitive PCR. EBV serology was determined by immunoblot profile and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for responses against VCA-p18 and EBNA-1.

Results

Twenty-two out of 109 patients receiving HAART and 28 out of 99 of patients on anti-HIV monotherapy showed elevated EBV DNA loads in whole blood (> 2000 copies/ml), without elevated loads in parallel plasma. EBV DNA load distribution did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.78) and did not correlate with HIV or CD4 T-cell count. In three patients with high EBV DNA loads EBV RNA was virtually absent. Patients with high EBV DNA loads (3610–89 400 copies/ml) had higher anti-VCA-p18 IgG levels than patients with undetectable EBV DNA (P < 0.0001) but lower anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels (P = 0.005).

Conclusion

Absolute values of EBV DNA load may have poor diagnostic value for defining HIV patients at risk for developing EBV-associated disease. Elevated EBV DNA loads are cell-associated and are not influenced by HAART. Increased anti-p18-VCA and decreased anti-EBNA-1 IgG levels in patients with high EBV loads indicate impaired latency control and increased lytic replication suggesting disturbed overall immunosurveillance against EBV.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^9c5318ab]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

We have monitored Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgA antibody levels of 39 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cases for up to 15 years before clinical onset of NPC, and assessed preclinical serologic status of another 68 cases. Our results identify a serologic window preceding diagnosis when antibody levels are raised and sustained. This window can persist for as long as 10 years, with a mean duration estimated to as 37 ± 28 months. Ninety-seven of these 107 NPC cases exhibited such a window. Cases that did not may reflect individual antibody response to EBV. Serologic screening at enrollment identified those cases who had already entered the window and became clinically manifested earlier (median = 28 months) than those who entered the window after enrollment (median = 90 months). The former account for 19 of 21 cases diagnosed within 2 years of screening. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma risk levels among seropositive subjects were also highest during this period. Both prediction rates and risk levels declined thereafter; cases detected at later times were composed of increasing proportions of individuals who entered the serological window after screening. Our findings establish EBV antibody as an early marker of NPC and suggest that repeated screening to monitor cases as they enter this window has considerable predictive value, with practical consequences for cancer treatment.

### Fever with atypical lymphocytosis: pearls and pitfalls in Epstein-Barr virus serology [^189d186a]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

The heterophile antibody (also known as the Monospot) test is a useful screening tool for infectious mononucleosis (IM) resulting from primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, up to 10% of patients with IM are heterophile negative. Heterophile-negative patients who have lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear should be further tested for EBV serologies, which include testing for specific IgM and IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigens, early antigens and EBV nuclear antigen proteins. A diagnostic dilemma arises when the patient has clinical and laboratory features of IM, but is both heterophile negative and seronegative for IM, as illustrated in this case presentation. To avoid missed diagnoses of IM, misdiagnosis of mononucleosis-like illnesses and unnecessary testing, knowledge of test characteristics and the evolving course of EBV serologies is important to assure and inform both the physician and the patient.

### Complete Epstein-Barr virus seropositivity in a large cohort of patients with early multiple sclerosis [^670a3b55]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Retrospective analysis of EBV seroprevalence in a large hospital population

We retrospectively analysed results of EBV serologies, which were performed for routine diagnostic purposes in 16 163 persons at Labor Berlin GmbH, Berlin, Germany, between January 2014 and December 2016. Sera were sent for EBV serological testing from persons treated as inpatients or outpatients at university hospitals (Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin) located in Berlin or community hospitals located in Berlin and Northern Germany. The 16 163 persons were included irrespective of diagnoses or the reason for ordering EBV serologies. For individuals tested more than once during the study period, only the results of the first EBV serology were considered. From all persons included in the analysis, results of serological tests for EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgG and VCA IgM had to be available. Notably, EBNA-1 IgG is a marker of past EBV infection, VCA IgG can be found in primary and past EBV infections, and VCA IgM is a marker of primary EBV infection. Testing for EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG and VCA IgM was performed by Liaison automated quantitative CLIA using undiluted sera. Thus, the same method (Liaison CLIA) was used for testing of patients with CIS/RRMS and patients of the hospital population, with sera of patients with CIS/RRMS being measured in dilution and sera of patients from the hospital population being measured without dilution. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, in undiluted sera, EBNA-1 IgG levels < 5 U/mL were considered negative, levels between 5 and 20 U/mL were considered equivocal and levels ≥ 20 U/mL were considered positive; VCA IgG levels < 20 U/mL were considered negative and VCA IgG levels ≥ 20 U/mL were considered positive; and VCA IgM levels < 20 U/mL were considered negative, levels between 20 and 40 U/mL were considered equivocal and VCA IgM levels ≥ 40 U/mL were considered positive. Persons with EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgG and VCA IgM below the respective cut-offs were considered EBV-seronegative. Persons in whom at least one of the three antibodies, EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG or VCA IgM, was above the respective cut-offs were considered EBV-seropositive. From the age of 5 years onwards, persons were grouped in 5-year age cohorts. To analyse the EBV seroprevalence in early life in more detail, newborns and infants below 5 years of age were grouped in smaller age cohorts.

### Evidence-based approach for interpretation of Epstein-Barr virus serological patterns [^bf6a5748]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is based on clinical symptoms and serological markers, including the following: immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA), heterophile antibodies, and IgG antibodies to the EBV early antigen-diffuse (EA-D) and nuclear antigen (EBNA-1). The use of all five markers results in 32 possible serological patterns. As a result, interpretation of EBV serologies remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to use a large population of patients to develop evidence-based tools for interpreting EBV results. This study utilized 1,846 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. Chart review was performed for more than 800 patients, and diagnoses were assigned based on physician-ordered testing, clinical presentation, and patient history. Testing for all five EBV antibodies was performed separately on all serum samples using the Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 system. Presumed EBV diagnosis (based on previous publications) was compared to EBV diagnosis based on a medical record review for each serological pattern. Interestingly, of the 32 possible serological patterns, only 12 occurred in ≥ 10 patients. The remaining 20 patterns were uninterpretable because they occurred with such infrequency. Two easy-to-use tables were created to interpret EBV serological patterns based on whether three (EBV VCA IgG, IgM, and heterophile) or five markers are utilized. The use of these two tables allows for interpretation of > 95% of BioPlex serological results. This is the first evidence-based study of its kind for EBV serology.

### Is there a clinical significance of very low serum immunoglobulin E level? [^7d621299]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

High serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels are associated with allergies, parasitic infections, and some immune deficiencies; however, the potential effects and clinical implications of low IgE levels on the human immune system are not well-known. This study aims to determine the disorders accompanying very low IgE levels in children and adults.

Methods

The patients whose IgE levels were determined between January 2015 and September 2020 were analyzed, and the patients with an IgE level < 2 IU/mL were included in this study. Demographic data, immunoglobulin levels, autoantibody results, and the diagnoses of the patients were noted from the electronic recording system of the hospital.

Result

The IgE levels were measured in 34,809 patients (21,875 children, 12,934 adults), and 130 patients had IgE levels < 2 IU/mL. Fifty-seven patients were children (0.26%); 73 were adults (0.56%). There was a malignant disease in 34 (9 of them children) (26%), autoimmune diseases in 20 (3 of them children) (15.4%), and immunodeficiency in 17 (14 of them children) (13.1%) of the patients. The most common reasons were other diseases, immunodeficiency and malignancy in children, and malignancy, autoimmune disorders, and other diseases in the adults, in rank order. The IgE level did not show any correlation with the levels of other immunoglobulins.

Conclusion

Although rare, a low IgE level has been shown to accompany malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and immune deficiencies. Patients with very low IgE levels should be carefully monitored for systemic disorders.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^2eca7fad]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Taken together, the results served to identify a period immediately preceding the diagnosis of NPC, when serum EBV antibody was raised to and sustained above cutoff titre, although the individuals showed no apparent symptoms of cancer. Based on the time of diagnosis of the 42 type I cases who had entered the window before the initial screening, and 10 type II cases who entered the window after screening, the mean duration of this serologic window was estimated to be 37 ± 28 months. The fluctuating antibody levels observed among the type II cases before this window period and type III cases throughout follow-up may reflect EBV reactivation or re-infection, such as observed among the non-NPC subjects described earlier.

### Early identification of individuals at risk for multiple sclerosis by quantification of EBNA-1-specific antibody titers [^a567a569]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In 264 of these MS patients with follow-up samples (81.5%), EBV seroconversion occurred in the course of clinically evident infectious mononucleosis (IM), confirmed by the triad of fever, lymphadenopathy, and tonsillitis (Table 1). In all patients with IM, EBV primary infection was further confirmed serologically by the presence of EBV viral-capsid antigen (VCA)-specific IgM in the absence of EBV-VCA- or EBV-EBNA-specific IgG antibodies. In all 264 patients with clinically evident IM, the time point of EBV seroconversion (T0) was defined as the first available plasma sample with VCA-IgM positive, VCA-IgG negative, and EBNA-IgG negative antibodies.

In 60 (18.5%) patients with MS, primary EBV infection had occurred asymptomatically, and, in these individuals, EBV seroconversion was confirmed by an additional plasma sample that was available and obtained at a median of 5.2 (3.2–7.2) months prior to the first detection of EBV-VCA-specific IgM or EBV-VCA- specific IgG. In all 60 patients with an asymptomatic EBV seroconversion, the time point of EBV seroconversion (T0) was defined as the first available plasma sample with VCA-IgM positive or VCA-IgG positive antibodies.

For each of the 324 follow-up MS patients, one healthy control individual was selected from the control cohort matched according to gender, age, time, and occurrence of IM. All MS patients and healthy controls were recruited in Austria and Germany. Furthermore, from all 324 control subjects, a follow-up was available for > 5 years after the matching time point, and it was confirmed by follow-up records that none of them was diagnosed with MS or other autoimmune diseases or neuro-inflammatory disorders within this follow-up period. The recruitment of the study participants was recently described in detail. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Medical University of Vienna (IRB number: 1339/2022). Details of the study cohort are shown in Table 1. Further details of the plasma samples included are shown in Table S1 and Table S2.

For the validation of the EBNA-1 381–452 -specific IgG ELISA, additional plasma samples from 15 EBV-VCA-IgG and EBNA-IgG seropositive as well as 40 EBV-VCA-specific IgM, EBV-VCA-specific IgG, and EBV-EBNA-specific IgG seronegative healthy blood donors were included.

### Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors for non-malignancy associated secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in children [^fb553ab9]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study subjects

Children diagnosed with HLH between 2005 and 2018 according to HLH-2004 criteria (fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis, ferritin ≥ 500 μg/L, low/absent NK-cell activity, and soluble CD25 [sIL-2r] [≥ 2400 U/ml], an affected sibling, and/or a molecular diagnosis based on familial hemophagocytic syndrome (FHL)-causative genes were eligible for his study. The majority of patients satisfied at least 5/6 of these criteria as NK-cell activity and soluble CD25 were not evaluated. Exclusion criteria were 1) diagnostic criteria not met or 2) malignancy-associated HLH (MA-HLH). This research was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Consent was obtained from a parent or guardian on behalf of any participants under the age of 16 years.

Parameters associated with HLH

The medical records of the included patients were retrospectively reviewed. Pretreatment complete blood cell (CBC) count, levels of fibrinogen and albumin, and prothrombin time (PT) were extracted from serial laboratory analyses.

Clinical outcomes were assessed based on the highest ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and triglyceride levels recorded during the 4 weeks after treatment initiation.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-association was evaluated by viremia (including low level chronic viremia) and symptomatology of EBV infection, serologic tests (EBV early antigen [EA], EBV nuclear antigen [EBNA], EBV viral capsid antigen [VCA] IgG/IgM) and measuring EBV DNA level using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

### Evaluation of a multiplex fluorescent microsphere immunoassay for the determination of Epstein-Barr virus serologic status [^330646bc]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, affects up to 95% of adults. Diagnosis of acute EBV infection can be challenging and often relies on the serologic antibody pattern to 3 distinct antigens, most often determined by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and, more recently, multiplex assays. We compared a multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies to viral capsid (VCA), nuclear (EBNA), and early (EA) EBV antigens with ELISAs using IFA for discrepancy resolution. Concordance of the multiplex assay was good for all 4 antigens: VCA IgM, 86.6% vs ELISA and 92.9% vs IFA; VCA IgG, 92.8% vs ELISA and 98.0% vs IFA; EBNA IgG, 90.3% vs ELISA and 98.1% vs IFA; and EA IgG, 83.8% vs ELISA and 92.8% vs IFA. After IFA resolution, correlation between the multiplex assay and ELISA for serologic disease stage, based on the antibody profile of all 4 analytes, was 90%. The multiplex assay showed good correlation with an established ELISA and even better correlation with the "gold standard" IFA. Advantages of the multiplex assay over traditional methods include multiple results per assay, inclusion of internal controls for each assay, and well-to-well monitoring of assay drift.

### Coupled particle light scattering: a new technique for serodiagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infection [^386bf5cb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

The Coupled Particle Light Scattering technique was evaluated for serological diagnosis of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection. Two hundred ninety-six patient sera selected from several clinical categories (acute infection, non-primary infection, interfering non-EBV infection, non-infected) were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies (anti-VCA, anti-EBNA and anti-EA). Determination of EBV IgG with Copalis multiplex was accurate when compared with Enzygnost Anti-EBV/IgG ELISA. Although the sensitivity of Copalis IgM for acute infections was 100% a positive IgM result did not always indicate an acute infection. Strong reactivity to IgG EA (ratio 3, 1) and IgG VCA (ratio 13, 3) correlated with persistent infection or reactivation. The CopalisI has many advantages over the existing methods, such as the possibility to measure three semi-quantitative IgG responses to three different EBV antigens simultaneously.

### Incidence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is elevated in COVID-19 patients [^7e83e589]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

No statistical difference was found in the amount of EBV genomes detected in the plasma of reactivated COVID negative and COVID positive patients (Fig. 2 B). The mean CT value of the COVID negative group (35.66 CT) was not statistically significant (p = 0.8223) compared to the COVID positive group (35.09 CT) with BamHI primers. The mean CT values of EBV reactivated samples detected with LMP2 primers were very similar between the COVID negative group (37.01 CT) and positive (37.34 CT) group (p = 0.9436). This data indicates that, in this study, the number of EBV genomes produced via reactivation do not differ significantly between COVID positive and negative patients.

3.2 EBV serology

96/106 patients (90.56%) had detectable levels of anti-EBNA-1 IgG, indicative of a past EBV infection. 25/103 (24.3%) were positive for anti-EA-D IgG and only 5/106 (4.71%) had anti-VCA IgM antibodies. 23/93 (24.7%) samples were positive for both EBNA-1 and EA-D, 12/46 (26.0%) of which were COVID positive and 11/47 (23.4%) were negative. 3/48 (6.3%) were positive for EBNA-1 and VCA from the COVID negative group and 2/48 (4.2%) were positive from the COVID positive group. When either EA-D or VCA was detected in combination with EBNA-1, 12/48 (25.0%) COVID negative patients showed reactivation compared to 12/48 (25.0%) in the COVID positive group (Fig. 3 A). There was no significant difference in EBV reactivation as determined by serology against VCA and EA-D antibodies when the COVID negative and positive groups were defined by PCR assay.

### Characterization of the hepatitis B virus DNA detected in urine of chronic hepatitis B patients [^bc46c6f5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Characterization of the study population

Previous studies have suggested that highly viremic HBV carriers may have high titers of HBV DNA in body fluids other than blood, such as urine. In order to investigate whether urine from patients with high viremia contains infectious HBV, we analyzed 25 urine samples from patients that have viral loads ranging from 10⁵ to 10⁸ IU/mL, designated as the "high viral load" group. In addition, we analyzed urine from 35 CHB patients whose viral loads were below 10⁵ IU/mL, designated as the "low viral load" group, as summarized in Table 1 (listed in descending order of their serum HBV viral load). Interestingly, Sample ID #59 was negative for surface antigen with a serum viral load of 20 IU/mL, suggesting an occult HBV infection. The clinicopathological characteristics of the patient population are summarized in Table 2. The mean age of the study population was 48.8 years (SD ± 13.2), consisting of 35 males and 25 females. Seven of the 60 CHB patients had Child Pugh A liver cirrhosis, and two of them were known to have hepatocellular carcinoma. Biomarkers with tested values above the normal range (positive) for any individual in this study cohort are included in Table 1. Immune disease markers (Antinuclear antibody, Rheumatic factor, Cryoglobulin, IgM, IgA, IgE, IgG and IgG4), viral markers (CMV IgM and IgG, EB-VCA IgM and IgG, EBEA and EBNA, HSV IgM) and inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein) were found to be negative in all patients of this study cohort, which suggests this study population has no individual with detectable immune complex deposition.

### Diagnostic value of measuring Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load and carcinoma-specific viral mRNA in relation to anti-EBV immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody levels in blood of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients from Indonesia [^870319a8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent malignancy in Southeast Asia and is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We investigated the primary diagnostic value of circulating EBV DNA and anti-EBV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA levels in Indonesian NPC patients (n = 149). By a 213-bp Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1)-based real-time LightCycler PCR, 72.5% of patients were positive for EBV DNA in whole blood, with 29.5% having levels above a previously determined clinical cutoff value (COV) of 2,000 EBV DNA copies/ml, the upper level in healthy carriers. In a 99-bp LightCycler PCR, 85.9% of patients were positive and 60.4% had levels above the COV. This assay quantified a significantly higher EBV load than the 213-bp PCR assay (P < 0.0001), suggesting that circulating EBV DNA is fragmented. Using data from 11 different studies, we showed a significant inverse correlation between PCR amplicon size and the percentage of patients positive for circulating EBV DNA (Spearman's rho = -0.91; P < 0.0001). EBV DNA loads were unrelated to anti-EBV IgG or IgA levels, as measured by VCA-p18 and EBNA1-specific synthetic peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The presence of circulating tumor cells was assessed by amplification of BamHI-A rightward frame 1 (BARF1) mRNA, a viral oncogene abundantly expressed in EBV-carrying carcinomas but virtually absent from EBV-associated lymphomas. Despite high EBV DNA loads and the presence of EBNA1 and human U1A small nuclear ribonucleoprotein mRNA, BARF1 mRNA was never detected in blood. We conclude that amplicon size significantly influences EBV DNA load measurement in NPC patients. The circulating EBV DNA load is independent of serological parameters and does not reflect intact tumor cells. The primary diagnostic value of the EBV DNA load for the detection of NPC is limited.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^0d80cf47]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma mainly affects adults in their most productive age, between 35 and 65 years. Our findings suggest that effective control of this cancer can be achieved by repeating serologic screening every 2 years to identify cases as they enter the serologic window. We estimate that such a program would sustain a prediction rate of 90% and more importantly about two-third of these cases diagnosed by the program belongs to early-stage disease. Apart from benefits to the afflicted individuals, such a program, when implemented community-wide in high-incidence areas for this cancer, would have important economic and sociological ramifications. We believe that we have shown this to be a practical proposition. Moreover, the VCA IgA assay used in this study, the only suitable assay at the time, has now been replaced by high-throughput objective assays produced with purified recombinant EBV proteins, which afford greater specificity and sensitivity than traditional assays, especially when they are used in combination. Detection of the EBV gene in nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic patients has been shown to be highly predictive of symptomatic NPC, and the incorporation of this approach in routine NPC screening of apparently healthy subjects is expected to enhance early detection of the cancer.

### Laboratory testing for epstein… [^4a351cb4]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of tests Viral capsid antigen Anti-VCA IgM appears early in EBV infection and usually disappears within four to six weeks. Anti-VCA IgG appears in the acute phase of EBV infection, peaks at 2 to 4 weeks after onset, declines slightly then persists for the rest of a person's life. Early antigen Anti-EA IgG appears in the acute phase of illness and generally falls to undetectable levels after three to six months. In many people, detection of antibody to EA is a sign of active infection. However, 20% of healthy people may have antibodies against EA for years. EBV nuclear antigen Antibody to EBNA is not seen in the acute phase of EBV infection. Instead, it slowly appears 2 to 4 months after onset of symptoms and persists for the rest of a person's life. Other EBNA enzyme immunoassays may report false positive results.

Primary infection People are considered to have a primary EBV infection if they have anti-VCA IgM but do not have antibody to EBNA. Other results that strongly suggest a primary infection are a high or rising level of anti-VCA IgG and no antibody to EBNA after at least 4 weeks of illness. Resolution of the illness may occur before the diagnostic antibody levels appear. In rare cases, people with active EBV infections may not have detectable EBV-specific antibodies. Past infection The presence of antibodies to both VCA and EBNA suggests past infection. Since over 90% of adults have been infected with EBV, most adults will show antibodies to EBV from infection years earlier. High or elevated antibody levels may be present for years and are not diagnostic of recent infection. Recent vs.

past infections Testing paired acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples is not useful to distinguish between recent and past EBV infections. In most cases, the antibody response occurs rapidly during primary EBV infection. The clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis occur in conjunction with the appearance of IgG and IgM anti-VCA antibodies. However, the antibody pattern is not stable before symptoms appear.

### Epstein-Barr virus antibody level and gastric cancer risk in Korea: a nested case-control study [^81c69dfe]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Background:

Few cohort studies have investigated Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection before the occurrence of gastric cancer.

Methods:

Among 14 440 cohort participants, 100 incident gastric cancer cases were individually matched to two controls. Epstein–Barr virus antibodies IgG and IgA against viral capsid antigen (VCA), EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibody IgG, and early antigen (EA) antibody IgG were measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs).

Results:

The highest titres of VCA IgG (odds ratio (OR): 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62–3.06) or EBNA IgG (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.51–1.46) were not associated with gastric cancer risk.

Conclusion:

Higher levels of VCA IgG or EBNA IgG were not associated with increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma in Koreans.

### Epstein-Barr virus in multiple sclerosis: past, present, and future [^48e8b950]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

History of the EBV-MS Connection

MS is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the CNS. The concept that MS may be caused by a viral infection has seen a resurgence in recent years, with a particular focus on the association with EBV. The link between MS and EBV was noted as early as the 1980s. Numerous studies have confirmed that more than 99% of patients with MS have been infected with EBV, which is significantly higher than the 90–95% seroprevalence in the global population.EBV seropositivity is likely 100% in all patients with MS when considering assay sensitivity and increased diagnostic stringency (e.g. exclusion of disorders that mimic MS). This strong association has also been corroborated in pediatric MS, where EBV seropositivity exceeds 95%, substantially higher than the seroprevalence in age-matched healthy controls.EBV seroconversion was found to increase the risk of MS development by 32-fold, with a median of 5 years before MS diagnosis. These findings therefore emphasize the role of EBV as a prerequisite for the development of MS. After EBV seroconversion, the levels of a biomarker for neuroaxonal degeneration increased, suggesting that subclinical CNS injury begins years before neurologic symptoms develop.

### High prevalence of immunoglobulin A antibody against Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen in adult patients with lupus with disease flare: case control studies [^650f97ea]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe autoimmune disease with rare remission and recurrent flare. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been reported to be strongly associated with SLE in the United States, but with an inconclusive role in Asia. We investigated the role of EBV infection in patients with SLE in Taiwan, with one of the highest population densities in Asia.

Methods

We conducted case-control studies to test whether EBV infection was associated with adult SLE in Taiwan. In the first study, 36 adults with SLE and 36 sex and age matched controls were enrolled for examination of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody against EBV-virus capsid antigen (EBV-VCA). In the second study, another 36 adult lupus cases and 36 matched controls were enrolled to confirm the high prevalence of IgA antibody against EBV-VCA found in the first study. Further, both groups of SLE patients were combined to analyze the association between the existence of IgA antibody against EBV-VCA and disease activity (determined by SLEDAI score) and disease flare in patients with SLE.

Results

In the first study, IgA antibody against EBV-VCA was the only marker with significantly higher prevalence in adults with SLE compared to healthy adults (36.1% vs 5.6%; p < 0.005). In the second study, we confirmed that the prevalence of IgA antibody against EBV-VCA was indeed higher in adults with SLE (38.9% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001). With further analysis (pooling analysis), adult SLE patients with IgA antibody against EBV-VCA had higher disease activity compared to SLE patients without IgA antibody against EBV-VCA (SLEDAI 7.8 ± 6.6 vs 3.3 ± 2.1; p < 0.001). SLE patients with flare showed much higher prevalence of IgA antibody against EBV-VCA compared to those without flare (81.3% vs 25.0%; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

This is the first evidence that IgA antibody against EBV-VCA is strongly associated with disease flare in SLE patients. It suggests that EBV reactivation may contribute toward the disease flare of SLE.

### Epstein-barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon? [^0efee0d5]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with MS; up to 3.3% people with MS are EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1)-seronegative compared with 6.0% controls.EBV serology is complex, and multiple antigens are required to assess seropositive status. We examined a cohort of seemingly EBV-negative patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The size of the population enrolled in the International CIS study allowed us to examine the largest population of seemingly EBV-negative patients with CIS gathered to date.

### Application of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA antibody detection with a polyantigenic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood [^8f87650e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The Enzygnost anti-Epstein-Barr virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, which is based on a defined antigen mixture and on detection of antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA classes, was evaluated for its reliability in diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood. With samples from 66 children, the Epstein-Barr virus status and the infection phase were defined by indirect immunofluorescence and anticomplement fluorescence assays: 11 children were seronegative, 8 had a primary infection, 20 had a recent primary or past infection, and in 27 a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus infection was diagnosed. When applying the Enzygnost ELISAs, 15 serum samples (22.7%) were not interpretable due to indeterminate results in at least one of the assays used and were therefore excluded from further evaluation. The respective sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of seronegativity were 100 and 100%, those for the diagnosis of primary infection were 100 and 97%, those for the diagnosis of recent primary or past infection were 100 and 52%, and those for the diagnosis of reactivated infection were 10 and 100%. This poor performance of the Enzygnost system with reactivated infections is due to the prerequisite of an IgG antibody value of > 650 IU/ml for the diagnosis of viral activity, which was fulfilled in only two of the children. Despite the high rate of indeterminate results, the Enzygnost system is useful in diagnosing acute and past Epstein-Barr virus infection in childhood. For serological diagnosis of viral activity in childhood, a supplementary assay is necessary.

### Febrile palpebral edema [^b2b40ac5]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which one of the following tests is expected to be found with the diagnosis of the presented case?
A. Negative heterophile antibodies
B. Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-viral capsid antigen (VCA) − IgG-VCA + anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) − antiearly antigen (anti-EA) −
C. IgM-VCA + IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA − anti-EA +
D. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA − anti-EBNA − anti-EA −
E. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA + anti-EA −

Answers:
A. Negative heterophile antibodies – Incorrect. Heterophile antibodies may be sufficient in case of positivity with a typical clinical picture of EBV infection. Otherwise, anti-VCA and anti-EBNA are required for the diagnosis. Moreover, young children aged < 4 years may not develop a positive heterophile antibody response during EBV primoinfection.
B. Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-viral capsid antigen (VCA) − IgG-VCA + anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) − antiearly antigen (anti-EA) − – Incorrect. This serologic profile is consistent with a convalescent infection.
C. IgM-VCA + IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA − anti-EA + – Correct. This serologic profile is consistent with a EBV primoinfection. Anti-EA antibodies are the markers of acute infection, appearing in early disease. IgM anti-VCA are also usually found at the onset of the disease but studies report the existence of false positive results, especially with cytomegalovirus infections.
D. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA − anti-EBNA − anti-EA − – Incorrect. This serologic profile is not consistent with an EBV infection.
E. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA + anti-EA − – Incorrect. This serologic profile is consistent with a remote past infection. IgG anti-VCA may be either negative or positive during the early infection but shows life-long persistance. On the other hand, anti-EBNA antibodies usually appear weeks after the infection onset. The presence of IgG anti-VCA and anti-EBNA in acute illness rules out a primary EBV infection.

Epstein–Barr virus epidemiology, clinical considerations, and testing — "EBV is a ubiquitous virus. Primary infection in healthy individuals is asymptomatic or may be associated with an infectious mononucleosis syndrome that is most often mild". After infection, "the virus remains latent in B lymphocytes", and it "may be shed in saliva" with risk limited to those with "very close contact". Regarding anti-TNFα therapy, "Data are lacking concerning the clinical presentation of EBV-associated lymphoma associated with anti-TNFα inhibitor therapy". Thiopurine-treated patients may develop "hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)" due to primary EBV, and "5 pediatric patients with IBD treated with systemic steroids, but not with anti-TNFα, developed HLH associated with primary EBV infection". For diagnosis, "A serologic panel that includes IgM and IgG antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA)" is described.

A previously healthy boy developed persistent hepatitis without fever or lymphoproliferative disorder. Although serologic tests were not indicative, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome and transcripts were detected from the liver tissue, and real time PCR detected extremely high levels of EBV viremia. EBV infection should be included in the differential diagnoses of hepatitis of unknown etiology, even with unremarkable serologic data.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lymphogranuloma venereum, more specifically with respect to serology, EADV 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that a high antibody titer (particularly IgA anti-MOMP antibodies) in patients with symptoms suggestive of LGV supports the diagnosis, but a low titer does not exclude LGV, nor does a high titer in patients without LGV symptomatology confirm LGV infection.

### Laboratory testing… [^da9bfd20]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This photomicrograph depicts leukemia cells that contain Epstein-Barr virus using an FA staining technique. Viral capsid antigen
- Anti-VCA IgM appears early in EBV infection and usually disappears within four to six weeks.
- Anti-VCA IgG appears in the acute phase of EBV infection, peaks at two to four weeks after onset, declines slightly then persists for the rest of a person's life. Early antigen Anti-EA IgG appears in the acute phase of illness and generally falls to undetectable levels after three to six months. In many people, detection of antibody to EA is a sign of active infection. However, 20% of healthy people may have antibodies against EA for years. The interpretation of EBV antibody tests requires familiarity with these tests and access to the patient's clinical information.

Interpretation of EBV antibody tests and diagnosis of EBV infection is summarized as follows: Susceptibility to infection People are considered susceptible to EBV infection if they do not have antibodies to the VCA. Primary infection People are considered to have a primary EBV infection if they have anti-VCA IgM but do not have antibody to EBNA. Other results that strongly suggest a primary infection are a high or rising level of anti-VCA IgG and no antibody to EBNA after at least four weeks of illness. Resolution of the illness may occur before the diagnostic antibody levels appear. In rare cases, people with active EBV infections may not have detectable EBV-specific antibodies. Past infection The presence of antibodies to both VCA and EBNA suggests past infection. Since over 90% of adults have been infected with EBV, most adults will show antibodies to EBV from infection years earlier.

High or elevated antibody levels may be present for years and are not diagnostic of recent infection. Testing paired acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples is not useful to distinguish between recent and past EBV infections. In most cases, the antibody response occurs rapidly during primary EBV infection. The clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis occur in conjunction with the appearance of IgG and IgM anti-VCA antibodies. However, the antibody pattern is not stable before symptoms appear.

### Sustained elevation of Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels preceding clinical onset of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^587655a4]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Serologic screening takes advantage of the above-described features of preclinical tumour development to predict NPC. Our effort located all 42 type I cases among the seropositive subjects, and predicted 19 of 21 cases detected from the entire study population within 2 years of screening. Relative NPC risk of the seropositive subjects was also highest during this period. The prediction rate and risk level declined at later times in proportion, with the declining number of type I cases detected. Cases detected from the seronegative groups were mainly made up of type II cases, which are at earlier stages of preclinical tumour development than type I cases. It was observed that the detection of type II cases was delayed for about 2 years initially, presumably reflecting the time taken for the cases to traverse the serologic window. Thereafter, cases were detected at a relatively constant rate. These findings show that repeated serologic screening of a target population at regular intervals may serve as a sentinel to monitor type II cases as they enter the serologic window, and provide a valuable high prediction rate for these individuals.

Although cure can still be achieved in all stages of NPC in the absence of distant metastases, the prognosis is significantly worse in advanced-stage disease. Patients with early-stage disease have not only improved survival rate, but also reduced toxicities of treatment. Early disease symptoms are innocuous, however, and even agreed participation in a program, such as ours, was not accompanied by an enhanced awareness of the cancer by the study subjects themselves, or improved early detection. Consequently, 80% of our study cases that were diagnosed by clinical symptoms and 79% of the concurrent control cases of newly diagnosed NPC during the study period, were diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Confirming previous reports, we demonstrated in a large-scale study that this trend could be reversed using a screening program that employed serological testing and clinical examination. Here, 68% of the cases thus detected by the screening program were diagnosed at the early stage I or II disease.

### Pivotal role of HIV and EBV replication in the long-term persistence of monoclonal gammopathy in patients on antiretroviral therapy [^9fc75e2a]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

A high prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) has been observed in HIV-infected patients. We explored the conditions associated with long-term persistence of serum monoclonal protein (M protein) in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Of 21 patients with MG, M protein disappeared in 12 patients (58%) over 5 years of ART. Higher level of serum γ-globulin and higher percentages of circulating plasmablasts and plasma cells were observed in patients with persistent MG compared with patients with transient MG. MG persistence was associated with the cumulative time of detectable plasma HIV RNA after ART initiation, detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in plasma, and a high level of EBV DNA in B cells. Poor control of HIV replication and detectable EBV replication in plasma were both associated with long-term MG persistence in patients on ART. In the case of viral control, MG associated with HIV infection is usually transient.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for Q fever… [^bb156511]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommended tests The reference standard test for the serologic diagnosis of acute Q fever is the indirect fluorescent antibody test using C. burnetii antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant rise in antibody titers. The first sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the first week of symptoms, and the second sample should be taken 3 to 6 weeks later. In most Q fever cases, the first IgG IFA titer is typically low, or "negative, " and the second typically shows a fourfold or greater increase in IgG antibody levels. A negative test during the first week of illness does not rule out Q fever as a cause of illness. There are two distinct antigenic phases to which humans develop antibody responses. In acute infection, an antibody response to. C.

burnetii phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than antibody levels to phase I antigen; the reverse is true in chronic infection which is associated with a rising phase I IgG titer that may be higher than phase II IgG. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG, near the end of the first week of illness, and remain elevated for months or longer and therefore provide limited diagnostic value on their own. IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive. For these reasons, physicians requesting IgM serologic titers should also request concurrent IgG titers. Diagnosis of chronic Q fever Chronic Q fever is confirmed by elevated phase I IgG antibody ≥ 1: 1024 and an identifiable persistent focus of infection. Whole blood, serum or tissue biopsies may be tested by PCR for C. burnetii.

PCR of whole blood has low sensitivity in patients with chronic Q fever endocarditis, so serum antibody titers should also be tested. Healthcare providers should also look at routine blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count or a chemistry panel. A prolonged fever with low platelet count, normal leukocyte count, and elevated liver enzymes are suggestive of acute Q fever infection but may not be present in all patients. After a suspect diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion and treatment has begun, specialized laboratory testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis of Q fever.

### Comparison of elecsys and liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^7ab0193d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

2.4 Data analysis

The expected EBV status was (i) the status obtained in the city laboratory when the results of the Elecsys and Liaison assays were concordant or (ii) the status established by the reference laboratory when the results of the two assays were discrepant. Serum with isolated anti‐VCA IgM antibodies in the Liaison or Elecsys assays was considered as early primary infection if the diagnosis of primary infection was confirmed by the reference laboratory. EBV status with an indeterminate profile (transition phase, isolated anti‐VCA IgG, or isolated anti‐EBNA IgG) or that remained inconclusive despite the evaluation of the reference laboratory were excluded from the statistical analysis.

Equivocal results obtained with one of the assays were considered as negative for sensitivity calculations and positive for specificity calculations. The sensitivity and the specificity of the different assays were compared using the exact binomial test. The clinical agreement between the Elecsys profiles, the Liaison profiles, and the expected EBV status was established in accordance with the criteria of the respective manufacturers and the following formula using 2 × 2 contingency tables: (True Positive + True Negative)/(True Positive + False Negative + True Negative + False Positive).

### Complete Epstein-Barr virus seropositivity in a large cohort of patients with early multiple sclerosis [^a6498e71]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Of further note, unlike patients with CIS/RRMS, EBV-seronegative participants of the hospital population, as determined by CLIA using undiluted sera, were not retested by an EBV immunoblot. We consider it very unlikely that this could have resulted in a higher rate of EBV seronegativity in the hospital population than in patients with MS for the following reasons: first, in routine diagnostic serology, absence of EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG and VCA IgM, as determined by CLIA in undiluted sera, is generally accepted to reliably indicate EBV seronegativity with no further confirmatory tests being required. Second, while we are not aware of published studies that directly compared the recomLine EBV IgG immunoblot with the liaison CLIA applied in our work, in a previous comparative study, the sensitivity of the recomLine EBV IgG immunoblot was not higher than that of another CLIA method (Architect; Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany), which is similar to the CLIA Method used in our work. Third, when we re-tested 28 sera, which were EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgG negative, as determined in undiluted sera by the Liaison CLIA, by EBV immunoblots, all of these sera were likewise EBV seronegative in the EBV immunoblot (unpublished observation). Altogether, the available evidence therefore clearly argues against a higher sensitivity of the EBV IgG immunoblot as compared with determination of EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgG in undiluted sera by the liaison CLIA.

A limitation of this study is that we did not determine EBV seroprevalence in the general population, but, similar to a previous large investigation, used a hospital population as a surrogate instead. The hospital population may have included patients in whom EBV serologies were ordered for a suspected primary EBV infection, which could potentially result in higher EBV seropositivity rates than in the general population. Conversely, our hospital population may also have included immunosuppressed patients in whom EBV serologies could potentially result false negative. However, given the very high number of patients analysed, it seems conceivable that the data obtained in the hospital population are overall representative of EBV seropositivity rates across different age ranges in the general population. Finally, as is the case with every serological test, we cannot exclude the occurrence of rare false-positive results. Nevertheless, such rare false-positive results would be highly unlikely to explain the 100% EBV seropositivity observed in patients with CIS/RRMS in our study.

### Comparison of elecsys and liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^c0ff4752]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Serological markers for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pretransplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician‐ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti‐VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti‐Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status. In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1). Concerning the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays showed similar performance. The interpretation of EBV serological profiles based on the clinical context may require serology follow up or further diagnostic approaches in challenging cases.

### Examination of control asymptomatic cohorts reveals heightened anti-EBV and HHV-6 A / B dUTPase antibodies in the aging populations [^ae24514e]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The virome of humans is complex and is composed of numerous virus families including members of the Herpesviridae. The Herpesviridae are classified into three subfamilies: the α‐herpesviruses (herpes simplex types 1 and 2 [HSV‐1 & 2] and varicella‐zoster virus [VZV]), the β‐herpesviruses (human cytomegalovirus [HCMV], human herpesvirus 6 A and 6B [HHV‐6A & 6B] and human herpesvirus‐7 [HHV‐7]) and the γ‐herpesviruses (Epstein‐Barr virus [EBV] and human herpesvirus‐8 [HHV‐8]). While these viruses can be distinguished based upon cellular tropism, serology, and DNA sequence, a common feature shared by the members of the Herpesviridae family is that they establish life‐long persistent infections in individuals. These viruses are highly prevalent in the human population and are associated with numerous diseases in immune‐competent and immune‐suppressed individuals.

Types of tests Viral capsid antigen Anti-VCA IgM appears early in EBV infection and usually disappears within four to six weeks.

Human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) infection — diagnostic approach and specimen handling: Serology is "not the preferred means of establishing a diagnosis of HHV-6 infection", though "anti-HHV-6 IgM, or a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody titers using paired sera may indicate recent infection", and because "most people have been exposed to the virus by 2 years of age", "a single positive result for anti-HHV-6 IgG may not be able to differentiate recent infection from remote exposure". Qualitative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) "does not differentiate replicating from latent virus", and "detection of HHV-6 in blood, body fluids, or even tissues does not definitively establish a diagnosis", as "chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (ci-HHV-6)… results in high HHV-6 levels in virtually all clinical specimens" and "may lead to an erroneous diagnosis". Culture is "labor-intensive, taking up to 21 days", though detection "can be shortened to 1–3 days", and culture-based assays "do not differentiate between variants A and B".

### Host virus and pneumococcus-specific immune responses in high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: implications for disease progression [^f4a6b18b]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) display a high incidence of infections due to an associated immunodeficiency that includes hypogammaglobulinemia. A higher risk of infections has also been recently reported for high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, while no information is available in low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Here, we evaluated the status of the humoral immune system in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 58), as well as in low- (n = 71) and high- (n = 29) count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis versus healthy donors (n = 91). Total free plasma immunoglobulin titers and specific levels of antibodies against cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza and S.pneumoniae were measured by nephelometry and ELISA-based techniques, respectively. Overall, our results show that both CLL and high-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis patients, but not low-count monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis subjects, present with relatively high levels of antibodies specific for the latent viruses investigated, associated with progressively lower levels of S.pneumoniae -specific immunoglobulins. These findings probably reflect asymptomatic chronic reactivation of humoral immune responses against host viruses associated with expanded virus-specific antibody levels and progressively decreased protection against other micro-organisms, denoting a severe humoral immunodeficiency state not reflected by the overall plasma immunoglobulin levels. Alternatively, these results could reflect a potential role of ubiquitous viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease. Further analyses are necessary to establish the relevance of such asymptomatic humoral immune responses against host viruses in the expansion of the tumor B-cell clone and progression from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to CLL.

### Increased T-cell responses to Epstein-Barr virus with high viral load in patients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^e0d882f6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2015). Low credibility.

The immunological status of patients with Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EBV+ DLBCL) without obvious immunodeficiency has not been elucidated. A multicenter prospective study was conducted to assess pretreatment T-cell responses to EBV, EBV-DNA load and anti-EBV antibody in these patients. The proliferative and interferon (IFN)-γ-producing capacity of T-cells in response to autologous B-lymphoblastoid cell lines was determined using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-based assay. Frequencies of EBV-specific CD4+ T-cells in patients with EBV+ DLBCL (n = 13) were significantly higher than in healthy controls (HCs) (n = 16) after both ex vivo and in vitro stimulation. Frequencies of EBV-specific CD8+ T-cells in patients with EBV+ DLBCL tended to be higher than in HCs after in vitro stimulation. Patients with EBV+ DLBCL also showed increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to lytic EBV-encoded antigens. Pretreatment plasma EBV-DNA level was significantly higher in patients with EBV+ DLBCL than in patients with EBV- DLBCL or HCs. In conclusion, EBV-specific T-cells showed increased reactivity, accompanied by higher levels of plasma virus DNA in patients with EBV+ DLBCL.

### Severe ulcerative oesophagitis caused by primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in an immunocompetent individual [^fc80df67]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects the vast majority of the human population. The primary infection in immunocompetent individuals is typically asymptomatic or presenting as infectious mononucleosis. Here, an 18-year-old man without medical history was admitted with mild non-specific symptoms of infection presenting primarily with severe dysphagia and epigastric pain. Gastroscopy revealed severe, extensive, ulcerative oesophagitis with suspicion of Crohn's disease. However, a diagnosis of primary EBV infection presenting as severe ulcerative oesophagitis and without systemic symptoms of infectious mononucleosis was made based on dynamic changes in EBV serology (shift from IgM to IgG positivity), EBV-specific immunohistochemical staining, and PCR analysis of biopsy specimens. This rare manifestation of primary EBV in an immunocompetent patient was treated symptomatically and resolved within a few weeks, and should be considered a differential diagnosis at otherwise unexplained ulcerative oesophagitis in younger individuals.

### The immunomodulating activity of trimodulin (polyvalent IgM, IgA, IgG solution): a post hoc analysis of the phase II CIgMA trial [^489d3c38]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of immune status

In the phase I study in healthy subjects, pre-treatment immune status was evaluated at the cellular level (ALC, ANC, NLR, monocyte and platelet counts) by measurement of soluble markers of inflammation (serum CRP and albumin), and Ig levels (IgM, IgA, and IgG).

In the phase II CIGMA trial, ALC, ANC, NLR, monocyte and platelet counts and serum CRP, PCT, albumin, IgM, IgA, and IgG were assessed pre-initiation of trimodulin (baseline). The course of these biomarkers was assessed during and shortly after treatment with trimodulin or placebo was concluded (up to Day 7).

Subgroups

Patients enrolled in the CIGMA trial were grouped according to baseline levels of inflammatory markers. An overview of subgroups is presented in Table 1 and in Additional file 1: Fig. S1. Thresholds for these subgroups were in accordance with normal reference ranges for both cellular and soluble markers of inflammation (Tables 1 and 2). Subgroups were defined based on baseline levels either above (ANC high, NLR high, PCT high), below (ALC low, IgM low) or within (ANC normal) these reference ranges. The NLR high subgroup comprised patients with both ALC low and ANC high at baseline (n = 65; median NLR 26.1; mean NLR 33.4). Subgroups with baseline thresholds ≥ 70 mg/L for CRP and ≤ 0.8 g/L for IgM were identified, as reported previously.

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus IgM assays in primary HIV infection [^7b655e1d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

We report three cases with misleading cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) results during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We determined the rate of positive anti-CMV IgM assays or anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in sera from a group of well-characterized subjects with primary HIV infection as 2.9% (1/35; 95%CI: 0.15–16.6%) for each infection. The rate of positive anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in subjects with positive hepatitis A virus IgM assays was 30% (6/20; 95%CI: 14.6–51.9%). Clinicians need to consider the limitations of IgM assays for diagnosis of herpesvirus infections, and consider testing for other infections with overlapping clinical manifestations.

### Case report: a diagnostically challenging conjunctival mass caused by the Epstein-Barr virus [^223f4ccd]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Diagnosing the lesion was challenging and initially two types of malignancies were considered: rhabdomyosarcoma and lymphoma. Conjunctival MALT lymphoma is the commonest malignant orbital tumour and it is characteristically described as a "salmon-patch" on the conjunctiva often arising from the fornix. However, it characteristically presents later in life than the age of the patient (median 65 years). On the other hand, rhabdomyosarcoma is a common primary orbital malignancy that can present with conjunctival swelling starting in the superonasal segment. The majority of cases are observed in the first 10 years of life and progress rapidly giving rise to visual disturbances due to proptosis or limited EOM. Other differentials to consider include malignant processes such as ocular infiltration secondary to multiple myeloma or infective causes such as nodular anterior scleritis, chlamydia, herpetic infection, papilloma, tuberculosis and migratory phlyctenulosis.

The histological report of the excised mass demonstrated a population of large atypical centroblastic CD20 positive cells. These large proliferating B cells are representative of EBV in the active latent stage. A T-cell mediated response against the rapidly dividing B cells usually occurs in non-immunocompromised individuals. Hence, the conjunctival enlargement was the result of the accumulation of histiocytes, pleomorphic lymphoid and plasma cells. Additionally, thirty to forty percent of both B and T cell nuclei expressed Epstein-Barr encoded RNAs (EBERs). Multiple polyclonal cell populations were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) looking for TCR or IGH gene rearrangements. This was in keeping with a reactive, rather than a neoplastic process.

Serology revealed the presence of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and EBV capsid antigen immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies. Viral EB DNA was detected at low levels at less than 1000 copies/ml. This serological profile was consistent with the histological findings of a recent acute immunoreactive process against EBV. Notably, the presence of EBNA IgG was indicative of the virus establishing latency following primary infection (the serological genome detection assay was performed 42 days after the initial presentation).
