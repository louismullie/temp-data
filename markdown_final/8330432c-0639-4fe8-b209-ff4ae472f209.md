## Question

What is the correlation between amiodarone half-life and its efficacy in atrial fibrillation management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how amiodarone's long half-life correlates with its efficacy in atrial fibrillation management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetic foundation, especially the half-life and tissue distribution. Then, I should verify the time course of clinical effect and how that maps onto loading and maintenance strategies. Next, I will examine comparative efficacy data for rhythm and rate control, followed by the persistence of effect after discontinuation. After that, I need to consider the downside of the long half-life, including adverse effects and drug interactions. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and synthesize a practical, individualized approach to dosing and monitoring, making sure I double-check any numeric ranges and reconcile any discrepancies along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic foundation. Amiodarone exhibits multi-compartment kinetics with a very large volume of distribution due to extensive tissue accumulation, especially in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs, and it is highly protein bound, which together explain prolonged persistence in the body [^115iy61E]. The terminal elimination half-life is long and variable, typically cited around 53–58 days on average with a wide range, and the active metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA) has a similarly prolonged half-life, reinforcing sustained pharmacologic activity even as plasma levels decline [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E]. Wait, let me verify the numeric ranges because different summaries cite different intervals; the FDA labeling and contemporary guideline tables consistently describe oral half-lives spanning roughly 26–107 days and IV 9–36 days, with means near 53–58 days, which aligns with the clinical observation of weeks-to-months persistence after discontinuation [^1119uY8x] [^112EFACu].

> I will now examine how this pharmacokinetic profile translates into the time course of clinical effect. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite high lipophilicity and large Vd, antiarrhythmic effects are not immediate; clinically meaningful rhythm effects generally begin after 2–3 days and typically require 1–3 weeks even with loading, reflecting the need to saturate tissue stores and accumulate DEA, which correlates more closely with ventricular class III effects than parent drug levels alone [^111bf2wS] [^115iy61E]. I should double-check the guidance on loading: guidelines endorse total loading doses of about 6–10 g over 2–4 weeks, often combining IV and oral routes, to accelerate achievement of therapeutic tissue concentrations and shorten the time to steady-state, which otherwise would take many months without loading [^112EFACu] [^111woD2f].

> Next, I should review comparative efficacy for rhythm control. Let me verify the pivotal data: in the SAFE-T trial, amiodarone significantly prolonged median time to AF recurrence to 487 days versus 74 days with sotalol and 6 days with placebo, establishing superiority for maintenance of sinus rhythm, with similar conversion rates across groups but markedly better durability with amiodarone [^111CTYsf] [^111wNZ5j]. I need to ensure consistency with earlier guidance: older ACC/AHA/ESC summaries also reported higher maintenance of sinus rhythm with amiodarone compared with class I agents and sotalol, reinforcing its position as the most effective pharmacologic rhythm-control agent despite extracardiac toxicity concerns [^116zAysj] [^115rDbb3]. But wait, what if heart disease modifies this? In ischemic heart disease, SAFE-T showed no significant difference between amiodarone and sotalol, reminding me that subgroup context matters when extrapolating superiority claims [^111CTYsf].

> Now, I should consider rate control and special populations. Let me verify acute settings: in critically ill patients or those with decompensated HF where beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are ineffective or contraindicated, IV amiodarone is recommended for acute rate control, leveraging its multichannel effects and hemodynamic profile in LV dysfunction [^116MWexS] [^114m34W5]. I should confirm chronic rate control guidance: oral amiodarone can be considered for long-term rate control only in highly selected patients after other options fail, given toxicity, which aligns with its role as a second-line agent for rate rather than a first choice [^112RemVt] [^115t7p4w]. Hold on, I should verify the caveat about onset: unlike ibutilide, which often converts within 30–90 minutes, IV amiodarone for pharmacologic cardioversion typically requires 8–12 hours, so expectations for rapid conversion must be set appropriately [^1137Z9YZ] [^112dv7xh].

> I will now examine the persistence of effect after discontinuation. The long half-life confers a pharmacokinetic reservoir such that antiarrhythmic effects can persist for weeks to months after stopping therapy, and importantly, if AF recurs and amiodarone is resumed, re-establishment of control is often faster because tissue stores are not fully depleted, which is a practical advantage in intermittent strategies or toxicity-driven interruptions [^111bf2wS]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: this persistence also means that drug interactions and proarrhythmic risks may continue after cessation, so I need to plan for prolonged washout when initiating interacting drugs or performing procedural washouts [^116FNwa9].

> But wait, what about the downside of such a long half-life? I need to ensure I weigh toxicity and interactions. Amiodarone is associated with pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, thyroid dysfunction, bradycardia, QT prolongation, and corneal deposits, and the risk is dose and duration related, which is why guidelines favor the lowest effective dose and ongoing surveillance when used long term [^113we7UH] [^1111eHN8]. I should double-check drug–drug interactions: amiodarone inhibits multiple CYPs and P-gp, so interactions with warfarin, digoxin, statins, and other QT-prolonging agents can persist for weeks to months after discontinuation, necessitating proactive dose adjustments and monitoring during initiation and tapering [^116FNwa9] [^111woD2f]. Hold on, I should verify thyroid considerations: given the iodine load and direct thyroid effects, periodic thyroid function testing is essential during chronic therapy [^111SLjpo].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my synthesis aligns with standards. Contemporary ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guidance recommends amiodarone as a reasonable option for long-term rhythm maintenance, particularly in patients with HFrEF or when other antiarrhythmics are ineffective or contraindicated, while emphasizing extracardiac toxicity and the need for careful selection and monitoring [^1111eHN8] [^1116xxXV]. ESC/EACTS guidance similarly supports amiodarone in AF with HFrEF requiring long-term antiarrhythmic therapy, again with toxicity surveillance, reinforcing its niche in structural heart disease contexts [^113wfZqX]. I should confirm acute guidance: IV amiodarone is reasonable for pharmacologic cardioversion, acknowledging slower onset than ibutilide, and for acute rate control in selected hemodynamically significant scenarios, which matches the pharmacokinetic-delayed but durable profile we expect [^113tBRif] [^116MWexS].

> Let me think about practical dosing and monitoring, and I should double-check ranges. Typical loading uses 6–10 g total over 2–4 weeks, often 400–800 mg/day in divided doses, followed by maintenance 100–200 mg/day, with the principle of using the lowest effective chronic dose to mitigate toxicity while preserving efficacy [^112EFACu] [^111woD2f]. I need to ensure I incorporate monitoring: baseline and periodic liver and thyroid function tests, pulmonary symptom surveillance, ECG assessment of rhythm, PR, QRS, and QT, and vigilance for bradycardia or drug interactions are standard, with closer follow-up during initiation and dose changes [^116YPiry] [^113we7UH]. Hold on, I should verify the steady-state point: without loading, steady-state would take roughly 130–535 days; loading materially shortens this, but even then, full antiarrhythmic effect may continue to accrue over weeks, so patience and individualized titration are key [^1119uY8x] [^111bf2wS].

> I should now synthesize the correlation explicitly. The long half-life and extensive tissue distribution create a pharmacokinetic reservoir that sustains antiarrhythmic effect, enabling superior durability of sinus rhythm maintenance compared with shorter half-life agents, and providing persistent benefit after discontinuation or during re-initiation, which directly underpins amiodarone's high efficacy in AF rhythm control at the cost of delayed onset and prolonged washout [^111CTYsf] [^111bf2wS]. Let me reconsider whether this is simply "more is better" pharmacodynamics; in fact, the delayed but sustained effect is mechanistically linked to tissue accumulation and DEA activity, which explains why loading is effective and why low maintenance doses can remain efficacious once stores are saturated, even as plasma levels fluctuate [^115iy61E] [^1119uY8x].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaways are actionable and balanced. Amiodarone's long half-life is both the source of its superior efficacy for maintaining sinus rhythm and the driver of its most significant limitations, namely delayed onset, prolonged drug–drug interaction liability, and cumulative toxicity; therefore, use should be reserved for appropriate indications, employ structured loading to reach effect sooner, minimize chronic dosing to the lowest effective level, and maintain rigorous surveillance for extracardiac adverse effects and interactions throughout therapy and after discontinuation [^112EFACu] [^116FNwa9] [^113we7UH]. Hold on, I should verify one last point: in patients in whom rapid conversion is needed, ibutilide or electrical cardioversion should be prioritized, with amiodarone considered for rhythm maintenance or when structural heart disease constrains other options, which aligns with both pharmacokinetics and guideline hierarchies [^113tBRif] [^113wfZqX].

---

Amiodarone's long half-life (20–100 days) [^111DPb7Q] is central to its **high efficacy** in atrial fibrillation (AF) by sustaining therapeutic tissue levels and sinus rhythm with once-daily dosing [^111woD2f]. This prolonged effect also explains the **delayed onset** (days to weeks) [^111bf2wS] and the need for loading doses to reach steady state [^1119uY8x]. The long half-life causes persistent antiarrhythmic activity after discontinuation, which can both maintain rhythm and prolong drug interactions [^116FNwa9]; therefore, clinicians should individualize dosing and monitor closely for toxicity [^116YPiry].

## Pharmacokinetic properties of amiodarone

Amiodarone exhibits **unique pharmacokinetic properties** that distinguish it from other antiarrhythmic drugs:

- **Half-life**: The terminal elimination half-life of amiodarone ranges from 20 to 100 days [^111DPb7Q], with a mean of approximately 53 days [^115iy61E]. The active metabolite, desethylamiodarone (DEA), has a similar half-life of about 36 days [^1119uY8x].

- **Volume of distribution**: Amiodarone has a large volume of distribution (approximately 60 L/kg) [^115iy61E], reflecting extensive tissue accumulation, particularly in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs such as the liver, lungs, and spleen [^115iy61E].

- **Metabolism and excretion**: Amiodarone is metabolized primarily by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A and CYP2C8) [^1119uY8x] and excreted mainly through biliary pathways. Neither amiodarone nor its metabolite is dialyzable [^1119uY8x].

---

## Relationship between half-life and clinical efficacy

The prolonged half-life of amiodarone directly influences its **clinical efficacy** in AF management:

- **Sustained therapeutic levels**: The long half-life ensures that therapeutic levels are maintained in cardiac tissues, providing continuous antiarrhythmic effects even after dosing interruptions or missed doses [^111bf2wS].

- **Delayed onset of action**: Clinical effects typically appear after 2 to 3 days [^111bf2wS], with maximal efficacy achieved within 1 to 3 weeks following initiation or dose adjustments. This delayed onset necessitates loading doses to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels [^111bf2wS].

- **Persistence of effect**: After discontinuation, amiodarone's antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks to months [^111bf2wS] due to its extensive tissue accumulation, which can be beneficial in maintaining sinus rhythm but also poses challenges in managing adverse effects or drug interactions [^116FNwa9].

---

## Clinical implications of prolonged half-life

The prolonged half-life of amiodarone has several important **clinical implications**:

- **Loading doses**: To achieve rapid therapeutic levels, amiodarone requires loading doses (typically 6–10 g total) [^112EFACu] administered over several weeks, followed by maintenance doses of 100–200 mg daily [^112EFACu].

- **Maintenance therapy**: Once therapeutic levels are achieved, amiodarone's long half-life allows for once-daily dosing, simplifying long-term management and improving patient adherence [^111woD2f].

- **Drug interactions**: Amiodarone's prolonged half-life means that drug interactions can persist for weeks to months after discontinuation [^116FNwa9]. Clinicians must carefully monitor and adjust concomitant medications, particularly warfarin, digoxin, and other antiarrhythmics [^111woD2f].

- **Adverse effects**: The prolonged half-life contributes to the accumulation of amiodarone in tissues, increasing the risk of adverse effects such as pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and corneal deposits [^113we7UH]. Regular monitoring of liver and thyroid function is essential during long-term therapy [^111SLjpo].

---

## Comparative efficacy with other antiarrhythmic drugs

Amiodarone's prolonged half-life and unique pharmacokinetics contribute to its **superior efficacy** compared with other antiarrhythmic drugs:

- **Superior rhythm control**: Clinical trials have demonstrated that amiodarone is more effective than sotalol, propafenone, and other antiarrhythmic drugs in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF [^111CTYsf] [^116zAysj].

- **Versatility**: Amiodarone's efficacy extends to patients with structural heart disease, heart failure, and other complex clinical scenarios, making it a preferred choice in these populations [^115rDbb3].

- **Delayed but sustained effect**: While amiodarone's onset of action is slower than some other antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g. ibutilide) [^112dv7xh], its sustained therapeutic effect provides long-lasting rhythm control [^111bf2wS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **individualized dosing** and careful monitoring when using amiodarone:

- **Individualized dosing**: Maintenance doses should be individualized based on patient response, tolerability, and clinical context, with careful consideration of the drug's prolonged half-life and tissue accumulation [^117BM19S].

- **Regular monitoring**: Patients receiving amiodarone require regular monitoring of liver and thyroid function, pulmonary status, and ophthalmologic examinations to detect and manage adverse effects early [^111SLjpo].

- **Cautious use**: Amiodarone is generally reserved for patients who have failed or cannot tolerate other antiarrhythmic drugs due to its potential for significant adverse effects [^1111eHN8].

---

Amiodarone's long half-life is a **key determinant of its high efficacy** in AF management, enabling sustained therapeutic levels, once-daily dosing, and durable rhythm control. This prolonged effect also necessitates careful dosing, monitoring, and management of drug interactions and adverse effects to optimize clinical outcomes.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

Amiodarone — comparative maintenance of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) shows higher efficacy than several alternatives, with amiodarone maintaining sinus rhythm (69% vs. 39%) over a 16-month follow-up period; in the AFFIRM study, 62% treated with amiodarone remained in sinus rhythm at 1 y compared with 23% on class I agents, and in another randomized comparison 60% versus 38% sustained sinus rhythm with amiodarone versus sotalol. However, 18% stopped amiodarone because of side effects after a mean of 468 d compared with 11% on sotalol or propafenone.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Agents with proven efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) — evidence summary and amiodarone: Thirty-six controlled trials evaluating 7 antiarrhythmic drugs for maintenance were identified, including 14 trials in paroxysmal AF and 22 trials in persistent AF. Available evidence suggests that amiodarone is more effective than either class I drugs, sotalol, or placebo for long-term maintenance in patients refractory to other drugs, but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of potentially severe extracardiac toxic effects, making it a second-line or last-resort agent in many cases. The use of low-dose amiodarone (200 mg daily or less) may be effective and associated with fewer side effects. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or previous myocardial infarction (MI), amiodarone is associated with a low risk of proarrhythmia, making it an appropriate initial choice to prevent recurrent AF in these situations, and it provides the added benefit of effective rate control, frequently eliminating the need for other drugs to control the ventricular rate. In the CTAF trial context, a majority of the 403 patients had first-time paroxysmal (46%) or persistent (54%) AF of less than 6-month duration.

Amiodarone — postcardioversion outcomes in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) indicate superiority over quinidine and effectiveness in longer-term maintenance: after 6 mo, amiodarone resulted in 83% of patients remaining in sinus rhythm versus 43% with quinidine, and after 9 mo, 18 of 27 (67%) on amiodarone were in sinus rhythm versus 2 of 17 (12%) taking quinidine. Amiodarone increases the success rate of electric cardioversion and prevents relapses by suppressing atrial ectopy in patients with persistent AF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

### Role of amiodarone in reducing atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery in adults [^111yZYtp]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a common occurrence after cardiac surgery and the source of financial expenditure and complications. A critical literature review was undertaken to examine the use of amiodarone therapy to prevent or manage atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. Evidence strongly suggests that perioperative treatment of cardiac patients with amiodarone may reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation with minimal adverse effects. Further study is warranted to determine the optimal timing and dosing, for the drug's most cost-effective use.

Nonselective ion channel–blocking drugs for atrial fibrillation — azimilide, dronedarone, and tedisamil: Azimilide has a long elimination half-life (114 h), allowing for once-daily administration, and in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia trials at doses of 100 and 125 mg daily it prolonged time to recurrence of AF and atrial flutter and reduced symptoms associated with recurrence; in a placebo-controlled trial involving 3717 survivors of MI with LV systolic dysfunction, azimilide, 100 mg daily, was associated with a 1-y mortality rate similar to placebo, with major adverse effects of severe neutropenia (less than 500 cells per microliter) in 0.9% and torsades de pointes in 0.5%. Dronedarone is a noniodinated amiodarone derivative that, in a randomized placebo-controlled study involving 204 patients undergoing cardioversion of persistent AF, at 800 mg daily delayed first recurrence from 5.3 to 60 d; higher doses (1200 and 1600 mg daily) were no more effective and were associated with gastrointestinal side effects, and to date neither organ toxicity nor proarrhythmia has been reported; in EURIDIS and ADONIS, dronedarone prolonged the time to first documented AF/atrial flutter recurrence and helped control the ventricular rate. Tedisamil blocks several potassium channels and causes a reverse rate-dependent QT-interval prolongation, and Tedisamil (4.0 and 0.6 mg/kg) was superior to placebo for rapid conversion (within 35 min) of recent-onset AF or atrial flutter, with main side effects of pain at the injection site and ventricular tachycardia.

### Effects of dronedarone started rapidly after amiodarone discontinuation [^111DPb7Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple studies have shown that amiodarone is effective in treating atrial fibrillation (AF), but is associated with a relatively high incidence of side effects; however, due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life (20–100 days), physicians may hesitate to start other drugs until it has fully cleared.

Hypothesis

A rapid switch from amiodarone to dronedarone is feasible.

Methods

EURIDIS and ADONIS were double-blind, multinational, parallel-group trials comparing the efficacy and safety of dronedarone with placebo over 12 months. This retrospective subanalysis of EURIDIS/ADONIS compared the effects of dronedarone in patients discontinuing amiodarone within 2 days before randomization ("rapid switch") with results in patients who had received no amiodarone during the 2 months preceding randomization.

Results

In total, 1237 patients were enrolled ("rapid switch", n = 154; "no amiodarone", n = 1014). In both the "rapid switch" and the "no amiodarone" groups, dronedarone users had significantly lower AF recurrence than patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.44–0.95; P = 0.0224 and HR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.67–0.92; P = 0.0027, respectively). Dronedarone users had a higher incidence of bradyarrhythmic events than placebo-treated patients. A "rapid switch" from amiodarone to dronedarone was associated with a higher incidence of serious heart failure events and heart failure hospitalizations versus all other groups. Overall event rates were low and there was no significant difference in total adverse event rates or deaths between groups.

Conclusion

In this patient population, a switch from amiodarone to dronedarone within a 2-day time frame might be feasible in certain patient categories, but further investigation is warranted.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone versus amiodarone in persistent AF: In a short-term, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 504 patients with persistent AF, dronedarone was less effective than amiodarone in decreasing AF recurrence but was better tolerated; the primary composite endpoint of recurrence of AF or premature study discontinuation occurred in 75.1% with dronedarone versus 58.8% with amiodarone at 12 months (HR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.98; P < 0.0001), premature discontinuation occurred in 10.4% versus 13.3%, and main safety endpoints were 39.3% versus 44.5% (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.07; P = 0.129).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) — amiodarone for prevention of recurrent AF around electrical cardioversion: In patients with persistent AF, treatment with amiodarone for 6 wk before and after cardioversion increased the conversion rate and the likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm and reduced supraventricular ectopic activity that may trigger recurrent AF, and prophylactic treatment with amiodarone was also effective when an initial attempt at direct-current cardioversion had failed. In patients with persistent AF randomly assigned to carvedilol, amiodarone, or placebo 6 d before direct-current cardioversion, the 2 drugs yielded similar cardioversion rates, but amiodarone proved superior at maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion.

### Medical management of atrial fibrillation: future directions [^114LANvJ]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia that requires treatment, and although ablation is appropriate in many cases, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy remains the first and most appropriate therapy in most patients. Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs are limited by modest efficacy and significant toxicity. Cardiac toxicity relates to effects on the ventricle, especially in prolonging the QT interval and causing torsades de pointes. Amiodarone, an agent with multiple antiarrhythmic effects, is unique in its relative lack of pro-arrhythmia, although its non-cardiac toxicities limit its use. Some investigational agents are directed at multiple ion channels, or are designed to be analogs of amiodarone. The other line of investigation focuses on the antiarrhythmic action of agents that affect novel ion channel targets. Basic and early clinical studies show promise for drugs that provide atrial antiarrhythmic effects without ventricular pro-arrhythmia by affecting the atrium preferentially or selectively (inhibiting the I(TO) and I(Kur) currents, respectively). Future drugs may possess preferential effects on the remodeled atrium (and as such would be selective for patients with atrial fibrillation). It is hoped that efforts to develop new drugs, including those with preferential effects on the atrium, will provide therapy with greater efficacy and safety.

After a 28 d run-in, spontaneous conversion occurred in 27% with amiodarone, 24% with sotalol, and 0.8% with placebo; among those not converted pharmacologically, direct-current shocks failed in 28%, 26.5%, and 32%, respectively. Median time to AF recurrence favored amiodarone (487 d) versus sotalol (74 d) or placebo (6 d), while in ischemic heart disease the median time did not differ between amiodarone (569 d) and sotalol (428 d).

### Role of amiodarone in the era of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator [^116zkZFK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is one of the most frequently used antiarrhythmic drugs in clinical practice. In patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom rhythm control is judged desirable, amiodarone is the most effective therapy. Amiodarone effectively prevents atrial fibrillation and may improve quality of life, but there is no evidence that it decreases mortality or severe morbidity in atrial fibrillation. In patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone may decrease mortality to a small degree, but the evidence for this benefit is incomplete. Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators frequently require antiarrhythmic drug therapy, especially to treat electrical storm. Amiodarone is useful in these patients; however, it may increase defibrillation thresholds in some patients. In patients with out-of-hospital DC shock-resistant VF, amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available to assist in resuscitation. Amiodarone is a complicated drug, and its optimal use requires careful patient surveillance with respect to potential adverse effects.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^114cfQvB]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with new-onset AF who are treated with amiodarone should receive a loading dose, immediately followed by an infusion. Clinicians should consider continuing amiodarone infusions in patients who are receiving inotropes until the inotrope is ceased. Patients who have pre-existing congestive cardiac failure or SIRS diagnosed on admission into ICU are at a greater risk of recurrence of AF. Vigilance of magnesium replacement, avoiding excessive volume depletion and the resolution of SIRS would appear a reasonable approach to limit AF recurrence, particularly as many known parameters are managed routinely within a tight range for patients in the ICU. A clear dosing guide is not available and further research is required to elicit the best dosing strategy.

### Amiodarone, anticoagulation, and clinical events in patients with atrial fibrillation: insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^116KmeGT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is an effective medication in preventing atrial fibrillation (AF), but it interferes with the metabolism of warfarin.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the association of major thrombotic clinical events and bleeding with the use of amiodarone in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial.

Methods

Baseline characteristics of patients who received amiodarone at randomization were compared with those who did not receive amiodarone. The interaction between randomized treatment and amiodarone was tested using a Cox model, with main effects for randomized treatment and amiodarone and their interaction. Matching on the basis of a propensity score was used to compare patients who received and who did not receive amiodarone at the time of randomization.

Results

In ARISTOTLE, 2,051 (11.4%) patients received amiodarone at randomization. Patients on warfarin and amiodarone had time in the therapeutic range that was lower than patients not on amiodarone (56.5% vs. 63.0%; p < 0.0001). More amiodarone-treated patients had a stroke or a systemic embolism (1.58%/year vs. 1.19%/year; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.10; p = 0.0322). Overall mortality and major bleeding rates were elevated, but were not significantly different in amiodarone-treated patients and patients not on amiodarone. When comparing apixaban with warfarin, patients who received amiodarone had a stroke or a systemic embolism rate of 1.24%/year versus 1.85%/year (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40 to 1.15), death of 4.15%/year versus 5.65%/year (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.98), and major bleeding of 1.86%/year versus 3.06%/year (HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.96). In patients who did not receive amiodarone, the stroke or systemic embolism rate was 1.29%/year versus 1.57%/year (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.00), death was 3.43%/year versus 3.68%/year (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.05), and major bleeding was 2.18%/year versus 3.03%/year (HR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.84). The interaction p values for amiodarone use by apixaban treatment effects were not significant.

Conclusions

Amiodarone use was associated with significantly increased stroke and systemic embolism risk and a lower time in the therapeutic range when used with warfarin. Apixaban consistently reduced the rate of stroke and systemic embolism, death, and major bleeding compared with warfarin in amiodarone-treated patients and patients who were not on amiodarone.

Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in atrial fibrillation — A frequent issue is whether to initiate therapy in hospital or on an outpatient basis, with concern for serious adverse effects including torsades de pointes; virtually all pharmacological cardioversion studies (except those with low-dose oral amiodarone) have involved hospitalized patients, but one study provided a clinically useful approach with out-of-hospital patient-controlled conversion using class IC drugs. The pill-in-the-pocket strategy consists of self-administration of a single oral dose shortly after the onset of symptomatic AF to improve quality of life, decrease hospital admission, and reduce cost. Recommendations differ for paroxysmal versus persistent AF: for paroxysmal AF the aims are to terminate an episode or prevent recurrence, whereas for persistent AF the aims are to achieve pharmacological cardioversion, obviate direct-current cardioversion, or enhance its success by lowering the defibrillation threshold and prevent early recurrence. In patients with lone AF without structural heart disease, class IC drugs may be initiated on an outpatient basis, and for other selected patients without sinus or AV node dysfunction, bundle-branch block, QT-interval prolongation, the Brugada syndrome, or structural heart disease, pill-in-the-pocket administration of propafenone and flecainide outside the hospital becomes an option once treatment has proved safe in hospital.

Monitoring and dose adjustment when initiating antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation — trans-telephonic monitoring or other methods of ECG surveillance may be used to monitor rhythm and conduction; the PR interval (when flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone are used), QRS duration (with flecainide or propafenone), and QT interval (with dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone) should be measured; antiarrhythmic drugs should be started at a relatively low dose and titrated based on response with the ECG reassessed after each dose change; heart rate should be monitored at approximately weekly intervals; the dose of other rate-control medication should be reduced when the rate slows after initiation of amiodarone and stopped if it slows excessively; concomitant drug therapies should be monitored closely, and the doses of digoxin and warfarin should usually be reduced upon initiation of amiodarone due to anticipated rises in serum digoxin levels and INR.

### Continuous vs episodic prophylactic treatment with amiodarone for the prevention of atrial fibrillation: a randomized trial [^116fjBXm]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Amiodarone effectively suppresses atrial fibrillation but causes many adverse events.

Objective

To compare major events in patients randomized to receive episodic amiodarone treatment with those who received continuous amiodarone treatment while still aiming to prevent atrial fibrillation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized trial of 209 ambulatory patients with recurrent symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation, conducted from December 2002 through March 2007 at 7 Dutch medical centers.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either episodic or continuous amiodarone treatment after electrical cardioversion following amiodarone loading. Episodic amiodarone treatment was discontinued after a month of sinus rhythm and reinitiated if atrial fibrillation relapsed (1 month peri-electrical cardioversion). In the continuous treatment group amiodarone was maintained throughout.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was a composite of amiodarone and underlying heart disease-related major events. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Results

After a median follow-up of 2.1 years (range, 0.4–2.5 years), 51 (48%) of those receiving episodic treatment vs 64 (62%) receiving continuous treatment had sinus rhythm (P = 0.05). There were 85 atrial fibrillation recurrences (80%) among the episodic treatment group vs 56 (54%) in the continuous treatment group (P < .001). No significant difference existed in the incidence of the primary composite end point between each group (37 [35%] episodic vs 34 [33%] continuous; incidence rate difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2 to 10.6). However, there were nonstatistically significant differences in the incidence of amiodarone-related major events (20 [19%] episodic vs 25 [24%] continuous; incidence rate difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -8.7 to 4.6) and underlying heart disease-related major events (17 [16%] episodic vs 9 [9%] continuous; incidence rate difference, 3.6; 95% CI, -1.6 to 8.7). All-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations were higher among those receiving episodic treatment (56 [53%] vs 35 [34%], P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this study population, there was no difference in the composite of amiodarone and cardiac major adverse events between groups. However, patients receiving episodic treatment had a significantly increased rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence and a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

### Role of new drugs for management of atrial fibrillation [^113YfEFN]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of newer agents in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Data Sources

EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched (up to June 2012) combining medication names with atrial fibrillation, humans, clinical trials, and pharmacoeconomic. References of the articles identified and www.clinicaltrials.gov were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were limited to the English language with clinical or pharmacoeconomic end points followed by the consensus of 3 authors.

Data Synthesis

Formulated to reduce some of the adverse effects associated with amiodarone by removing the iodine component, dronedarone has improved clinical outcomes over placebo when used in paroxysmal or persistent AF; however, it is less efficacious than amiodarone. Worse outcomes with dronedarone have been seen in patients with heart failure or permanent AF. It has not been compared to antiarrhythmic agents other than amiodarone, and pharmacoeconomic evaluations are lacking. Dabigatran 150 mg is superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism and has been associated with lower rates of vascular-associated mortality. Although the rates of major bleeding were not significantly different between the 2 agents, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial infarction occurred more frequently with dabigatran. Dabigatran appears to have the most pharmacoeconomic benefit over warfarin in patients with a higher risk of stroke. Rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, with no difference in the rates of major bleeding. Cost-effectiveness studies have not been performed with this agent at this time. In patients with AF who were not suitable candidates for warfarin, apixaban is superior to aspirin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism without increasing the risk for major bleeding. Additionally, apixaban is superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, results in fewer bleeding events, and is associated with lower mortality. Apixaban is not cost-effective against aspirin when used for a short duration but gains superiority with prolonged use or in patients with higher risks of stroke. Additionally, apixaban appears to offer a pharmacoeconomic advantage over warfarin at no to minimal cost. Each new anticoagulant lacks a reversal agent and an assay to detect the presence of the anticoagulant, as well as long-term data when used in the clinical setting.

Conclusions

Use of dronedarone should be limited to patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and should not be used in patients with heart failure or with permanent AF. Newer antithrombotic agents appear to be promising alternatives for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF; however, more data are needed to understand their role.

Atrial fibrillation — treatment algorithm for pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm lists options by left ventricular (LV) function and setting. In patients with normal LV function, IV amiodarone or ibutilide (2a) are listed, and procainamide may be considered when amiodarone and ibutilide are not optimal; recommend avoidance of IV procainamide after amiodarone or ibutilide. For heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; LVEF ≤ 40%), IV amiodarone (2a) is listed. For AF occurring outside the hospital in patients with normal LV function ("pill‑in‑the‑pocket"), flecainide or propafenone (2a) are listed. Use is "in the absence of preexcitation", the first dose is administered in a monitored facility, and IV amiodarone requires several hours for efficacy whereas ibutilide is generally effective in 30 to 90 min but carries higher risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.

### The future of atrial fibrillation therapy [^113g53JD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Today management of atrial fibrillation (AF) centers on restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm or control of the ventricular rate response to AF. Current guidelines state that rhythm and rate control strategies should be considered therapeutically equivalent, but recognize that no "one size fits all", an approach consistent with growing recognition of the heterogeneity of AF. As data from the Sotalol Amiodarone Atrial Fibrillation Efficacy Trial clearly demonstrate, conventional antiarrhythmics have a role in highly symptomatic AF accompanied by decreased quality of life. However, for many AF patients such drugs lack efficacy, have potentially serious side effects, and are poorly tolerated. In parallel with the development of more effective and safer antiarrhythmics, nontraditional approaches to prevention and treatment of AF are being explored. Treatments not considered "antiarrhythmic" that may prevent or forestall AF include aggressive antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and some, but not all, beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists, especially when used as adjunctive therapy. Other approaches include statins, steroids, and fish oil to reduce atrial fibrosis and inflammation, and pacemakers to prevent bradycardia-mediated AF and as a pacing preventive strategy in selected patients. Ablative techniques with potential to cure AF are gaining popularity, but are not yet simple, straightforward, and risk-free procedures. In the future, treatment of AF will progress beyond today's focus on AF as a purely electrocardiographic disease toward a patient and context-specific management strategy involving multiple treatment modalities.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Effect of obesity on the use of antiarrhythmics in adults with atrial fibrillation: a narrative review [^116PDhua]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4.1 Amiodarone

The results from two of the four studies in this review showed that the clearance of amiodarone is influenced by BMI, and a higher dose of amiodarone can be given to extremely obese patients (> 40 kg/m²). These findings appear to be aligned with other published works that investigated the effect of weight on the pharmacokinetics of amiodarone. It is postulated that the altered pharmacokinetics of amiodarone in obesity may be influenced by reduced hepatic metabolism and increased levels of amiodarone‐binding proteins. Amiodarone has been used for decades to help manage arrhythmia in patients with AF. Together with digoxin, it accounts for 80% of the prescribed medication regimens in developing countries. Despite the history of amiodarone, the pharmacokinetic profile is yet to be truly understood. It is incompletely and erratically absorbed following oral administration. The drug undergoes first‐pass metabolism in the gut wall and/or in the liver and the bioavailability ranges from 22% to 86%. The half‐life of amiodarone ranges from 14 to 110 days but in most cases, it ranges from 14 to 59 days. Due to its markedly lipophilic property and in turn its high Vd (50–100 L/kg), it is extensively distributed in the adipose tissue where it can be up to 125 times that in blood. Consequently, in theory, it can be assumed that morbidly obese patients (> 40 kg/m²), who have a larger Vd for amiodarone, would require a higher dose to achieve therapeutic levels. The findings from Lafuente‐Lafuente et al. and Ornelas‐Loredo et al. were the only two studies that contrasted with other studies in this review. Ornelas‐Loredo et al. showed that the therapeutic response to Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone) is similar in both the obese and healthy‐weight patients. Similarly, Lafuente‐Lafuente et al. concluded that there was no evidence to suggest the accumulation of amiodarone in the adipose tissue after long‐term use, but the participants in this study did not qualify as obese according to the WHO criteria (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²).

### Amiodarone therapy for atrial rhythm control: insights gained from a single center experience [^111JhZKr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone has been advocated as an effective "long-term" therapy for atrial rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to assess the sustainability of this therapeutic strategy.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis of a consecutive, single-center cohort (n = 168) with symptomatic AF who were treated with amiodarone and followed for 3 years. The incidence of amiodarone cessation was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years and attributed principally to drug inefficacy, intolerance, or toxicity. A gradual diminution in the number of patients on therapy was observed, such that by 3 years, only 45% remained. This was attributable to inefficacy (25%), intolerance (12%), or toxicity (18%). Pulmonary toxicity was surprisingly common, occurring in at least 7% of patients.

Conclusions

These data challenge the notion of amiodarone as a reasonable "destination" therapy for AF.

Atrial fibrillation — ibutilide and amiodarone efficacy, timing, and safety are summarized as follows. Randomized, double‑blind placebo‑controlled studies report ibutilide achieves AF conversion rates of about 30% versus 2% with placebo, with greater efficacy in atrial flutter (38%-63%), and most patients convert within 30 to 90 minutes. Ibutilide is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes; risk is higher with reduced LVEF, HFrEF is an independent risk factor, and ibutilide is best avoided when LVEF ≤ 40%; a magnesium infusion immediately before ibutilide may mitigate torsades and excessive QT prolongation. Intravenous amiodarone is effective for conversion; a meta‑analysis reported relative risks for sinus rhythm at 6 to 8 hours and at 24 hours of 1.23 (P = 0.022) and 1.44 (P < 0.001), respectively, and cardioversion with IV amiodarone requires 8 to 12 hours compared with a much shorter response time with ibutilide.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — digoxin provides limited rate control with delayed onset, is not first-line for rapid management, and has important adverse effects and interactions. Although intravenous digoxin may slow the ventricular response to AF at rest, there is a delay of at least 60 min before onset and the peak effect does not develop for up to 6 h; digoxin is no more effective than placebo in converting AF to sinus rhythm, in a review of 139 episodes of paroxysmal AF there was no difference between those taking digoxin and those not, and digoxin is no longer considered first-line therapy for rapid management of AF except in patients with HF or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or in very sedentary patients. According to a systematic review, digoxin alone slows resting heart rate by an average of 4 to 21 beats per minute but does not slow heart rate during exercise in AF; the most frequent adverse effects are ventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular (AV) block, and sinus pauses, and serum digoxin concentration may rise with verapamil or antiarrhythmic agents such as propafenone or amiodarone.

### Dronedarone: an emerging agent with rhythm-and rate-controlling effects [^111hTztG]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Of current antiarrhythmic agents, amiodarone is among the most effective with the additional advantage of having little proarrhythmic potential. However, it can cause potentially serious extracardiac side effects, stimulating the search for safer derivatives. Dronedarone, a new antiarrhythmic drug that is structurally related to amiodarone, lacks an iodine moiety and, thus, amiodarone's iodine-related organ toxicity, while its methane sulfonyl group decreases lipophilicity so shortening half-life and decreasing tissue accumulation. Electrophysiological studies show that dronedarone shares amiodarone's multichannel blocking effects, inhibiting transmembrane Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), and slow L-type calcium channels, as well as its antiadrenergic effects. Unlike amiodarone, it has little effect at thyroid receptors. Possessing both rate- and rhythm-control properties, dronedarone has proved safe and effective in preventing recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with persistent AF in the Dronedarone Atrial Fibrillation Study After Electrical Cardioversion (DAFNE) trial, the first prospective randomized trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety. Dronedarone has since undergone further extensive evaluation in three pivotal phase III trials. In two sister studies, the European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS) and American-Australian-African Trial with Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter Patients for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (ADONIS), dronedarone 400 mg b.i.d. showed significant efficacy against placebo in prevention of AF recurrence. Additionally, in patients with permanent AF, dronedarone was highly effective at controlling ventricular rate on top of standard rate-controlling therapies in the Efficacy and Safety of Dronedarone for the Control of Ventricular Rate during Atrial Fibrillation (ERATO) study.

### Dronedarone: an amiodarone analog for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter [^117JEc24]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety profile of dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using the search terms dronedarone, SR 33589, atrial fibrillation, and antiarrhythmic medication in MEDLINE (1966-February 2007), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2007), and EMBASE (1990-February 2007). References from the identified trials and selected review articles were evaluated. Additional information, including abstracts and posters, was obtained from Sanofi-Aventis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Published studies and meeting abstracts evaluating the effects of dronedarone in humans and animals were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Dronedarone is a novel antiarrhythmic medication to treat atrial fibrillation. Dronedarone has a multifaceted mechanism of action similar to that of amiodarone. Dronedarone works by blocking potassium, sodium, and calcium channels and exhibits antiadrenergic properties. The drug has been evaluated at doses of 400, 600, and 800 mg twice daily. It prolonged the time to atrial fibrillation recurrence to 60–158 days compared with 5–59 days with placebo and decreased heart rate during atrial fibrillation by 12–25 beats/min in clinical trials. Major adverse events include gastrointestinal side effects and risk of proarrhythmia. Dronedarone may increase the risk of mortality in patients with congestive heart failure.

Conclusions

Dronedarone is a new antiarrhythmic agent for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Further studies are needed to better define dronedarone's safety profile and place in therapy.

Atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery — supportive text on rate/rhythm control and anticoagulation states that "The use of beta blockers to control heart rate is well documented" and that "Calcium channel blockers are an option for rate control when beta blockers are ineffective". Rate control or rhythm control "are both acceptable options in hemodynamically stable patients" because "neither has a distinct clinical advantage over the other based on a randomized study that included 529 patients", and "patients in the rhythm-control group received amiodarone". "Cardioversion of patients with sustained postoperative AF is regularly performed", "routinely combined with pharmacological therapy, especially amiodarone". A review of "8 observational studies that included 15 335 patients found a protective impact on the mortality rate at 5 years but no differences in thromboembolic events" with anticoagulants. "In general, the duration of anticoagulation is a minimum of 60 days"; in a randomized trial, if AF "remained" or "recurrent" "48 hours after randomization, anticoagulation was recommended to be continued for 60 days, unless complications occurred", and "Patients should be evaluated before discontinuation to determine underlying rhythm". Postdischarge, "The need for a rhythm-control strategy should be evaluated", as patients on rate control "often convert spontaneously after 6 to 8 weeks", with "earlier discharge" for hemodynamically stable patients; those not converting "can be managed accordingly with rhythm-control strategy". For poorly controlled AF, "cardioversion is reasonable", and for those with " > 48 hours" of AF, "imaging of the LA (even if surgically closed) should be considered".

Amiodarone and liver injury

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug used in the treatment of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, including AF, which is associated with asymptomatic elevations in liver biochemical tests in up to 30% of patients after intravenous administration, or among those who use amiodarone long term. Symptomatic hepatitis or liver failure and cirrhosis from amiodarone is fortunately very rare (0–3% of amiodarone users), but the risk is higher for prolonged users and with high doses. In a meta-analysis of approximately 740 patients on low-dose amiodarone for at least 1 year, there were no statistically significant increases in gastrointestinal or liver-related adverse events compared with placebo. Amiodarone-induced liver injury includes steatosis and steatohepatitis and can be difficult to distinguish from NAFLD. Because amiodarone concentrates in the liver and has a relatively long half-life, amiodarone-induced liver injury can take time to resolve and may even become apparent after amiodarone has been discontinued.

Elimination

Following single dose administration in 12 healthy subjects, amiodarone hydrochloride exhibited multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics with a mean apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life of 58 days (range 15 to 142 days) for amiodarone and 36 days (range 14 to 75 days) for the active metabolite (DEA). In patients, following discontinuation of chronic oral therapy, amiodarone hydrochloride has been shown to have a biphasic elimination with an initial 50% reduction of plasma levels after 2.5 to 10 days. A much slower terminal plasma-elimination phase shows a half-life of the parent compound ranging from 26 to 107 days, with a mean of approximately 53 days and most patients in the 40- to 55-day range. In the absence of a loading-dose period, steady-state plasma concentrations, at constant oral dosing, would therefore be reached between 130 and 535 days, with an average of 265 days. For the metabolite, the mean plasma-elimination half-life was approximately 61 days. These data probably reflect an initial elimination of drug from well-perfused tissue (the 2.5- to 10-day half-life phase), followed by a terminal phase representing extremely slow elimination from poorly perfused tissue compartments such as fat.

The considerable inter-subject variation in both phases of elimination, as well as uncertainty as to what compartment is critical to drug effect, requires attention to individual responses once arrhythmia control is achieved with loading doses because the correct maintenance dose is determined, in part, by the elimination rates. Individualize maintenance doses of Pacerone tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Metabolism

Amiodarone is metabolized to DEA by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme group, specifically CYP3A and CYP2C8. The CYP3A isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines. In vitro, amiodarone and DEA exhibit a potential to inhibit CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Amiodarone and DEA have also a potential to inhibit some transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter (OCT2).

Excretion

Amiodarone is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and there is negligible excretion of amiodarone or DEA in urine. Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable.

### Practical regimen for amiodarone use in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation [^113XnhQz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 5% to 65% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Although postoperative atrial fibrillation is often regarded as a temporary, benign, operation-related problem, it is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of adverse events, including permanent or transient stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial included 250 eligible consecutively enrolled patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). They received 300 mg of amiodarone/placebo administered intravenously over 20 minutes on the first postoperative day and an oral dose of 600 mg of amiodarone or placebo twice daily for the first 5 postoperative days.

Results

The patients in amiodarone prophylaxis experienced a reduction in risk of atrial fibrillation of 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0% to 24%), with the number needed to treat at 6.9 (95% CI, 4.2 to 20), and the results for symptomatic atrial fibrillation showed a risk reduction of 18% (95% CI, 9.4% to 26), with the number needed to treat at 5.7 (95% CI, 3.9 to 11). Of the patients who developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group, 84% experienced a symptomatic attack versus only 43% in the amiodarone group.

Conclusions

Postoperative prophylaxis with a high dose of oral amiodarone after an intravenous bolus infusion is a safe, practical, feasible, and effective regimen for CABG patients. It significantly diminishes the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Amiodarone use for the prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requires drug loading over a period of several days to weeks, whereas class 1C agents do not. Three hundred thirty-nine patients were evaluated during drug loading with amiodarone or class 1C agents, and it was found that recurrent arrhythmia was common, usually not persistent, and frequently asymptomatic. Recurrent arrhythmia was not more common with amiodarone.

### Effects of amiodarone therapy on thyroid function [^115cXa2K]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone is a benzofuran derivative approved for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Traditionally classified as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, amiodarone possesses electrophysiologic properties of all four Vaughan-Williams classes. This drug, however, has high iodine content, and this feature plus the intrinsic effects on the body make amiodarone especially toxic to the thyroid gland. Treatment can result in a range of effects from mild derangements in thyroid function to overt hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis and treatment of amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is usually straightforward, whereas that of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and the ability to distinguish between the type 1 and type 2 forms of the disease are much more challenging. Dronedarone was approved in 2009 for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation. As amiodarone, dronedarone is a benzofuran derivative with similar electrophysiologic properties. In contrast to amiodarone, however, dronedarone is structurally devoid of iodine and has a notably shorter half-life. In studies reported before FDA approval, dronedarone proved to be associated with significantly fewer adverse effects than amiodarone, making it a more attractive choice for patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, who are at risk of developing amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction.

Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

Coronary artery disease with atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic selection emphasizes beta blockers first, sotalol preference, and cautious use of other agents. In stable coronary artery disease (CAD), beta blockers may be considered first but supporting evidence is limited to 2 studies, and efficacy for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent AF is not convincing. When additional therapy is needed, sotalol has substantial beta-blocking activity and may be the preferred initial antiarrhythmic agent in ischemic heart disease due to less long-term toxicity than amiodarone. Amiodarone increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker implantation in elderly AF patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) but may be preferred over sotalol in patients with heart failure (HF). Neither flecainide nor propafenone is recommended; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide may be considered as third-line choices. Regarding dofetilide, post-MI data from DIAMOND-MI support a second-line role, whereas in CAD without MI or HF it remains uncertain whether benefits outweigh risk and more experience is needed before it can be recommended even as second line.

### Amiodarone versus sotalol for atrial fibrillation [^111CTYsf]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

The optimal pharmacologic means to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation remains controversial.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 665 patients who were receiving anticoagulants and had persistent atrial fibrillation to receive amiodarone (267 patients), sotalol (261 patients), or placebo (137 patients) and monitored them for 1 to 4.5 years. The primary end point was the time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation beginning on day 28, determined by means of weekly transtelephonic monitoring.

Results

Spontaneous conversion occurred in 27.1 percent of the amiodarone group, 24.2 percent of the sotalol group, and 0.8 percent of the placebo group, and direct-current cardioversion failed in 27.7 percent, 26.5 percent, and 32.1 percent, respectively. The median times to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation were 487 days in the amiodarone group, 74 days in the sotalol group, and 6 days in the placebo group according to intention to treat and 809, 209, and 13 days, respectively, according to treatment received. Amiodarone was superior to sotalol (P < 0.001) and to placebo (P < 0.001), and sotalol was superior to placebo (P < 0.001). In patients with ischemic heart disease, the median time to a recurrence of atrial fibrillation was 569 days with amiodarone therapy and 428 days with sotalol therapy (P = 0.53). Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm significantly improved the quality of life and exercise capacity. There were no significant differences in major adverse events among the three groups.

Conclusions

Amiodarone and sotalol are equally efficacious in converting atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Amiodarone is superior for maintaining sinus rhythm, but both drugs have similar efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Sustained sinus rhythm is associated with an improved quality of life and improved exercise performance.

### Amiodarone after surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation: is it really necessary? A prospective randomized controlled trial [^11142CQA]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment is a well-established practice after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is controversial after surgical ablation. This prospective randomized controlled trial examined whether amiodarone after surgical ablation reduced atrial arrhythmia recurrence within the first 3 months after surgery.

Methods

Ninety patients were randomized to receive (n = 45) or not receive (n = 45) amiodarone after surgical ablation. Rhythm status was ascertained via clinical follow-up and 72-hour continuous monitoring at 6 and 12 weeks, using Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. Primary outcome was defined as atrial arrhythmia recurrence, cardioversion, ablation, or crossover from no-amiodarone to amiodarone as a result of atrial arrhythmia during follow-up. An intention-to-treat approach was used.

Results

The 2 study groups were similar in traditional predictors for failure, including left atrium size (5.0 vs 5.1 cm, P = 0.734), median AF duration (23 vs 20 months, P = 0.513), and long-standing persistent AF (44% vs 33%, P = 0.280). The primary outcome occurred in 52% of the no-amiodarone group (23 of 44) and 19% of the amiodarone group (8 of 43; p = 0.001). Cumulative freedom from primary outcome was greater in the amiodarone group (81.4% vs 47.7%, P < .001). Amiodarone was discontinued in 18 patients randomized to amiodarone for side effects, bradycardia, or noncompliance.

Conclusions

Prophylactic amiodarone reduced early atrial arrhythmia recurrence. These results are consistent with catheter AF ablation findings and should inform recommendations for prophylactic class I/III AAD after surgical AF ablation, regardless of discharge rhythm status. As previously recommended, monitoring for side effects and amiodarone discontinuation by 3 months, for patients in sinus rhythm, is warranted.

Clinical Trial Registration

### Relationship between amiodarone response prior to ablation and 1-year outcomes of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^116EFc71]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common therapeutic strategy for patients with either paroxysmal AF (PAF) or persistent AF (persAF), but long-term ablation success rates are imperfect. Maintenance of sinus rhythm immediately before ablation with antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in patients undergoing ablation. Amiodarone has superior efficacy relative to other AADs. Whether failure of amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm before ablation for either PAF or persAF is associated with poor outcomes is unknown.

Methods

A total of 307 patients who received amiodarone in a 1-year window before undergoing catheter ablation for AF were included. Patients were divided into amiodarone success (n = 183) and amiodarone failure (n = 124) groups based on the response to pre-ablation amiodarone treatment. Analysis of procedural outcomes as a function of response to amiodarone therapy was performed. Patients were followed for at least 12 months postablation, to assess outcomes (adverse events and arrhythmia recurrence). Procedural success was defined by the absence of documented arrhythmia (> 30s) without any antiarrhythmic agents beyond a 90-day blanking period.

Results

Following ablation for either PAF or persAF, freedom from any recurrent atrial arrhythmia at 1 year was 57.7% for the entire cohort. One-year freedom from recurrent arrhythmia in the amiodarone success group was comparable to that in the amiodarone failure group (55.7% vs. 60.5%; p = .54). Success rates following ablation did not vary by the response to amiodarone when analyzed for PAF or persAF subgroups.

Conclusion

Failure to restore and maintain sinus rhythm with amiodarone before ablation for either PAF or persAF is not a predictor of ablation procedural failure. Amiodarone failure alone should not deter practitioners from considering ablation therapy for patients with AF.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 atrial fibrillation — pharmacological rate control (Class I): Measurement of the heart rate at rest and control of the rate with pharmacological agents are recommended for persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) (Level of Evidence: B). In the absence of preexcitation, intravenous beta blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are recommended to slow the ventricular response to AF in the acute setting, with caution in hypotension or heart failure (HF) (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous digoxin or amiodarone is recommended to control heart rate in patients with AF and HF without an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). For patients with activity-related AF symptoms, adequacy of rate control should be assessed during exercise and pharmacological treatment adjusted to keep the rate in the physiologic range (Level of Evidence: C). Oral digoxin is effective to control resting heart rate in AF and is indicated for HF, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, or sedentary individuals (Level of Evidence: C).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure arrhythmia management — supraventricular rhythm control — notes that given its relatively rapid onset of action and superior safety profile in HF, intravenous amiodarone for life-threatening arrhythmias during acute HF has gained widespread acceptance, and in acutely ill HF, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter may impose hemodynamic decompensation requiring aggressive therapy; poorly tolerated SVT may be better treated acutely by synchronous cardioversion at relatively low energies (e.g., 50 to 100 J biphasic), verapamil may be effective for recurrent AV node–dependent SVTs but care should be taken due to negative inotropic effects, and intravenous amiodarone may be more effective at rate control of AF or atrial flutter and may restore sinus rhythm; in HF, amiodarone alone or with electrical cardioversion is effective at slowing the heart rate and achieving cardioversion, and for unstable arrhythmia cardioversion is appropriate with amiodarone preferred for longer-term administration and generally well tolerated hemodynamically.

Atrial fibrillation — propafenone for cardioversion: reported cardioversion of recent-onset AF ranged from 56% to 83%, and oral propafenone was as efficacious as flecainide but superior to oral amiodarone and quinidine plus digoxin. Limited data suggest reduced efficacy in patients with persistent AF, in conversion of atrial flutter, and in patients with structural heart disease. Adverse effects are uncommon but include rapid atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, intraventricular conduction disturbances, hypotension, and bradycardia on conversion. Available data on propafenone loading in organic heart disease are scant; this agent should be used cautiously or not at all for conversion of AF in such cases and should be avoided in patients with HF or severe obstructive lung disease.

### Amiodarone and thyroid physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1113fAZY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Although amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic agent, its use is limited by a wide variety of potential toxicities. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive "bench to bedside" overview of the ways amiodarone influences thyroid function. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The search was limited to English-language reports published between 1950 and 2017. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, hypothyroidism, myxedema, hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and electrical storm. Google and Google scholar as well as bibliographies of identified articles were reviewed for additional references. We included 163 germane references in this review. Because amiodarone is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs in the United States, the mechanistic, diagnostic and therapeutic information provided is relevant for practicing clinicians in a wide range of medical specialties.

Atrial fibrillation — general antiarrhythmic drug therapy and monitoring: Before administering any antiarrhythmic agent, reversible precipitants of AF should be identified and corrected, and patients who develop HF in association with alcohol intake should abstain from alcohol consumption. When treatment with a single antiarrhythmic drug fails, combinations may be tried; useful combinations include a beta blocker, sotalol, or amiodarone with a class IC agent, and the combination of a calcium channel blocker, such as diltiazem, with a class IC agent, such as flecainide or propafenone, is advantageous in some patients. A drug that is initially safe may become proarrhythmic if coronary disease or HF develops or with interacting medications; thus, the patient should be alerted to the potential significance of such symptoms as syncope, angina, or dyspnea and warned about the use of noncardiac drugs that might prolong the QT interval. With class IC drugs, prolongation of the QRS interval should not exceed 50%, and for class IA or class III drugs, with the possible exception of amiodarone, the corrected QT interval in sinus rhythm should be kept below 520 ms; exercise testing may help detect QRS widening that occurs only at rapid heart rates. During follow-up, plasma potassium and magnesium levels and renal function should be checked periodically, and in individual patients, serial noninvasive assessment of LV function is indicated, especially when clinical HF develops during treatment of AF.

Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation — recommendations and agents — is outlined as follows: For patients with AF, pharmacological cardioversion is reasonable as an alternative to electrical cardioversion for those who are hemodynamically stable or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed (COR 2a, LOE C‑LD). For patients with AF, ibutilide is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion for patients without depressed LV function (LVEF < 40%) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, intravenous amiodarone is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion, although time to conversion is generally longer than with other agents (8–12 hours) (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with recurrent AF occurring outside the hospital, the "pill‑in‑the‑pocket" approach with a single oral dose of flecainide† or propafenone,‡ with a concomitant atrioventricular nodal blocking agent,† is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion if previously tested in a monitored setting (COR 2a, LOE A). For patients with AF, use of intravenous procainamide may be considered for pharmacological cardioversion when other intravenous agents are contraindicated or not preferred (COR 2b, LOE B‑R). Ibutilide works rapidly for pharmacological cardioversion of AF but is associated with QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with HFrEF.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^117BM19S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The considerable inter-subject variation in both phases of elimination, as well as uncertainty as to what compartment is critical to drug effect, requires attention to individual responses once arrhythmia control is achieved with loading doses because the correct maintenance dose is determined, in part, by the elimination rates. Individualize maintenance doses of amiodarone hydrochloride [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Metabolism

Amiodarone is metabolized to DEA by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme group, specifically CYP3A and CYP2C8. The CYP3A isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines. In vitro, amiodarone and DEA exhibit a potential to inhibit CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Amiodarone and DEA have also a potential to inhibit some transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter (OCT2).

Excretion

Amiodarone is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and there is negligible excretion of amiodarone or DEA in urine. Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable.

Specific Populations

Effect of Age: Normal subjects over 65 years of age show lower clearances (about 100 mL/hr/kg) than younger subjects (about 150 mL/hr/kg) and an increase in t½from about 20 to 47 days.

### Efficacy and safety of dronedarone versus placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation stratified according to renal function: post hoc analyses of the EURIDIS-ADONIS trials [^114x9RtV]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are common cardiac arrhythmias that are often symptomatic and responsible for around one‐third of all arrhythmia‐related hospitalizations. Although anticoagulation medication and heart rate control can significantly improve symptoms and decrease risks, restoration of sinus rhythm can further reduce symptoms and greatly improve exercise capacity and quality of life. One antiarrhythmic drug (AAD), dronedarone, has been proven to reduce cardiovascular hospitalizations or death in people with AF/AFL, complementing the findings of the EAST‐AFNET4 trial of early rhythm control, and highlighting an important therapeutic goal for individuals with AF and AFL.

While amiodarone is a potent AAD, it can cause serious thyroid and systemic toxic side effects in some patients. A post hoc analysis of the BALKAN‐AF survey found that patients with CKD received amiodarone almost exclusively for rhythm control, indicating that there is a need for increased understanding of the safety and efficacy of other available therapeutic options. Dronedarone has a similar pharmacological profile to amiodarone, but demonstrates a reduced risk of toxicities, likely due to its increased water solubility, decreased half‐life, and absence of iodine. Compared to the Vaughan Williams class Ic drugs and sotalol, renal elimination of dronedarone is minimal, with just 6% excreted in urine. Various randomized controlled trials and real‐world studies have investigated the impact of dronedarone on AF burden and cardiovascular hospitalization. These studies include the European Trial in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients Receiving Dronedarone for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (EURIDIS, NCT00259428) and the American–Australian–African Trial with Dronedarone in Atrial Fibrillation or Flutter Patients for the Maintenance of Sinus Rhythm (ADONIS, NCT00259376), which were identical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of dronedarone for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with non‐permanent AF or AFL. Both trials demonstrated that dronedarone treatment resulted in significantly increased median time to first AF/AFL recurrence, significantly reduced ventricular rate during first AF/AFL recurrence, and significantly reduced rate of hospitalization or death.

Atrial fibrillation — pharmacological enhancement of direct-current cardioversion recommendations are as follows. Class IIa: Pretreatment with amiodarone, flecainide, ibutilide, propafenone, or sotalol can be useful to enhance the success of direct-current cardioversion and prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation. (Level of Evidence: B) In patients who relapse to AF after successful cardioversion, it can be useful to repeat the procedure following prophylactic administration of an antiarrhythmic medication. (Level of Evidence: C) Class IIb: For patients with persistent AF, administration of beta blockers, disopyramide, diltiazem, dofetilide, procainamide, or verapamil may be considered, although the efficacy of these agents to enhance the success of direct-current cardioversion or to prevent early recurrence of AF is uncertain. (Level of Evidence: C) Out-of-hospital initiation of antiarrhythmic medications may be considered in patients without heart disease to enhance the success of cardioversion of AF. (Level of Evidence: C) Out-of-hospital administration of antiarrhythmic medications may be considered to enhance the success of cardioversion of AF in patients with certain forms of heart disease once the safety of the drug has been verified for the patient.

### Rapid loading of sotalol or amiodarone for management of recent onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation: a randomized, digoxin-controlled trial [^1178XVrt]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone and sotalol are commonly used for the maintenance of sinus rhythm, but the efficacy of these agents administered as high-dose infusions for rapid conversion of atrial fibrillation is unknown. Use in this context would facilitate drug initiation in patients in whom ongoing prophylactic therapy is indicated.

Methods

We assessed the efficacy and safety of rapid high-dose intravenous infusions of amiodarone and sotalol for heart rate control and rapid reversion to sinus rhythm in patients who came to the emergency department with recent-onset symptomatic atrial fibrillation. Patients (n = 140) were randomized to receive 1.5mg/kg of sotalol infused in 10 minutes, 10mg/kg of amiodarone in 30 minutes, or 500 microg of digoxin in 20 minutes. Electrical cardioversion was attempted for patients not converting to sinus rhythm within 12 hours.

Results

The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone resulted in more rapid rate control than digoxin. Each of the 3 trial strategies resulted in similar rates of pharmacological conversion to sinus rhythm (amiodarone, 51%; sotalol, 44%; digoxin, 50%; P = not significant). The overall rates of cardioversion after trial drug infusion and defibrillation were high for all groups (amiodarone, 94%; sotalol, 95%; digoxin, 98%; P = not significant), but there was a trend toward a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions in the amiodarone group.

Conclusion

The rapid infusion of sotalol or amiodarone in patients with symptomatic recent-onset atrial fibrillation results in rapid control of ventricular rate. Even with high-dose rapid infusions, all 3 agents are associated with a poor overall reversion rate within 12 hours. Almost all patients were returned to sinus rhythm with a combination of pharmacological therapy and electrical cardioversion.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

Amiodarone hydrochloride has a very large but variable volume of distribution, averaging about 60 L/kg, because of extensive accumulation in various sites, especially adipose tissue and highly perfused organs, such as the liver, lung, and spleen.

One major metabolite of amiodarone hydrochloride, DEA, has been identified in man; it accumulates to an even greater extent in almost all tissues. No data are available on the activity of DEA in humans, but in animals, it has significant electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects generally similar to amiodarone itself. DEA's precise role and contribution to the antiarrhythmic activity of oral amiodarone are not certain. The development of maximal ventricular class III effects after oral amiodarone hydrochloride administration in humans correlates more closely with DEA accumulation over time than with amiodarone accumulation.

Elimination

Following single dose administration in 12 healthy subjects, amiodarone hydrochloride exhibited multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics with a mean apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life of 58 days (range 15 to 142 days) for amiodarone and 36 days (range 14 to 75 days) for the active metabolite (DEA). In patients, following discontinuation of chronic oral therapy, amiodarone hydrochloride has been shown to have a biphasic elimination with an initial 50% reduction of plasma levels after 2.5 to 10 days. A much slower terminal plasma- elimination phase shows a half-life of the parent compound ranging from 26 to 107 days, with a mean of approximately 53 days and most patients in the 40- to 55-day range. In the absence of a loading-dose period, steady-state plasma concentrations, at constant oral dosing, would therefore be reached between 130 and 535 days, with an average of 265 days. For the metabolite, the mean plasma- elimination half-life was approximately 61 days. These data probably reflect an initial elimination of drug from well-perfused tissue (the 2.5- to 10-day half-life phase), followed by a terminal phase representing extremely slow elimination from poorly perfused tissue compartments such as fat.

### Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation… [^114wFord]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in many European countries but is labeled in the United States only for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Its success in restoring a sinus rhythm has been inconsistent in clinical trials, with success rates ranging from 16 to 92 percent. In addition, concerns exist about the toxicity of amiodarone. Vardas and colleagues performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amiodarone in the treatment of atrial fibrillation of long or short duration. Within the first hour of the study, 41 of the patients in the amiodarone group and 25 of those in the placebo group converted to a sinus rhythm. By the end of 24 hours, 25 additional patients in the amiodarone group had converted to sinus rhythm, compared with 15 patients in the placebo group. Thus, by the end of the first day, conversion to normal sinus rhythm had occurred in 61.

1 percent of the amiodarone group and
40. 0 percent of the placebo group. Between the second day and the 30th day, 21 additional patients who received amiodarone converted to sinus rhythm, compared with no patients in the placebo group. In all, 87 of the patients who received amiodarone converted to sinus rhythm by the 30th day, compared with 40 of the persons in the placebo group. Compared with patients who did not have successful conversion, those who converted to sinus rhythm had atrial fibrillation of a shorter duration and smaller atria. Twelve patients who received amiodarone became hypotensive during the infusion and 17 developed phlebitis at the infusion site. Cessation of therapy because of adverse effects was not required in any of the patients. The authors conclude that amiodarone is a safe and effective method for termination of atrial fibrillation.

While the conversion rate was generally high following administration of amiodarone, it fell to a relatively low level in patients with a very large left atrium or with chronic fibrillation. The conversion rate in patients with a large left atrium was 61 percent, and it was 34. 6 percent in those with chronic atrial fibrillation. The authors believe amiodarone could be a drug of first choice for atrial fibrillation, unless rapid conversion is needed.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring… [^1175fb6f]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Indications LONG-TERM TREATMENT Amiodarone is approved for use in the secondary prevention of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The North American Society for Pacing and Electrophysiology recommends amiodarone as the antiarrhythmic agent of choice in patients who have survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly those with left ventricular dysfunction. 4 Studies on the use of amiodarone for the primary prevention of sudden death in high-risk patients have had mixed results. One meta-analysis of 13 studies of patients with congestive heart failure or recent myocardial infarction showed a small reduction in total annual mortality, from 12. 3 percent to
10. 9 percent. 5 The benefit of amiodarone therapy was more pronounced in the patients who had congestive heart failure, with treatment reducing the annual mortality rate from 24.

3 percent to
19. 9 percent. 10 Several smaller studies have shown that amiodarone is similar to quinidine and sotalol in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in these patients. 11, 12 In one randomized controlled trial, 12 sinus rhythm was maintained successfully for 16 months in 65 percent of patients treated with amiodarone, compared with 37 percent of patients treated with sotalol or propafenone. 16 However, these guidelines list amiodarone as being only "possibly effective" for the treatment of refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In contrast, a recent study comparing the use of amiodarone and lidocaine in patients with shock-resistant, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation showed that amiodarone therapy substantially improves survival and hospital admission rates.
17.

Intravenously administered amiodarone is being used with increasing frequency in the acute treatment of atrial fibrillation. In a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs, amiodarone was similar to other antiarrhythmic drugs in its ability to convert patients to normal sinus rhythm.

### Effectiveness of amiodarone for conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm… [^111VCkqv]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Results Twenty-one studies met eligibility criteria. Duration of AF proved to be a source of heterogeneity, leading to 2 analyses. The relative risk for achieving sinus rhythm was 4. 33 for trials with mean AF duration of greater than 48 hours and

1. 40 for those with AF of 48 hours or less. The risk differences for these 2 groups were 27% and 26%, respectively, yielding a number needed to treat of 4 for both groups. The low control event rate among trials with long duration of AF, compared with that of trials with a duration of 48 hours or less, explained the difference in the RR for conversion. We found that the size of the left atrium, presence of cardiovascular disease, and protocols of amiodarone administration did not influence the magnitude of effect. Serious adverse events were infrequent.

Our secondary outcomes were mortality and adverse events, but we did not exclude from the primary analysis studies that failed to report these outcomes. For a study that enrolled patients with AF complicating acute myocardial infarction and did not report the mean duration of AF, 16 we assumed the duration to be less than 48 hours. Figure 2 depicts the RRs and 95% CIs for conversion to sinus rhythm with amiodarone compared with control treatments for each of the 21 studies and 2 pooled RRs, 1 for each of the 2 subgroups according to the mean AF duration. The pooled analysis demonstrated an RR for conversion to sinus rhythm of 1.
40. The lower boundary of the CI at

1. 25 reflects that amiodarone would be at least 25% more effective than placebo or control drugs to convert AF to sinus rhythm. The funnel plot did not show evidence of publication bias.

The rate of spontaneous conversion in the control group in the 5 studies that enrolled patients with a longer AF duration was far lower than the event rate in the control group of 15 studies that enrolled patients with short AF duration. The difference between RR and absolute risk reductions is a function of the statistical properties of both measures.

### Amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation… [^111RPp6K]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Five percent of persons older than 65 years experience atrial fibrillation — the most common cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical treatment. Complications associated with atrial fibrillation include congestive heart failure and reduced exercise tolerance. This condition also increases the risk of stroke fourfold in patients not receiving anticoagulation. It is often possible to restore patients with atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm through cardioversion or with medical therapy; however, the arrhythmia recurs within six months in one half of patients. Data from several small trials have indicated that amiodarone is more effective than other antiarrhythmic agents in treating atrial fibrillation. Roy and colleagues conducted a large, prospective, randomized trial comparing amiodarone with sotalol and propafenone in the prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation. Patients were seen at three months after randomization, and every six months thereafter.

The primary end point was the length of time to a first electrocardiographically confirmed recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Secondary end points were thromboembolic events, death and adverse events caused by the study drugs. A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study. There were slightly more men than women, and the mean age for both groups of patients was 65 ± 11 years. During a mean follow-up period of 468 ± 150 days, 71 patients in the amiodarone group had a recurrence of atrial fibrillation compared with 127 patients who were given sotalol or propafenone. With regard to major clinical events, nine deaths occurred in the amiodarone group and eight deaths in the patients receiving sotalol or propafenone. Eighteen percent of patients in the amiodarone group required treatment for a major clinical event compared with 17 percent in the second group. However, strokes and intracranial hemorrhages were less common in the amiodarone group.

On the basis of their data, the authors conclude that amiodarone is significantly more effective than sotalol or propafenone in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. In this study, where the dosage of amiodarone was 200 mg per day, the incidence of adverse events was quite low. The authors suggest that amiodarone should become the drug of choice for use in patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation and structural heart disease.

### Amiodarone in the management of refractory atrial fibrillation… [^116ahXBy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Thirty-eight patients were studied to evaluate amiodarone hydrochloride in the treatment of refractory atrial fibrillation. Among them were 25 with sustained atrial fibrillation and 13 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. All patients were symptomatic and refractory to therapeutic doses of at least two conventional drug trials, and patients with atrial fibrillation had relapsed from electroversion. Amiodarone hydrochloride was administered in doses of 5 mg/kg intravenously, then 600 to 800 mg/d for seven to ten days, followed by 200 to 400 mg/d. Holter recordings were obtained every one to three months. The effect of amiodarone on the ventricular rate during sustained atrial fibrillation was evaluated in 18 patients and decreased from 99/min at baseline to 75/min at follow-up before conversion. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm occurred in 19 patients, including 11 with and eight without directcurrent cardioversion.

During long-term treatment, sinus rhythm was sustained on an average of 16 months in 20 patients. This included 11 of 25 patients with sustained atrial fibrillation and nine of 13 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with only four of these patients relapsing. Four patients developed intolerable side effects, but no serious toxic effects were encountered, perhaps because of the relatively low doses of amiodarone hydrochloride that were used. Amiodarone is a safe and effective alternative to standard therapy in patients with refractory sustained or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Blevins RD, Kerin NZ, Benaderet D, et al.
