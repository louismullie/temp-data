## Question

What are the causes of oligohydramnios?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of oligohydramnios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying physiology of amniotic fluid production and regulation. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism and provide a hierarchical list with examples. Next, I will verify the strength of evidence and note where data are limited. Finally, I will integrate special contexts and outline a practical diagnostic approach, making sure I double-check thresholds and guideline-based definitions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the physiological basis, because if I get the mechanism wrong, the causal framework will be shaky. After about 20 weeks, fetal urine is the dominant source of amniotic fluid, with fetal lung fluid contributing a smaller portion, and fluid homeostasis depends on balanced production and removal via fetal swallowing and intramembranous flow; thus, anything that reduces urine output, impairs swallowing, or increases fluid loss can lower amniotic fluid volume, and severe reductions can compress the fetus and impair lung development, especially in the pseudoglandular stage, which is clinically relevant for pulmonary hypoplasia risk [^518f3334] [^d4ea3d2e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize causes by mechanism to keep the taxonomy clinically actionable. The major buckets are decreased production (primarily fetal renal/urinary pathology or placental insufficiency with fetal oliguria), increased loss (premature rupture of membranes), and impaired recirculation (fetal swallowing abnormalities or obstruction), with a fourth category of idiopathic or multifactorial cases when no single cause is identified after appropriate evaluation [^518f3334] [^71dd3641].

> I will now examine decreased production due to fetal renal or urinary tract pathology, because this is a classic and often severe cause. Bilateral renal agenesis, polycystic kidney disease (especially ARPKD), lower urinary tract obstruction (posterior urethral valves, urethral atresia), and severe bilateral hydronephrosis can all reduce urine output and lead to oligohydramnios or anhydramnios; importantly, early-onset oligohydramnios in these settings predicts pulmonary hypoplasia and high mortality, and timing of onset correlates with outcome, which I should emphasize for counseling and management planning [^518f3334] [^21ebe723] [^09004e66] [^8a3dfdb1].

> Wait, let me verify the placental insufficiency pathway, because isolated oligohydramnios at term is often debated. Chronic uteroplacental insufficiency reduces fetal perfusion and triggers redistribution away from nonessential organs, decreasing renal perfusion and urine output; this mechanism links oligohydramnios with fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia, and observational data suggest isolated oligohydramnios may be a placental-mediated disorder with increased recurrence and adverse outcomes in subsequent pregnancies, though causality is hard to prove and management should be individualized [^14495a74] [^71dd3641] [^4ea2a0aa] [^708a366a].

> Next, I should review increased fluid loss, and I need to ensure I don't miss a rupture. Premature rupture of membranes, including previable PPROM, is a leading cause of oligohydramnios; prolonged oligohydramnios from PPROM is strongly associated with pulmonary hypoplasia and perinatal morbidity, and counseling should incorporate the gestational age at rupture and the severity of fluid loss, with antenatal corticosteroids and magnesium sulfate considered per local protocols to mitigate prematurity-related complications [^b5a5bc23] [^6a625734] [^a72dabd1].

> Let me consider impaired recirculation or swallowing abnormalities, and I should double-check that I'm not overstating this. Fetal anomalies that impair swallowing (e.g., esophageal atresia, facial clefts, neurologic impairment) can theoretically reduce fluid removal and paradoxically lead to polyhydramnios rather than oligohydramnios, so I should correct that initial thought; however, in the context of oligohydramnios, impaired swallowing is not a primary driver, whereas obstruction to fluid flow (e.g., cord compression, uterine constraint) can compound low volumes, and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome produces oligohydramnios in the donor twin via hypoperfusion and oliguria rather than a swallowing defect [^518f3334] [^382aef5f].

> I should confirm the idiopathic and multifactorial category, because many cases remain unexplained. Isolated oligohydramnios at term, after excluding rupture, anomalies, and growth restriction, is common and may reflect physiologic decline near term, measurement variability, or subtle placental dysfunction; importantly, using the deepest vertical pocket rather than AFI reduces overdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions without worsening outcomes, which I need to keep in mind when labeling a case as "idiopathic" [^100863f4] [^5fccdf61] [^71dd3641].

> But wait, what if medications are contributing; I need to check for iatrogenic causes. Drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan, olmesartan) can cause fetal renal dysfunction, oligohydramnios, and even anhydramnios, with risks of pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal renal failure; NSAIDs, particularly after 20 weeks, can cause oligohydramnios via renal effects and ductal constriction, and trastuzumab has postmarketing reports of oligohydramnios sequence; if exposure is identified, discontinuation and serial ultrasound monitoring are indicated, recognizing injury may already be present when oligohydramnios is first detected [^3ffbc05e] [^801fe269] [^1bcc40de] [^6edb3a92] [^3e189dd4] [^9750a992] [^42f03039] [^abba88f7] [^7437a58d] [^11b1a8df].

> Let me think about maternal and environmental contributors, and I should verify which associations are consistent. Post-term pregnancy increases the prevalence of oligohydramnios, likely via placental aging and altered aquaporin expression; in LMIC settings, malaria in pregnancy has been associated with oligohydramnios, plausibly via placental pathology and hypoperfusion; maternal dehydration or inadequate intake may modestly reduce amniotic fluid, and maternal smoking has been cited as a risk factor, though confounding is common in observational data [^59375470] [^c55d181e] [^9840adfa] [^a9971798].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and where it is weak. High-quality guidance supports placental insufficiency, rupture of membranes, and fetal urinary pathology as major causes, and recommends DVP over AFI for diagnosis; however, much of the literature on isolated oligohydramnios and recurrence risk is observational, and interventional data for amnioinfusion in PPROM are limited, so counseling should be cautious and individualized, especially when extrapolating to unique populations or early gestational ages [^100863f4] [^5fccdf61] [^d77420da].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach so I don't miss reversible or high-stakes causes. First, confirm true oligohydramnios with DVP less than 2 cm or AFI less than 5 cm and exclude rupture with a careful history, sterile speculum exam, and, if needed, biochemical testing; second, assess fetal growth and umbilical artery Doppler to evaluate for growth restriction and placental insufficiency; third, perform a detailed anatomic survey of kidneys, bladder, and urethra to detect urinary tract anomalies or obstruction; fourth, review medications for RAS blockers, NSAIDs, and trastuzumab; fifth, consider maternal factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and infections; finally, if no cause is found, label as isolated oligohydramnios and plan surveillance per gestational age and risk profile [^100863f4] [^5fccdf61] [^518f3334].

> In summary, I need to ensure the causal hierarchy is clear: decreased production from fetal renal or urinary tract disease and placental insufficiency with fetal oliguria are major causes; increased loss from rupture of membranes is common and consequential; impaired recirculation is less often a primary cause of oligohydramnios; and idiopathic cases, especially at term, are frequent but require exclusion of other etiologies. Medications, post-term physiology, and maternal conditions like malaria can contribute, and early-onset oligohydramnios signals higher risk of pulmonary hypoplasia and adverse outcomes, which should guide counseling and timing of delivery decisions [^518f3334] [^100863f4] [^09004e66] [^8a3dfdb1].

Oligohydramnios has diverse causes, but the most common are **premature rupture of membranes (PROM)** [^518f3334], **placental insufficiency** (including fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia) [^14495a74], and **fetal urinary tract anomalies** (renal agenesis, polycystic kidney disease, lower urinary tract obstruction) [^518f3334] [^21ebe723]. Other contributors include **post-term pregnancy** [^59375470], maternal dehydration, medications (NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, trastuzumab) [^3e189dd4] [^3ffbc05e] [^7437a58d], and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome [^382aef5f]. Idiopathic cases occur in **0.5–5%** of pregnancies [^de8a4b66]. Evaluation should prioritize confirming PROM, assessing placental function, and screening for fetal anomalies, as management and prognosis depend on the underlying cause and gestational age [^518f3334] [^100863f4].

## Maternal factors

- **Premature rupture of membranes (PROM)**: The most common cause, leading to chronic fluid loss and increased risk of infection and preterm labor [^518f3334] [^b5a5bc23].

- **Placental insufficiency**: Reduced uteroplacental perfusion from hypertension, preeclampsia, or FGR causes fetal oliguria and oligohydramnios [^14495a74] [^71dd3641].

- **Post-term pregnancy**: Physiologic decline in amniotic fluid after 40 weeks increases oligohydramnios risk [^59375470].

- **Maternal dehydration**: Inadequate intake can reduce amniotic fluid volume [^a9971798].

- **Medications**: NSAIDs (after 20 weeks), ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and trastuzumab can cause oligohydramnios via fetal renal effects [^3e189dd4] [^3ffbc05e] [^7437a58d].

---

## Fetal factors

- **Renal anomalies**: Bilateral renal agenesis, polycystic kidney disease, and lower urinary tract obstruction reduce urine output and cause oligohydramnios [^518f3334] [^21ebe723].

- **Chromosomal abnormalities**: Trisomy 13, 18, and 21 are associated with oligohydramnios [^notfound].

- **Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome**: The donor twin develops oligohydramnios due to hypovolemia and reduced urine output [^382aef5f].

---

## Idiopathic causes

Idiopathic oligohydramnios accounts for **0.5–5%** of cases, diagnosed after excluding other causes; it may reflect subtle placental dysfunction or transient fluid shifts [^de8a4b66] [^28a0e38a].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Oligohydramnios is associated with increased risks of **FGR, preterm birth, cord compression, meconium aspiration, and cesarean delivery** [^d1549e75] [^38921d48]. Management depends on the cause and gestational age: confirm PROM, assess placental function, and screen for fetal anomalies [^518f3334] [^100863f4]. Delivery timing is individualized; isolated oligohydramnios at term often prompts delivery at 36–37 weeks, whereas preterm cases may be managed expectantly with close surveillance [^100863f4] [^6b722a01].

---

Oligohydramnios arises from multiple causes, with **PROM, placental insufficiency, and fetal urinary anomalies** predominating; thorough evaluation and cause-specific management are essential to optimize outcomes.

Electronic fetal monitoring is a popular technology used to establish fetal well-being. Despite its widespread use, the terminology used to describe patterns seen on the monitor has not been consistent until recently. In 1997, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Research Planning Workshop published guidelines for interpretation of fetal tracings. This publication was the culmination of 2 years of work by a panel of experts in the field of fetal monitoring and was endorsed in 2005 by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. In 2008, ACOG, NICHD, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reviewed and updated the definitions for fetal heart rate patterns, interpretation, and research recommendations. Following is a summary of the terminology definitions and assumptions found in the 2008 NICHD workshop report.

### A review of amniotic fluid dynamics and the enigma of isolated oligohydramnios [^28a0e38a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Traditionally, oligohydramnios has been implemented as a sign of potential fetal compromise and associated with an increased incidence of adverse perinatal morbidity and mortality. Decreased amniotic fluid volume is especially of concern when it occurs in conjunction with structural fetal anomalies, fetal growth restriction, postdates pregnancies, and maternal disease. Consequently, following ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios at term, delivery is routinely advocated even in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies with an appropriate-for-gestational-age fetus, irrespective of the presence of reassuring fetal evaluation and the absence of maternal disease. Numerous factors complicate the ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios. These include a lack of complete detailed understanding of the physiology of the dynamics of oligohydramnios, the transient condition at times of decreased amniotic fluid volume, generally poor performance of ultrasonography in detecting oligohydramnios, an array of different ultrasound diagnostic criteria, and varying ultrasonographic thresholds. In light of the latter and the lack of prospective randomized data, is unclear that the practice of effecting delivery for isolated oligohydramnios at term is justified. This article presents physiologic dynamics of amniotic fluid, factors that may affect amniotic fluid volume, possible pitfalls in the ultrasonographic assessment of amniotic fluid volume, and the clinical significance of oligohydramnios. In addition, the literature regarding perinatal outcome associated with oligohydramnios and current available data supporting expectant noninterventional management of cases complicated by isolated oligohydramnios at term are discussed.

### Management of oligohydramnios in pregnancy [^934418d2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of oligohydramnios in pregnancy is problematic. The various mechanisms that control amniotic fluid, the inability to precisely measure and quantify the amount, and the relevance of a "decreased" amount of fluid make the management of this finding unclear. Given the limited amount of data, the single deepest vertical pocket may be a better method than the amniotic fluid index to define oligohydramnios. A large prospective study is needed to develop the most optimal management recommendations, especially for idiopathic oligohydramnios at or near term.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^708a366a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the current study points to a strong association between isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery and any main placental disorder in the subsequent delivery, especially oligohydramnios recurrence and small for gestational age neonate. Based on our results the risk for a small for gestational age neonate is increased two-fold in subsequent delivery. Accordingly, isolated oligohydramnios may be the first sign of placental insufficiency even in the absence of overt fetal growth impairment and may be an independent manifestation of the placental related complications spectrum.

Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our hypothesis, and to define the proper management in cases of isolated oligohydramnios, including establishing guidelines for follow up in subsequent pregnancies.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^e0830f08]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prenatal ultrasound findings of fetal bilateral echogenic kidneys accompanied by oligohydramnios can be highly stressful for both pregnant women and physicians. The diversity of underlying causes makes it challenging to confirm a prenatal diagnosis, predict postnatal outcomes, and counsel regarding recurrence risks in future pregnancies.

Case Presentation

We report two cases of abnormal fetal echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios detected in the early third trimester. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), a rare genetic syndrome, was initially suspected in both cases. However, postnatal diagnoses differed: the first case was confirmed as glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) through renal pathology, while the second case was diagnosed as ARPKD with a compound heterozygous likely pathogenic PKHD1 mutation.

Conclusion

Prenatal diagnosis of fetal echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios should prioritize accurate diagnosis. Given the differences in the clinical spectrum, GCKD should be considered a differential diagnosis for this condition, particularly ARPKD. This study highlights the importance and benefits of molecular diagnosis and postnatal renal pathology for precise diagnosis and effective counseling.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^f75528ac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, ultrasound screening and targeted ultrasound examinations have played the most important role in the detection of fetal malformations. Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging procedure in the world, it is extremely safe, and with the development of ultrasound systems, it has been associated with increasing imaging performance. According to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios are the two most commonly detected ultrasound abnormalities during pregnancy.

The possible causes of poly- and oligohydramnios are discussed in several publications. Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios may be associated with fetal anatomical abnormalities, fetal chromosomal abnormalities. In a study spanning four years, Hentemann et al. investigated 140 pregnancies associated with various developmental abnormalities detected by ultrasound, the authors highlighted the importance of karyotyping from amniotic fluid in cases of detected developmental abnormalities and oligohydramnios. Kouamé et al. point out that when polyhydramnios is detected, particular care must be taken during ultrasound examination in order to detect any fetal abnormalities that may be present.

### Antepartum fetal surveillance: ACOG practice bulletin, number 229 [^100863f4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Oligohydramnios — definitions and delivery timing — Commonly used definitions of oligohydramnios include a single deepest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid of 2 cm or less and an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less, and the use of a percentile of amniotic fluid should not be used in management decisions; randomized controlled trials indicate that using the deepest vertical pocket measurement, as opposed to the amniotic fluid index, to diagnose oligohydramnios is associated with a reduction in unnecessary interventions without an increase in adverse perinatal outcomes. In the setting of otherwise uncomplicated isolated and persistent oligohydramnios (deepest vertical pocket measurement less than 2 cm), delivery at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later is recommended, whereas in pregnancies at less than 36 0/7 weeks of gestation with intact membranes the decision to proceed with expectant management or delivery should be individualized based on gestational age and the maternal and fetal condition; if delivery is not undertaken, follow-up amniotic fluid volume measurements, NSTs, and fetal growth assessments are indicated, and if the oligohydramnios results from fetal membrane rupture, follow-up amniotic fluid volume assessment often may be safely omitted.

ACOG Committee Opinion 831 — timing for fetal fluid abnormalities states: oligohydramnios (isolated or otherwise uncomplicated [deepest vertical pocket less than 2 cm]) is late preterm/early term with 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later; polyhydramnios (mild, idiopathic) is full term with the note "early term birth not routinely recommended" and suggested specific timing 39 0/7–40 6/7 weeks of gestation.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^a9971798]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of fetal malformations at birth is around 2–3%. Overall, polyhydramnios occurs in 1–2% of pregnancies, but the causes of polyhydramnios remain unknown in the majority of cases. Polyhydramnios may be due to a congenital abnormality in 20% of cases, but in 60–70% of cases it is idiopathic, i.e. there is no identified cause of the increased amount of amniotic fluid.

Among the fetal malformations, amniotic fluid volume abnormalities may be associated with craniospinal, craniofacial, cardiac developmental, and other thoracic abnormalities, abdominal and abdominal wall disorders, urogenital disorders.

In the case of less than average amniotic fluid, oligohydramnios, the amount of amniotic fluid is below normal (less than 500 mL in the second and third trimesters). The possible causes of oligohydramnios are various and include: fetal abnormalities, premature rupture of the membranes, placental insufficiency, deteriorating fetal circulation, insufficient maternal fluid intake, starvation and smoking. More than average amniotic fluid, polyhydramnios, is considered to be the case when there is a larger amount of amniotic fluid. Between 26 and 38 weeks, the volume of amniotic fluid exceeds 1500 mL and is still above 1000 mL after the 38th week. It may be caused by an underlying maternal disease, a pregnancy-related condition (diabetes mellitus, diabetes gestationis), infection, fetal developmental abnormalities causing overproduction of amniotic fluid or impeding absorption or circulation, fetal circulatory abnormalities, twin pregnancies. The co-occurrence of fetal retardation and polyhydramnios may indicate chromosomal abnormalities and therefore cytogenetic testing is recommended. Most cases of mild polyhydramnios are idiopathic, and the two most common pathological causes of polyhydramnios include maternal diabetes mellitus and various fetal anomalies that may be associated with genetic syndromes. The role of maternal diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes in the development of polyhydramnios has been highlighted also by other authors. When polyhydramnios is associated with fetal macrosomia, the most common maternal etiology is inadequately controlled and managed diabetes mellitus. Untreated maternal diabetes mellitus puts the fetus at lifelong risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome, and will have a higher rate of caesarean Sects.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^ec656dd0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal echogenic kidneys, identified by an abnormally bright appearance on ultrasound compared to the liver or spleen, can indicate underlying renal abnormalities and dysfunction. While echogenic kidneys may sometimes present as an isolated finding, their association with factors such as enlargement (greater than the 95th percentile), cystic changes, reduced amniotic fluid, or a family history of renal diseases increases the likelihood of significant renal issues in the fetus. One notable condition linked to echogenic kidneys is fetal autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which typically manifests as bilaterally enlarged echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios on prenatal imaging. Other rare conditions, such as glomerulocystic kidney disease(GCKD), are less frequently prenatally reported.

After 16 weeks of gestation, fetal kidneys excrete the fetal urine to the pathway of amniotic circulation, reach the plateau around 34 weeks, steady through the rest of gestation until term, and a little decrease after 40 weeks. The fetal kidneys provide over 90% of the amniotic fluid after 20 weeks and the amniotic fluid acts as a vital sign parameter for fetal well-being. The normality of the amount of amniotic fluid reflects the development and maturity of many organ systems. The fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid is essential for lung maturity, which causes growth and branching of the distal alveolar buds during gestation. Abnormal fetal kidney functions lead to a varying degree of decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid, oligohydramnios, and anhydramnios; this can result in pulmonary hypoplasia and early neonatal death. The management of fetuses with echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios involves monitoring kidney function through amniotic fluid volume assessment, with decreased or absent fluid indicating a poorer prognosis.

Given the challenging prognosis associated with these conditions, decisions may sometimes be made to terminate the pregnancy, complicating family counseling and limiting opportunities for preimplantation and prenatal genetic diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies. Molecular genetic studies and renal pathology play crucial roles in confirming the diagnosis of a suspected case. In this reported case, we attempt to highlight an alternative differential diagnosis of a cause of fetuses presenting with prenatal ultrasound findings of bilaterally enlarged echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^a8c69582]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Fetal kidneys are among the structures evaluated during the standard fetal anatomic survey, typically performed by ultrasound at mid-trimester, around 18–22 weeks of gestational age. However, some fetal renal abnormalities may not be detected at this stage because they develop or become more apparent in the late second to third trimester. Approximately 55–60% of fetal urogenital anomalies are diagnosed in the third trimester. This is consistent with the reported cases in which prenatal diagnosis of fetal echogenic kidneys was made at 29 weeks of gestation. Increased renal echogenicity indicates abnormal renal parenchyma, suggesting the presence of multiple microscopic cysts and/or multiple interfaces of dilated renal tubules.

According to several studies, the differential prenatal diagnosis of fetal isolated bilateral enlarged echogenic kidneys involves polycystic kidney diseases, which can be assessed based on amniotic fluid volume. In the absence of urinary tract obstruction, normal amniotic fluid with echogenic kidneys suggests autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), whereas decreased or absent amniotic fluid indicates ARPKD. Both conditions are classified as renal ciliopathies. Renal ciliopathies are caused by the defect of primary cilia, the cellular organelles that extend from the surface of many cells, and defects in their structure or function can lead to various cystic phenotypes.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^d1549e75]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oligohydramnios is the commonest amniotic fluid disorder, characterized by reduced amniotic fluid or amniotic fluid volume that is less than expected for gestational age. Oligohydramnios is associated with poor maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, fetal distress, birth asphyxia, prolonged labor, and increased risk of caesarean section, often arising from umbilical cord compression, meconium aspiration, or uteroplacental insufficiency. In low-and middle-income countries, oligohydramnios accounts for approximately up to 6.5% of still births.

Oligohydramnios occurs in about 1–5% of term pregnancies worldwide; however, the prevalence rises to more than 12% in post-term pregnancies. In Africa, prevalence rates of oligohydramnios ranging from 4 to 23% have been reported previously. Additionally, several maternal, placental, and fetal factors, including ruptured amniotic membranes, fetal abnormalities, genetic factors, maternal illnesses, nutrition status, multiple pregnancies, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and use of certain angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), have been found to be associated with oligohydramnios.

8.1.4 Ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume

Professional societies do not recommend inclusion of isolated amniotic fluid volume assessment into management decisions for FGR. A decrease in amniotic fluid volume can occur as a result of fetal oliguria in response to progressive placental dysfunction and hypoxia, as well as rupture of membranes. 287, 288, 324 Accordingly, additional evaluation is required to determine the significance of decreased amniotic fluid volume. Oligohydramnios can be defined as an ultrasound measured four‐quadrant amniotic fluid index below or equal to 5 cm, or a maximum vertical amniotic fluid pocket below or equal to 2 cm. 325 Use of the latter reduces overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios and is preferred. Oligohydramnios is associated with an increased rate of intrapartum FHR abnormalities, need for cesarean section, and low 5‐minute Apgar scores, but not acidosis at birth. 326

### Oligohydramnios compromises lung cells size and interferes with epithelial-endothelial development [^d57900ea]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Severe oligohydramnios can induce pulmonary hypoplasia. However, the mechanisms by which leaking of fluids cause lung hypoplasia are not well defined. The objective of this study was to characterize a mouse model of pulmonary hypoplasia induced by oligohydramnios.

Methods

Amniotic sacs were punctured on E14.5 of gestation. Untouched fetuses were used as control. Pregnancy was allowed to continue until E18.5 in which lung tissue was collected and evaluated for morphometry, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.

Results

Our results found that lung weight, lung to total body weight ratio, and lung water content were reduced in oligohydramnios when compared to controls. In contrast, oligohydramnios did not affect the DNA content. Morphometric studies confirmed that oligohydramnios fetuses had smaller air spaces than control. Interestingly, cells from oligohydramnios fetuses have smaller size and less regular shapes. Oligohydramnios decreased the differentiation of type I epithelial cells and compromised apoptosis and angiogenesis while proliferation was not affected.

Conclusions

Although, the smaller size of the lung could be explained by a decreased of lung fluids, our data suggest that increased of external compression secondary to severe oligohydramnios can compromise cell size and interfere with epithelial and endothelial development. Type I epithelial cells could have an unrecognized key role in the differentiation of the distal lung mediated by mechanical signals.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^fdb27c5c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) is defined by cystic dilatation of Bowman's space to more than 2 to 3 times its normal size on histology. GCKD is a rare renal cystic disease with variable classification, diverse etiology, and a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Early-onset GCKD can remain stable for several years or progress to end-stage renal disease within a few years. Regarding pathogenesis, GCKD can be classified as either an isolated kidney disease or part of a genetic syndrome. The pathogenesis of cystic formation in GCKD remains elusive. Several reports suggested that GCKD occurs late in gestation due to dysplasia or tubule obstruction. Our case involved an isolated pathological kidney confirmed without other molecular findings, highlighting that isolated GCKD can present with prenatal findings similar to those of echogenic kidney conditions, particularly ARPKD. A prior review from Cramer MT and Guay-Woodford LM reported that the echogenic kidneys in GCKD can vary in size from small to normal or enlarged. This means that sonographic findings in fetuses with GCKD are difficult to distinguish from those with ARPKD if the enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios are the only isolated findings prenatally. In the group of isolated fetal echogenicity with small or normal kidney size, sporadic GCKD should be differentially diagnosed as an underlying cause, especially in negative results of prenatal molecular genetic tests.

### Pulmonary effects of prolonged oligohydramnios following mid-trimester rupture of the membranes – antenatal and postnatal management [^6a625734]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

Mid-trimester, preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) with prolonged oligohydramnios remains a challenge for both obstetricians and neonatologists. Although survival rates have improved, morbidity remains common particularly due to pulmonary insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension. The aetiology of abnormal lung development is unknown but may depend critically on pulmonary vascular development. Antenatal evaluation of at-risk foetuses by three-dimensional ultrasound and MRI is possible but the techniques need to be further assessed. Antenatal corticosteroids given in cases of PPROM reduce the incidence of neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis without increasing maternal or neonatal infection. The true risk-benefit ratio of antibiotics, tocolysis and strategies to normalise amniotic fluid volume remains less clear. There is no consensus regarding the optimal ventilation strategy to support infants with pulmonary insufficiency following PPROM, and further work is required to determine whether and which pulmonary vasodilators improve long-term outcome in these infants.

### Assessment of amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy [^518f3334]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid (AF) is an integral part of the fetal environment and is essential for fetal growth and development. Pathways of AF recirculation include the fetal lungs, swallowing, absorption through the fetal gastrointestinal tract, excretion through fetal urine production, and movement. In addition to being a marker for fetal health, adequate AF is necessary for fetal lung development, growth, and movement. The role of diagnostic imaging is to provide a detailed fetal survey, placental evaluation, and clinical correlation with maternal conditions to help identify causes of AF abnormalities and thereby enable specific therapy. Oligohydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal growth restriction as well as genitourinary issues, including renal agenesis, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and bladder outlet obstruction. Premature preterm rupture of membranes should also be clinically excluded as a cause of oligohydramnios. Clinical trials evaluating amnioinfusion are underway as a potential intervention for renal causes of oligohydramnios. Most cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, with maternal diabetes being a common cause. Polyhydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal gastrointestinal obstruction and oropharyngeal or thoracic masses, as well as neurologic or musculoskeletal anomalies. Amnioreduction is performed only for maternal indications such as symptomatic polyhydramnios causing maternal respiratory distress. Polyhydramnios with fetal growth restriction is paradoxical and can occur with maternal diabetes and hypertension. When these maternal conditions are absent, this raises concern for aneuploidy. The authors describe the pathways of AF production and circulation, US and MRI assessment of AF, disease-specific disruption of AF pathways, and an algorithmic approach to AF abnormalities. © RSNA, 2023 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

### Sildenafil citrate therapy for oligohydramnios: a randomized controlled trial [^bf743c62]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare sildenafil plus hydration with hydration alone in improving the amniotic fluid index and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by idiopathic oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index less than 5 cm without underlying maternal or fetal causes and with normal fetal growth).

Methods

This was an open-label randomized trial for women carrying singleton pregnancies at 30 weeks of gestation or more with idiopathic oligohydramnios detected during routine ultrasonogram. Women received either oral sildenafil citrate (25 mg every 8 hours) plus intravenous infusion of 2 L isotonic solution or fluids only until delivery. The primary study outcome was the amniotic fluid volume at 6 weeks of follow-up or the final volume before delivery, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes were duration of pregnancy prolongation, mode of delivery, and select neonatal outcomes. The study was powered to detect a 45% difference between groups, so, at an α level of 0.05 and 80% power, a sample size of 167 women was required.

Results

From February 24, 2015, through April 2016, 196 women were screened and 184 were randomized. Follow-up was completed in 166 (90%): 82 in the sildenafil group and 84 in the hydration group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The amniotic fluid volume was higher in the sildenafil group at the final assessment (11.5 compared with 5.4 cm, P = 0.02). The sildenafil group delivered later (38.3 compared with 36.0 weeks of gestation, P = 0.001), had a lower rate of cesarean delivery (28% compared with 73%), and their neonates were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (11% compared with 41%, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Sildenafil citrate increases amniotic fluid volume in pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios.

### Clinical relevance of sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: polyhydramnios [^be125960]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid within the amniotic cavity. The etiology of polyhydramnios may be idiopathic, the consequence of fetal structural anomalies, or the consequence of various fetal and maternal conditions. The clinical importance of polyhydramnios is found in its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes and the risk of perinatal mortality. The antenatal management of polyhydramnios can be challenging as there are no formalized guidelines on the topic. The purpose of this review is to provide a literature-based overview on the subject of polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies, demonstrate its clinical implications, and describe a practical approach to its management.

### Maternal hydration therapy improves the quantity of amniotic fluid and the pregnancy outcome in third-trimester isolated oligohydramnios: a controlled randomized institutional trial [^0a95d0e2]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Amniotic fluid is important for the maintenance of fetal well-being; therefore, an amniotic fluid deficiency, ie, oligohydramnios, can have multiple impacts on the prognosis of the pregnancy. In some cases, there are no evident fetal or maternal causes, and the condition is called isolated oligohydramnios. The aim of our study was to validate maternal intravenous and oral hydration therapy as a means for improvement of isolated oligohydramnios in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Methods

We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study on pregnancies complicated by idiopathic oligohydramnios (group A, 66 women) with a control group of women with normal pregnancies without oligohydramnios (group B, 71 women). Oligohydramnios was diagnosed using the amniotic fluid index (AFI; < 5 cm). Sonographic examinations were performed with a convex 3.5-MHz probe. Group A underwent 6 days of intravenous infusion of 1500 mL of an isotonic solution per day. An AFI measurement, a nonstress test, and a fetal biophysical profile were performed at 0 and 7 days. Group A was randomized into subgroups A1 and A2. Subgroup A1 was prescribed home oral hydration therapy of 1500 mL/d and subgroup A2 2500 mL/d. We considered the AFI to compare the effectiveness of the therapy.

Results

General features did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups. In group A, the mean AFI ± SD at recruitment was 39.68 ± 11.11 mm; in group B, it was 126.92 ± 10.59 mm (P < .001). In group A, the mean AFI at 7 days was 77.70 ± 15.03 mm; in group B, it was unchanged. In subgroup A1, the mean AFI at birth was 86.21 ± 16.89 mm; in subgroup A2, it was 112.45 ± 14.92 mm (P < .001).

Conclusions

Our data show that in pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios, hydration therapy significantly improves the quantity of amniotic fluid.

### What-and why-the neonatologist should know about twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome… [^382aef5f]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome results from unbalanced vascular anastomoses in monochorionic twin gestations. This condition, affecting 2, 500 pregnancies each year in the United States, is most commonly identified with ultrasonography on the basis of unequal amniotic fluid volumes in a monochorionic, diamniotic pregnancy. Hemodynamic alterations in the syndrome lead to oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, and frequently, anemia in the "donor" twin while the "recipient" has polyhydramnios and polycythemia. In severe cases, both twins are at risk of developing hydrops fetalis and death. The Quintero staging system is widely used to characterize the features and severity of the disease in a given pregnancy and to guide decisions regarding therapy.

The advent of endoscopic fetoplacental surgery, which affords the possibility of laser photocoagulation of connecting placental vessels and thereby separation of the twins' circulation, has revolutionized the management of this condition and improved outcomes. The main risk of intervention is preterm premature rupture of membranes and subsequent preterm delivery of the twins. The outcomes for survivors of the syndrome are generally comparable to those of monochorionic, diamniotic twins in general and relate primarily to the degree of prematurity.

### Fetal lower urinary tract obstruction: what should we tell the prospective parents? [^21ebe723]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Fetal lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO), which often results in marked perinatal morbidity and mortality, is caused by a heterogeneous group of anatomical defects that lead to blockage of the urethra. The classic prenatal presentation of LUTO includes megacystis with hydronephrosis. While mild forms of the disease can be associated with favorable outcomes, more severe disease commonly leads to dysplastic changes in the fetal kidneys, and ultimately oligohydramnios, which can result in secondary pulmonary hypoplasia and renal failure at birth. The aim of this review is to provide practitioners with a general overview of the diagnosis and treatment of LUTO based on disease severity, along with some points to consider when counseling prospective parents of fetuses with this condition.

### Maternal hydration for increasing amniotic fluid volume in oligohydramnios and normal amniotic fluid volume [^8ea6fa74]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid) may be responsible for malpresentation problems, umbilical cord compression, concentration of meconium in the liquor, and difficult or failed external cephalic version. Simple maternal hydration has been suggested as a way of increasing amniotic fluid volume in order to reduce some of these problems.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of maternal hydration on amniotic fluid volume and measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched. Date of last search: September 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing maternal hydration with no hydration in pregnant women with reduced or normal amniotic fluid volume.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by both reviewers.

Main Results

Two studies of 77 women were included. The women were asked to drink two litres of water before having a repeat ultrasound examination. Maternal hydration in women with and without oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic volume (weighted mean difference for women with oligohydramnios 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.56; and weighted mean difference for women with normal amniotic fluid volume 4.5, 95% confidence interval 2.92 to 6.08). Intravenous hypotonic hydration in women with oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic fluid volume (weighted mean difference 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 3.24). Isotonic intravenous hydration had no measurable effect. No clinically important outcomes were assessed in any of the trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Simple maternal hydration appears to increase amniotic fluid volume and may be beneficial in the management of oligohydramnios and prevention of oligohydramnios during labour or prior to external cephalic version. Controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical benefits and possible risks of maternal hydration for specific clinical purposes.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^24057846]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Isolated oligohydramnios are associated with an increased risk of placental abnormalities. Zilberman et al. investigated the extent of oligohydramnios. Abnormally reduced amniotic fluid volume was associated with an increased rate of fetal cardiac arrhythmias, more frequent need for induction of labour, and worse neonatal outcome. Oligohydramnios are also associated with more frequent cesarean section in low-risk pregnancies and an increased rate of low birth weight neonates. Fetal weight estimation may also be confounded by lower than average amniotic fluid, and in oligohydramnios, birth weight may be overestimated even shortly before term. If the height of the uterine fundus is lower than expected based on the calculated gestational age, reduced volume of amniotic fluid should be considered, and measurement is recommended.

Severe oligohydramnios can trigger pulmonary hypoplasia. An international study found that children with reduced amniotic fluid volume had an 8% higher rate of clinical airway treatment and an 80% higher incidence of respiratory failure compared to children with no oligohydramnios detected. Severe oligohydramnios can also have long-term neurological consequences for the newborn, which may be reflected in movement disorders.

ADPKD fetal evaluation — prenatal findings and counseling advises that mild radiographic abnormalities in the fetus do not necessarily predict severe ADPKD in the child and that shared decisionmaking about confirmatory genetic testing is advised; severe fetal bilateral structural kidney cystic disease and/or oligohydramnios portend a higher risk of poor neonatal outcome or early-onset childhood kidney dysfunction; and parents should be counseled that a normal fetal ultrasound does not exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD in an at-risk child.

### Transabdominal amnioinfusion for improving fetal outcomes after oligohydramnios secondary to preterm prelabour rupture of membranes before 26 weeks [^d77420da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 26 weeks can delay lung development and can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, as a result of oligohydramnios. Restoring the amniotic fluid volume by transabdominal amnioinfusion might prevent abnormal lung development and might have a protective effect for neurological complications, fetal deformities and neonatal sepsis.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of transabdominal amnioinfusion in improving perinatal outcome in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing transabdominal amnioinfusion with no transabdominal amnioinfusion. Cluster- or quasi-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion. In cases where only an abstract was available, we attempted to find the full articles.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trials for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified.

Main Results

There are no included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to evaluate the use of transabdominal amnioinfusion in women with oligohydramnios secondary to rupture of fetal membranes before 26 weeks for improving perinatal outcome. Further research examining the effects of this intervention is needed. Two randomised controlled trials are ongoing but final data have not yet been published.

### Neonatal outcomes are similar between patients with resolved and those with persistent oligohydramnios [^c61a5cd2]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oligohydramnios (defined as amniotic fluid volume < 5cm or deepest vertical pocket < 2cm) is regarded as an ominous finding on prenatal ultrasound. Amniotic fluid, however, is not static, and to date, there have been no studies comparing perinatal outcomes in patients who are diagnosed with oligohydramnios that resolves and those who have persistent oligohydramnios.

Study Design

This is a secondary analysis of a National Institutes of Health-funded retrospective cohort study of singleton gestations delivered at a tertiary care hospital between 2002 and 2013 with mild hypertensive disorders and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR). Maternal characteristics, delivery, and neonatal information were abstracted by trained research nurses. Patients with a diagnosis of oligohydramnios were identified, and those with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios at the time of delivery were compared. The primary outcome was a composite of neonatal resuscitation at delivery: administration of oxygen, bag-mask ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, intubation, chest compression, or cardiac medication administration. Secondary outcomes included FGR, timing, and mode of delivery.

Results

Of 527 women meeting study criteria, 42 had oligohydramnios that resolved prior to delivery, whereas 485 had persistent oligohydramnios. There were no significant differences in patient demographics between groups. The gestational age at diagnosis was significantly lower for patients with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios (median: 33.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 29.1–35.9] vs. 38.0 [IQR: 36.4–39.3], p < 0.001). There was not a substantial difference in rate of neonatal resuscitation (41 vs. 32%, p = 0.31). Patients with resolved oligohydramnios were more likely to have developed FGR than those with persistent oligohydramnios (55 vs. 36%, p < 0.02). There were no significant differences for gestational age at delivery, birth weight, or neonatal intensive care unit admission.

Conclusion

Patients whose oligohydramnios resolved were diagnosed earlier yet had similar rates of neonatal resuscitation but higher rates of FGR than those who had persistent oligohydramnios.

Key Points

· When diagnosed earlier in pregnancy, oligohydramnios was more likely to resolve prenatally. · Patients who were diagnosed with oligohydramnios earlier in pregnancy had higher rates of FGR. · There were no differences in the rates of the composite outcome of need for neonatal resuscitation when comparing those with resolved versus those with persistent oligohydramnios. No differences in composite neonatal morbidity were noted between those with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^dfe8509a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the poor perinatal outcomes attributable to oligohydramnios, there are few data on prevalence and factors associated with oligohydramnios in the East African Region, and Uganda in particular. Establishing the prevalence of oligohydramnios and associated factors in the third trimester is crucial to inform the index of suspicion among healthcare workers during antenatal care so as to plan appropriate interventions, including mode and timing of deliveries. In Uganda, many missed opportunities for prompt detection of oligohydramnios exist; only 30% of pregnant women requiring ultrasonography services access them. When oligohydramnios is missed and patients do not receive appropriate and timely treatment, outcomes are often poor.

Prior to conducting this study, data from review of medical records for a six-month period (April–September 2018) in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) revealed that 45 mothers had oligohydramnios-related complications. All the 45 mothers had cesarean sections, 6% had fresh stillbirths, and 17% had babies with birth asphyxia (APGAR scores of < 7 at 5 min). Furthermore, oligohydramnios may be contributing to the high rates of cesarean section deliveries; fetal distress caused by oligohydramnios has been identified as one of the leading indications for cesarean section deliveries in Uganda. MRRH, in particular, has been found to have high cesarean section delivery rates of more than 25%. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios among women attending antenatal care at > 36 weeks of gestation at MRRH in Southwestern Uganda.

### Antepartum fetal surveillance: ACOG practice bulletin, number 229 [^1fb827cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Antepartum fetal surveillance — Level C recommendations include that initiating antepartum fetal testing at 32 0/7 weeks of gestation or later is appropriate for most at-risk patients, though in higher-risk conditions testing might begin when delivery would be considered for perinatal benefit; when the clinical condition prompting testing persists, testing should be repeated periodically until delivery and tests are typically repeated at weekly intervals, with some investigators performing more frequent testing and no optimal regimen established; in the absence of obstetric contraindications, delivery of the fetus with an abnormal test result often may be attempted by induction of labor with continuous intrapartum monitoring of the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions; and for otherwise uncomplicated isolated and persistent oligohydramnios with deepest vertical pocket less than 2 cm, delivery at 36 0/7–37 6/7 weeks of gestation or at diagnosis if diagnosed later is recommended, whereas at less than 36 0/7 weeks with intact membranes and oligohydramnios the decision should be individualized based on gestational age and maternal–fetal condition.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^de8a4b66]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid amount is an important parameter for the evaluation of fetal well-being. There is no consensus regarding the best method to estimate the amount of amniotic fluid, and the definition of oligohydramnios. Some define oligohydramnios by a deepest vertical pocket (DVP) of less than 2 cm, while others prefer calculating a four-quadrant amniotic fluid index (AFI) and define oligohydramnios as a value of 5 cm or less.

Amniotic fluid volume is dynamic. Its production increases gradually until 32 weeks of pregnancy and remains stable until term. The main sources of amniotic fluid are fetal urination and lung secretions. Oligohydramnios most commonly occurs secondary to premature rupture of membranes. Yet, it has also been related to post-term pregnancies, intrauterine fetal growth retardation (FGR), maternal chronic illness, fetal malformations and chromosomal anomalies. Finally, oligohydramnios may be isolated. Overall incidence of isolated oligohydramnios is between 0.5 and 5%, and depends on local definitions and target population. Isolated oligohydramnios is a diagnosis of exclusion, after comprehensive assessment of the fetus to exclude malformations, genetic anomalies and FGR. Moreover, a detailed and thorough maternal examination is necessary to rule out premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine infection or chronic maternal illness. Often oligohydramnios itself serves as an indication for induction of labor and entails an increased risk of operative delivery and cesarean section for fetal distress. Other studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of obstetric interventions or immediate neonatal outcome impairment.

The pathogenesis of isolated oligohydramnios is unclear, yet it has been viewed by some as an expression of placental insufficiency, and as such is regarded as an additional placental related obstetrical syndrome, in similar to FGR and preeclampsia. Others view this condition as a benign finding, necessitating intervention only in the presence of additional findings. It is well established that placental syndromes such FGR and preeclampsia tend to recur and increase the overall risk of placental complications in subsequent pregnancy. We therefore set to examine if isolated oligohydramnios displays similar recurrence risks as other placental mediated complications and may be regarded as risk factor for subsequent pregnancies. Our objectives were to evaluate the correlation between isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy and its recurrence in subsequent pregnancy, and the incidence of placental-related complications in subsequent pregnancy.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^4c2bb583]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 30-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 4, para 3002, was referred to the maternal-fetal medicine unit at 29 weeks of gestation due to oligohydramnios. She had no reported underlying medical conditions. Her obstetric history included an early perinatal loss in her second pregnancy, involving a male newborn with severe respiratory distress and abdominal organ enlargement, while her two other daughters were reported as healthy. Antenatal care began at 6 weeks of gestation, with a total of 12 visits leading up to delivery. Initial laboratory investigations during pregnancy were unremarkable. At 31 weeks and 1 day gestational age, a fetal ultrasound revealed a viable fetus with appropriate growth for gestational age, severe oligohydramnios, and abnormal bilateral hyperechogenic enlarged kidneys, the USclip_case2 in supplementary files. The dimensions of the right fetal kidney were notably increased, measuring 56.8 mm in length (97th centile = 46.3 mm), 33.4 mm in transverse diameter (97th centile = 29.90 mm), and 39.1 mm in antero-posterior diameter (97th centile = 29.9 mm), while the left kidney measured 52.8 mm, 29.3 mm, and 31.9 mm, respectively (Fig. 3). A provisional prenatal diagnosis of fetal ARPKD was made. Genetic counseling was provided to the patient and her family regarding the prognosis during the perinatal period. The patient underwent a repeated cesarean section at 35 weeks and 2 days due to spontaneous preterm labor, delivering a preterm female neonate weighing 2500 g with APGAR scores of 8 and 9 at 1-minute and 5-minute intervals, respectively. Unfortunately, the neonate passed away at 9 h of age due to severe respiratory distress, and the parents declined an autopsy. Genetic testing was conducted, revealing a karyotype of 46, XX. Sequence analysis and deletion/duplication testing of a Cystic Kidney Disease gene panel (Invitae, 1400 16th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, #05D2040778) were performed using the Illumina HiSeq sequencing system, targeting 44 genes associated with cystic kidney diseases as detailed in the supplementary material_bioinformatic analysis. This was followed by Sanger sequencing of the suspected variant, which identified a compound heterozygous likely pathogenic PKHD1 mutation: specifically, c.3589dup (p. Glu1197Glyfs*42) and c.10105T > C (p. Ser3369Pro). The heterozygous PKHD1 mutation c.3589dup (p. Glu1197Glyfs*42) introduces a premature stop signal in the PKHD1 gene and is not present in population databases. Loss-of-function variants in PKHD1 are recognized as pathogenic, and algorithms designed to predict the effects of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may create or enhance a splice site. In the case of the heterozygous PKHD1 mutation c.10105T > C (p. Ser3369Pro), this sequence change substitutes serine with proline at codon 3369 of the PKHD1 protein. The serine residue is highly conserved and is also absent from population databases. The segregation of biallelic variants (in trans) of PKHD1 in the neonate and the heterozygous state in the asymptomatic parents has been confirmed. For these reasons, these variants have been classified as likely pathogenic, confirming the diagnosis of ARPKD in the neonate.

### Planned early delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby for improving outcomes [^515ce937]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal compromise in the term pregnancy is suspected when the following clinical indicators are present: intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), decreased fetal movement (DFM), or when investigations such as cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound reveal results inconsistent with standard measurements. Pathological results would necessitate the need for immediate delivery, but the management for 'suspicious' results remains unclear and varies widely across clinical centres. There is clinical uncertainty as to how to best manage women presenting with a suspected term compromised baby in an otherwise healthy pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the effects of immediate delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing expectant management versus planned early delivery for women with a suspected compromised fetus from 37 weeks' gestation or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Of the 20 reports identified by the search strategy, we included three trials (546 participants: 269 to early delivery and 277 to expectant management), which met our inclusion criteria. Two of the trials compared outcomes in 492 pregnancies with IUGR of the fetus, and one in 54 pregnancies with oligohydramnios. All three trials were of reasonable quality and at low risk of bias. The level of evidence was graded moderate, low or very low, downgrading mostly for imprecision and for some indirectness. Overall, there was no difference in the primary neonatal outcomes of perinatal mortality (no deaths in either group, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded moderate), major neonatal morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.81, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), or neurodevelopmental disability/impairment at two years of age (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.69, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). There was no difference in the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (one trial, 333 infants) or meconium aspiration (one trial, 459 infants), There was also no difference in the reported primary maternal outcomes: maternal mortality (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.87, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), and significant maternal morbidity (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.22, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). The gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier in women randomised to early delivery (mean difference (MD) -9.50, 95% CI -10.82 to -8.18, one trial, 459 women) and women in the early delivery group were significantly less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, one trial, 33 women). Significantly more infants in the planned early delivery group were admitted to intermediate care nursery (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, two trials, 491 infants). There was no difference in the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, (one trial, 333 infants), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (three trials, 546 infants), resuscitation required (one trial, 459 infants), mechanical ventilation (one trial, 337 infants), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23, three trials, 545 infants, evidence graded very low), length of stay in NICU/SCN (one trial, 459 infants), and sepsis (two trials, 366 infants). Babies in the expectant management group were more likely to be < 2.3rd centile for birthweight (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.73, two trials, 491 infants), however there was no difference in the proportion of babies with birthweight < 10th centile (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10). There was no difference in any of the reported maternal secondary outcomes including: caesarean section rates (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.59, three trials, 546 women, evidence graded low), placental abruption (one trial, 459 women), pre-eclampsia (one trial, 459 women), vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), assisted vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), breastfeeding rates (one trial, 218 women), and number of weeks of breastfeeding after delivery one trial, 124 women). There was an expected increase in induction in the early delivery group (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.37, one trial, 459 women). No data were reported for the pre-specified secondary neonatal outcomes of the number of days of mechanical ventilation, moderate-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy or need for therapeutic hypothermia. Likewise, no data were reported for secondary maternal outcomes of postnatal infection, maternal satisfaction or views of care.

Authors' Conclusions

A policy for planned early delivery versus expectant management for a suspected compromised fetus at term does not demonstrate any differences in major outcomes of perinatal mortality, significant neonatal or maternal morbidity or neurodevelopmental disability. In women randomised to planned early delivery, the gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier, women were less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation, they were more likely to be induced and infants were more likely to be admitted to intermediate care nursery. There was also a significant difference in the proportion of babies with a birthweight centile < 2.3rd, however this did not translate into a reduction in morbidity. The review is informed by only one large trial and two smaller trials assessing fetuses with IUGR or oligohydramnios and therefore cannot be generalised to all term pregnancies with suspected fetal compromise. There are other indications for suspecting compromise in a fetus at or near term such as maternal perception of DFM, and ultrasound and/or CTG abnormalities. Future randomised trials need to assess effectiveness of timing of delivery for these indications.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^67104d2b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Case 1

A 43-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1 (with a healthy 20-year-old daughter), who had underlying essential hypertension, presented with her second episode of antepartum hemorrhage. Family history was unremarkable. Due to an unintended pregnancy, she initiated antenatal care at 25 weeks of gestation at a local primary care unit. Initial antenatal laboratory investigations and management of her hypertension were unremarkable. An ultrasound was performed at 28 weeks and 2 days gestational age due to the antepartum hemorrhage, revealing placenta previa bleeding in the presence of a single viable fetus with appropriate weight for gestational age but also showing signs of oligohydramnios. Following a course of corticosteroids and resolution of vaginal bleeding, she was discharged without immediate fetal concerns. However, ten days later, she returned to the labor room with painless vaginal bleeding. A subsequent ultrasound at 29 weeks and 6 days gestational age showed a viable fetus with an estimated weight of 1,808 g but with anhydramnios and bilateral enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys, the USclip_case1 in supplementary files. The fetal kidneys exhibited abnormal dimensions, with the right kidney measuring 65.4 mm in length (97th centile = 47.7 mm), 36.0 mm in transverse diameter (97th centile = 28.2 mm), and 51.5 mm in antero-posterior diameter (97th centile = 29.2 mm), while the left kidney measured 61.4 mm, 29.9 mm, and 49.8 mm, respectively, showing loss of corticomedullary differentiation (Fig. 1). Color Doppler ultrasound identified a diminutive fetal urinary bladder at the abdominal umbilical cord insertion site. Given the concerning findings and the suspected diagnosis of ARPKD, the patient and her family were counseled about the perinatal poor prognosis. Despite ongoing bleeding from placenta previa, a female neonate was delivered via cesarean section with a birth weight of 1,800 g. The neonate had APGAR scores of 4 and 2 at 1 and 5 min, respectively, and unfortunately passed away 20 min after neonatal resuscitation. A necropsy was conducted, and examination of kidney sections revealed dilatation of Bowman's capsule, leading to the formation of glomerular cysts primarily in the subcapsular cortex (Fig. 2). These findings were indicative of GCKD, characterized by cyst formation within the glomeruli without significant tubular dilatation or fibrosis in the surrounding stroma. Suspecting cystic kidney disease, genetic testing was initiated. The karyotype analysis revealed 46, XX. Subsequently, singleton whole exome sequencing (WES) with copy number variations (CNVs) analysis was performed using the Illumina HiSeq sequencing system, as detailed in the supplementary material_bioinformatic analysis, to identify potential genetic mutations associated with the condition. Moreover, targeted analysis of 6 genes related to glomerulocystic kidney disease, including PKHD1, PKD2, HNF1B, TSC1, TSC2, and NPHP did not reveal pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. Unfortunately, the WES and targeted analysis results yielded negative findings, indicating that this specific genetic cause of glomerulocystic kidney disease remained elusive.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^4473ed5e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Oligohydramnios was detected in approximately one of every ten pregnancies beyond the gestational age of 36 weeks, in women seeking care at MRRH. Increasing gestational age, history of malaria in pregnancy, and prime gravidity were the factors significantly associated with oligohydramnios. We recommend increased surveillance for oligohydramnios in the third trimester, especially among prime gravidas, those with history of malaria in pregnancy, and those with post-term pregnancies, in order to enable prompt detection of this complication and plan timely interventions.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^435bc9fd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of our study was to evaluate the correlation between isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery and adverse placental mediated complications in subsequent delivery. We therefore investigated a cohort of second deliveries at our institution as described, excluding previous deliveries with adverse placental mediated outcomes to avoid a confounding effect for subsequent delivery. We demonstrated a significantly higher rate of oligohydramnios, small for gestational age neonates and overall placental disorders in subsequent delivery, following isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery, as the odds ratio was almost double than of controls. No additional differences were noted in other adverse outcomes.

A debate regarding the pathogenesis and significance of oligohydramnios exists. While some consider this to be a variant of common clinical presentation, especially in the context of term pregnancy, others regard this entity as abnormal, and view it as a form of placental insufficiency. In some studies, isolated oligohydramnios at term was found to be related to higher rates of adverse outcomes like meconium aspiration syndrome, cesarean delivery for fetal distress and admission to NICU. Yet, the interpretation of these results must also account for the effects of iatrogenic interventions and lower weight fetuses. In a different study, expectant management of isolated oligohydramnios at preterm was associated with similar neonatal outcomes as compared to pregnancies with normal AFI, although an increased risk of new onset fetal growth restriction and lower birthweight was noted. This finding may suggest that in women with isolated oligohydramnios, reduced amniotic fluid volume can be the first sign of placental insufficiency. Nevertheless, others did not demonstrate any adverse outcomes with isolated oligohydramnios. An important adverse outcome that could not be evaluated in most studies regarding oligohydramnios was the risk of intrauterine fetal death, due to its rarity and insufficient sample size to address this outcome. Casey et al. showed a significant association between stillbirth and oligohydramnios, that persisted after exclusion of malformed fetuses from the analysis. Yet, they couldn't confirm that intervention may reduce this risk. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a randomized interventional trial will ever be able to address this specific complication.

### Assessment of the fetal lungs in utero [^d4ea3d2e]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2022). Medium credibility.

Conditions resulting in oligohydramnios/anhydramnios

Conditions that result in second-trimester oligohydramnios may restrict fetal lung growth and result in pulmonary hypoplasia, as shown in both animal models and human fetuses. This may be because of congenital abnormalities such as bilateral renal agenesis or acquired abnormalities such as PPROM.
1 Renal tract abnormalities and early-onset oligohydramnios are associated. Pulmonary hypoplasia in these cases is thought to be attributable to low urine production that results in a decrease in intraamniotic pressure and increase in the alveolar–amniotic pressure gradient. A population-based study suggested a positive correlation between pulmonary hypoplasia and oligohydramnios, in which oligohydramnios-exposed children presented an 8% higher increased admissions rate with respiratory illness than nonexposed children. The exact mechanism by which lung hypoplasia ensues is unclear, but animal models suggest that oligohydramnios at the pseudoglandular stage reduces elastin deposition, alveolarization, and the amount of collagen in the fetal lung. There are limited data specifically evaluating lung development antenatally in cases of renal agenesis, but postnatal quantitative analysis has demonstrated a reduction in size of the pulmonary airways and growth within the acinar region, with resulting hypoplastic lungs.MRI images are less affected by oligo- and anhydramnios than ultrasound images. The role of MRI in assessing pulmonary development in urinary tract abnormalities in these cases of oligo- and anhydramnios has been assessed through several studies. One study yielded images from fast gradient-echo sequences and true fast imaging analyzed by an experienced observer for valuating signal intensity of the lungs to diagnose pulmonary hypoplasia. Low signal intensity in the lungs was thus identified in a fetus with Meckel–Gruber syndrome. Overall, MRI was deemed superior in detecting the bilateralism and severity of the renal diseases, and denoted better visualization of the fetal whole body in a single cut compared with ultrasound. Reaching a diagnostic accuracy of 96% for urinary tract anomalies in this study, MRI demonstrated its potential in characterizing the associated extrarenal fetal anomalies, such as pulmonary anomalies, with high accuracy.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^59375470]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

In agreement with previous findings, we found an association between increasing gestational age and oligohydramnios. Some studies have reported that in post-term pregnancies, the majority (93%) of oligohydramnios cases are idiopathic and about 7% of the cases have placental insufficiency. In post term pregnancies, alteration in the expression of aquaporins (aquaporin-1 and aquaporin-3) on amnion, placenta and chorion are thought to be responsible for the reduction in amniotic fluid. Furthermore, accelerated apoptosis or increased renal tubular reabsorption as a result of a more mature tubular system, have also been hypothesized as probable underlying mechanisms in pathogenesis of oligohydramnios in post-term pregnancies.

In agreement with previous studies, the current study found that prime gravidas had higher odds of oligohydramnios compared to multigravidas. This may be because disorders of pregnancy are exaggerated in prime gravidas compared to multigravidas. Moreover, some complications, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, and infections (e.g. malaria), have been reported to be associated with oligohydramnios.

The following limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, we are unable to draw causal inferences from the observed associations due to the cross-sectional nature of our study, that does not enable assigning time directionally between the exposures and the outcome. Second, due to lack of longitudinal outcome data, we were unable to assess the prognostic implications of oligohydramnios in our study population. This can be assessed in future longitudinal studies. Finally, this was a single-centre study in a regional referral hospital, hence our findings may not be generalizable beyond the population of pregnant women in similar peri-urban settings in Uganda. Despite these limitations, our study generated valuable epidemiological data, being one of the initial studies to estimate the burden and correlates of oligohydramnios in the East African Region.

### Perinatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed before 37 weeks of gestation [^120faf67]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze pregnancy outcome in cases of isolated oligohydramnios at preterm.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies diagnosed with isolated oligohydramnios at preterm (n = 108). Pregnancy outcome was compared with a matched control group of low-risk preterm pregnancies with normal levels of amniotic fluid in a 3:1 ratio (n = 324).

Results

Pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios were characterized by a higher rate of preterm deliveries (26.9% vs 12.3%, P < .001), most of which were iatrogenic, and a higher rate of labor induction and cesarean delivery. Neonates with isolated oligohydramnios were characterized by a lower birthweight and a higher rate of neonatal morbidity. These differences were eliminated when the analysis was limited to the subgroup of pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios that were managed expectantly and delivered spontaneously at term.

Conclusion

Adverse pregnancy outcome in cases of isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed at < 37 weeks appears to be related to a considerable degree to iatrogenic prematurity.

### Amniotic fluid abnormalities [^cac12d54]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The complex nature of amniotic fluid reflects contributions from many fetal systems, many functional roles, and multiple interactions with fetal maturation, obstetric, and maternal factors. Simple ultrasound measurement, probably done best with the maximum vertical pocket method, has a clinical role in fetal surveillance, substantiated by extensive level II and some level I evidence. Interventions (amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios, amnioreduction for polyhydramnios) have not been studied effectively in controlled fashion, with the exception of intrapartum applications, where effective reduction of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and perinatal impacts of meconium aspiration may follow amnioinfusion. A wealth of research opportunities exists into regulation of amniotic fluid constituents and their relation to preterm delivery.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^162fecd6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a historic cohort at a single university-affiliated center – the Edith Wolfson Medical Center between November 2008 and December 2019. The center serves a population of half a million citizens from the area, and, in similar to alternative center in the area, offers a maternal fetal division and neonatal intensive care if needed. Women with a first and second livebirth singleton delivery at our center during these years were included in the cohort. All singleton pregnancies with a diagnosis of isolated oligohydramnios were identified from electronic medical records and cases reviewed to exclude any secondary causes for oligohydramnios, including premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine fetal growth retardation (FGR), maternal chronic illness, fetal malformations and chromosomal anomalies. We excluded women with any delivery complicated by fetal chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, by birth before 24 weeks, women with lack of prenatal care and cases of current or past intrauterine fetal death. We also excluded women whose first delivery was complicated by small for gestational age, preeclampsia, preterm birth or placental abruption, all placental related complications that are known to recure in subsequent pregnancies.

We compared pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of two groups – second deliveries of women with isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (previous oligohydramnios group), and second deliveries of women without isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (control group).

As per institutional protocol, all women admitted to our obstetric emergency room and delivery ward underwent assessment of amniotic fluid amount by ultrasound as an integral part of obstetric evaluation. Amniotic fluid was assessed by obstetricians, with the use of abdominal probes (Voluson E8, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Oligohydramnios was determined in the presence of a DVP of less than two centimeters or an AFI of less than 5 cm, and coding was entered to the computerized system as per the ICD9 (code 658.03).

### Irbesartan (Avapro) [^801fe269]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

AVAPRO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death [see Clinical Considerations]. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue AVAPRO as soon as possible.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes regardless of drug exposure. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo-fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/neonatal adverse reactions

Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative treatment. Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to AVAPRO for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia and other symptoms of renal impairment. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to AVAPRO, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function.

### Celecoxib [^9750a992]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risk of major birth
defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including celecoxib, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If celecoxib treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs,
discontinue celecoxib and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

Labor or Delivery

There are no studies on the effects of celecoxib during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including celecoxib, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

### Outcome of pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios or anhydramnios of renal origin [^a2f8a686]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the outcome of fetuses with oligohydramnios due to kidney anomalies.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed of all pregnancies diagnosed with oligohydramnios and associated kidney anomalies during the period 2000–2008. Outcome included pregnancy outcome, mortality, and morbidity. Morbidity included renal function based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during follow-up.

Results

A total of 71 pregnancies were evaluated; 36 fetuses presented on ultrasound with cystic dysplasia, 15 with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and 20 with hydronephrosis. Twenty-three (32%) had associated anomalies. In 49 fetuses (69%), the diagnosis had been made before 24 weeks of gestational age (GA); 41 of those pregnancies were terminated. Twenty-five neonates were live born: 10 survived, 15 died. Prognostic factors for survival included GA at diagnosis (32.2 weeks for survivors vs 28.1 weeks for non-survivors; P = 0.02), diagnosis of hydronephrosis (7 in the survivors vs 4 in the non-survivors: P = 0.05), isolated anomaly (9 in the survivors vs 7 in the non-survivors: P = 0.04). Severity of oligohydramnios (1 case of anhydramnios in the survivors vs 7 in the non-survivors: P = 0.08) was not significant. The 1-year GFR was below 50 mL/min/1.73 m² in four of the ten survivors.

Conclusion

The prognosis of early onset renal oligohydramnios is poor. Predictive determinants of survival are: GA at diagnosis, nature of renal anomaly (hydronephrosis vs other), and presence of associated anomalies.

### Guideline no. 430: diagnosis and management of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes [^b5a5bc23]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for premature rupture of membranes, more specifically with respect to general counseling, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider including amniotic fluid volume at the time of rupture in counseling patients and families with previable PPROM, as anhydramnios and oligohydramnios are more frequently associated with pregnancy loss and pulmonary hypoplasia compared with normal amniotic fluid volumes.

---

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^1bcc40de]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk:

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions:

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking telmisartan and amlodipine tablets during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue telmisartan and amlodipine tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

### Outcomes of fetal lower urinary tract obstruction based on timing of oligohydramnios onset [^09004e66]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fetal Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction (LUTO) is associated with oligohydramnios and significant fetal morbidity, resulting in poor lung development and perinatal death. However, oligohydramnios may develop at different gestational periods, and the impact of timing on fetal outcomes remains unknown. Our objective was to characterize the impact onset of oligohydramnios had on prenatal outcomes.

Methods

This study is a retrospective cohort study of all patients with a prenatal diagnosis of LUTO at our tertiary referral center from 2014 to 2023. All patients underwent detailed ultrasonography and interdisciplinary counseling and were subsequently delivered at our institution. Data were obtained from electronic medical records and complete extraction was required for final inclusion.

Results

During the study time period, 93 patients met inclusion criteria of which 68 (73.1%) developed oligohydramnios during their pregnancy. 63 (93%) of these pregnancies resulted in livebirths with 28 (41.1%) perinatal deaths. Onset of oligohydramnios was earlier in pregnancies with perinatal death (23 vs. 28 weeks, p = 0.004) and associated with pulmonary hypoplasia.

Conclusions

Our data show the impact of oligohydramnios timing in pregnancy on pulmonary hypoplasia and ultimately perinatal death. This allows for detailed patient counseling on the impact oligohydramnios may have on pregnancies by the gestational age of onset.

### Neonatal and childhood outcomes following preterm premature rupture of membranes [^66477218]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is almost uniformly associated with preterm birth and thus sequelae of prematurity explain many of the complications associated with this condition. However, the unique inflammatory environment and oligohydramnios associated with PPROM may impart unique neonatal and childhood morbidity compared with other preterm birth pathways.

### Periviable premature rupture of membranes [^a72dabd1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Periviable deliveries (less than 26 weeks) are a small percentage of deliveries but account for a disproportionately high number of long-term morbidities. Few studies describe interventions and outcomes for periviable preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). The available reports may include only those neonates who received resuscitation, making interpretation and application difficult. Counseling should consider the impact of oligohydramnios on fetal lung development. This article discusses standard and experimental interventions that may offer neonatal benefit. Antenatal corticosteroids, antibiotics, and magnesium sulfate may improve outcomes but data to support an improvement in outcome are limited. Studies specifically evaluating these interventions are needed.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^31cf558a]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Practice Points 8.6.1–8.6.3 — prenatal and fetal evaluation — Mild radiographic abnormalities in the fetus, observed prenatally or during routine follow-up of pregnancy, do not necessarily predict severe ADPKD in the child, and shared decision-making regarding the value and short- and long-term implications of confirmatory genetic testing is advised. Severe fetal bilateral structural kidney cystic disease and/or oligohydramnios portend a higher risk of poor neonatal outcome or early-onset childhood kidney dysfunction, and such severe cases may warrant proper genetic testing; Termination of pregnancy may be considered when significant fetal dysfunction leading to Potter sequence is present, and the latter situation suggests ARPKD, not ADPKD. Parents should be counseled that a normal fetal ultrasound does not exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD in an at-risk child, because The level of sensitivity of ultrasound in the fetus to detect ADPKD is low and a normal kidney ultrasound in fetal life, or even in childhood, does not exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD.

### Risk factors for neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia in extremely preterm premature rupture of membranes: a retrospective study [^6b9807c9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Findings from this study suggested that duration of oligohydramnios and gestational age at delivery for less than 24.1 weeks are risk factors for BPD in cases diagnosed with pPROM before 28 weeks of gestation. Also, the results of this study indicated that oligohydramnios that lasts four days or longer increases the risk of BPD. If pregnancy is extended and prolonged oligohydramnios is observed, the neonate should be closely monitored after birth for the onset of BPD.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^6e992c59]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 Strengths and limitations

The main strength of our study was the large cohort from two obstetrical centers with high annual delivery volumes, in a developed country with advanced medical services and relatively high rates of TOLAC attempts. This enabled us to evaluate this specific subgroup of patients with oligohydramnios. The uniformity in inclusion criteria, reflected by the strict definition of oligohydramnios only according to one method (MVP) and the timing of diagnosis by qualified ultrasound units within the hospital, along with consistent TOLAC management protocols in our centers, reduces the likelihood of confounders and increases the reliability and generalizability of our findings. The use of computerized medical records updated in real‐time provided comprehensive data and minimized bias.

Our study specifically assessed success rates and complications of TOLAC in the presence of oligohydramnios. Additionally, the diagnosis of oligohydramnios in our study was close to delivery, whereas, in the previous studies discussed above, the timing of diagnosis was not specified and relied on medical record ICD codes.

The main limitation of our study was its retrospective design, which carries inherent limitations. For instance, we did not have sufficient data to stratify according to the causes of oligohydramnios or the indications for the previous CD, which could be important factors in successful TOLAC. Additionally, the unique population in our centers, characterized by patients who tend toward large families and prefer vaginal delivery over CD, may influence both the physicians' and patients' preferences regarding the mode of delivery. Despite these limitations, we addressed this through the inclusion of a large sample size and comparison of our results with other studies conducted in different populations that showed similar success rates. The rates of maternal and neonatal complications were similar to those reported in previous worldwide publications, including uterine rupture, PPH, puerperal fever, maternal ICU admissions, and maternal respiratory complications. This similarity suggests that our study's conclusions may be generalizable to other populations.

### Oligohydramnios associated with sonographically normal kidneys [^dbb521f3]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

We report a male newborn presenting with sonographically normal kidneys, oligohydramnios during late pregnancy, and persisting anuric renal failure. Despite intensive treatment, the patient suffered from severe hypotension and died at the age of 4 weeks. At autopsy, kidneys were found to be normal; on histology, deranged renal structures, in particular proximal tubuli and vessels, were noted, leading to the diagnosis of renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD). The diagnosis was confirmed by 2 heterozygous nonsense mutations of the ACE gene. Because the recurrence rate of RTD is 25% for the autosomal recessive trait, knowledge and genetic diagnosis of the disease is important for the parents.

### Valsartan [^3ffbc05e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Valsartan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Published reports include cases of anhydramnios and oligohydramnios in pregnant women treated with valsartan (see Clinical Considerations).

When pregnancy is detected, consider alternative drug treatment and discontinue valsartan as soon as possible.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

 Clinical Considerations

 Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Naproxen sodium [^42f03039]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

 Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including naproxen sodium, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If naproxen sodium treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue naproxen sodium, and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

 Labor or Delivery

There are no studies on the effects of naproxen sodium during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including naproxen, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

### Trastuzumab (Herzuma) [^7437a58d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product [see Clinical Considerations].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Monitor women who received HERZUMA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.

Data

Human Data

In post-m arketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations included pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred.

Animal Data

In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects.

### Intrauterine growth restriction and oligohydramnios among high-risk patients [^98e544e2]. American Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the prevalence of oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index < 5.0 cm) among fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and newborns identified as small for gestational age (SGA), and (2) among fetuses with IUGR, to determine the predictive accuracy of amniotic fluid index (AFI) ≤ versus > 5.0 cm for adverse peripartum outcomes. This was a retrospective review of high-risk pregnancy that had reliable gestational age (GA) and needed weekly biophysical profile (BPP). Along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), we calculated the likelihood ratios (LRs) and used guidelines promulgated by Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group. Among the 1859 singletons undergoing BPP, IUGR (estimated fetal weight < 10% for GA) was suspected in 22% (n = 410) and the prevalence of oligohydramnios was 6% (95% CI, 4 to 8%). SGA (birthweight ≤ 10%) occurred among 28% (n = 517) of newborns and oligohydramnios was noted in 6% (95% CI, 4 to 8%). Among fetuses with IUGR, the LR of oligohydramnios to predict cesarean delivery for nonreassuring fetal heart tracing was 2.0 (range, 0.8 to 5.0); for newborns small for gestational age, 1.9 (range, 1.2 to 3.1), and for neonatal intensive care unit admission, 1.4 (range, 0.6 to 2.3) More than 90% of patients with IUGR or SGA have AFI > 5.0 cm, and oligohydramnios with IUGR is a poor predictor of peripartum complications.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^5725b6a2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this multicenter study of patients with oligohydramnios, we found that the successful vaginal delivery rate for those who attempted TOLAC was 84.5%. We also compared the maternal and neonatal outcomes of patients with oligohydramnios between those who underwent TOLAC versus those who underwent PRCD, demonstrating similar maternal outcomes between the groups, with no increased risk of uterine rupture. The rate of hypoglycemia and composite adverse neonatal outcomes was higher among patients who underwent PRCD, and this association remained significant after even controlling for potential confounders. This relatively high success rate demonstrates that under the right conditions, TOLAC in pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios is an achievable and safe option, with potentially favorable outcomes.

These new findings enhance our understanding of this obstetric condition and may increase the rates of TOLAC in this subpopulation, thereby reducing the rates of PRCD and its associated early and late complications. Further studies from other medical centers are needed to strengthen these findings.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for intrauterine growth restriction, more specifically with respect to indications for delivery, FIGO 2021 guidelines recommend to consider deferring delivery until 34–37 weeks in cases of FGR with early Doppler changes or mild associated abnormalities (oligohydramnios, suboptimal interval growth, preeclampsia). Obtain monitoring including cardiotocography/nonstress test and/or biophysical profile 2 times weekly and Doppler 1–2 times weekly until then.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^4ea2a0aa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess the association between isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy and the incidence of placental related complications in subsequent pregnancy.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of live singleton births from a single university affiliated medical center during an eleven-year period of women with two subsequent deliveries at our center. An analysis of outcomes was performed for all second deliveries, comparing women for whom their first delivery was complicated by isolated oligohydramnios (previous oligohydramnios group), and women without isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (control group). Patients for whom their first delivery was complicated by small for gestational age, pregnancy induced hypertension and preterm birth were excluded. The study groups were compared for obstetric and early neonatal outcomes, recurrence of oligohydramnios and a composite of placental related pregnancy complications.

Results

A total of 213 in the previous oligohydramnios group and 5348 in the control group were compared. No differences were found between the groups in maternal age, body mass index, smoking and comorbidities. Gestational age at delivery was, 39.6 ± 1.3 vs. 39.3 ± 1.4 weeks, p = 0.006, in the previous oligohydramnios and controls respectively, although preterm birth rate was similar between the groups. The previous oligohydramnios group had a significantly higher incidence of oligohydramnios in second delivery, aOR 3.37, 95%CI 1.89–6.00, small for gestational age neonates, aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.16–3.25, and overall placental related disorders of pregnancy, aOR 2.13, 95%CI 1.35–3.35.

Conclusion

Pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios are associated with an increased risk of placental related disorders in subsequent pregnancy. Isolated oligohydramnios may be the first sign of placental insufficiency and an independent manifestation of the placental related complications spectrum.

### Amniotic fluid disorders and the effects on prenatal outcome: a retrospective cohort study [^38921d48]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The amniotic fluid is the protective liquid present in the amniotic sac, and mainly composed of water and solids, including proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and phospholipids, enzymes, hormones and chemical substances urea, uric acid, creatinine, electrolytes. It is developed from the membrane plasma by the development of fetus and serves as a protective cushion for the growing fetus. It has antibacterial properties to protect the growing fetus from infection, also it facilitates the exchange of nutrients, water and biochemical products between mother and fetus. Different types of fetal cells are further present which includes; skin, respiratory, intestinal, urinary tract and stem cells, hair and blood cells, all of which aid in the growth of fetus.

Amniotic Fluid Volume (AFV) does not change significantly from day to day, but generally it increases with the growth of fetus reaching a peak at 34 weeks of gestation (over 800 mL), after which it may start to decrease. However, in certain cases Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) of the amniotic fluid volume is greater than 24 cm, the phenomenon is referred as polyhydramnios. Risk factors of polyhydramnios includes: maternal diabetes, fetal heart failure, abnormal swallowing and congenital infection. The degree of increase in the AFV is directly associated with the increase in adverse risk factors on mother and fetus prenatally. Some of these prenatally outcomes include preterm birth, cesarean delivery, placental abruption, fetal malposition, macrosomia, umbilical cord prolapse and maternal respiratory compromise.

In contrast, AFI of the amniotic volume less than 5 cm is referred as oligohydramnios. Risk factors of oligohydramnios includes: premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction and birth defects. Oligohydramnios impede normal fetal movement, retarded fetal growth and development leading towards fetal deformities, umbilical cord compression, while in some cases death may happen depending on gestational age. In the first trimester decrease in AFI is an ominous finding, the fetus usually undergo abortion. However, in the second trimester the prognosis majorly depends mostly on the etiology, borderline/low normal amniotic fluid volume which generally have a good prognosis, on the other hand severe oligohydramnios often lead to fetal death. Whereas, in the third trimester many cases of oligohydramnios are idiopathic. The occurrence of a threatening fetal outcome is related to the umbilical cord compression, utro-placental insufficiency and meconium aspiration.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^3216d10c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polyhydramnios, or an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, affects less than 2% of pregnancies in high-income countries. Polyhydramnios can be associated with adverse outcomes such as perinatal mortality, prematurity, shoulder dystocia, and respiratory distress syndrome, and is therefore an important health concern. Polyhydramnios can result from maternal conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes, infections and medication exposure. Fetal conditions that affect the fetus's ability to swallow or obstructive gastrointestinal pathologies can also result in polyhydramnios.

In many low and low-middle income countries (LMICs), the incidence of polyhydramnios is unknown. The use of ultrasound during prenatal care is limited in many LMICs due to the high cost of purchasing and maintaining ultrasound equipment, and lack of trained providers to perform and interpret these studies. As a result, certain pregnancy-related conditions that are usually detected by ultrasound go undiagnosed, including polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios and fetal growth abnormalities. These conditions can lead to adverse perinatal events, and therefore should be recognized in order to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with polyhydramnios may be worse in LMICs due to limitations in emergent obstetric care and intensive care for infants born prematurely. Understanding the epidemiology of polyhydramnios in LMICs might lead to strategies for reducing perinatal and peripartum morbidity and mortality.

Pregnant women in LMICs may have different underlying risk factors for polyhydramnios when compared to women in high-income countries. Women in LMICs have different nutritional status, infection exposures, prevalence of diabetes and incidence of fetal anomalies than women in high-income countries. These differences in exposure might alter the prevalence of polyhydramnios in these regions. These maternal characteristics might also contribute to worse perinatal outcomes.

In this paper, we report the incidence of polyhydramnios among women in five LMICs. We also report maternal characteristics associated with polyhydramnios and the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among those affected.

### Long-term outcomes, including fetal and neonatal prognosis, of renal oligohydramnios: a retrospective study over 22 Years [^8a3dfdb1]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the long-term outcome of renal oligohydramnios and risk factors for fetal, neonatal, and postneonatal death.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included fetuses with prenatally detected renal oligohydramnios between 2002 and 2023. Patients who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Fetal, neonatal, and long-term outcomes were evaluated, and their risk factors were analyzed.

Results

Of 131 fetuses with renal oligohydramnios, 46 (35%) underwent a termination of pregnancy, 11 (8%) had an intrauterine fetal death, 26 (20%) had a neonatal death, nine (7%) had a postneonatal death, and 39 (30%) survived. Logistic regression analyses showed that an earlier gestational age at onset (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.37) was significantly associated with intrauterine fetal death; anhydramnios (OR 12.7, 95% CI 1.52–106.7) was significantly associated with neonatal death as a prenatal factor. Although neonatal survival rates for bilateral renal agenesis, bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK), and unilateral MCDK with contralateral renal agenesis were lower than for other kidney diseases, 1 case of bilateral renal agenesis and two of bilateral MCDK survived with fetal intervention. Kaplan-Meier overall survival rates were 57%, 55%, and 51% for 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. In the Cox proportional hazards model, birth weight < 2000 g (hazard ratio 7.33, 95% CI 1.48–36.1) and gastrointestinal comorbidity (hazard ratio 4.37, 95% CI 1.03–18.5) were significant risk factors for postneonatal death.

Conclusion

Long-term survival following renal oligohydramnios is a feasible goal and its appropriate risk assessment is important.

### Amlodipine and olmesartan medoxomil [^6edb3a92]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Olmesartan medoxomil

Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to olmesartan for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to olmesartan, if oliguria or hypotension occur, utilize measures to maintain adequate blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and supporting renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Data

Animal Data

No reproductive studies have been conducted with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil, and amlodipine. However, these studies have been conducted for olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine alone.

### Routine third-trimester ultrasound in low-risk pregnancies and perinatal death: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^367e929f]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether routine third-trimester ultrasounds in low-risk pregnancies decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with regular antenatal care with serial fundal height measurements.

Data Sources

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials to identify relevant studies published from inception to October 2019. The databases used were Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a combination of key words related to "third trimester ultrasound" and "low-risk".

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included all randomized control trials of singleton, nonanomalous low-risk pregnancies that were randomized to either one or more third-trimester ultrasounds (ultrasound group) or serial fundal height (fundal height group). Exclusion criteria were patients with multiple gestations, maternal medical complications, or fetal abnormalities requiring a third-trimester ultrasound.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The primary outcome was the rate of perinatal death. The secondary outcomes were rates of fetal growth restriction, suspected large for gestational age, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, fetal anomalies, antenatal interventions, stillbirth, neonatal death, cesarean delivery, induction of labor, and other neonatal outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed with the use of the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird to produce relative risk or mean difference with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.

Results

A total of 7 randomized control trials with 23,643 participants (12,343 in the ultrasound group vs 11,300 in the fundal height group) were included. The total rate of perinatal death was similar among the groups (41 of 11,322 [0.4%] vs 34 of 10,285 [0.3%]; relative risk, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–1.89). The rate of fetal growth restriction was higher in the ultrasound group (763 of 10,388 [7%] vs 337 of 9021 [4%]; relative risk, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.86–2.39) and the rate of suspected large for gestational age (1060 of 3513 [30%] vs 375 of 3558 [11%]; relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.6–3.2). Polyhydramnios was also significantly higher in the ultrasound group than the fundal height group (18 of 323 [6%] vs 4 of 322 [1%] relative risk, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–11). The rates of the remainder of the secondary outcomes were similar among the groups.

Conclusion

Routine third-trimester ultrasounds do not decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with serial fundal height in low-risk pregnancies. Ideally, an adequately powered trial is warranted to determine whether perinatal mortality in the fundal height group can be reduced by one-third with third-trimester ultrasound.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^2ae98732]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study data from 2,622 fetuses with structural malformations were processed, of which 1,256 resulted in a delivery. Amniotic fluid volume abnormalities were most frequently detected in urogenital, abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies. In urogenital anomalies, oligohydramnios occurred in most cases, 34.72%, while polyhydramnios occurred in 20.14%. In abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in most cases, 31.44%, while oligohydramnios occurred in 12.38%. In craniospinal anomalies, polyhydramnios was detected in most cases, 22.08%, and oligohydramnios in 9.06%. In thoracic and pulmonary anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 19.23%, and oligohydramnios occurred in 15.38%. In the case of limb anomalies and ossification disorders, polyhydramnios occurred in 21.96% and oligohydramnios in 11.76%. In the case of craniofacial anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 12.39% of fetuses and oligohydramnios in 8.72% during pregnancy. In the case of cardiovascular anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 14.67% and oligohydramnios in 7.46%.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^0cf28a0c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Examination of placental histology often sheds light in the investigation of pregnancy complications, as placental mediated complications are often associated with typical and suggestive findings, such as vascular malperfusion and inflammatory lesions. To investigate both clinical and placental histological aspects of isolated oligohydramnios, Miremberg et al. examined placentas from term pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios as compared to matched controls. Authors noted an increased rate of low placental weight with isolated oligohydramnios, as was a higher rate of abnormal cord insertions and maternal vascular malperfusion lesions. Neonates in the isolated oligohydramnios group had a lower birthweight and higher incidence of adverse outcomes. These findings support isolated oligohydramnios' relation to the "placental insufficiency" spectrum and are in line with our findings. An increased risk for small for gestational age neonate in subsequent pregnancy supports the assumption that isolated oligohydramnios is a placental mediated disorder, as it displays a similar risk for placental complications in subsequent pregnancies, as do other hallmark placental disorders.

Our study is limited by its retrospective design, although data did originate from a single center and were available for review. Importantly, information was available for actual birthweight hence SGA incidence was evaluated and not intrauterine growth retardation, hence SGA neonates may include those constitutionally small. In a prospective setting the two would be better differentiated, and neonatal gender, unavailable for the current analysis, would be adjusted for. Additional limitation is the lack of placental pathology supporting placental-related origin of mentioned pregnancy complications.

To strengthen the statistical significance, we had a preliminary power analysis and a relatively large sample size that was mandatory to support our theory. Still, the rate of preeclampsia in our cohort was relatively low, therefore, our study was unable to demonstrate an association between isolated oligohydramnios in first pregnancy and preeclampsia in subsequent delivery if one exists. A distinctive feature of our research is the ability to evaluate the predominant effect of isolated oligohydramnios on future delivery, as we selected a cohort of women without any other obstetric placental-related complication in their previous delivery. Our findings may be useful in the clinical setting indicating the importance of reviewing patients' obstetrical history. In cases of isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery, a clinician should consider closer observation of fetal growth in subsequent pregnancy to diagnose FGR in time.

### Oxaprozin [^abba88f7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If oxaprozin treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue oxaprozin and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

Labor or Delivery

There are no studies on the effects of oxaprozin during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^c55d181e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Oligohydramnios is associated with poor maternal and perinatal outcomes. In low-resource countries, including Uganda, oligohydramnios is under-detected due to the scarcity of ultrasonographic services. We determined the prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios among women with pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Southwestern Uganda.

Methods

We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study from November 2019 to March 2020. Included were women at gestational age > 36 weeks. Excluded were women with ruptured membranes, those in active labour, and those with multiple pregnancies. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to capture demographic, obstetric, and clinical characteristics of the study participants. We determined oligohydramnios using an amniotic fluid index (AFI) obtained using an ultrasound scan. Oligohydramnios was diagnosed in participants with AFI ≤ 5 cm. We performed multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with oligohydramnios.

Results

We enrolled 426 women with a mean age of 27 (SD ± 5.3) years. Of the 426 participants, 40 had oligohydramnios, for a prevalence of 9.4% (95%CI: 6.8–12.6%). Factors found to be significantly associated with oligohydramnios were history of malaria in pregnancy (aOR = 4.6; 95%CI: 1.5–14, P = 0.008), primegravidity (aOR = 3.7; 95%CI: 1.6–6.7, P = 0.002) and increasing gestational age; compared to women at 37–39 weeks, those at 40–41 weeks (aOR = 2.5; 95%CI: 1.1–5.6, P = 0.022), and those at > 41 weeks (aOR = 6.0; 95%CI: 2.3–16, P = 0.001) were more likely to have oligohydramnios.

Conclusion

Oligohydramnios was detected in approximately one out of every ten women seeking care at MRRH, and it was more common among primigravidae, those with a history of malaria in pregnancy, and those with post-term pregnancies. We recommend increased surveillance for oligohydramnios in the third trimester, especially among prime gravidas, those with history of malaria in pregnancy, and those with post-term pregnancies, in order to enable prompt detection of this complication and plan timely interventions. Future longitudinal studies are needed to assess clinical outcomes in women with oligohydramnios in our setting.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^00e15037]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric ADPKD — definitions of diagnostic subentities specify that very-early-onset (VEO)-ADPKD requires symptoms or clinical evidence of severe ADPKD at age 18 mo defined by antenatal hyperechogenic enlarged kidneys (> 2 SD for gestational age) with oligohydramnios, or between birth and age 18 mo enlarged cystic kidneys (> 2 SD for age, sex, and height) with hypertension (BP ≥ 95th percentile for age, sex, and height) and/or decreased eGFR; early-onset (EO)-ADPKD is defined between ages 18 mo and 15 yr by enlarged cystic kidneys (> 2 SD for age, sex, and height) with hypertension (BP ≥ 95th percentile for age, sex, and height) and/or decreased eGFR. The guideline also defines a child with ADPKD as one with diagnosis not fulfilling VEO-ADPKD or EO-ADPKD criteria and a child at risk of ADPKD as one with potential for heritability in the setting of a relative known to have ADPKD, and it emphasizes that enlarged kidneys alone at a specified age are not sufficient to warrant VEO or EO terminology.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^5fccdf61]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid volume evaluation using ultrasonography — objective methods and diagnostic thresholds are detailed with preference for the deepest vertical pocket. It is recommended that objective, rather than subjective, measurements of amniotic fluid volume be used, especially in the third trimester. To qualify as a measurable amniotic fluid pocket with either method, the width of the pocket must be at least 1 cm. Oligohydramnios is described in various ways, including absence of a vertical pocket of at least 2 cm and an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of less than 5 cm; best available evidence supports using the deepest vertical pocket method of measurement because it leads to fewer interventions with no increase in poor perinatal outcomes compared with use of the AFI, and only the deepest vertical pocket method should be used with multiple pregnancies. Polyhydramnios commonly is described by an AFI greater than or equal to 24 cm or a maximum deepest vertical pocket of equal to or greater than 8 cm; idiopathic polyhydramnios represents 50–60% of cases.

Table 1.
Genetic causes of a kidney dysplasia phenotype

Prenatal screening for pathogenic variants in genes that cause kidney dysplasia (see Table 1) should not generally be recommended, because the molecular diagnosis is not reliably predictive for kidney function. However, in fetuses with syndromic features and/or hyperechogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios, prenatal genetic testing for chromosomal imbalances (cGH/karyotype) or ciliopathies may be offered and discussed carefully with the parents if termination of pregnancy is considered.

Prenatal genetic counselling and testing in fetuses with dysplastic kidneys may lead to termination of pregnancy and thus should be handled with the greatest caution. Prenatal sonography cannot reliably distinguish kidney dysplasia from other genetic kidney diseases such as ciliopathies. Hence, prenatal genetic testing should be focused on genetic conditions that, together with sonographic findings, correlate with a high degree of certainty with a dismal prognosis, e.g. syndromic diseases. Prenatal counselling should address these aspects and should be detailed and respectful to non-medical aspects relevant for patients and families mentioned in the previous section. Prenatal testing should only be offered after consultation with experienced pediatric nephrologists and human geneticists in line with local legislation. To provide families of children with kidney dysplasia with the best counselling possible, we suggest implementing multidisciplinary clinics, including a human geneticist, a pediatric nephrologist, and, e.g. in case of oligo/anhydramnios, a neonatologist and gynaecologist.

The causality of genetic variants in patients with kidney dysplasia should be interpreted with caution because many variants initially reported as causing CAKUT have not been confirmed in subsequent studies.

The rapidly growing knowledge about human gene variations is extremely helpful in re-evaluating variants that in the past have been considered pathogenic. This corrective instrument seems particularly important in CAKUT and has repeatedly led to reclassification of variants formerly considered pathogenic to likely benign. The classification for genetic variants of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics should be applied.

For genetic testing, we suggest next-generation sequencing (NGS) as the primary screening tool. If negative, consider trio-whole-exome sequencing (WES)/whole genome sequencing (WGS) with subsequent evaluation of all genes implicated in monogenic hereditary kidney diseases.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^8efbb72b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this hospital-based cross-sectional study in southwestern Uganda, we detected oligohydramnios in about one of every ten women at 37 weeks of gestation or beyond. Oligohydramnios was more common among participants with a history of malaria in pregnancy, those carrying their first pregnancy, and those with higher gestational age (40 weeks or beyond). Overall, these findings support the need to strengthen oligohydramnios surveillance in resource-constrained settings to enhance detection of this complication.

The prevalence of oligohydramnios of 9.4% reported in this study is similar to the prevalence of 11% reported in Italy in a hospital setting. However, it is higher than the prevalence of 4.4% that was reported in China. Much higher prevalence estimates compared to ours have been reported previously in India (17%) and South Africa (23%). The variation of the previous prevalence estimates from ours may be attributed to the differences in methodologies employed across the different studies. For instance, the study in China audited deliveries in various hospitals and relied on secondary data from individual medical records, while ours relied largely on primary data to ascertain the presence or absence of oligohydramnios. Unlike our study, the study in India did not exclude women with ruptured membranes, while Buchmann and colleagues in South Africa considered only mothers referred due to post-term pregnancies. This may explain the much higher prevalence rates reported in these two studies.

Methods

Study population and setting

We conducted this cross-sectional study at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) Maternity Ward and Antenatal Clinic from November 16, 2019 to March 12, 2020. MRRH is found in Mbarara District, 286 km southwest of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. It is a public hospital under the Ministry of Health (MoH). It serves 11 districts with an estimated population of about five million individuals. The hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST). The maternity ward handles about 10,000 deliveries per year. At the antenatal admissions' area, an average of 40 pregnant women are attended to on a daily basis. The hospital also has antenatal clinic that attends to approximately 40 pregnant mothers per day.

We included mothers who sought care at MRRH at a gestation age of 37 weeks or beyond, and who consented to participate in the study. We excluded mothers who had ruptured membranes, those in active stage of labour, and those with multiple pregnancies.

Data management and analysis

We entered data in EpiData 3.1 software (EpiData, Odense, Denmark) and exported the data to STATA version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA) for all statistical analyses. The prevalence of oligohydramnios was determined as the proportion of participants with oligohydramnios. We categorized all study variables; the categorical variables were described (as frequencies, and percentages) and compared among those with oligohydramnios and those without oligohydramnios using Chi square or Fischer's exact tests. Additionally, continuous, normally distributed variables (e.g. age, fetal weight, body mass index) were described as means with standard deviations. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with oligohydramnios. Covariates significant (with P < 0.05) at univariable analysis were included in the multivariable model to identify independent factors significantly associated with oligohydramnios (P < 0.05). We adjusted the final model for maternal age, as a potential confounder.

### Acute respiratory failure and short-term outcome after premature rupture of the membranes and oligohydramnios before 20 weeks of gestation [^a9d27d1d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To study the effect of premature rupture of membranes and oligohydramnios before 20 weeks of gestation (PROM20) on acute respiratory morbidity and on short-term outcome in infants with a gestational age ≥ 24 weeks.

Study Design

A historic cohort study was performed of all infants born after PROM20 with a gestational age greater-than-or-equal24 weeks between 1990 and 1999. Control infants were matched for year of birth, gestational age, and birth weight.

Results

PROM20 infants had an increased acute respiratory morbidity (higher ventilator settings and increased incidence of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and pulmonary hypertension) and a trend to more air leaks. Although not statistically different, PROM20 infants had more complications (neonatal survival, 68% vs 95%; severe intracranial hemorrhage, 31% vs 6%; chronic lung disease in surviving infants, 46% vs 17%). The relative risk for combined morbidity (death, intracranial hemorrhage, chronic lung disease) was increased (3.0, P = 0.019) when compared with matched control infants. However, 31% of the surviving PROM20 infants were discharged without apparent morbidity.

Conclusions

Expectant treatment in women with PROM20 and present neonatal intensive care has improved the survival of PROM20 infants despite severe initial respiratory failure. However, chronic morbidity still occurred.

Factors associated with oligohydramnios

In the multivariable analysis (Table 2), the odds of oligohydramnios were 2.5 times higher among participants with a history of malaria in pregnancy, compared to those who had no malaria in pregnancy. Prime gravidas were 3.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with oligohydramnios compared to multigravidas. There was an association between increasing gestational age and oligohydramnios; compared to mothers at 37–39 weeks, the odds of oligohydramnios were 2.5 times higher among participants who were at 40–41 weeks, and 6 times higher among participants who were at > 41 weeks of gestation.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^9840adfa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Of note, mothers with a history of malaria in the current pregnancy had significantly higher odds of oligohydramnios compared to those who did not have malaria in pregnancy. This is a new finding. A study conducted in Brazil among pregnant women with vivax malaria reported no association of malaria and oligohydramnios. However, it is worth noting that in the same study in Brazil, sonographic assessment done during the period of infection revealed thickened placentas with mal perfusion of the placentas, which may be a predisposing factor for oligohydramnios later in the pregnancy. In our study, we considered a record of documented diagnosis of malaria. There is also evidence of persistence of proteins that encode for apoptosis after placental malaria has been cleared by pharmaceutical agents. This study also considered vivax malaria, which is not common in our setting in Uganda, and is less virulent compared to Plasmodium falciparum, that has been found to be more common in our setting. Another study in Malawi reported adverse birth outcomes due to sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the placenta. Furthermore, malaria also leads to a dysregulation of angiopoietin, a protein that is responsible for vascular development in the placenta. In cases of placental insufficiency and chronic hypoxia, the fetus adapts to the new situation to protect its important organs, by redistributing the blood flow. This mechanism leads to decreased diuresis and secretion of pulmonary fluids and subsequently leads to oligohydramnios. These underlying pathological mechanisms may explain the association between oligohydramnios and malaria. Nevertheless, future studies in our Ugandan setting with Plasmodium falciparum endemicity are warranted to corroborate our research findings.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^82f1a113]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding polyhydramnios, the Association Factor (AF) we developed showed a very high value for craniospinal and abdominal and abdominal wall abnormalities (AF ≥ 5), high AF for cardiovascular abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, limb abnormalities and ossification disorders (2.5 ≤ AF < 5), while AF was moderate for craniofacial, thoracic and fetal abnormalities with subcutaneous oedema. Regarding oligohydramnios, AF showed a very high value for urogenital abnormalities (AF ≥ 5). The value was moderate for craniospinal, craniofacial, cardiovascular, other thoracic, abdominal and abdominal wall abnormalities, and limb abnormalities and ossification disorders (0.5 ≤ AF < 2.5).

Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios can have an impact on perinatal outcome. Aviram et al. reported that, comparing normal and gravid women with AFI greater than 20 cm after 34 weeks of gestation, cases with polyhydramnios had a higher rate of placental abruption and abnormal fetal heart rate. Compared to normal pregnancies, polyhydramnios may be associated with higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and neonatal respiratory distress. In addition to the increased justification for cesarean section and the risk of placental abruption, other authors have also highlighted the importance of increased observation, as polyhydramnios may lead to more frequent intrauterine death and prolonged dilation (first stage of labour). Other authors point to more frequent postpartum respiratory morbidity in polyhydramnios. In association with polyhydramnios, Walter et al. measured fetal growth restriction (FGR) in 4.6% of fetuses. Burwick et al. studied cases of fetal hydrops and measured increased volume of amniotic fluid in 39.8%. Of the 337 cases of hydrops, an increased rate of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and neonatal death was observed.

Association of fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios

In the case of anatomical structural abnormalities of various organ systems, several publications have described that it is more often associated with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, but specific percentages are rarely included in the literature. In the case of craniospinal anomalies, exencephaly/anencephaly, which can be classified as neural tube defects based on literature data, is often associated with polyhydramnios. In our own material, we found polyhydramnios in 22.08% of craniospinal anomalies. In the case of craniofacial anomalies, cleft lip and palate can lead to an increase in the amount of amniotic fluid due to difficulty swallowing. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 12.39% of all craniofacial anomalies. Cardiovascular disorders are often associated with polyhydramnios according to the literature. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 14.67% of cases of heart and great vessel disorders. In the case of thoracic and pulmonary disorders, congenital pulmonary airway malformation can lead to polyhydramnios if the lesion dislocates the mediastinal structures and causes compression of the oesophagus, thereby making swallowing and circulation of amniotic fluid difficult. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 19.23% of cases of thoracic and pulmonary disorders, and oligohydramnios occurred in 15.38%. Among abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, according to the literature, in addition to oesophageal atresia, duodenal atresia and other small intestinal atresia are often associated with polyhydramnios. Among abdominal wall anomalies, gastroschisis is often associated with polyhydramnios. In all abdominal and abdominal wall anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 31.44% of cases, and oligohydramnios occurred in 12.38%. Urogenital anomalies may be associated with polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios, and may affect the development of other organs. In all urogenital anomalies, polyhydramnios occurred in 20.14% of cases, and oligohydramnios occurred in 34.72%. Among limb anomalies and ossification disorders, Almeida et al. reported an exceptionally high rate of polyhydramnios (38.9%) in skeletal system anomalies. In our own material, polyhydramnios occurred in 21.95% of all limb anomalies and ossification disorders, and oligohydramnios in 11.76%.

### Indomethacin (Indocin) [^3e189dd4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including INDOCIN, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If INDOCIN treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue INDOCIN and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

Results

During the study period 5561 second deliveries occurred at our institution and were eligible for inclusion - 213 deliveries with isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery (3.8% of all deliveries) and 5348 pregnancies in the control group, with no oligohydramnios in previous delivery.

Demographic characteristics of the groups are presented in Table 1. There were no differences in maternal age, BMI (kg/m²), rate of smoking and comorbidities between the groups.

Obstetric and neonatal outcomes of the previous oligohydramnios and the control groups are presented in Table 2. Deliveries in the previous oligohydramnios group were notable for a higher gestational age, 39.6 ± 1.3 vs. 39.3 ± 1.4 weeks, p = 0.006, yet preterm birth rate was similar between the groups. After adjustment for gestational age, the previous oligohydramnios group had a significantly higher rate of oligohydramnios, 6.5% vs. 1.9%, aOR 3.37, 95%CI 1.89–6.00, composite placental disorders, 12.2% vs. 8.5%, aOR 2.13, 95%CI 1.35–3.35 and small for gestational age neonates, 7.9% vs. 4.2%, unadjusted OR OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.16–3.25.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^247fb3d5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Association between intrauterine detectability of fetal abnormalities and amniotic fluid volume

Changes in amniotic fluid volume have been shown to affect the detectability of fetal anatomical abnormalities. Ultrasound screenings are also affected by the difficulty of the examination.

In the case of polyhydramnios, the fetus, and thus the fetal anatomical abnormalities, are easier to visualize during ultrasound examination, whereas in the case of oligohydramnios, ultrasound examination is more difficult. This explains why we have seen an upward trend in the detection of anatomical abnormalities in all organ groups in the case of polyhydramnios. Thus, a higher proportion of fetal anatomical abnormalities were detected with greater efficiency when associated with polyhydramnios. The difference was significant for craniofacial abnormalities, cardiovascular abnormalities, and thoracic abnormalities, with an increase in the rate of in utero detection from 32.57 to 51.85% for craniofacial abnormalities, from 62.1 to 79.69% for cardiovascular abnormalities, and from 56.41 to 74.19% for thoracic abnormalities (Table 8.).

Table 8
Recognition of fetal malformations associated with polyhydramnios

When the fetal anatomical anomaly was associated with oligohydramnios, only cardiovascular, urogenital, limb anomalies, and ossification disorders, as well as anomalies with subcutaneous oedema, showed an upward trend in the detection of anomalies. However, in none of these cases was this trend significant.

For other organ systems, a decreasing trend in detectability was observed, and this trend was significant for craniospinal, craniofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and abdominal wall anomalies. In craniospinal anomalies, the intrauterine detection rate decreased from 66.04 to 39.58%, while in craniofacial anomalies, it decreased from 32.57 to 15.79%. In thoracic anomalies, it decreased from 56.41 to 41.67%, and in abdominal and abdominal wall defects, it decreased from 60.89 to 40.38% (Table 9).

### Trastuzumab-dkst (Ogivri) [^11b1a8df]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product [see Clinical Considerations].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Monitor women who received Ogivri during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.

Data

Human Data

In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab products during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence. Fetal manifestations includedpulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death. These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In most reported cases, amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped. In reported cases where trastuzumab therapy was resumed after amniotic index improved, oligohydramnios recurred.

Animal Data

In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg/kg given twice weekly (up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg/kg), trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early (Gestation Days 20 to 50) and late (Gestation Days 120 to 150) phases of gestation. The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33% and 25%, respectively, of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects.

### Valsartan (Diovan) [^a71384cf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Diovan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Published reports include cases of anhydramnios and oligohydramnios in pregnant women treated with valsartan (see Clinical Considerations).

When pregnancy is detected, consider alternative drug treatment and discontinue Diovan as soon as possible.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Survival in second trimester oligohydramnios secondary to bilateral pelviureteral junction obstruction [^114dc44c]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

The extent and onset of obstruction in hydronephrosis determine the varying degrees of renal impairment. Bilateral hydronephrosis, especially in combination with oligohydramnios, is considered a negative predictor for pregnancy outcome. We describe a case of bilateral pelviureteral junction obstruction causing severe oligohydramnios between 25 and 29 weeks of gestation. The prenatal and postnatal findings and treatment are demonstrated. In the presence of bilateral renal impairment and oligohydramnios, our patient had an unfavorable prognosis. The respiratory and renal function, however, were better than expected. We show how urinary tract reconstruction and neonatal intensive therapy can result in an acceptable outcome.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^155b4e8c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 Research implications

This study contributes to the existing literature on TOLAC by establishing high success rates and satisfactory maternal and neonatal outcomes in patients with a recent diagnosis of oligohydramnios. Although we demonstrated lower rates of adverse neonatal outcomes in patients who underwent TOLAC compared to PRCD, this was not statistically significant in multivariate analysis. This study serves as a steppingstone for future investigations, encouraging the development of targeted strategies to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in patients with oligohydramnios undergoing TOLAC. Further larger studies are needed to confirm our findings. Additionally, future studies should focus on TOLAC in other specific subgroups of patients with oligohydramnios, such as those with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), pre‐eclampsia, post‐term pregnancies, and fetuses with fetal growth restriction (FGR), as the sample size of our study was too small to assess these groups. This will help establish safety and explore predictive factors and potential interventions that can optimize TOLAC success rates in these specific subgroups.

In the present study, we chose to evaluate the outcomes of patients with oligohydramnios and one previous CD by comparing TOLAC to PRCD, rather than comparing patients with oligohydramnios who underwent TOLAC to those with normal amniotic fluid levels. This approach was intended to better inform our consultations with patients facing this concern. Although choosing a control group of patients with normal fluid levels would be academically interesting and add information about the additive risk of oligohydramnios itself, it does not address the clinical dilemma.

### Serial third-trimester ultrasonography compared with routine care in uncomplicated pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial [^4822df31]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Among uncomplicated pregnancies, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations identified significantly more cases with a composite of fetal growth or amniotic fluid abnormalities (27%) than did routine fundal height measurements (8%).

Methods

Women without complications between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation were randomized (NCT0270299) to either routine care (control arm) or ultrasound examination every 4 weeks (intervention arm). The primary outcome was a composite of abnormalities of fluid volume and growth: oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios; fetal growth restriction; or large for gestational age. The secondary outcome was the presence of composite maternal or neonatal morbidity among the two groups. A total of 206 participants was needed to have 80% power to detect an increase in the primary composite outcome from 10% in control to 25% in the intervention group (baseline rate 10%; two-tailed; α = 0.05; loss to follow-up 5%). All women were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Fisher exact, χ tests, or two-sample t tests were used to assess group differences.

Results

From July 11, 2016, to May 24, 2017, 852 women were screened for eligibility and 206 were randomized as follows: 102 in routine care and 104 in serial ultrasound examinations. The two groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. The primary composite outcome was significantly higher among women who were in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group (27% vs 8%; relative risk 3.43, 95% CI 1.64–7.17); five women (95% CI 3–11) were needed to identify at least one of the composite ultrasound abnormalities. Although we were underpowered to detect a significant difference, the following secondary endpoints occurred with similar frequency in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group: induction resulting from abnormal ultrasound examination findings (14% vs 6%), cesarean delivery in labor (5% vs 6%), and prespecified composite maternal morbidity (9% in both groups) and composite neonatal morbidity (1% vs 4%).

Conclusion

Among uncomplicated pregnancies between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations were significantly more likely to identify abnormalities of fetal growth or amniotic fluid than measurements of fundal height and indicated ultrasound examination. No differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted, although we were underpowered for these endpoints.

### Perinatal outcomes and predictors of neonatal mortality in preterm premature rupture of membranes: a tertiary center experience [^533bcacf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, our study demonstrates the influence of gestational age, birth weight, and neonatal complications on mortality in PPROM. It demonstrates the importance of expectant management in the early weeks of gestation and supports the role of active management after 34 weeks of gestation in improving neonatal outcomes. The increased incidence of oligohydramnios in non-surviving infants indicates a possible relationship with adverse outcomes. Although our results are consistent with the literature, methodological differences and patient distribution should be considered when interpreting neonatal mortality rates. Prospective studies with larger cohorts are needed to improve PPROM management and better define risk factors.
