## Question

TEETHING DIARRHEA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diarrhea during infant teething is a real, causal phenomenon or a myth, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality prospective evidence on teething symptoms. Then, I should verify whether any observed associations persist when timing windows and observer bias are addressed. Next, I will examine biological plausibility and competing explanations for concurrent diarrhea. After that, I need to review cultural and behavioral confounders that inflate attribution. Finally, I will translate this into practical, guideline-based management and counseling for families, including when to investigate further and when to treat supportively.

> Let me first confirm the best evidence base. The most rigorous prospective cohort found that parent-reported loose stools were weakly associated with tooth eruption days, but this association disappeared when the peri-eruption window was extended or when staff (rather than parents) reported symptoms, suggesting recall and expectation bias rather than a causal link, and the authors explicitly cautioned against attributing severe symptoms to teething [^114bnNap]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and fragility: the odds ratio for parent-reported loose stools was about 1.86 in a 5-day pre-eruption window but fell to non-significance with broader windows, reinforcing that the signal is small and unstable [^114bnNap].

> I should also review corroborating data. A separate longitudinal study reported that diarrhea was among several symptoms associated with eruption, but the design relied on maternal recall and lacked objective confirmation, making it vulnerable to the same attribution bias seen historically in caregiver reports, so I need to be cautious about inferring causality from that signal [^113bAknd]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even when symptoms co-occur temporally, that does not establish that eruption causes diarrhea, especially when infectious exposures are common in this age group [^1111fp8e] [^113Whbf9].

> Next, I should review biological plausibility. I need to check whether there is a credible mechanism linking tooth eruption to diarrheal physiology. Local gingival inflammation does not directly alter intestinal motility or secretion, and no robust mechanistic data demonstrate a pathway from erupting teeth to systemic gastrointestinal effects, which weakens a causal interpretation of any observed association [^notfound]. Hmm, wait a minute, could salivary changes or swallowing of blood explain it? Even if minor blood is swallowed, that would not produce clinically meaningful diarrhea, so this line of reasoning does not rescue a causal claim [^notfound].

> I will now examine competing explanations for concurrent diarrhea. Infants 6–24 months are in the peak window for viral gastroenteritis and early bacterial enteropathogens, and they explore environments with high fecal-oral exposure, so infectious diarrhea is common and often coincides with teething chronologically, creating an illusion of causation where there is only correlation [^113Whbf9] [^1111fp8e]. Hold on, I should verify that this age overlap is indeed the highest-risk period; yes, norovirus and rotavirus are notably prevalent in infants and young children, and transmission is predominantly fecal-oral, which fits the observed timing with tooth eruption without implying causality [^1111fp8e] [^113Whbf9].

> Let me consider cultural and behavioral confounders. Caregivers frequently attribute fever, diarrhea, and vomiting to teething, and this belief can delay appropriate care-seeking or drive harmful practices such as milk tooth extraction in some settings, illustrating how strong priors distort attribution and perpetuate harm [^1168CqpP] [^112Kauzw]. I should double-check whether these beliefs are documented in observational studies; indeed, caregivers report delaying treatment because they believe symptoms are "just teething", which can worsen outcomes for treatable infections [^116NhUad].

> But wait, what if the child truly has mild, watery stools only around eruption days? Even then, I need to ensure we do not anchor on teething as the cause. The safest, evidence-aligned approach is to treat presumed viral gastroenteritis supportively unless red flags emerge, rather than invoking teething as an etiology, because the balance of evidence shows no consistent, causal relationship between tooth eruption and diarrhea [^114bnNap] [^117Jf4mx]. I should confirm that this stance aligns with pediatric guidance; yes, authoritative summaries emphasize that severe symptoms should not be attributed to teething and warrant standard evaluation for illness [^117Jf4mx].

> Next, I should review practical management. For mild, acute watery diarrhea in an otherwise well infant, I need to ensure hydration with reduced-osmolarity ORS, continue breastfeeding or formula, and avoid routine antibiotics or antimotility agents, reserving further workup for red flags or persistence, which is consistent with IDSA guidance for acute infectious diarrhea in children [^111KxZ6T] [^115oX9BJ] [^111LYwyM]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and feeding advice; IDSA supports ORS as first-line for mild to moderate dehydration and continuation of human milk feeding throughout the episode, with resumption of age-appropriate diet after rehydration, which fits the typical teething-age infant scenario [^111KxZ6T] [^114vDXPN].

> I need to ensure I address zinc appropriately. Zinc can shorten diarrhea duration in children older than 6 months in settings of zinc deficiency or malnutrition, but evidence does not support benefit in infants under 6 months, so I should avoid routine zinc in younger infants and consider it selectively in older infants if deficiency risk is likely, per Cochrane and IDSA-aligned recommendations [^111KYhPn] [^1142JPfE]. Wait, let me verify the age threshold; yes, systematic reviews consistently show no benefit under 6 months, so I should not extrapolate zinc use downward in age without a compelling indication [^111KYhPn].

> I should confirm when to escalate evaluation. Red flags include blood in stool, high fever, persistent vomiting, signs of dehydration, weight loss or failure to thrive, or diarrhea lasting beyond 14 days, which should prompt assessment for bacterial or parasitic etiologies and noninfectious causes rather than attributing symptoms to teething [^1125KSJb]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent diarrhea warrants a different diagnostic approach; IDSA advises against empiric antimicrobials in persistent watery diarrhea and emphasizes targeted testing and management, reinforcing that teething should not delay appropriate workup when red flags are present [^111LYwyM].

> Finally, I need to ensure safe counseling on teething discomfort. I should advise against benzocaine or lidocaine gels and homeopathic teething tablets due to serious risks, and instead recommend mechanical soothing with a clean finger or firm rubber teether, which aligns with FDA and AAP guidance and avoids conflating teething care with systemic symptom treatment [^115RW43K]. Let me reconsider whether any teething intervention could plausibly treat diarrhea; none are supported, and exposing infants to risky teething products adds harm without benefit, so the focus should remain on hydration and illness evaluation when diarrhea occurs [^115RW43K].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: current high-quality evidence does not support a causal relationship between teething and diarrhea. Observed associations are weak, inconsistent across observers, and likely reflect temporal coincidence and caregiver reporting bias, so diarrhea during teething should be managed as standard pediatric gastroenteritis with supportive care, attention to hydration, and appropriate thresholds for further evaluation, not as a teething effect [^114bnNap] [^117Jf4mx] [^111KxZ6T].

---

Teething does not directly cause diarrhea, but infants may have **mild, transient loose stools** around tooth eruption due to increased salivation, dietary changes, or minor viral infections [^114bnNap] [^113bAknd]. Diarrhea from teething is **typically mild and self-limited**, resolving within a few days with supportive care. Persistent, severe, or bloody diarrhea warrants evaluation for infection or other causes [^111iwEH6]. Management is supportive — maintain hydration, continue age-appropriate feeding, and avoid teething gels with benzocaine or lidocaine due to safety concerns [^115RW43K].

---

## Evidence linking teething and diarrhea

- **Prospective cohort study**: Parent-reported loose stools were modestly associated with tooth eruption (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.26–2.73), but this association disappeared when the peri-eruption window was extended, suggesting a weak, non-causal link [^114bnNap].

- **Longitudinal study**: Diarrhea was among symptoms reported during teething, but the study did not establish causality and noted that severe symptoms (e.g. high fever) should not be attributed to teething [^113bAknd].

- **AAFP review**: No association was found between tooth eruption and diarrhea, cough, or high fever, reinforcing that teething is not a direct cause of diarrhea [^117Jf4mx].

---

## Proposed mechanisms for teething-related diarrhea

Several **indirect mechanisms** may explain mild diarrhea around teething:

- **Increased salivation**: Excess saliva may be swallowed, potentially softening stools and causing mild looseness.

- **Dietary changes**: Teething infants often introduce new foods or objects, increasing exposure to pathogens or dietary irritants.

- **Immune response**: Minor viral infections may coincide with teething, causing mild gastrointestinal symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Clinical characteristics of teething-related diarrhea

Teething-related diarrhea is **typically mild and self-limited**:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Severity | Mild, watery stools without blood or mucus |
| Duration | Transient, usually resolving within a few days |
| Associated symptoms | Mild irritability, drooling, gum discomfort, low-grade fever (< 38°C) [^117Jf4mx] |
| Dehydration risk | Low, as stools are mild and infrequent |

---

## Differentiating teething-related diarrhea from other causes

Persistent, severe, or bloody diarrhea **requires evaluation** for other causes:

- **Infectious diarrhea**: Viral (Rotavirus, Norovirus), bacterial (Salmonella, Campylobacter), or parasitic infections [^1111fp8e].

- **Antibiotic-associated diarrhea**: Clostridioides difficile infection or altered gut flora [^114rdUyt].

- **Food allergies or intolerances**: Cow's milk protein allergy, lactose intolerance [^116C1ygj].

- **Chronic gastrointestinal conditions**: Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease [^11229cKk].

---

## Management strategies for teething-related diarrhea

Management is **supportive and focused on symptom relief**:

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake with breast milk, formula, or oral rehydration solutions [^111KxZ6T].

- **Diet**: Continue age-appropriate feeding; avoid sugary or artificially sweetened beverages [^114vDXPN].

- **Hygiene**: Frequent handwashing to prevent secondary infections [^114geuHh].

- **Teething relief**: Use chilled (not frozen) teething rings, gentle gum massage, or acetaminophen for discomfort [^115RW43K].

- **Avoidance**: Do not use benzocaine or lidocaine gels due to methemoglobinemia risk; avoid teething jewelry due to choking hazard [^1177QAV9] [^115RW43K].

---

## Potential complications and risks

Teething-related diarrhea is **typically benign**, but complications can occur if diarrhea is severe or persistent:

- **Dehydration**: Rare with mild, transient diarrhea but possible if fluid losses are significant [^113ryeAc].

- **Secondary infections**: Poor hygiene can lead to additional infections [^114geuHh].

- **Delayed care-seeking**: Attributing severe symptoms to teething may delay appropriate medical evaluation and treatment [^116NhUad].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical evaluation is indicated if any of the following occur:

- Persistent diarrhea (> 7 days) or recurrent episodes.

- Severe diarrhea with frequent, watery stools or dehydration signs (dry mouth, decreased urine, lethargy) [^111Z41kw].

- Blood or mucus in stool, high fever, vomiting, or signs of illness [^113ryeAc].

- Poor weight gain or failure to thrive [^11229cKk].

---

Teething does not directly cause diarrhea, but infants may have **mild, transient loose stools** around tooth eruption. This is typically self-limited and managed with supportive care; persistent or severe diarrhea warrants evaluation for other causes [^114bnNap].

### Tigecycline (Tygacil) [^115dwNEQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Tooth Discoloration and Inhibition of Bone Growth

Advise pregnant women that TYGACIL may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)].

Lactation

Advise a woman not to breastfeed for longer than 3 weeks while taking TYGACIL because of the lack of data on effects due to prolonged breastfeeding, and the theoretical risk of dental discoloration and inhibition of bone growth. Women may also consider reducing infant exposure through pumping and discarding breastmilk during and for 9 days after the last dose of tigecycline [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Diarrhea

Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including TYGACIL. Sometimes, frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection. If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops, advise patients to contact his or her healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Development of Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including TYGACIL should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When TYGACIL is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by TYGACIL or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Pediatric Use

In clinical studies, colistimethate sodium was administered to the pediatric population (neonates, infants, children and adolescents). Although adverse reactions appear to be similar in the adult and pediatric populations, subjective symptoms of toxicity may not be reported by pediatric patients. Close clinical monitoring of pediatric patients is recommended.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Coly-Mycin M should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Coly-Mycin M is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Coly-Mycin M or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Toddler diarrhoea: is it a useful diagnostic label? [^117HYu8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Toddler diarrhoea is a term coined many years ago to describe a young child who passes several loose stools a day but who is otherwise healthy with excellent growth and normal examination. It could be argued that it is not an appropriate diagnostic term as it potentially stops the clinician from thinking about the possible causes of loose stools in this clinical situation. This article, which follows a debate between the authors on the topic at the 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual meeting, discusses the differential diagnoses of a young child presenting with the so-called toddler diarrhoea.

### Dietary supplements in children [^113iDj5B]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

High-quality systematic reviews of use of herbal or homeopathic remedies in children often suffer from design flaws, such as not following PRISMA guidelines, inconsistent outcome measurements, and paucity of high-quality studies. Herbal remedies have modest demonstrated benefits with insufficient evidence to recommend any particular supplement. Homeopathic remedies have no role in treatment of pediatric conditions, and have been associated with great harm in infants given homeopathic teething products. Two types of herbal supplements are associated with high risk in adolescents, energy drinks and adulterated weight-loss products. Parents should be counseled about risks of these products.

### Inconsistency in diarrhea measurements when assessing intervention impact in a non-blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial [^114sM8rN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diarrhea is among the top five leading causes of total years of life lost globally. It is still a major cause of child mortality and morbidity in low-income countries. – Most of the pathogens that cause diarrhea are transmitted via the fecal–oral route. Interventions that improve the quality of drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) behavior can potentially interrupt transmission and reduce diarrhea. – One of the commonly used indicators to assess effectiveness of these environmental interventions is reported diarrhea. – For example, a systematic review of 45 cluster-randomized controlled trials for assessing effectiveness of improving water quality for diarrhea reduction shows that the primary outcome in all of these studies was reported diarrhea. Data collectors usually collect this information by regularly visiting study households and asking an adult participant to recall diarrhea episodes experienced by household members within recent days or weeks. Measuring diarrhea objectively such as by observing diarrhea-associated hospital admissions or by complementing disease reporting with microbiological testing of stool for specific microorganisms is prone to less subjective reporting bias, and hence is a preferred way of measuring diarrhea compared with reported outcomes. However, these approaches require larger study sizes to capture these less common outcomes and are more complex and costly, and so are deployed less commonly. – Concerns raised regarding reliability of reported diarrhea include courtesy bias, imperfect and biased recall, – and surveillance fatigue. – In addition, there is concern about the reliability of measuring subjective health outcomes in non-blinded trials due to observer bias. A systematic review of 21 randomized clinical trials with blinded and non-blinded assessment of the same binary outcome showed that the non-blinded assessors of subjective binary outcomes generated substantially biased effect estimates. Because of these concerns, in some non-blinded trials, a reduction of diarrhea by even 50% may not necessarily be due to a true intervention effect. To overcome this, it is now recommended that in studies where blinding is not possible, there should be at least one objectively assessed outcome even if the primary outcome is subjective. Alternatively, validation studies for estimating the degree of bias should be incorporated to improve data interpretation.

### Pharmacologic effects of naldemedine, a peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonist, in in vitro and in vivo models of opioid-induced constipation [^114evNU2]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

3.6 Effect of naldemedine on opioid withdrawal

The influence of naldemedine on opioid withdrawal was evaluated by examining possible naldemedine‐precipitated withdrawal symptoms in morphine‐dependent rats. Treatment with naldemedine at oral doses of 0.01‐3 mg kg −1 did not result in jumping behavior in morphine‐dependent rats. However, naldemedine 1 mg kg −1 increased diarrhea scores (P < 0.05 at 2 hours postdose vs control); and naldemedine 3 mg kg −1 increased teeth chattering (P < 0.05 at 1, 4, and 8 hours postdose vs control) and diarrhea scores (P < 0.05 at 1 hour postdose vs control; Figure 5). Loss of body weight was noted at naldemedine doses ≥ 0.3 mg kg −1 (P < 0.05 for 0.3 mg kg −1; P < 0.01 for 1 and 3 mg kg −1 vs control; Figure 5). In another study evaluating possible naldemedine‐precipitated central withdrawal symptoms at higher doses of up to 7 mg kg −1, naldemedine did not result in jumping behavior in morphine‐dependent rats, although a slight increase in the number of wet‐dog shakes was observed at oral doses ≥ 5 mg kg −1 (P < 0.05 for the 5‐ and 7‐mg kg −1 doses at 4 hours postdose; P < 0.01 for the 5‐ and 7‐mg kg −1 doses at 6 hours postdose). The no‐observed‐effect levels of naldemedine for central and peripheral withdrawal signs are shown in Table 3.

### Risk of respiratory infection following diarrhea among adult women and infants in Nepal [^116Ro48p]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Globally, diarrheal and respiratory infections are responsible for more than 24% of deaths in children aged less than 5 years and are major sources of adult morbidity and mortality. Decreasing childhood mortality is one of the major goals of public health. Historically, gastrointestinal and respiratory infections have been studied separately; however, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease may predispose infants and young children to respiratory illness and is associated with more severe illness. – Furthermore, children who have concurrent diarrhea and respiratory illness are at a substantially increased risk of death compared with either illness alone. A proposed mechanism of this association is B and T cells cocirculation between the mucosal sites of the gut and the respiratory tract. – Alterations in the gut microbiome through infection, medications, or other processes can alter mucosal immune responses and increase susceptibility to infection at other mucosal sites, including the lungs.

To our knowledge, diarrhea as a risk factor for respiratory illness, particularly in adults, has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of respiratory illness and infection following diarrheal illness among pregnant women, postpartum women, and infants in rural southern Nepal. This study is a secondary analysis of symptom data from two community-based, prospective randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization of pregnant women conducted in rural Nepal from 2011 to 2014. The trials prospectively enrolled 3,693 pregnant women and surveyed them weekly during pregnancy and up to 6 months postpartum for gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms. Symptom data for their 3,646 infants were also collected weekly. Diarrheal illness episodes were defined as at least three watery bowel movements per day for one or more days, with seven or more diarrhea-free days between episodes. Respiratory illness is defined as the presence of fever with an additional respiratory symptom (i.e. cough, difficulty breathing, runny nose, or nasal congestion). For subjects with more than one episode of diarrhea, only the first episode was included in the analysis.

### Mothers / caregivers healthcare seeking behavior towards childhood illness in selected health centers in addis ababa, Ethiopia: a facility-based cross-sectional study [^116NhUad]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Magnitude, previous experience and severity perception of childhood illness

The diseases specific magnitude of most common symptoms reported by the mothers/caregivers were fever, cough, diarrhea and vomiting among 182(43.1%), 134(31.8%), 128(30.3%), and 81(19.2%) of the children, respectively. The average symptom days reported was 3 ± 4.0 days, ranging from 1 to 36 days. From the result, the commonest childhood diseases that were confirmed by health professionals for under-five children were ARI and diarrhea, which accounts for 201(47.6%) and 131(31.0%), respectively (Fig. 1). With regard to mothers/caregivers perception of illness severity, 128(30.3%) of them perceived it as severe, 163(38.6%) as moderate and 131(31.1%) as mild.

### Evaluation of the association between periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iidbo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral and dental diseases are among the most common worldwide and negatively impact various aspects of individual and societal health. Among the common oral diseases, periodontal disease is caused by bacteria's penetration into the deeper tissues surrounding the teeth and periodontium. This, combined with the host's defense response to microbial agents, leads to the destruction of the periodontium and loss of alveolar bone. Furthermore, the loss of periodontal support significantly reduces chewing function and molar bite force. The significant prevalence of periodontal disease contributes to the growing global burden of chronic non-communicable diseases. Over the past decade, the prevalence of periodontal disease among adults has been estimated at approximately 62%, with severe periodontitis affecting 23.6% of the population. Compared to estimates from 1990 to 2010, these findings indicate a concerning trend in the rising prevalence of periodontal conditions.

Periodontal disease significantly impacts oral and dental health and quality of life, with its severity correlating to an increased adverse effect. Although therapeutic interventions can improve self-reported quality of life, several studies have demonstrated a relationship between periodontal diseases and systemic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, digestive diseases, respiratory diseases, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to a group of chronic and recurrent disorders that affect the gastrointestinal tract, with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) representing the principal forms of the condition. IBD is experiencing a global rise, marked by notable variations in prevalence and distinct disease trends across different countries and regions. UC predominantly affects the colon and rectum, with inflammation confined to the mucosal layer. In contrast, CD can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by inflammation that penetrates the full thickness of the intestinal wall. IBD is associated with a variety of debilitating symptoms, including acute diarrhea, rectal bleeding, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue. These symptoms can significantly impact mental and social well-being, leading to extensive consequences for affected individuals. Furthermore, the progression of IBD is typically chronic and may be linked to various systemic conditions that compromise both the physical and mental well-being of patients. This situation affects individuals directly and imposes a significant economic burden on patients and healthcare systems.

Isosporiasis — clinical manifestations in children with and exposed to HIV include that, based on limited data, the incubation period averages approximately 1 week but may range from several days to ≥ 2 weeks; symptom onset may be acute or insidious. The most common symptom is watery (non-bloody) diarrhea, which can be profuse and result in dehydration, weight loss, and malabsorption, and affected people also can have crampy abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Biliary disease and reactive arthritis also have been reported, and whereas immunocompetent hosts typically have self-limited infection, chronic and debilitating diarrhea is common in patients with uncontrolled HIV.

### Acute diarrheal disease in children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment [^112d1yoU]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Diarrhea is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The causes of acute diarrhea in children vary with the location, time of year, and population studied. There is increasing recognition of a widening array of enteric pathogens associated with diarrheal diseases. Adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement and maintenance are key to managing diarrheal illnesses. Thorough clinical and epidemiologic evaluation is needed to define the severity and type of illness, exposures, and whether the patient in is immunocompromised to direct the performance of selective diagnosis cultures, toxin testing, parasite studies, and the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

### The parental appraisal of the morbidity of diarrhea in infants and toddlers (PAMODI) survey [^117SwfYC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

This study analyzed parental perception of the impact of diarrhea on quality of life of their children. A standardized questionnaire was completed by 2023 parents in Germany with children with diarrhea who were younger than 2 years old. Parents stated the most worrying aspects of diarrhea. A health score was measured using a visual analogue scale (0 = worst health, 100 = best health). Clinical symptoms were quoted by 72% of parents as one of the most worrying dimensions, with duration/frequency of diarrhea and weight loss perceived most meaningful. Next were behavioral/physical symptoms (51%), with an inflamed bottom for mild disease and pain for severe cases being most meaningful. Parental concern is characterized by sympathy and anxiety for the child. The health score for the diarrheal episode was 54.6 for mild and 33.9 for severe cases. Parents perceive a high disease burden of diarrhea and clinically less meaningful aspects play a significant role.

Change in PD Over Time

We assessed whether the odds of PD among MSD cases had changed between GEMS versus VIDA, using regression models that tested for interaction between the studies and age category, study site, and diarrhea type (bloody or watery). Odds ratios and 95% CIs were reported for the probability of persistence, comparing VIDA and GEMS by age and study site. Adjusted models were constructed, including interaction terms for bloody diarrhea versus WD and site, and adjusted for stunting, antibiotic prescription, fever, vomiting, stool frequency, lethargy, dehydration, caregiver education, and household electricity.

Clinical Outcomes

We examined the association of each syndrome with growth faltering by comparing the change in HAZ between enrollment and the 60-day follow-up visit among case patients in VIDA and their matched controls using adjusted linear regression, adjusting for the following variables selected a priori: age, study site, enrollment HAZ, caregiver education level, and follow-up time.

Few deaths were reported in the study, so to include the maximum number of participants when examining the association between diarrheal syndromes and deaths, participants without memory-aid data were included if they had a final "child health" variable (where death was recorded) and the death date could be used to infer the duration of diarrhea. Owing to low outcome numbers, adjusted models were not feasible. We used χ² tests to assess the differences in frequency of deaths, comparing those who had dysentery versus WD and comparing those with PD versus no PD. Dichotomous variables were compared using χ² tests, and continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < .05.

Ethical Review

The current study was approved by the ethical review committees at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (no. HP-00062472), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (reliance agreement 6729), The Gambia Government/Medical Research Council/Gambia at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (no. 1409), the Comité d'Ethique de la Faculté de Médecine, de Pharmacie, et d'Odonto-Stomatologie, Bamako, Mali (no number), and the Kenya Medical Research Institute Scientific & Ethics Review Unit in Siaya County, Kenya (no.

### Sarecycline hydrochloride (Seysara) [^113XCzEb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Teratogenic Effects

SEYSARA, like other tetracyclines, can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If SEYSARA is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking SEYSARA, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus and treatment should be stopped immediately.

The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of these drugs, but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported.

All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated with SEYSARA during pregnancy in association with maternal toxicity [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.2 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea (Antibiotic Associated Colitis)

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to potential overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile should be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Teething and Tooth eruption in infants: a cohort study [^114bnNap]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

Many symptoms are attributed to teething in infants. There is little evidence to support these beliefs, despite their implications for clinical management. We investigated relationships between tooth eruption, fever, and teething symptoms.

Methods

Prospective cohort study.

Participants

Twenty-one children 6 to 24 months old attending 3 suburban long-day care centers ≥ 3 days/week. Measures. 1) Daily temperature recording and examination of alveolar ridges for tooth eruption (dental therapist). 2) Daily questionnaires-symptoms over preceding 24 hours (staff and parents independently). 3) Final questionnaire-beliefs/experiences related to teething (parents). Definitions. Eruption day-the first day a tooth could be seen or felt. Non-toothdays-more than 28 days clear of any eruption day. Toothdays-the 5 days preceding eruption days.

Results

Data were collected for 236 toothdays and 895 non-toothdays pertaining to 90 teeth. Child temperatures were similar on toothdays and non-toothdays (36.21 vs 36.18, paired t test). Logistic regression adjusted for age did not show an association between toothdays and temperature (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.80, 2.27 for high fever; OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.48, 3.77 for low fever). Logistic regression models allowing for within-child cluster effects and age were fitted to daily staff and parent reports of mood, wellness/illness, drooling/dribbling, sleep, diarrhea, strong diapers, red cheeks, and rashes/flushing. Only parent-reported (but not staff-reported) loose stools were significantly associated with tooth eruption (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1. 26, 2.73). When the toothday definition was varied to 10 days preceding or 5 days surrounding tooth eruption, this single significant association was no longer apparent (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.98, 2.05 and OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.97, 2.21, respectively). All parents retrospectively reported that their own children had suffered a range of teething symptoms.

Conclusions

This study did not confirm the expected strong associations between tooth eruption and a range of teething symptoms in children 6 to 30 months old, although we cannot rule out the possibility that weak associations may exist (Type II error). These findings contrast with strong parent and professional beliefs to the contrary. Such beliefs may preclude optimal management of common patterns of illness and behavior in young children.teething, infants, symptoms, tooth eruption, illness.

### Efficacy of zinc in young infants with acute watery diarrhea [^117T4boV]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies reported that zinc significantly reduced the duration and volume of acute watery diarrhea in children aged ≥ 4 mo, but there were no data specifically on infants aged < 6 mo.

Objective

This study investigated the effect of zinc on the duration of illness and the stool quantity in acute watery diarrhea of infants aged 1–6 mo by comparing a 20 mg Zn/d dose with a 5 mg Zn/d dose.

Design

Infants hospitalized with at least some dehydration (by World Health Organization classification) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Infants were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg Zn (acetate)/d, 5 mg Zn/d, or placebo for the duration of illness.

Results

Two hundred seventy-five infants were enrolled between 20 September 1998 and 18 December 2000. Neither diarrhea duration nor mean stool volume differed between groups. There were no significant differences in fluid intake, the need for unscheduled intravenous fluid, weight gain, or vomiting rates between the groups.

Conclusions

Zinc supplementation did not affect diarrhea duration or stool volume in young infants. Young infants tolerated both zinc doses. A beneficial effect on subsequent illness cannot be ruled out.

### Safely soothing teething pain in infants and children… [^115RW43K]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Teething is a normal experience for infants and children, but it can be painful. Many well-meaning parents and caregivers who want to ease a child's pain might turn to products that could be harmful. Soothing children's gums with prescription or nonprescription medicines containing benzocaine or lidocaine – or homeopathic tablets and other products – might seem like good options. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration warns that these products can be dangerous to children and can lead to serious injury, and even death. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends alternative ways for treating teething pain, including rubbing infants' gums with a clean finger, or providing a teething ring made of firm rubber to chew on. On average, infants begin teething around age 4 to 7 months and have a total of 20 "baby teeth" by 3 years of age. According to the AAP, occasional symptoms of teething include mild irritability, a low-grade fever, drooling, and an urge to chew something hard.

Topical Drugs and Teething Jewelry Used for Teething Have Risks Topical medications containing benzocaine or lidocaine offer little to no benefit and are associated with serious risks when used for teething pain in children. These include creams, gels, and homeopathic teething tablets. Topical oral viscous lidocaine solution – a prescription drug used to treat certain types of mouth pain – also should not be used to treat teething pain in infants and young children. It can cause grave harm, such as heart problems, severe brain injury and even death. In addition, topical oral viscous lidocaine solution can cause seizures in infants and young children when too much is applied, or it is accidentally swallowed. The FDA also has received reports of death and serious injuries to infants and children, including strangulation and choking, caused by teething jewelry, such as amber teething necklaces.

What You Can Do to Ease Teething Pain If a child's gums are swollen and tender, gently rub or massage the gums with your finger, or give the child a firm teether made of rubber to chew on. Make sure the teething ring is not frozen. If the object is too hard, it can hurt the child's gums. Be sure to supervise children so they don't accidentally choke on the teething ring.

### Doxycycline [^111JQXtk]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following the use of antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

### Extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease in children: their prevalence and association with human leukocyte antigens and pathological and laboratory evaluations [^111jvNxX]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disease caused by gluten intake in genetically predisposed individuals. It results in high concentrations of celiac-specific autoantibodies and varying degrees of small intestine inflammation, as well as a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal- (GI), classical and extra-intestinal-, or non-classical symptoms.

Diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and weight loss are considered to be the most common complaints of patients with CD; these are due to maldigestion and malabsorption caused by intestinal villous atrophy. Constipation, frequent vomiting, or heartburn are less common and may lead to a misdiagnosis (e.g. a functional problem or irritable bowel syndrome). The manifestations of CD vary based on the population: Diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal distention (bloating), and failure-to-thrive are among the most common GI symptoms in children, including those younger than three years old, while adults and adolescents suffer more from diarrhea, bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, and weight loss.

Traditionally CD was believed to be a disease of the GI tract, although many extra-intestinal manifestations (EIM) symptoms were reported in the literature, and nowadays CD is considered to be a systemic disease. Growth retardation, short stature, delayed puberty, dental enamel hypoplasia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, iron-deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation, recurrent stomatitis, liver and biliary disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, arthralgia/arthritis are the most common EIM seen in the pediatric CD population. In addition, CD patients can exhibit a wide range of neurological symptoms such as headache, paresthesia, neuroinflammation, anxiety, and depression. Most of these symptoms can be reversed by a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), albeit fatigue and some neurological symptoms, as well as functional GI issues, may remain for a long time in a subset of CD patients. Interestingly, the prevalence of CD EIM is similar in pediatric (60%) and adult (62%) CD, while the specific EIM and recovery rates vary. Short stature is the most prevalent EIM in children with CD, while iron deficiency anemia is the most common in adults. Fatigue and headaches are two of the more prevalent EIM in both children and adults. Compared to adults, children appear to improve at a much higher and faster rate.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111ndPHx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### Eravacycline (Xerava) [^116rMHyJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Serious Allergic Reactions

Advise patients that allergic reactions, including serious allergic reactions, could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment. Ask patient about any previous hypersensitivity reactions to antibacterial drugs including tetracycline or other allergens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Tooth Discoloration and Inhibition of Bone Growth

Advise patients that XERAVA, like other tetracycline-class drugs, may cause permanent tooth discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Advise patients that they should tell their healthcare provider right away if they become pregnant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)].

Lactation

Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with XERAVA and for 4 days after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including XERAVA, which usually ends when the antibacterial drug is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drug, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) which may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection, even as late as 2 or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Tetracycline Class Adverse Reactions

Inform patients that XERAVA is similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Overgrowth of Non-susceptible Microorganisms

Inform patients that antibacterial drugs including XERAVA may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms, including fungi [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including XERAVA should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (for example, the common cold). When XERAVA is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by XERAVA or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Two Phase 3 trials were conducted involving 436 infants age 3 months-23 months. One 6-week randomized vehicle-controlled trial with a 20-week open-label phase and one safety trial, up to one year, were conducted. In the 6-week trial, 11% of ELIDEL and 48% of vehicle subjects did not complete this trial; no subject in either group discontinued due to adverse events. Infants on ELIDEL Cream, 1% had an increased incidence of some adverse events compared to vehicle. In the 6-week vehicle-controlled trial, these adverse events included pyrexia (32% vs. 13% vehicle), URI (24% vs. 14%), nasopharyngitis (15% vs. 8%), gastroenteritis (7% vs. 3%), otitis media (4% vs. 0%), and diarrhea (8% vs. 0%). In the open-label phase of the trial, for infants who switched to ELIDEL Cream, 1% from vehicle, the incidence of the above-cited adverse events approached or equaled the incidence of those subjects who remained on ELIDEL Cream, 1%. In the 6-month safety data, 16% of ELIDEL and 35% of vehicle subjects discontinued early and 1.5% of ELIDEL and 0% of vehicle subjects discontinued due to adverse events. Infants on ELIDEL Cream, 1% had a greater incidence of some adverse events as compared to vehicle.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^111KYhPn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using either a fixed-effect or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Thirty-three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency. Acute diarrhoeaThere is currently not enough evidence from well-conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence). In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD -11.46 hours, 95% CI -19.72 to -3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD -26.39 hours, 95% CI -36.54 to -16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence). Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI -4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, moderate certainty evidence). None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence). Persistent diarrhoeaIn children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well-nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

### Oral health status and salivary properties in relation to gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease [^116VF5dY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with celiac disease (CD) have a wide variety of symptoms, from being asymptomatic to having chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and extraintestinal symptoms. In the oral cavity, enamel defects and recurrent aphthous stomatitis are the most common symptoms. The aim of the study was to assess oral health, bacterial colonization and salivary buffering capacity of patients with CD at diagnosis were compared with patients with CD receiving a gluten-free diet (GFD) and healthy children.

Methods

Three groups were prospectively investigated: newly diagnosed CD, CD treated with GFD, and a control group. All of the children were examined by pediatric dentists, and saliva samples were collected for bacterial and pH analysis.

Results

Ninety children were enrolled in the study, 30 in each group. A higher prevalence of enamel hypoplasia (66%) was found in children with CD. Plaque index was significantly lower in the celiac-treated group, which correlated with oral health behavior: teeth brushing and frequency of eating between meals. Children receiving GFD brushed their teeth and used fluoride significantly more often than other children in the study. No difference between groups was found in snack consumption, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli counts in saliva, as well as pH and buffer capacity.

Conclusions

A lower degree of plaque was found in children with CD receiving GFD. This finding could not be explained by salivary properties or bacteria, but rather by better oral hygiene. The results should raise the awareness of pediatric gastroenterologists toward oral health-related issues in children with CD.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^116Mp9FR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Types of participants

Children between one month and five years of age with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

We excluded trials of infants below one month of age and studies that exclusively enrolled children with particular conditions, such preterm or low birthweight infants and children with HIV.

Acute diarrhoea is usually defined as three or more loose stools in a 24‐hour period. Persistent diarrhoea is defined as diarrhoea lasting more than 14 days. Dysentery is a diarrhoeal illness in which blood is observed in the stool. The final day of diarrhoea is usually defined as the last day meeting the above definition followed by 48 hours without diarrhoea.

Types of interventions

Intervention

Oral zinc supplementation of any zinc salt at doses of 5 mg/day or more for any duration.

Control

Placebo.

Concurrent supplementation of other minerals and vitamins are eligible only if administered to both the intervention and control groups.

We excluded ORS plus zinc and food fortification interventions (such as milk fortification) as the amount of ORS/food consumed, and hence the zinc intake, would be less certain.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Measures of diarrhoea duration

Diarrhoea duration.
Diarrhoea at 3, 5, and 7 days after starting the intervention.

Measures of diarrhoea severity

Stool frequency.
Stool output.

Secondary outcomes

Hospitalization (number of children hospitalized).
Death (from any cause and diarrhoea specific).

Adverse events

Serious adverse events (life‐threatening or requiring hospitalization).
Any adverse event that results in the discontinuation of treatment.
Other adverse events, such as vomiting and reduced copper levels.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF PEDIATRIC DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

As seen by clinical health providers at fixed healthcare facilities in developing countries, almost all cases of pediatric diarrheal illness can be conveniently characterized as falling into 1 of 5 clinical syndromes (Table 1). Approximately 80%–85% of patient episodes present as "simple gastroenteritis" with the subject passing loose or watery stool (often with mucus but not with blood), low-grade fever, occasional vomiting, anorexia, and apparent malaise (Figure 1). Approximately 5%–15% of children present with overt dysentery (gross blood in the diarrheic stools) (Figure 2), often accompanied by fever (sometimes high); many dysenteric patients appear clinically toxic. A small proportion of cases in older children present with profuse watery diarrhea, passing such voluminous "rice water" stools that even older children can rapidly become severely dehydrated (Figure 3). Another few percent of pediatric cases present with a history of apparent simple gastroenteritis that began 14 or more days previously but did not abate; this defines "persistent diarrhea", a syndrome that particularly can have adverse nutritional consequences. Finally, a few percent of children are brought by caretakers for care because of vomiting rather than diarrhea as the main complaint. Few reports have described expanded etiologic analyses in relation to these clinical syndromes.

Table 1.
The 5 Main Clinical Syndromes of Diarrheal Disease Seen Among Infants and Young Children Presenting to Health Centers and Hospitals in Developing Countries

Figure 1.
An infant who presented with diarrheal dehydration consequent to simple gastroenteritis that was not treated promptly or effectively. Loss of turgor of skin over the abdomen is visible as "tenting", following pinching. Simple gastroenteritis caused by many etiologic agents in young infants in developing countries can lead to dehydration. The fundamental reason is that per kilogram of body weight, the daily water and electrolyte requirements of young infants are substantially greater than those of older children. Thus, abnormal losses from diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, accompanied by inadequate fluid intake and lack of prompt and appropriate replacement (as with glucose/electrolyte oral rehydration solution), can lead to moderate and severe dehydration and death.

### Screening for celiac disease: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^116Kk9os]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Celiac disease pathophysiology and clinical spectrum — symptomatic, silent, and potential forms: Celiac disease is caused by an immune response to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible persons, with ingestion leading to immune-mediated inflammatory damage to the small intestine mucosa and malabsorption of nutrients. Classic celiac disease is associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, and it is also associated with nongastrointestinal, nonspecific manifestations such as anemia, osteoporosis, chronic fatigue, peripheral neuropathy or ataxia, aphthous stomatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, infertility, recurrent fetal loss, or short stature; children may experience pubertal delay and dental enamel defects. Patients with silent, or asymptomatic, celiac disease are diagnosed by serologic testing and intestinal biopsy but lack typical signs or symptoms, whereas patients with potential celiac disease have positive serology and mild or no intestinal damage on biopsy and may or may not have symptoms; the natural history of silent and potential celiac disease is not well understood and it is not clear if they represent progressive stages or distinct diseases.

### Rotavirus infection in adults [^1111fp8e]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Rotavirus has been recognised for 30 years as the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis in infants and young children. By contrast, the role of rotavirus as a pathogen in adults has long been underappreciated. Spread by faecal-oral transmission, rotavirus infection in adults typically manifests with nausea, malaise, headache, abdominal cramping, diarrhoea, and fever. Infection can also be symptomless. Rotavirus infection in immunocompromised adults can have a variable course from symptomless to severe and sustained infection. Common epidemiological settings for rotavirus infection among adults include endemic disease, epidemic outbreak, travel-related infection, and disease resulting from child-to-adult transmission. Limited diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives are available for adults with suspected rotavirus infection. Because symptoms are generally self-limiting, supportive care is the rule. Clinicians caring for adults with gastroenteritis should consider rotavirus in the differential diagnosis. In this review we intend to familiarise clinicians who primarily provide care for adult patients with the salient features of rotavirus pathophysiology, clinical presentation, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention.

### Prospective longitudinal study of signs and symptoms associated with primary Tooth eruption [^113bAknd]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association between primary tooth eruption and the manifestation of signs and symptoms of teething in infants.

Methods

An 8-month, longitudinal study was conducted with 47 noninstitutionalized infants (ie, receiving care at home) between 5 and 15 months of age in the city of Diamantina, Brazil. The nonrandomized convenience sample was based on the registry of infants in this age range provided by the Diamantina Secretary of Health. Eligible participants were infants with up to 7 erupted incisors and no history of chronic disease or disorders that could cause an increase in the signs and symptoms assessed in the study. Tympanic and axillary temperature readings and clinical oral examinations were performed daily. A daily interview with the mothers was conducted to investigate the occurrence of 13 signs and symptoms associated with teething presented by the infants in the previous 24 hours.

Results

Teething was associated with a rise in tympanic temperature on the day of the eruption (P = 0.004) and with the occurrence of other signs and symptoms. Readings of maximal tympanic and axillary temperatures were 36.8°C and 36.6°C, respectively. The most frequent signs and symptoms associated with teething were irritability (median: 0.60; P < .001), increased salivation (median: 0.50; P < .001), runny nose (median: 0.50; P < .001), and loss of appetite (median: 0.50; P < .001).

Conclusions

Irritability, increased salivation, runny nose, loss of appetite, diarrhea, rash, and sleep disturbance were associated with primary tooth eruption. Results of this study support the concept that the occurrence of severe signs and symptoms, such as fever, could not be attributed to teething.

### Human and animal fecal contamination of community water sources, stored drinking water and hands in rural India measured with validated microbial source tracking assays [^112ycYvf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

In each village, improved and unimproved community water sources (as defined by the World Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation) were sampled, and hand rinses (HRs) and SDW in homes with a child under age five were collected. Samples were analyzed to evaluate levels and sources of fecal contamination in each tested public and domestic domain exposure pathway. Sampling occurred during the monsoon season, a period when diarrhea rates typically rise in the region, between June 19 and July 26, 2012. Prevalence and seasonal trends of reported diarrhea in the study area can be found elsewhere.

Study communities.

The study comprised 24 villages in Puri District forming a subsample of 100 villages of similar size and socioeconomic characteristics enrolled in a cluster randomized controlled trial of the health impacts of rural sanitation in India. All trial villages had access to improved drinking water supplies consisting predominantly of public and private tube wells (86% of households) but < 10% sanitation coverage (all improved) before the 2011 latrine intervention (detailed in Clasen and others). Public tube wells mostly drew groundwater from deeper depths than the shallow tube wells installed privately by homeowners. Despite access to improved water sources, the majority of trial households used open ponds daily for nondrinking purposes, such as anal cleansing after defecation, bathing, brushing teeth, laundry, and cleaning utensils. Trial households belonged predominantly to lower castes (57%), qualified as poor (62%), were Hindu (100%) and owned livestock (59%), comprising cattle, sheep, goat, and buffalo, in order of most common species owned. Details of trial villages have been published previously.

Data Collection at Enrollment From Cases and Controls

Case enrollment interviews took place at the SHC whereas control caretakers were interviewed at home. To facilitate linkage of our results with existing databases, we designed our caretaker interviews to include questions found in the primary sources of population-based data used to estimate child mortality in developing countries, such as the UNICEF-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and the US Agency for International Development–supported Demographic and Heath Surveys. Demographic information collected about the case or control and his/her household (defined as a group of people who share a cooking fire) included maternal education and household size (including the number of children < 5 years old). Building materials and household possessions were documented (to assess potential risk factors for illness and as indicators for constructing a wealth index for each site). Questions addressed handwashing practices and access and availability of improved water and sanitation facilities, animals on the premises, water treatment, sharing sanitation facilities, and disposal of the child's feces. The caretakers were queried about the child's clinical signs and symptoms; how the illness was managed prior to the SHC visit (the reference point was the current illness for cases and the most recent diarrheal illness for controls), for example, use of oral rehydration solutions, zinc, antibiotics, traditional medicines, continued feeding and fluid administration; healthcare seeking behavior; and breastfeeding practices. The household's direct (out-of-pocket) and indirect (eg, income lost while caring for the sick child) expenditures at home and at the SHC were tabulated. The GEMS staff measured the child's axillary digital temperature, respiratory rate (the average of 2 measures obtained using a rate counter), anthropometric dimensions (described below), and clinical signs of malnutrition (bipedal edema, wasting, flaky skin, and sparse or loose hair).

### Doxycycline hyclate (Doryx) [^113z2i7Q]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT (LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY, INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH (YELLOW-GRAY-BROWN). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN THIS AGE GROUP, EXCEPT FOR ANTHRAX, INCLUDING INHALATION ANTHRAX (POST-EXPOSURE), UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including DORYX Capsules, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

### Cholera vaccine: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, 2022 [^1142vPEM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Information on Cholera

Cholera is a toxin-mediated bacterial gastrointestinal illness caused by toxigenic V. cholerae serogroup O1 or, uncommonly, O139. V. cholerae O1 has an aquatic reservoir, and human infection occurs via ingestion of contaminated water or food. Direct fecal-oral transmission can occur, but secondary cases from person-to-person transmission are rare if sanitation is adequate. The incubation period usually ranges from hours to a few days.

Infection with toxigenic V. cholerae O1 can cause a range of symptoms. Up to 10% of infections manifest as cholera gravis, profuse watery diarrhea that can cause severe dehydration and death within hours without treatment. The case-fatality rate ranges from as high as 50% without treatment to < 1% with appropriate fluid replacement therapy. Fluid replacement should be based on the degree of volume depletion and ongoing fluid losses. Oral rehydration solution can be used for milder cases, whereas intravenous fluids are needed for severe dehydration or hypovolemic shock. Antibiotics, which have been shown to shorten the duration of illness and fluid requirements, are an adjunct for severely ill patients.

A definitive diagnosis of cholera is based on culture of stool or rectal swab specimens. Special transport and culture media not routinely used for stool cultures are needed to isolate V. cholerae. Other stool-based diagnostic tests include antigen tests, darkfield microscopy, and molecular assays. Although certain multiplex gastrointestinal panels used in clinical settings have a target for V. cholerae, these tests are insufficient for diagnosis without serogroup information and confirmation of toxin production.

Recommended measures to prevent cholera infection in cholera-endemic areas include using safe water (i.e. for drinking, brushing teeth, washing and preparing food, and making ice) and eating safe food (i.e. those that are packaged or fully cooked and served hot). Other important prevention measures include washing hands often with soap and safe water and using sanitary methods to dispose of stool.

Global Epidemiology

Cholera is endemic in approximately 50 countries and can cause large epidemics. Cholera epidemics are associated with unsafe water and inadequate sanitation. An estimated 1.3–4.0 million cases of cholera and 21,000–143,000 deaths occur worldwide each year. CDC's Travelers' Health Branch monitors areas with active cholera transmission and updates the list of affected countries monthly.

### Risk factors for sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infections in children, Argentina [^115eoRg1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Risk Factors by Site and Etiology

We performed a univariate adjusted analysis for all variables by site (Tables 1, 2). For every variable that was significantly risky or protective in the combined analysis, the OR went in the same direction in the site-specific analysis (Buenos Aires 81 cases, Mendoza 69 cases), although the association was not always statistically significant. Many dietary habits, most of which were beef associated, were significantly associated with illness in Buenos Aires, whereas fewer reached statistical significance in Mendoza. Consuming jugo de carne was significantly associated with illness in both sites; however, 19.1% of case-patients from Mendoza consumed this item compared with only 4.9% from Buenos Aires.

Risk and protective factors were also analyzed separately for patients with culture-confirmed O157 or non-O157 STEC infection (Table 3). These 2 groups were similar in age, sex, and site distribution. The risk and protective factors among these 2 groups were similar to those of all study participants. Among patients with O157 STEC infection, illness was significantly associated with eating at a social gathering, with many meat-related dietary habits, exposures related to farm animals and their environment, wearing diapers, and having a nonparental household income. Protective factors included several related to eating beef at home and buying beef less than once a week. Among the smaller group of patients with non-O157 STEC infection, the only risk factors significantly linked to illness were drinking from a bottle left at room temperature, drinking formula (a factor not identified in the full group), eating a piece of beef outside the home, teething on undercooked beef at home, contact with a child < 5 years of age with diarrhea, wearing diapers, and living in an overcrowded condition. Eating meat pie at home was protective for this group.

### Atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli: typical pathogens? [^116Yozyo]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is both the most abundant facultative commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and the most common bacterial cause of human diarrhea. However, precise recognition of E. coli pathotypes remains problematic. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), classically associated with outbreaks of infant diarrhea, harbors distinctive chromosomal (the locus of enterocyte effacement, or LEE island) and plasmidborne (residing on the EPEC adherence factor, or EAF, plasmid) virulence factors, which are linked by common gene regulators. At the Second International Conference on EPEC, held in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1995, the foremost authorities in the field proclaimed the global importance of such "typical" EPEC (tEPEC) but pondered the clinical relevance of strains carrying only the LEE island (dubbed at that conference "atypical EPEC", or aEPEC). Had aEPEC lost the EAF plasmid? Had it incidentally acquired only fragments or incomplete packages of virulence-associated genes? Or were some aEPEC true pathogens of humans or animals?

In this issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Nguyen et al. propose a distinct role for aEPEC in human infection. Previously, these investigators reported a high prevalence of aEPEC among pediatric diarrhea patients in Melbourne, including both infants and older children (in contrast to the strong tendency for infants to be infected with tEPEC). Now these authors show that, in contrast to patients infected with other pathogens, patients infected with aEPEC are far more likely to experience diarrhea past 14 days, the point long recognized as a clinical watershed that heralds increased risk for illness and death. aEPEC's prevalence among diarrhea patients, the pathogen's strong association with diarrheal symptoms, and the infection's distinctively persistent nature argue for a high disease burden in Melbourne. Although the authors define aEPEC strictly on the basis of positivity for the LEE eae gene and failure to amplify a bfpA pilin gene (not assessing additional plasmid loci), the absence of tEPEC serotypes and the occurrence of disease in children older than infants suggest that these are indeed aEPEC.

### Doxycycline hyclate (Targadox) [^111vLG2w]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects of the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines:

Gastrointestinal: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS .) Rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .)

### Human monkeypox outbreak caused by novel virus belonging to Congo basin clade, Sudan, 2005 [^1115CUmm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

In Sudan, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, extracting incisors (and sometimes canine milk teeth) occurs just after eruption of permanent dentition. This practice is associated with achieving adulthood, beauty, and tribal identity and is necessary for emitting specific linguistic sounds and consuming softer food textures. In addition, it is a common belief that canine milk teeth adversely affect the health of infants, causing diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. These teeth are often removed by a traditional healer when symptoms develop in the child. Because these practices are avenues for disease transmission, an educational campaign aimed at reducing the prevalence of this practice should be implemented. Culturally sensitive education could help implement change for safer practices and discourage this harmful ritual practice.

The low CFR observed during this outbreak could not be attributed to treatment, as most case-patients were admitted to the MSF-F hospital very late in the course of disease. Virulence differences between MPXV isolates from West Africa and the Congo Basin have been shown to be caused by genetic differences. The low CFR observed in Sudan could be linked to the MPXV circulating in Unity State and its genetic difference with West Africa and Congo Basin isolates. In this regard, our preliminary results showed that the MPXV strain isolated during this outbreak is a novel virus. Alternatively, the low CFR could be related to the transmission of the virus or dose of the virus exposure, and the relatively older ages of affected persons.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^1137fNSA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Diarrhoea causes around two million child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation could help reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea, and is recommended by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search Strategy

In November 2007, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, mRCT, and reference lists. We also contacted researchers.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing oral zinc supplementation (≥ 5 mg/day for any duration) with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors assessed trial eligibility and methodological quality, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. Diarrhoea duration and severity were the primary outcomes. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses (using the fixed- or random-effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.

Main Results

Eighteen trials enrolling 6165 participants met our inclusion criteria. In acute diarrhoea, zinc resulted in a shorter diarrhoea duration (MD -12.27 h, 95% CI -23.02 to -1.52 h; 2741 children, 9 trials), and less diarrhoea at day three (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81; 1073 children, 2 trials), day five (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95; 346 children, 2 trials), and day seven (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98; 4087 children, 7 trials). The four trials (1458 children) that reported on diarrhoea severity used different units and time points, and the effect of zinc was less clear. Subgroup analyses by age (trials with only children aged less than six months) showed no benefit with zinc. Subgroup analyses by nutritional status, geographical region, background zinc deficiency, zinc type, and study setting did not affect the results' significance. Zinc also reduced the duration of persistent diarrhoea (MD -15.84 h, 95% CI -25.43 to -6.24 h; 529 children, 5 trials). Few trials reported on severity, and results were inconsistent. No trial reported serious adverse events, but vomiting was more common in zinc-treated children with acute diarrhoea (RR 1.71, 95% 1.27 to 2.30; 4727 children, 8 trials).

Authors' Conclusions

In areas where diarrhoea is an important cause of child mortality, research evidence shows zinc is clearly of benefit in children aged six months or more.

### Recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of methemoglobinemia [^1177QAV9]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical management of methemoglobinemia in neonatal/childhood period

Management of methemoglobinemia in infancy and childhood is based on several factors including whether the patient is symptomatic, the total amount of methemoglobin, the cause of the methemoglobinemia, and the patient's age. Of note, the cyanosis is determined not by percentage of methemoglobin but the total amount of methemoglobin. MetHb levels > 70% are considered potentially lethal. In acquired methemoglobinemia, treatment is indicated at levels of 20% in symptomatic patients and 30% in asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic or those with additional factors compromising oxygen delivery such as congenital heart disease, lung disease, significant anemia, or carbon monoxide poisoning should be treated at levels between 10% and 30%. In hereditary methemoglobinemia, higher levels of MetHb are better tolerated, with some patients asymptomatic even up to levels of 30%‐40%.

Infants are at greater risk of developing methemoglobinemia, attributed to lower levels of erythrocyte CYB5R activity estimated to be around 50%‐60% of adult values. In addition, infants have higher levels of HbF which is more readily oxidized to MetHb than adult hemoglobin.

In critically ill hospitalized infants, inhaled nitric oxide therapy for pulmonary hypertension may lead to methemoglobinemia, necessitating regular monitoring. Methemoglobinemia may occur in the first few months of life in infants with marked metabolic acidosis, typically associated with sepsis or diarrhea and dehydration. It is speculated that infants' higher intestinal pH promotes growth of Gram‐negative organisms such as Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni that convert dietary nitrates to nitrites, which in turn induce methemoglobinemia. Infants who ingest well water contaminated with nitrates are also susceptible to methemoglobinemia. So too are infants and young children exposed to local anesthetics such as lidocaine for circumcision, or to benzocaine, an analogue of aniline, in teething gels.

### Oral zinc for treating diarrhoea in children [^115vYhcz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

In developing countries, diarrhoea causes around 500,000 child deaths annually. Zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

Objectives

To evaluate oral zinc supplementation for treating children with acute or persistent diarrhoea.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, m RCT, and reference lists up to 30 September 2016. We also contacted researchers.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared oral zinc supplementation with placebo in children aged one month to five years with acute or persistent diarrhoea, including dysentery.

Data collection and analysis

Both review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The primary outcomes were diarrhoea duration and severity. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses (using either a fixed‐effect or random‐effects model) and assessed heterogeneity.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

Thirty‐three trials that included 10,841 children met our inclusion criteria. Most included trials were conducted in Asian countries that were at high risk of zinc deficiency.

Acute diarrhoea

There is currently not enough evidence from well‐conducted RCTs to be able to say whether zinc supplementation during acute diarrhoea reduces death or number of children hospitalized (very low certainty evidence).

In children older than six months of age, zinc supplementation may shorten the average duration of diarrhoea by around half a day (MD −11.46 hours, 95% CI −19.72 to −3.19; 2581 children, 9 trials, low certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number of children whose diarrhoea persists until day seven (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 3865 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence). In children with signs of malnutrition the effect appears greater, reducing the duration of diarrhoea by around a day (MD −26.39 hours, 95% CI −36.54 to −16.23; 419 children, 5 trials, high certainty evidence).

Conversely, in children younger than six months of age, the available evidence suggests zinc supplementation may have no effect on the mean duration of diarrhoea (MD 5.23 hours, 95% CI −4.00 to 14.45; 1334 children, 2 trials, low certainty evidence), or the number of children who still have diarrhoea on day seven (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54; 1074 children, 1 trial, low certainty evidence).

None of the included trials reported serious adverse events. However, zinc supplementation increased the risk of vomiting in both age groups (children greater than six months of age: RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.86; 2605 children, 6 trials, moderate certainty evidence; children less than six months of age: RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.24; 1334 children, 2 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Persistent diarrhoea

In children with persistent diarrhoea, zinc supplementation probably shortens the average duration of diarrhoea by around 16 hours (MD −15.84 hours, 95% CI −25.43 to −6.24; 529 children, 5 trials, moderate certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

In areas where the prevalence of zinc deficiency or the prevalence of malnutrition is high, zinc may be of benefit in children aged six months or more. The current evidence does not support the use of zinc supplementation in children less six months of age, in well‐nourished children, and in settings where children are at low risk of zinc deficiency.

### Vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and gastroenteritis [^111SjUVz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Diseases that cause vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and gastroenteritis are major problems for populations worldwide. Patients, particularly infants, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, may present at any point in a wide spectrum of disease states, underscoring the need for the clinician to treat these ailments aggressively. Several promising new treatment modalities, from oral rehydration solutions to antiemetic therapies, have been introduced over the past decade. Future directions include the use of probiotic agents and better tolerated rehydration solutions. Gastrointestinal disease will continue to be a focus worldwide in the search for better ways to cure illnesses associated with vomiting and diarrhea.

### Advances in human norovirus research: vaccines, genotype distribution and antiviral strategies [^111SuvqM]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

3 Clinical observation

The most prevalent symptoms associated with norovirus infection include emesis and diarrhea, occasionally accompanied by nausea, abdominal discomfort, cramping, anorexia, malaise, and low-grade pyrexia. Common complications may encompass benign seizures, febrile seizures, convulsions, necrotizing enterocolitis as well as exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. Detection of respiratory secretions from children presenting with respiratory symptoms revealed that norovirus may also be implicated in respiratory diseases. Additionally, there have been reported cases where mild meningoencephalitis can be attributed to norovirus infection based on clinical manifestations.

The main symptoms associated with norovirus infection exhibited variability among individuals, with a higher prevalence observed in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Studies have indicated that young children exhibit more severe symptoms, with the establishment of protective immunity to prevent re-infection typically occurring before the age of 2 years. The primary manifestations of diarrhea in infants under 1 year old include watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, convulsions, and potentially fatal outcomes in severe cases.

In addition, the patients with norovirus gastroenteritis accompanied by convulsions also experience transient vomiting (lasting for approximately 2 days) in the absence of fever. For patients with immunocompetent norovirus gastroenteritis, the incubation period of infection is typically short, usually ranging from 24 to 48 h. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which generally resolve within a span of 72 h.

Furthermore, the various strains of the virus would exhibit distinct clinical manifestations. According to previous studies, the GII genotype is globally prevalent in human norovirus infections, while the GI genotype is only observed in a limited number of cases. Considering seasonal variations, the prevalence of GI genotypes is primarily observed during spring, whereas GII genotypes are predominant during autumn. Compared to other genotypes, norovirus GII infection is associated with a higher incidence of severe diarrhea and vomiting. Additionally, a greater proportion of patients infected with genotype GI experienced symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea lasting less than 3 days, and increased bowel sounds.

The comprehension of dominant strains and their correlation with clinical manifestations will facilitate the enhancement of clinical diagnosis accuracy and the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies.

### Environmental enteric dysfunction in children [^114kkwxE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of childhood death in resource-poor countries, killing approximately 760,000 children younger than 5 years each year. Although deaths due to diarrhea have declined dramatically, high rates of stunting and malnutrition have persisted. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a subclinical condition caused by constant fecal-oral contamination with resultant intestinal inflammation and villous blunting. These histological changes were first described in the 1960s, but the clinical effect of EED is only just being recognized in the context of failure of nutritional interventions and oral vaccines in resource-poor countries. We review the existing literature regarding the underlying causes of and potential interventions for EED in children, highlighting the epidemiology, clinical and histologic classification of the entity, and discussing novel biomarkers and possible therapies. Future research priorities are also discussed.

### Long-term effects of a randomized maternal education trial in rural Uganda: implications for child oral health [^1168CqpP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a clear association between caries and the consumption of sugar. However, we found no significant difference between the two study groups regarding dietary intakes. More than half of the children in both groups reported high intake of food and drinks containing sugar. Lifestyle changes like diet improvement is challenging, especially in poor populations with limited access to information on diet and its effect on health.

The registration of signs of removed ebiino ("false teeth") was based on the photographs that by chance included the primary canine region and the results cannot be interpreted as prevalence of removed ebiino, but we registered possible signs of removed tooth buds in 13.7% of the children. The most common sign was missing primary canines in the lower jaw. However, at follow-up, when the children were 36 months old, a significantly reduced occurrence of removed tooth buds was reported in the intervention group compared with the control group (8.9% versus 24.7%). Few studies have reported on the prevalence of removal of primary tooth buds in rural Uganda. Nuwaha et.al found that 58.6% households in the Bushenyi district, Uganda reported that at least one child younger than 5-year-old had suffered from this practice. In 2016, Musinguzi et al. found that the prevalence of missing teeth due to removal of ebiino was 8.1% in rural Uganda. The practice is often performed when the child is 5–7 months old. At this age, the gum swelling is most evident and infants are most likely to suffer from common childhood illness (fever, diarrhea, and vomiting). Therefore, infant illnesses can easily be attributed to teething. We found no significant difference between the two study groups regarding signs of removed ebiino. This is probably because oral health information was not included in this study before the children were 12–16 months; consequently, many children had already been subjected to the procedure.

### Animals in healthcare facilities: recommendations to minimize potential risks [^114FMep2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Guidance — exclusion criteria and accommodations for service animals list situations in which a service animal may be excluded from the healthcare facility, including when the animal exhibits aggressive behavior such as snarling, biting, scratching, or teeth baring, is excessively noisy, or is unable to properly contain bodily excretions such as not being housebroken or having vomiting or diarrhea. If facility personnel reasonably believe a service animal is infectious or ill, the animal should not be allowed to remain with the person with a disability until evaluated by a veterinarian with written certification acceptable to the facility that it does not pose an increased risk to patients or staff, and the policy should include locations from which service animals are prohibited and reasons for exclusion. Where exclusion is based solely on risk to the service animal, the patient should be consulted, and when the service animal is restricted from accompanying the patient, reasonable accommodation should be made for the person with disability to function without the service animal.

### Minocycline hydrochloride (minolira extended release) [^112ZiWmf]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid during treatment with MINOLIRA?

Avoid sunlight or artificial sunlight, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. You could get severe sunburn. Use sunscreen and wear loose-fitting clothes that cover your skin while out in sunlight. Stop taking MINOLIRA if you get sunburn.
You should not drive or operate dangerous machinery until you know how MINOLIRA affects you. MINOLIRA may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded, or have a spinning feeling (vertigo).

What are possible side effects of MINOLIRA?

MINOLIRA may cause serious side effects, including:

Harm to an unborn baby. See "What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking MINOLIRA?"
Permanent teeth discoloration. MINOLIRA may permanently turn a baby or child's teeth yellow-gray-brown during tooth development. You should not use MINOLIRA during tooth development. Tooth development happens in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and from birth to 8 years of age.
Slow bone growth. MINOLIRA may slow bone growth in infants and children. Slow bone growth is reversible after stopping treatment with MINOLIRA.
Diarrhea. Diarrhea can happen with most antibiotics, including MINOLIRA. This diarrhea may be caused by an infection (Clostridium difficile) in your intestines. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get watery or bloody stools.
Liver problems. MINOLIRA can cause liver problems that may lead to death. Stop taking MINOLIRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems:
loss of appetite
tiredness
diarrhea
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes
bleeding more easily than normal
confusion
sleepiness
Increased pressure around the brain (intracranial hypertension). This condition may lead to vision changes and permanent vision loss. You may be more likely to get intracranial hypertension if you are a female of childbearing potential and are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension. Stop taking MINOLIRA and tell your healthcare provider right away if you have blurred vision, double vision, vision loss, or headaches.
Immune system reactions including a lupus-like syndrome, hepatitis, and inflammation of blood or lymph vessels (vasculitis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get a fever, rash, joint pain, or body weakness.
Serious skin or allergic reactions that may affect parts of your body such as your liver, lungs, kidneys and heart. Sometimes these can lead to death. Stop taking MINOLIRA and go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms:
skin rash, hives, sores in your mouth, or your skin blisters and peels
swelling of your face, eyes, lips, tongue, or throat
trouble swallowing or breathing
blood in your urine
fever, yellowing of the skin or the whites of your eyes, dark colored urine
pain on the right side of the stomach area (abdominal pain)
chest pain or abnormal heartbeats
swelling in your legs, ankles, and feet
darkening of your nails, skin, eyes, scars, teeth, and gums
Discoloration (hyperpigmentation). MINOLIRA can cause darkening of your skin, scars, teeth, gums, nails, and whites of your eyes.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^116HqR1n]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The intestinal form of CD is more commonly detected in the pediatric population and children younger than 3 years and is characterized by diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal distention, and failure to thrive. Older children and adults may complain of diarrhea, bloating, constipation, abdominal pain, or weight loss. Nonetheless, in adults, the malabsorption syndrome with chronic diarrhea, weight loss and significant asthenia is quite rare. Despite its uncommon detection, this phenotype can cause hospitalization due to cachexia, sarcopenia, significant hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. Conversely, an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like presentation with constipation or alternating bowel and/or dyspepsia-like symptoms, such as nausea and sometimes vomiting, is more frequent.

Extraintestinal symptoms are common in both children and adults. They include iron deficiency microcytic anemia, detectable in up to 40% of cases (by cause of iron malabsorption or chronic inflammation) or, more rarely, macrocytic anemia due to folic acid and/or vitamin B12 deficiency (more frequent in Europe than in the US). Changes in bone mineral density, including osteopenia or osteoporosis (affecting about 70% of patients at diagnosis), are related to altered absorption of calcium and vitamin D3. In children, growth retardation and short stature can raise the suspect of an underlying CD. Other signs include tooth enamel defects, aphthous stomatitis (identified in about 20% of undiagnosed CD patients), and hypertransaminasemia (40–50% of untreated patients), which can be ascribed to food and bacterial antigen translocation reaching the liver due to increased intestinal permeability. A wide array of neurological symptoms, such as headache, paresthesia, neuroinflammation, anxiety and depression, can be detectable in CD patients. The clinical presentation may also include changes in reproductive function characterized by late menarche, amenorrhea, recurrent miscarriages, premature birth, early menopause, and changes in the number and mobility of spermatozoa. Notably, these manifestations can be reversed when patients start a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), although fatigue and some neurological manifestation as well as functional gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can persist for a long period in a subgroup of CD patients.

### Celiac disease: a review [^116RPQqk]. JAMA Pediatrics (2014). Medium credibility.

Triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals, celiac disease is the most common genetically based food intolerance in the world, with a prevalence among approximately 1% of the general population. This enteropathy may appear at any age and is characterized by a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms that go well beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In young children, gastrointestinal presentations are common and include chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention; however, extraintestinal manifestations are becoming increasingly more common. They include numerous conditions such as dermatitis herpetiformis, anemia, dental enamel hypoplasia, recurrent oral aphthae, short stature, osteoporosis, arthritis, neurologic problems, unexplained elevation of transaminase levels, and female infertility. Therefore, diagnosing celiac disease requires a high degree of suspicion, followed by correct screening and a confirmatory test with an intestinal biopsy. After diagnosis, a strict gluten-free diet must be followed, which in most cases will bring a marked improvement of symptoms. However, there are important compliance and quality-of-life problems, especially in adolescents.

### Salivary detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and implications for oral health-care providers [^1116b49k]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, in late December, 2019. Since then, the disease has rapidly spread around the globe. The causative agent of the disease was identified to be a novel coronavirus of bat origin, later termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the COVID‐19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of May 19, 2020, there have been over 4 731 458 laboratory confirmed cases and 316 169 deaths reported globally. In the United States alone, more than 1 477 516 COVID‐19 cases and 89 272 deaths have been reported, and the numbers continue to rise.

Many patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 are asymptomatic; however, the most common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, dyspnea, and myalgia. Some patients may also experience headache, dizziness, loss of taste and/or smell, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Chest computed tomography (CT) findings of patients with COVID‐19 show multifocal bilateral ground‐glass opacities and areas of consolidation. Severe‐onset disease may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death.SARS‐CoV‐2 is thought to spread primarily through respiratory droplets and from close person‐to‐person contact with an infected individual. The virus has also been shown to survive on surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 hours. Currently, the recommended mode of diagnostic specimen collection is from the upper respiratory tract using nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. However, this requires close contact between the health‐care worker and individual, and may induce sneezing and coughing which can lead to aerosol generation, and cause transmission of the virus. This method of sample collection may also cause discomfort and bleeding in some people. In addition, there is an acute shortage of swabs and protective gear, and an overburdening of the testing centers. Thus, there is a need to explore other evidence‐based modalities of specimen collection for mass testing and monitoring of COVID‐19.

### Global reports of intussusception in infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114J24T8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in infants, presenting as refractory abdominal pain or mass, vomiting, lethargy, and currant jelly stool. Coronavirus disease 2019 is not well characterized in children, especially infants, but symptoms in children have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. From January to July 2020, intussusception was reported in 5 infants 4–10 months of age who had laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. All 5 infants presented with currant jelly stool and at least 1 other abdominal symptom, and none presented with respiratory symptoms. Four infants recovered but the fifth infant progressed to a critical illness and death. While an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and intussusception has not been established, infants with symptoms consistent with intussusception may warrant testing for viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, especially if presenting to healthcare with a history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure or with signs and symptoms of COVID-19. More investigation is needed to determine whether intussusception is part of the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 in infants or a coincidental finding among infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

WARNINGS

Tooth Development

The use of drugs of the tetracycline-class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. Tetracycline drugs should not be used in this age group, except for anthrax, unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated.

Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including tetracyclines, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

Supportive treatment — rehydration therapy indicates oral rehydration solution (ORS) as first-line and allows nasogastric administration in select cases: reduced ORS is recommended as the first-line therapy of mild to moderate dehydration in infants, children, and adults with acute diarrhea from any cause (strong, moderate), and in people with mild to moderate dehydration associated with vomiting or severe diarrhea. Nasogastric administration of ORS may be considered in infants, children and adults with moderate dehydration who cannot tolerate oral intake, or in children with normal mental status who are too weak or refuse to drink adequately (weak, low).

### "Flux in the belly: " A history of infantile gastroenteritis [^117TjdgD]. Neonatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although a major cause of infant mortality for centuries, little research was done on the causes of infants' diarrhea. Artificial feeding, teething, and summer heat were believed to cause the severe disease that spared breastfed infants.

Summary

Since antiquity, infants' digestive disorders were termed dyspepsia, flux of the belly, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, watery gripes, the runs, dysentery, or cholera, without definitions. Alois Bednar discerned 3 grades (dyspepsia, diarrhea, and cholera) of the same disease. Infants' neurologic symptoms were interpreted as alimentary toxicosis. Chronic diarrhea caused emaciation and dehydration. In 1950, Laurence Finberg found diarrhea with hypernatremia causing cerebral damage. Seasonal influence was known since Hippocrates. Baudelocque recommended obtaining infant milk fresh from the cow because it decomposes in the summer heat. In the cities, summer diarrhea caused a third of total infant mortality. Physicians debated whether heat acted directly on the infant or spoiled the food. The discovery of microorganisms in the 1860s revolutionized medical understanding. However, influential researchers such as Adalbert Czerny classified nutritional disturbances by assumed pathogenesis ("ex alimentation, ex infection, ex constitution"), but denied the possibility of bacterial infection via milk. Heating baby food, practiced for centuries, was introduced in Denmark, Sweden, and France, whereas in Britain and Germany, professional and public debate on pasteurization persisted.

Key Messages

It took half a century to implement effective hygienic measures once the bacterial origin became known. Foodborne infection was rejected, and the prejudice that raw milk possesses essential "living" properties, adopted by influential scientists, contributed to delaying pasteurization.

### Tigecycline [^114H1RQs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Tooth Discoloration and Inhibition of Bone Growth

Advise pregnant women that tigecycline may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.4)].

Lactation

Advise a woman not to breastfeed for longer than 3 weeks while taking tigecycline because of the lack of data on effects due to prolonged breastfeeding, and the theoretical risk of dental discoloration and inhibition of bone growth. Women may also consider reducing infant exposure through pumping and discarding breastmilk during and for 9 days after the last dose of tigecycline [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

Diarrhea

Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including tigecycline. Sometimes, frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection. If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops, advise patients to contact his or her healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Development of Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tigecycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When tigecycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tigecycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### The global enteric multicenter study (GEMS) of diarrheal disease in infants and young children in developing countries: epidemiologic and clinical methods of the case / control study [^111Z41kw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

A clinician examined all cases to document signs of dehydration, including skin pinch return (graded as slow ≤ 2 seconds or very slow > 2 seconds), sunken eyes (more than usual confirmed by the parent/primary caretaker), dry mouth (graded as somewhat or very dry), and mental status changes, and examined the child's rectum for signs of prolapse. A member of the clinical team examined the child's stool (if available) for visible blood and recorded any rehydration fluids, zinc, and antibiotics prescribed or administered at the SHC. Cases who remained in the SHC while receiving rehydration fluids were reweighed at 4 hours and again at discharge from the SHC, as applicable, at which points the clinician reassessed the child for signs of dehydration and determined his/her vital status and weight.

### Update on prolonged and persistent diarrhea in children [^114xaokp]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight recent advances in our understanding of prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in children. The focus is on the contribution of these illnesses to the global burden of diarrhea, their impact on childhood growth and development, novel epidemiologic links between prolonged and persistent diarrheal episodes, and strategies for their prevention and management.

Recent Findings

Although less common than acute diarrhea, prolonged and persistent episodes of diarrhea in childhood constitute a significant portion of the global burden of diarrhea. These episodes also play a key role in the vicious cycle of childhood diarrhea and malnutrition in which undernutrition is both a risk factor and an outcome of diarrhea. Increased efforts to provide WHO-recommended zinc therapy for all children with diarrhea in developing countries will significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. In children who develop persistent diarrhea, yogurt-based or amino acid-based diets may accelerate their recovery.

Summary

In addition to increased implementation of strategies already known to effectively prevent and manage acute diarrhea, further research is needed to address the recognition, prevention, and treatment of prolonged episodes of acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in resource-limited settings.

### Pimecrolimus [^115uzpjW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Two Phase 3 trials were conducted involving 436 infants age 3 months-23 months. One 6-week randomized vehicle-controlled trial with a 20-week open-label phase and one safety trial, up to one year, were conducted. In the 6-week trial, 11% of Pimecrolimus and 48% of vehicle subjects did not complete this trial; no subject in either group discontinued due to adverse events. Infants on Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% had an increased incidence of some adverse events compared to vehicle. In the 6-week vehicle-controlled trial, these adverse events included pyrexia (32% vs. 13% vehicle), URI (24% vs. 14%), nasopharyngitis (15% vs. 8%), gastroenteritis (7% vs. 3%), otitis media (4% vs. 0%), and diarrhea (8% vs. 0%). In the open-label phase of the trial, for infants who switched to Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% from vehicle, the incidence of the above-cited adverse events approached or equaled the incidence of those subjects who remained on Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%. In the 6-month safety data, 16% of Pimecrolimus and 35% of vehicle subjects discontinued early and 1.5% of Pimecrolimus and 0% of vehicle subjects discontinued due to adverse events. Infants on Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% had a greater incidence of some adverse events as compared to vehicle. These included pyrexia (30% vs. 20%), URI (21% vs. 17%), cough (15% vs. 9%), hypersensitivity (8% vs. 2%), teething (27% vs. 22%), vomiting (9% vs. 4%), rhinitis (13% vs. 9%), viral rash (4% vs. 0%), rhinorrhea (4% vs. 0%), and wheezing (4% vs. 0%).

### Which symptoms are actually associated with teething?… [^117Jf4mx]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Parents and physicians have debated for years about whether there are symptoms associated with tooth eruption. Macknin and colleagues conducted a prospective study to determine if there are symptoms associated with tooth eruption and, if so, which ones could reliably predict such eruption in infants. Families were recruited at an infant's four-month-old well-child check if at least one parent worked at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Although about 500 families were eligible, parents were told that completion of the study would be difficult. Consequently, only 125 families enrolled. Each family was asked to check an aural temperature twice daily and complete a daily questionnaire about 18 symptoms. A teething period was defined as the period from four days before to three days after a tooth eruption. The study lasted eight months. Of the 125 families, results from only 111 were available for analysis.

At enrollment, the infants were between three and 5. 6 months of age. Data were available for a median of 212 days per child. Eighty-nine children experienced 475 tooth eruptions during the study period; in 22 children, no teeth erupted. No one symptom occurred in more than 35 percent of children who had a tooth eruption, although a number of symptoms were significantly associated with the eruptions. The symptoms that were significantly related to eruption were drooling, gum-rubbing, irritability, decreased appetite for solids and a temperature higher than mean plus one standard deviation. Tooth eruption was not associated with infection, diarrhea, cough or temperatures higher than 38. 9°C.

The authors conclude that tooth eruption in infants is not associated with severe symptoms and that severe symptoms should not be attributed to teething.

### Prevalence of harmful traditional practices among mothers of under five children in dire dawa administration, Eastern Ethiopia, and associated risk factors [^112Kauzw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Milk teeth extraction is another HTP that is performed to prevent diarrhea or vomiting, fever, and problems of growth and development, root of milk teeth can have things such as worms or hair. Eye borrow incision is also believed to prevent eye diseases or infections. However, MTE remains a public health issue for children under the age of five around the world, primarily in East African countries. It has the most common complications including damage to lips and cheeks, pain, swelling, infection and bleeding, dry socket, and temporary numbness.

Stakeholders such as human rights bodies, and United Nations agencies started addressing HTPs early in the 1990 s but there was little progress. Currently, Ethiopia launched a national strategy and plans to end every HTP by 2025. Ethiopia made great efforts to achieve the national plans; such as health education about the negative consequences, community mobilization, and awareness creation to social help like "Idir" leaders, religious leaders, and traditional healers to draw clients enhancing the capacity of service provision.

Moreover, the national constitution, criminal and family laws, education, health, population, and cultural policies of Ethiopia included articles that directly or indirectly combat HTPs.

Despite the above efforts to reduce the problem over the years, findings from studies in different regions of Ethiopia showed that the practice continues and the victims are vulnerable to various health conditions. Therefore, it will be difficult to accomplish the national plan or expectation of ending every HTP from Ethiopia by 2025. To combat HTPs and achieve national expectations, a localized and contextualized understanding of commonly existing HTPs is very important.

However, a comprehensive study and up-to-date data on harmful traditional practices (HTPs) among children were lacking in the study area. After an extensive literature review, we identified the need to explore obstetric-related factors — such as antenatal care (ANC) follow-up, postnatal care (PNC) follow-up, place of delivery, and counseling by health professionals on HTPs during ANC and PNC — and their association with overall HTPs, beyond their known links to specific practices. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of HTPs and their associated factors in the Dire Dawa Administration, Eastern Ethiopia.
