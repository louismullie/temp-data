## Question

Hrt affect on Erythropoietin blood levels

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects erythropoietin (EPO) blood levels and erythropoiesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "HRT" typically includes and how androgens versus estrogens differ in their hematologic effects. Then, I should verify the direct and indirect mechanisms by which testosterone influences EPO and red cell mass. Next, I will examine the evidence for estrogen's effects on EPO, including any suppressive actions. After that, I should review clinical data in humans, including randomized trials and observational cohorts. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and outline practical monitoring and safety considerations, especially for testosterone-induced erythrocytosis [^117C3UJU] [^112dCZ9K].

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate mechanisms. "HRT" in men generally refers to testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), whereas in women it usually means menopausal hormone therapy with estrogens, with or without progestogens; these regimens have opposite directions of effect on erythropoiesis, so I need to keep them separate in my reasoning and evidence appraisal [^117C3UJU] [^114Yw4pR].

> Now, I will examine testosterone's effects on EPO and red cell mass. Wait, let me verify the classic paradox: TRT robustly increases hemoglobin and hematocrit, but some human studies did not show a proportional rise in circulating EPO, suggesting non-EPO mechanisms predominate in many contexts; however, newer translational and clinical data indicate that testosterone can increase EPO in some settings, so I should reconcile these findings rather than dismiss them outright [^112Hyrdi] [^111axCee].

> Mechanistically, I need to check the hepcidin pathway because it is consistently implicated. Testosterone suppresses hepcidin within about a week, increasing iron flux to the marrow and amplifying erythropoiesis; this effect is dose dependent and more pronounced in older men, aligning with the greater hematocrit rise seen with age, and hepcidin suppression tracks with the magnitude of hematocrit increase in clinical cohorts [^112T9gqt] [^115XNiJp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about EPO itself. Some studies in hypogonadal men with diabetes show that TRT-associated increases in hematocrit correlate with increases in EPO and suppression of hepcidin, supporting a dual mechanism; but wait, I should double-check that this is not universal, because earlier dose–response work with GnRH suppression found no significant change in EPO despite rising hemoglobin, implying that direct marrow effects and iron mobilization can suffice in many cases, especially early after initiation [^111axCee] [^112Hyrdi].

> Next, I should review direct marrow effects. Androgens can upregulate EPO receptor expression on erythroid progenitors and enhance their proliferation and survival, and they may also stimulate IGF-1–mediated erythropoietic signaling; these non–EPO-centric pathways help explain erythrocytosis even when circulating EPO does not rise substantially, which fits the heterogeneous clinical observations [^113fBBfy] [^115XNiJp].

> I will now examine estrogen's effects on EPO. Let me consider preclinical data first: estradiol can suppress hypoxia- or iron deficiency–stimulated EPO induction in animal models, indicating a negative regulatory role at the kidney; clinically, women generally have lower hemoglobin than men, and physiologic estrogen appears to blunt EPO responsiveness, though this is nuanced and not uniformly observed across all human contexts [^114Yw4pR] [^116xC9Q7].

> But wait, what if estrogen also facilitates erythropoiesis via iron handling? Indeed, estrogen can suppress hepcidin and increase iron availability, which would be expected to support erythropoiesis; however, in contrast to testosterone, clinical menopausal hormone therapy does not typically raise hematocrit and may even associate with lower hemoglobin in some analyses, suggesting that any pro-erythropoietic effect of improved iron flux is offset by suppression of EPO drive and other regulatory constraints in most women on standard HRT regimens [^116vVhNe].

> Next, I should review human clinical data to ensure these mechanistic inferences hold. Randomized and observational studies of TRT consistently show dose-dependent increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, with higher risk of secondary erythrocytosis, particularly with injectables; the magnitude is commonly 2–4% absolute hematocrit rise, and guidelines mandate baseline, 3–6 month, and annual hematocrit monitoring with interruption if hematocrit exceeds 54% and evaluation for sleep apnea or hypoxia when elevated [^112Tqvy3] [^117C3UJU] [^112NnRJn].

> I should confirm whether EPO levels were measured in these trials. In the dose–response study with GnRH suppression, EPO did not change significantly despite rising hemoglobin, reinforcing that hepcidin suppression and marrow effects can dominate; conversely, in hypogonadal men with diabetes, TRT-associated hematocrit increases aligned with increased EPO, so the EPO signal is context dependent rather than absent [^112Hyrdi] [^111axCee].

> Let me consider special populations to avoid overgeneralization. In transgender men on testosterone, erythrocytosis is a recognized adverse effect necessitating routine hematologic monitoring; in contrast, transgender women on estrogen generally do not exhibit erythrocytosis, consistent with estrogen's net suppressive effect on EPO-driven expansion, although data are more limited and individualized risk assessment remains important [^112dCZ9K] [^116L8mur].

> I should double-check safety signals and guideline thresholds because they inform how we interpret "effect size". TRT-related erythrocytosis correlates with increased thromboembolic risk in some cohorts, and professional guidance treats hematocrit above 54% as a stop signal pending evaluation; this is particularly salient in men with baseline hematocrit near 48–50% or those at altitude, where relative contraindications and closer surveillance are advised [^117C3UJU] [^112NnRJn].

> Synthesis and answer: Testosterone HRT increases red cell mass predominantly via suppression of hepcidin with augmented iron delivery to erythropoiesis, and in some settings it also increases EPO, whereas estrogen HRT tends to suppress EPO responsiveness and does not raise hematocrit in most women; thus, the direction and magnitude of EPO change depend on the hormone used and the clinical context, with testosterone promoting erythrocytosis and estrogen generally restraining it [^112T9gqt] [^111axCee] [^114Yw4pR].

> Practical implications: For men on TRT, I need to ensure baseline hematocrit is under 48–50%, recheck at 3–6 months, then annually, hold therapy if hematocrit exceeds 54%, and screen for sleep apnea or hypoxia; for women on estrogen HRT, routine hematocrit surveillance is not typically required for erythrocytosis risk, though anemia evaluation should follow standard clinical indications rather than hormone effects per se [^117C3UJU].

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) affects erythropoietin (EPO) levels through **testosterone-driven EPO stimulation** and **estrogen-mediated EPO suppression**. Testosterone increases EPO production and erythropoiesis, raising hematocrit and hemoglobin [^112Hyrdi] [^111BRk61], whereas estrogen suppresses EPO and reduces red cell mass [^114Yw4pR] [^116vVhNe]. Clinically, testosterone therapy can cause erythrocytosis [^117C3UJU], especially in older men, and **monitoring hematocrit is essential** [^112NnRJn]; estrogen therapy lowers hematocrit and is not associated with erythrocytosis [^notfound]. These effects are dose dependent and vary by age, sex, and formulation [^112Hyrdi] [^112NnRJn].

## Testosterone and erythropoietin

Testosterone increases EPO production and erythropoiesis via **direct renal effects** and **hepcidin suppression**, which increases iron availability [^112T9gqt] [^115XNiJp].

- **Direct renal stimulation**: Testosterone stimulates renal EPO production, increasing red cell mass [^111axCee].
- **Hepcidin suppression**: Testosterone lowers hepcidin, increasing iron flux and erythropoiesis [^112T9gqt] [^115KxaFN].
- **Clinical evidence**: TRT raises hematocrit and hemoglobin, with higher risk of erythrocytosis in older men [^112Hyrdi] [^111BRk61] [^117C3UJU].

---

## Estrogen and erythropoietin

Estrogen suppresses EPO and erythropoiesis via **hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal feedback** and **direct renal effects**.

- **Suppression of EPO**: Estrogen reduces hypoxia-induced EPO, lowering red cell mass [^114Yw4pR] [^116vVhNe].
- **Clinical evidence**: Estrogen therapy lowers hematocrit and is not linked to erythrocytosis [^112dCZ9K] [^112jTDRw].

---

## Clinical implications and monitoring

- **Testosterone therapy**: Monitor hematocrit at baseline, 3–6 months, and annually; hold therapy if hematocrit > 54% and evaluate for sleep apnea or hypoxia [^117C3UJU] [^112NnRJn].
- **Estrogen therapy**: No routine hematocrit monitoring needed; anemia risk is low [^notfound].
- **Individualized care**: Adjust therapy based on age, sex, and response to minimize adverse effects [^112Hyrdi] [^112NnRJn].

---

HRT alters EPO via **testosterone stimulation** and **estrogen suppression** of erythropoiesis; testosterone increases hematocrit and requires monitoring, whereas estrogen lowers hematocrit and does not cause erythrocytosis [^112Hyrdi] [^117C3UJU] [^112dCZ9K].

### Mechanisms of disease: erythropoietin – an old hormone with a new mission? [^115Z847Z]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The major physiological function of erythropoietin is the induction of erythropoiesis. A growing body of evidence indicates, however, that this hormone has tissue-protective effects and prevents tissue damage during ischemia and inflammation. This review article summarizes the present knowledge on the cardiovascular and renal protective effects of erythropoietin and discusses the possible underlying mechanisms.

Long thought to act only as a hormone that was the primary regulator of red blood cell production, erythropoietin is now known to have a whole spectrum of activity. Organs such as the brain, ovary, oviduct, uterus, and testis have erythropoietin receptors. Because erythropoietin receptors exist in the paracrine and autocrine systems, as well as the hormonal system, the beneficial effects of administering human erythropoietin are likely to extend beyond its effect in raising hematocrit. It may even be possible in the future to use the receptors to target a drug to a tumor without damaging the surrounding tissue.

### Is it time for a paradigm shift? Is erythropoietin deficiency still the main cause of renal anaemia? [^114KCPNL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

An increasing number of reports documenting resistance to human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy are challenging the concept that erythropoietin deficiency is the main cause of the anaemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In an attempt to establish whether other factors play a more predominant role in the anaemia of CKD, 988 patients receiving dialysis were assessed for a wide range of variables. Data were collected on haematocrit (Hct) levels, rHuEPO dose, dry weight, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum albumin, serum aluminium, serum parathyroid hormone intact, eKt/V for urea, gender, dose of i.v. iron administered, time in hospital, and use of i.v. vancomycin. Hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO was defined as patients requiring > 500 IU/kg/week or failing to achieve Hct levels of > 30%. Ninety-two (9.2%) of the 988 patients met the above criteria for hyporesponsiveness to rHuEPO. In 21 of these patients, Hct concentrations remained < 30% at 6-month follow-up. There were known haematological causes of refractoriness to rHuEPO in nine of these patients. During extended follow-up, probable causes of hyporesponsiveness were discovered in all but two of the remaining 13 patients. Of 62 dialysis patients who received rHuEPO at doses > 500 IU/kg/week, 45 (73%) had Hct concentrations of 33–42%. These patients were responding to the higher doses of rHuEPO with no obvious adverse effects. Lower values of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and eKt/V, or higher levels of parathyroid hormone or serum aluminium were not associated with higher rHuEPO dose requirements. These results suggest that erythropoietin deficiency is still the main cause of the anaemia of CKD. Erythropoietin replacement therapy can correct the anaemia in almost all iron replete patients providing enough hormone is given, functional iron deficiency is avoided, aluminium levels and parathyroid toxicities are controlled and that no de novo haematological condition that affects erythropoiesis or red blood cell survival develops. Consideration should be given to modifying the definition of rHuEPO hyporesponsiveness. The US Hct target of 33–36% for haemodialysis patients is narrow and the European target of Hct > 33% may be significantly more practical and physiologically relevant.

### Effects of graded doses of testosterone on erythropoiesis in healthy young and older men [^112Hyrdi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Erythrocytosis is a dose-limiting adverse effect of testosterone therapy, especially in older men.

Objective

Our objective was to compare the dose-related changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit in young and older men and determine whether age-related differences in erythropoietic response to testosterone can be explained by changes in erythropoietin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) levels.

Design

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a testosterone dose-response study in young and older men who received long-acting GnRH agonist monthly plus one of five weekly doses of testosterone enanthate (25, 50, 125, 300, or 600 mg im) for 20 wk.

Setting

The study took place at a General Clinical Research Center.

Participants

Participants included 60 older men aged 60–75 yr and 61 young men aged 19–35 yr.

Outcome Measures

Outcome measures included hematocrit and hemoglobin and serum erythropoietin and sTfR levels.

Results

Hemoglobin and hematocrit increased significantly in a linear, dose-dependent fashion in both young and older men in response to graded doses of testosterone (P < 0.0001). The increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly greater in older than young men. There was no significant difference in percent change from baseline in erythropoietin or sTfR levels across groups in either young or older men. Changes in erythropoietin or sTfR levels were not significantly correlated with changes in total or free testosterone levels.

Conclusions

Testosterone has a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on erythropoiesis in men that is more pronounced in older men. The testosterone-induced rise in hemoglobin and hematocrit and age-related differences in response to testosterone therapy may be mediated by factors other than erythropoietin and sTfR.

### Dihydrotestosterone: biochemistry, physiology, and clinical implications of elevated blood levels [^115RuRaq]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Erythropoiesis

Androgens, but not estradiol, increase erythropoiesis and have some clinical utility in the treatment of mild anemias associated with long-term hypogonadism as recently confirmed in older hypogonadal men. DHT can serve to stimulate erythropoiesis when given in supraphysiologic dosing, despite suppressing endogenous T and estradiol (E), but it is not required for exogenous T to exert these effects. Furthermore, endogenous DHT, despite its androgenic potency, is not necessary for maintenance of normal hematocrit and hemoglobin in healthy men. Recent data point to suppression of hepcidin and increased erythropoietin production as the mechanisms whereby T increases erythropoiesis and iron incorporation into red blood cells. Normal levels of circulating DHT are not required for suppression of hepcidin.

In the Page et al. study, there was no change in hematocrit after subjects were treated with a DHT gel preparation for 1 month. In the Idan et al. study, eight subjects in the DHT arm were discontinued due to polycythemia over the 24-month treatment period. Compared with most other TRT studies where intervention (e.g. dose adjustment, phlebotomy, or discontinuation) does not occur unless a hematocrit > 54% has been confirmed, a conservative hematocrit limit of > 50% was used by Idan et al. None of these subjects with elevated hematocrit were symptomatic or required intervention. Interestingly, these men all had high-normal hemoglobin levels at baseline. The magnitude of response to DHT [group mean (± standard error) hematocrit: 47.1 ± 1.3 in DHT vs 43.4 ± 0 in the placebo group; P < 0.001] was the same in men who did or did not become polycythemic. In contrast with these findings, Jockenhovel et al. compared four TRT preparations (including oral TU treatment of 55 hypogonadal men) and found a positive correlation existed with T and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, but not DHT.

### Beyond anemia: the clinical impact of the physiologic effects of erythropoietin [^114XSM2a]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

Although we have known that oxygen tension affects erythrocyte production since the 19th century, we have only recently begun to understand many subtleties of erythropoietin (EPO) physiology. EPO administration has allowed hundreds of thousands of patients to avoid transfusions. With the beneficial effects so apparent a detailed understanding of the full clinical physiology of this plasma factor seemed less important. However, the unanticipated increase in mortality found in recent randomized studies is prompting a reassessment of this view. We will review what is known about the physiology of this plasma factor that, it is now clear, is more than just an erythrocyte production factor.

### Transdermal androgen therapy to augment EPO in the treatment of anemia of chronic renal disease [^1124LjNk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hypogonadism and anemia are common comorbid conditions in dialysis patients. Testosterone replacement may improve such clinical parameters as anemia, sarcopenia, and low libido. Additionally, by increasing hemoglobin levels, testosterone replacement may allow for a dose reduction in recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), thereby reducing cost.

Methods

This phase IV, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind study assessed the effect of transdermal testosterone on serum testosterone levels, rHuEPO dose required to maintain hemoglobin level, bone mineral content, lean body mass and fat content, cholesterol level, sexual function, and mood. Forty hypogonadal male hemodialysis patients who were administered rHuEPO were randomly assigned to 100 mg of topical 1% testosterone gel (Testim; Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Norristown, PA) or placebo, applied daily for 6 months.

Results

Forty men with a mean age of 56 years and baseline serum testosterone level less than 300 ng/dL (< 10.4 nmol/L) participated in this trial. In men assigned to administration of transdermal testosterone, there was an increase beyond that in the placebo group in mean serum testosterone (77.1 ng/dL [2.7 nmol/L]), dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 0.8 nmol/L), and estradiol levels (6.3 pg/mL [23.0 pmol/L]) and a decrease in mean serum luteinizing hormone levels (-3.1 IU/L). Compared with subjects administered placebo, participants on testosterone replacement therapy did not show an appreciable change in rHuEPO dose (mean difference adjusted for baseline values, 12.6 U/kg/wk; P = 0.73), bone mineral density, lean body mass or fat content, cholesterol level, sexual function, or mood.

Conclusion

Daily administration of 100 mg of topical 1% testosterone gel for 6 months failed to significantly increase serum testosterone or DHT levels in hypogonadal men with end-stage renal disease. Treatment with transdermal testosterone did not impact on rHuEPO requirement or clinical parameters in this small placebo-controlled study. Greater serum testosterone levels may be required to show clinical benefit in men with end-stage renal disease.

### Effect of human recombinant growth hormone therapy on circulating levels of erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in short children [^111qjeLj]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Several reports suggest a role of growth hormone (GH) in the regulation of the haematopoietic system, as regards the normal differentiation and function of blood cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of rhGH therapy on erythropoietin (Epo) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels in 18 prepubertal short children with idiopathic GH deficiency (GHD) (n = 8) or without GHD (n = 10), during the first year of treatment. In non-GHD children Epo levels significantly decreased and G-CSF levels increased from basal to 12 months of therapy, whereas in GHD children they did not change significantly. Circulating levels of G-CSF are significantly lower in GHD than in non-GHD children. In non-GHD children the number of red blood cells, haemoglobin and haematocrit values significantly increased after 1 year of rhGH treatment. rhGH therapy influences Epo and G-CSF levels in short non-GHD children, while it shows no effects in GHD children.

### Androgens correlate with increased erythropoiesis in women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^113NvcKS]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effect of androgens on erythropoiesis is well described and initially came to light through the observation that men have higher levels of haemoglobin (Hb) than women. 1 Pre‐pubertal boys and girls have similar levels of Hb but boys acquire higher Hb levels following puberty that coincides with the surge in testosterone levels. 2 Lower Hb levels in women are not due to chronic menstrual blood loss as this gender difference persists in non‐menstruating women. 3, 4 The evidence for an erythropoietic effect of testosterone led to its use as a treatment for anaemia in renal failure 4 and bone marrow failure 5 in the past before the development of recombinant erythropoietin. In men, intramuscular testosterone replacement is often associated with polycythaemia, 6 which reverses with a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. 7 Conversely, androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer leads to a reduction in Hb levels. 8

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the commonest genetic endocrine disorder, and 21‐hydroxylase deficiency accounts for more than 95% of cases. 9 In this condition, defective cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands leads to the loss of negative feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion by the pituitary. The elevated ACTH leads to hyperplasia of the adrenal glands and excess production of adrenal androgens. 9 Treatment with glucocorticoids aims to control androgen excess and replace steroid deficiency; however, it is challenging to achieve the correct balance between over‐ and under‐treatment. When patients are under‐replaced, adrenal androgens are elevated and women are affected by symptoms of hyperandrogenism. With over‐replacement, adrenal androgens are suppressed.

The effect of elevated adrenal androgens on erythropoietic markers in patients with CAH has been assumed but not studied in detail. Polycythaemia is seen in neonates with CAH, 10 and there have been a few case studies reporting polycythaemia in untreated men and women with CAH and androgen excess. 11, 12 To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies examining the relationship of androgens with erythropoiesis in women with CAH. This study investigated the association of androgens with Hb and haematocrit (Hct) in women with CAH in a cross‐validated study.

### Androgens for the anaemia of chronic kidney disease in adults [^113ad5Hh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia occurs when blood contains fewer red blood cells and lower haemoglobin levels than normal, and is a common complication among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although a number of approaches are applied to correct anaemia in adults with CKD, the use of androgen therapy is controversial.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and harms of androgens for the treatment of anaemia in adult patients with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM), CNKI, VIP and reference lists of articles without language restriction. The most recent search was conducted in August 2014.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the use of androgens for treating anaemia of CKD in adults were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analyses were performed using relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included eight studies that reported data from 181 participants. Study quality was assessed as moderate in six studies, one was low quality, and one was high quality. The small number of included studies, and low participant numbers adversely influenced evidence quality overall. We found limited evidence (1 study, 24 participants) to indicate that oxymetholone can increase haemoglobin (Hb) (MD 1.90 g/dL, 95% CI 1.66 to 2.14), haematocrit (HCT) (MD 27.10%, 95% CI 26.49 to 27.71), change in albumin (MD 4.91 g/L, 95% CI 3.69 to 6.13), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (MD 54.50 U/L, 95% CI 43.94 to 65.06), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (MD 47.33 U/L, 95% CI 37.69 to 56.97); and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD -15.66 mg/dL, 95% CI -24.84 to -6.48). We also found that compared with erythropoietin alone, nandrolone decanoate plus erythropoietin may increase HCT (3 studies, 73 participants: MD 2.54%, 95% Cl 0.96 to 4.12). Compared with erythropoietin (1 study, 27 participants), limited evidence was found to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase plasma total protein (MD 0.40 g/L, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.67), albumin (MD 0.20 g/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.39), and transferrin (MD 45.00 mg/dL, 95% CI 12.61 to 77.39) levels. Compared with no therapy (remnant kidney), evidence was found to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase Hb (2 studies, 33 participants: MD 1.04 g/dL, 95% Cl 0.66 to 1.41) and HCT (1 study, 24 participants: MD 3.70%, 95% Cl 0.68 to 6.72). Compared with no therapy (anephric), evidence was found (1 study, 5 participants) to suggest that nandrolone decanoate can increase Hb (MD 1.30 g/dL, 95% Cl 0.57 to 2.03), but nandrolone decanoate did not increase HCT (MD 2.00%, 95% Cl -0.85 to 4.85). However, oxymetholone was not found to reduce blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), cholesterol, or triglycerides; or increase plasma total protein, prealbumin, or transferrin. No evidence was found to indicate that nandrolone decanoate increased prealbumin or decreased BUN, SCr, AST, ALT, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL or low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Adverse events associated with androgen therapy were reported infrequently.

Authors' Conclusions

We found insufficient evidence to confirm that use of androgens for adults with CKD-related anaemia is beneficial.

### Secondary erythrocytosis among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with hypogonadism using sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and testosterone replacement therapy [^112Tqvy3]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Diabetes management has been revolutionised recently since the introduction of sodium glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT‐2i), which have a cardiorenal protective effect beyond glycaemic control. Their use was associated with a modest increase in haematocrit levels, suggesting the cardiovascular positive impact of this crucial anti‐diabetic class by reducing cardiovascular death. The rise in Hct could be one of the mechanisms that play a role in cardiovascular and renal protective effects via improved tissue oxygenation. This effect has been related to increased diuresis secondary to the glycosuria effect of SGLT‐2i, leading to decreased plasma volume and hemoconcentration. Other mechanisms, such as increased erythropoietin (EPO) production by renal fibroblasts, are also likely to play a role. The use of SGLT‐2i has demonstrated an increase in haematocrit by 2%–3% and the associated risk of new‐onset erythrocytosis.

Hypogonadism is frequently associated with T2DM, indicating that up to 40% of men with T2DM have testosterone deficiency; however, the etiological link between these two conditions has not been definitively established.

It is important to note that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) represents an essential treatment modality among T2DM patients to restore physiological T levels, particularly when integrated with lifestyle modification and pharmacologic treatment for obesity to improve their health outcomes and quality of life. However, it is well known that TRT might increase up to 3 times the risk of developing secondary erythrocytosis.

It is important to note that, according to current American clinical guidelines, initiation of TRT is contraindicated in patients with baseline erythrocytosis, defined as a haematocrit (Hct) level > 50%. Furthermore, TRT should be discontinued if haematocrit exceeds 54% or if haemoglobin rises above 18.5 g/dL in men due to the potential increased risk of thromboembolic events. This adverse event is dose‐dependent and higher with short‐acting testosterone rather than long‐acting injectable testosterone and transdermal formulations. Furthermore, in randomised control trials, TRT use has resulted in a significant absolute increase of 2%–4% in Hct regardless of treatment duration and testosterone delivery modality.

### Dihydrotestosterone: biochemistry, physiology, and clinical implications of elevated blood levels [^115XNiJp]. Endocrine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Studies of T combined with a 5AR-I (e.g. finasteride or dutasteride) also fail to show an appreciable effect of DHT on erythrocytosis. In these studies, the effect of T alone on hematocrit was compared with T plus a 5AR-I over periods of exposure ranging from 20 weeks to 36 months. In men treated for 36 months, T therapy alone (200 mg T enanthate (TE) intramuscularly every 2 weeks) resulted in an increase in hematocrit from a mean baseline of 42.9% to 48.6% at month 36. Men treated with T plus finasteride (5 mg, daily) also experienced an increase in hematocrit from 43.2% at baseline to 47.4%. Despite a significant reduction in circulating levels of DHT (50% below baseline), there was no effect of lower DHT levels on the magnitude of erythrocytosis when compared with men treated with T alone.

Clearly, the DHT levels observed in the literature in response to TRT are many fold less than has been observed when DHT gel has been used in clinical trials. Consequently, it is probable that chronic exposure to very high DHT will increase hematocrit in some men. It is noteworthy that all subjects in the Idan et al. study, who discontinued due to polycythemia, had the highest baseline hemoglobin levels (albeit still in the normal range), a reflection, perhaps, of polymorphisms that predispose some men to DHT-mediated effects on hematocrit when treated with DHT gel. Such a polymorphism in the erythropoietin gene that influences hematocrit levels in normal blood donors has been described.

Overall, the available data do not support DHT as the principal driver of changes in hematocrit observed in response to the various TRT routes of administration. The erythrocytosis observed in response to TRT seems predominantly due to a direct inhibitory action of T (independent of DHT) on hepcidin transcription/expression and to increased iron incorporation in red blood cells. However, it also has been shown that androgens may directly affect erythropoietin concentrations via stimulation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, a pathway that involves AR-mediated induction of IGF-1. A direct role of DHT in this pathway has not been investigated.

### Erythropoietin administration in humans causes a marked and prolonged reduction in circulating hepcidin [^115KxaFN]. Haematologica (2010). Low credibility.

Expression of hepcidin, the key hormone governing iron transport, is reduced by anemia in a manner which appears dependent on increased bone marrow activity. The temporal associations between plasma hepcidin and other iron parameters were examined in healthy humans after erythropoietin administration and venesection. Profound hepcidin suppression appeared abruptly 24 hours after subcutaneous erythropoietin (P = 0.003), and was near maximal at onset, with peak (mid-afternoon) levels reduced by 73.2%, gradually recovering over the following two weeks. Minor changes in circulating iron, soluble transferrin receptor and growth differentiation factor-15 were observed after the reduction in hepcidin. Similar but more gradual changes in these parameters were observed after reducing hematocrit by removal of 250 mL blood. These human studies confirm the importance of a rapidly responsive marrow-hepcidin axis in regulating iron supply in vivo, and suggest that this axis is regulated by factors other than circulating iron, soluble transferrin receptor or growth differentiation factor-15.

### Testosterone therapy is associated with reduced risk of acute kidney injury, kidney failure with renal replacement therapy, and cardiovascular events in men with diabetes and hypogonadism [^111axCee]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Exogenous testosterone supplementation leads to an increase in estradiol concentration in men through aromatization. There are arguments in favor of the hypothesis that part of the renal benefits of testosterone treatment is mediated by its conversion to estradiol. Indeed, administration of estradiol to diabetic animals is associated with reduction in glomerulosclerosis, extracellular matrix deposition in glomeruli and mesangial cells, and lower albuminuria. Estradiol administration has been correlated with lower expression of markers associated with podocyte injury. Furthermore, estrogens attenuate renal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion through the release of nitric oxide in the post-ischemic kidney.

Our results of a lower mortality rate for men treated with testosterone compared to those untreated are in line with a recent meta-analysis based on individual participant data showing that testosterone deficiency is associated with increased total mortality. Furthermore, observational findings showed a lower mortality rate for men with diabetes and hypogonadism treated with testosterone compared to their untreated counterparts over a follow-up of 3.8 years. Low total testosterone was associated with higher mortality in men with chronic kidney disease, and a serum testosterone concentration in the top quartile is associated with a lower cardiovascular risk in elderly men compared to those with levels in the first two quartiles.

Stimulation of erythropoiesis may be a plausible potential pathway for kidney and cardiovascular protection with testosterone treatment. In hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes, the increase in hematocrit observed following administration of testosterone is associated with an increase in erythropoietin, the suppression of hepcidin, and an increase in the expression of ferroportin. Hypoxia and reduced renal cortical oxygenation have been shown to be associated in patients with a decline of renal function and adverse kidney outcomes. Increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit values under treatment have been postulated to be involved in the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular death, heart failure hospitalization, and also kidney protection in diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to increase erythropoietin, suggesting direct effects on erythropoiesis that may improve kidney tissue oxygenation. In a post hoc mediation analysis of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial which included time-dependent updated mean change from baseline of hematocrit level, this appeared to be the strongest mediator of the observed treatment effect of empagliflozin on the composite kidney outcome in patients with diabetes. Consistently, a link between changes in hematocrit values and the effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular mortality and heart failure outcomes was also observed in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^114TKnq9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For all patients with CKD:

When initiating or adjusting therapy, monitor hemoglobin levels at least weekly until stable, then monitor at least monthly. When adjusting therapy consider hemoglobin rate of rise, rate of decline, ESA responsiveness and hemoglobin variability. A single hemoglobin excursion may not require a dosing change.

Do not increase the dose more frequently than once every 4 weeks. Decreases in dose can occur more frequently. Avoid frequent dose adjustments.
If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 g/dL in any 2-week period), reduce the dose of PROCRIT by 25% or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.
For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not increased by more than 1 g/dL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose by 25%.
For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation period, increasing the PROCRIT dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a hemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. Evaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue PROCRIT if responsiveness does not improve.

For adult patients with CKD on dialysis:

Initiate PROCRIT treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL.
If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on hemodialysis.

For adult patients with CKD not on dialysis:

Consider initiating PROCRIT treatment only when the hemoglobin level is less than 10 g/dL and the following considerations apply:
The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC transfusion and,
Reducing the risk of alloimmunization and/or other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 g/dL, reduce or interrupt the dose of PROCRIT, and use the lowest dose of PROCRIT sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions.
The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 Units/kg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.

### Uptake of evidence by physicians: De-adoption of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents after the TREAT trial [^111Ta1Qw]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) are commonly used to stimulate bone marrow to produce red blood cells, improving anemia symptoms and preventing the need for blood transfusion. The treatment is typically initiated when a patient's level of hemoglobin concentration is too low, and the treatment is used until the hemoglobin concentration reaches a "safe" range. The main types of ESA in the U.S. are epoetin alfa (EPO) and darbepoetin alfa (DPO), which mainly differ in how frequently the drug is administered to patients. DPO is a newer, synthetic form of naturally-occurring erythropoietin that has a longer duration of action, requiring less frequent administration. EPO is usually administered three times a week while DPO is administered once a week up to once every a month.

### Early versus delayed erythropoietin for the anaemia of end-stage kidney disease [^114ZvAcJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia is a common complication in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and mainly develops as a consequence of relative erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. Anaemia develops early in the course of disease and peaks among people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Many types of EPO - also called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) - are used to treat anaemia in people with ESKD.ESAs have changed treatment of severe anaemia among people with CKD by relieving symptoms and avoiding complications associated with blood transfusion. However, no benefits have been found in relation to mortality rates and non-cardiac fatal events, except quality of life. Moreover, a relationship between ESA use and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD has been reported in studies with fully correcting anaemia comparing with partial anaemia correction. Until 2012, guidelines recommended commencing ESA treatment when haemoglobin was less than 11 g/dL; the current recommendation is EPO commencement when haemoglobin is between 9 and 10 g/dL. However, advantages in commencing therapy when haemoglobin levels are greater than 10 g/dL but less than 11 g/dL remain unknown, especially among older people whose life expectancy is limited, but in whom EPO therapy may improve quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO for anaemia in patients with ESKD undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 8 July 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating at the clinical benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO for anaemia in patients with ESKD undergoing haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Studies comparing EPO with another EPO, placebo or no treatment were eligible for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For dichotomous outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, overall myocardial infarction, overall stroke, vascular access thrombosis, adverse effects of treatment, transfusion), we planned to use the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We planned to calculate the mean difference (MD) and CI 95% for continuous data (haemoglobin level) and the standardised mean difference (SMD) with CI 95% for quality of life if different scales had been used.

Main Results

Literature searches yielded 1910 records, of these 1534 were screened after duplicates removed, of which 1376 were excluded following title and abstract assessment. We assessed 158 full text records and identified 18 studies (66 records) that were potentially eligible for inclusion. However, none matched our inclusion criteria and were excluded.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence to assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed EPO for the anaemia of ESKD.

### Effects of thyroid hormone on A1c and glycated albumin levels in nondiabetic subjects with overt hypothyroidism [^111fSYuk]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to determine the effects of thyroid hormone on A1C and glycated albumin (GA) in nondiabetic patients with overt hypothyroidism.

Research Design and Methods

A1C levels were measured in 45 nondiabetic patients with overt hypothyroidism and 180 euthyroid control subjects. A1C, GA, fasting blood glucose (FBG), 1,5-anhydroglucitol, and erythrocyte indexes were determined in 30 nondiabetic patients with overt hypothyroidism before and after thyroid hormone replacement.

Results

A1C levels were higher in patients with hypothyroidism compared with control subjects. A1C levels were decreased by thyroid hormone replacement. Thyroid hormone replacement increased serum erythropoietin, reticulocyte count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The change in A1C level was significantly correlated with the change in reticulocyte count or MCH. Thyroid hormone replacement decreased serum levels of albumin and GA. However, FBG and 1,5-anhydroglucitol levels were not altered.

Conclusions

Levels of A1C and GA are spuriously high in nondiabetic patients with overt hypothyroidism.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^112NnRJn]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Erythrocytosis with testosterone therapy — Androgens have an erythrogenic effect with elevations in hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct); during TT, Hb and Hct rise for the first 5 to 6 months, then plateau, and decline to baseline within 3 to 12 months after discontinuation, with injectable formulations associated with the greatest increases. Prospective RCTs have not shown a direct relationship between TT-induced erythrocytosis and cardiovascular events, and a meta-analysis did not support a causal role for testosterone supplementation in adverse cardiovascular events. Management guidance states that Hct values higher than 54% warrant discontinuation of TT until further assessment; if Hct becomes markedly elevated, phlebotomy should be considered, and patients newly diagnosed with hypertension before or during TT warrant close monitoring.

### Erythropoietin (Procrit) [^115quLUo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

PROCRIT overdosage can cause hemoglobin levels above the desired level, which should be managed with discontinuation or reduction of PROCRIT dosage and/or with phlebotomy, as clinically indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Cases of severe hypertension have been observed following overdose with ESAs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Long-term treatment with EPO increases serum levels of high-density lipoprotein in patients with CKD [^111Siuc2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Among lipid abnormalities observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In a previously published randomized control trial, we showed that early erythropoietin (EPO) administration in a predialysis population slowed the progression of CKD. In the present nested substudy, we examine whether EPO has an influence on serum HDL-C levels in comparison to other lipid parameters in this population.

Methods

Eighty-eight patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in the study. Forty-five patients (group 1) were treated with EPO (50 U/kg/wk), targeting to increase hemoglobin levels to 13 g/dL or greater (≥ 130 g/L). The other patients (group 2) remained without treatment until hemoglobin levels decreased to less than 9 g/dL (< 90 g/L). The duration of the study was 12 months.

Results

At the end of the study, we observed a statistically significant decrease in serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides in both groups. However, serum HDL-C levels significantly increased in only group 1 (from 42.5 ± 10.4 to 55.9 ± 8.1 mg/dL [1.10 ± 0.27 to 1.45 ± 0.21 mmol/L]; P < 0.001), whereas they were unchanged in group 2. In addition, a significant decrease in atherogenic LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was observed in only group 1. Importantly, the increase in serum HDL-C levels correlated positively with the increase in hemoglobin values in EPO-treated patients.

Conclusion

Our results show that EPO treatment of predialysis patients with CKD significantly increases serum HDL-C levels, which may represent an important antiatherogenic effect of this hormone.

### Erythropoietin or darbepoetin for patients with cancer [^114zqXrR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia associated with cancer and cancer therapy is an important clinical factor in the treatment of malignant diseases. Therapeutic alternatives are recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo), darbepoetin (Darbepo) and red blood cell transfusions.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of Epo or Darbepo to either prevent or treat anaemia in cancer patients.

Search Strategy

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE and EMBASE and other data bases. Searches were done for the periods 01/1985 to 12/2001 for the first review and 1/2002 to 04/2005 for the update. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials on managing anaemia in cancer patients that compared the use of Epo/Darbepo (plus transfusion if needed) with observation until red blood cell transfusion was required.

Data Collection and Analysis

Several reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

This update of the systematic review included a total of 57 trials with 9,353 patients. Of these, 27 trials with 3,287 adults were also included in the first Cochrane Review. Thirty trials with 6,066 patients were added during the update process. Use of Epo/Darbepo significantly reduced the relative risk of red blood cell transfusions (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.68, 42 trials, n = 6,510). On average participants in the Epo/Darbepo group received one unit of blood less than the control group (WMD -1.05; 95% CI -1.32 to -0.78, 14 trials, n = 2,353). For participants with baseline haemoglobin below 12 g/dL haematological response was observed more often in participants receiving Epo/Darbepo (RR 3.43; 95% CI 3.07 to 3.84, 22 trials, n = 4,307). There was suggestive evidence that Epo/Darbepo may improve Quality of Life (QoL). The relative risk for thrombo embolic complications was increased in patients receiving Epo/Darbepo compared to controls (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.06; 35 trials, n = 6,769). Uncertainties remain whether and how Epo/Darbepo effects tumour response (fixed effect RR 1.12; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23, 13 trials, n = 2,833; random effects: RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.26) or overall survival (unadjusted and adjusted data: HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.18; 42 trials, n = 8,167).

Authors' Conclusions

There is consistent evidence that administration of Epo/Darbepo reduces the relative risk for blood transfusions and the number of units transfused in cancer patients. For patients with baseline haemoglobin below 12 g/dL (mild anaemia) there is strong evidence that Epo/Darbepo improves haematological response. There is suggestive evidence that Epo/Darbepo may improve QoL. However, there is strong evidence that Epo/Darbepo increases the relative risk for thrombo embolic complications. Whether and how Epo/Darbepo effects tumour response and overall survival remains uncertain.

### Androgens correlate with increased erythropoiesis in women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^115U94Sx]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated that androgen levels in women with CAH are positively associated with Hb and Hct, suggesting that these markers of erythropoiesis are a potential biomarker of androgen control in women with CAH. The findings strengthen the evidence for an action of androgens on erythropoiesis in women.

The mechanism by which androgens promote erythropoiesis is not established. 1, 14 There are conflicting results on the effect of testosterone on erythropoietin, the major regulator of erythropoiesis. Some studies have suggested that testosterone increases the erythropoietin production, 1, 15 while others found no evidence to support these findings. 6, 16 Other possible mechanisms by which testosterone might induce erythropoiesis include a direct effect on bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells by stimulating insulin‐like growth factor 1 and erythrocyte colony‐forming units, 17 and increasing intestinal iron absorption and incorporation into erythrocytes. 14

Exogenous androgens have been associated with an increase in erythropoiesis. Supra‐physiological pharmaceutical doses of androgens cause an increase in Hb and Hct in men, 18 which is dose‐dependent. Polycythaemia is a common but unwanted side effect of testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men. 6 Similarly in women, androgen therapy was associated with an increase in Hb and erythroid cell hyperplasia in bone marrow aspirates. 19 In gender reassignment, hormone therapy raising testosterone levels in female‐to‐male reassignment leads to an increase in Hb levels, while suppressed testosterone levels in male‐to‐female reassignment leads to a decrease in Hb levels. 20 Levels of endogenous androgens have also been associated with erythropoiesis: healthy adult men with low free testosterone levels have a lower haematocrit than men with normal free testosterone, 21 while Hb levels correlate with total and bioavailable testosterone in men and women older than 65 years. 22

### Frequency of administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for the anaemia of end-stage kidney disease in dialysis patients [^1114nR2k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) for dialysis patients have been demonstrated. However, it remains unclear whether the efficacy and safety of new, longer-acting ESA given less frequently is equivalent to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) preparations. This is an update of a review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2005.

Objectives

This review aimed to establish the optimal frequency of ESA administration in terms of effectiveness (correction of anaemia, and freedom from adverse events) and efficiency (optimal resource use) of different ESA dose regimens.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 21 March 2013 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing different frequencies of ESA administration in dialysis patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model.

Main Results

This review included 33 studies (5526 participants), 22 of which were added for this update. Risk of bias was generally high; only nine studies were assessed at low risk of bias for sequence generation and 14 studies for allocation concealment. Although only four studies were placebo-controlled, all were considered to be at low risk of performance or detection bias because the primary outcome of haemoglobin level was a laboratory-derived assessment and unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding. We found that 16 studies were at low risk of attrition bias and five were at low risk of selection bias; only one study reporting sources of support was not funded by a pharmaceutical company. We compared four different interventions: Continuous erythropoietin receptor agonists (CERA) versus other ESA (darbepoetin or rHuEPO); different frequencies of darbepoetin administration; darbepoetin versus rHuEPO; and different frequencies of rHuEPO administration. There were no significant differences in maintaining final haemoglobin between CERA administered at two weekly intervals (4 studies, 1762 participants: MD 0.08 g/dL, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.21) or four weekly intervals (two studies, 1245 participants: MD -0.03 g/dL, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.12) compared with rHuEPO administered at two to three weekly intervals. In one study comparing CERA administered every two weeks with darbepoetin administered once/week, there was no significant difference in final haemoglobin (313 participants: MD 0.30 g/dL, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.55). In comparisons of once/week with once every two weeks darbepoetin (two studies, 356 participants: MD 0.04 g/dL, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.52) and once every two weeks with monthly darbepoetin (one study, 64 participants: MD 0.40 g/dL, 95% CI -0.37 to 1.17) there were no significant differences in final haemoglobin levels. There was marked heterogeneity among studies comparing weekly darbepoetin with once every two weeks and was possibly related to different administration protocols. Eight studies compared weekly darbepoetin with rHuEPO given two to three times/week; no statistical difference in final haemoglobin was demonstrated (6 studies, 1638 participants: MD 0.02 g/dL, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.12). Fourteen studies compared different frequencies of rHuEPO. No statistical difference was demonstrated in final haemoglobin (7 studies, 393 participants: SMD -0.17 g/dL, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.05). Adverse events did not differ significantly within comparisons; however, mortality and quality of life were poorly reported, particularly in earlier publications.

Authors' Conclusions

Longer-acting ESA (darbepoetin and CERA) administered at one to four week intervals are non-inferior to rHuEPO given one to three times/week in terms of achieving haemoglobin targets without any significant differences in adverse events in haemodialysis patients. Additional RCTs are required to evaluate different frequencies of ESA in peritoneal and paediatric dialysis patients and to compare different longer-acting ESA (such as darbepoetin compared with CERA).

### Androgens correlate with increased erythropoiesis in women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia [^114HsMcB]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

Conditions associated with significant hyperandrogenism such as Cushing's disease and androgen‐producing ovarian tumours may present with polycythaemia. 23, 24 We hypothesised that lower chronic elevations of androgens may be associated with more subtle increases in erythropoietic markers. Women with CAH have elevated levels of adrenal androgens if inadequately treated with glucocorticoids 25 and provide a free‐living model for exploring the effect of androgens on erythropoiesis. Cortisol has been implicated to play a mediating role in erythropoiesis. 26, 27 Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor promotes 'stress erythropoiesis' and maturation of erythroid progenitors in vitro. 28 It is well recognised that anaemia occurs in patients with hypocortisolism, for example Sheehan's syndrome, 29 while polycythaemia is described in women with hypercortisolism. 30 Correcting hypocortisolism with glucocorticoid replacement 31 or hypercortisolism by surgery 24 leads to normalisation of Hb levels. Hypogonadal men with active Cushing's disease have low erythroid parameters that improve slowly after correction of hypercortisolism in parallel with improvements in testosterone levels. In our study, glucocorticoid equivalent doses did not differ between women with normal and those with elevated haematological parameters. A previous study of testosterone replacement in two men with aromatase deficiency has shown that the action of testosterone on erythropoiesis does not require its aromatisation to oestrogen. 32

In our study, the androgen precursors androstenedione and 17‐OHP were weakly associated with erythropoietic markers compared with testosterone. Androgenic precursors exert their androgenic effect through conversion to testosterone and do not directly activate the androgen receptor, which may explain the weaker relationship with erythropoiesis. Free testosterone may have a stronger association with erythropoiesis but was not calculated in the present study because sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was not measured. We have, however, adjusted our data for body mass index, which relates inversely to SHBG levels. It would be of interest to examine the association of Hb and Hct with dihydrotestosterone, which has ten‐fold greater affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone. 33 However, dihydrotestosterone is not routinely measured in the clinical setting and therefore was not available in the present study. Chronic kidney disease is also associated with anaemia due to the reduction in renal production of erythropoietin. 34 In the two cohorts presented here, there were no subjects with chronic kidney disease and the relationship between androgens and markers of erythropoiesis continued to persist after adjustment for creatinine.

### Effects of erythropoietin receptors and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on disease progression in cancer [^114Gw3Hb]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Indirect mechanisms

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent exposure could theoretically increase the risk of disease progression via indirect mechanisms. Intriguingly, recent findings suggest that activated monocyte/macrophage cells express EpoR and that binding of Epo to these cells can prevent NF- κ B activation, repress pro-inflammatory genes, and induce an immunosuppressive effect. However, the possible immunomodulatory role of Epo influences on tumour growth is unknown. Tumour growth could also theoretically be influenced by changes in iron-dependent metabolism (especially in iron-deficient patients) that result from an ESA-induced increase in RBC production. Research is needed to examine this possibility.

It has been proposed that ESAs could affect the cardiovascular system. There are reports showing in vitro angiogenic effects of Epo on human bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and on endothelial cells derived from human adult myocardial tissue. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent therapy has also been reported to increase circulating levels of EPCs and endogenous Epo levels were found to correlate with circulating EPCs in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. However, ESA therapy did not affect the number of EPCs in donors for allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation nor in patients with acute myocardial infarction. In addition, long-term ESA treatment did not affect endothelial markers in patients on haemodialyses. At present, convincing evidence for an effect of ESAs on EPCs is missing in the clinical setting.

If blood vessel endothelial cells express EpoR, then ESA exposure could hypothetically stimulate neovascularisation or angiogenesis; blood vessel growth in a tumour could then enhance tumour proliferation. Some studies have suggested that endothelial cells contain EpoR mRNA and that Epo can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation. However, a recent study demonstrated that human endothelial, renal, cardiac, and neuronal cells contain EpoR mRNA at levels 10–100-fold lower than those in cells highly responsive to Epo. In addition, low or no EpoR-protein expression was detected in these cell types using a recently developed specific anti-EpoR monoclonal antibody. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were also observed to have no effect in a rat angiogenesis assay. These findings call into the question whether ESAs could indirectly stimulate disease progression via angiogenesis.

### Effects of erythropoietin receptors and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on disease progression in cancer [^113JGh8t]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG)-191 study was conducted in cervical cancer patients receiving chemoradiotherapy who were randomised to receive or not receive recombinant Epo (40 000 IU weekly) during treatment (the overall radiation treatment time was ≤ 8 weeks). This trial assessed whether maintaining haemoglobin levels of 13–14 g dL⁻¹ would improve survival and progression outcomes. Based on concerns of increased thromboembolic events in the ESA arm, the study closed after < 25% of the planned accrual (460 patients were targeted to allow for 165 recurrences within 2 years). After a median follow-up of 37 months, results from 109 patients (52 in the control arm and 57 in the ESA arm) indicated that 25% of control patients and 33.3% of ESA-treated patients experienced disease recurrences; however, this result was not statistically significant (P = 0.65). At ∼3 years, 73% of control patients and 61% of ESA-treated patients were still alive; 65% of control patients and 60% of ESA-treated patients were progression-free. As this trial closed prematurely, the effect of ESAs on progression and mortality in this study remains undetermined.

The Preoperative Epirubicin Paclitaxel Aranesp (PREPARE) study evaluated the effect of preoperative dose-dense, dose-intensified chemotherapy with anthracyclines and taxanes in breast cancer patients (N = 733). A second randomisation assigned patients to receive or not receive darbepoetin alfa 4.5 μ g kg⁻¹ every 2 weeks to maintain haemoglobin concentrations between 12.5–13 g dL⁻¹. Secondary endpoints included the effect of darbepoetin alfa on disease-free survival and overall survival. After a median follow-up of ∼3 years, an unplanned-interim analysis of 733 patients indicated that survival and progression-free survival rates were lower in ESA-treated patients (this difference was not statistically significant). Final results from the PREPARE trial were recently published in two manuscripts. When comparing ESA-treated patients with control patients, the 3-year estimated HR (95% CI) was 1.31 (0.99–1.74; P = 0.061) for disease-free survival and 1.33 (0.91–1.95; P = 0.139) for overall survival. Though these results suggest a trend of decreased disease-free survival with darbepoetin alfa use, the findings were not statistically significant. Darbepoetin alfa use did not affect pathological-complete response.

### The role of erythropoietin and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in tumor progression [^111iCVrt]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Over the past few decades, understanding of the physiologic function of erythropoietin (EPO) has evolved significantly. EPO binds to erythropoietin receptors (EPOR), initiating signaling that stimulates growth, inhibits apoptosis, and induces the differentiation of erythroid progenitors to increase red blood cell mass. EPO has additionally been shown to exert tissue-protective effects on multiple tissues, suggesting a pleiotropic mechanism of action. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) are used clinically for treating cancer-related anemia [chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA)]. Recent clinical trials have reported increased adverse events and/or reduced survival in ESA-treated cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, potentially related to EPO-induced cancer progression. Signaling pathways downstream of EPO/EPOR have been shown to influence numerous cellular functions in both normal and tumor cells, including proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance. Some studies have reported effects on proliferation, reduced chemotherapy efficacy, reduction of apoptosis, and resistance to selective therapies on cancer cell lines, whereas others have shown null effects. In addition, newer targeted cancer therapies that are directed toward specific signaling pathways may be antagonized by ESAs. This molecular interplay between anticancer agents and potential survival signals triggered by ESAs may have been underestimated and may contribute toward decreased survival seen in certain trials. As more targeted anticancer therapies become available, these types of interactions may mitigate therapeutic efficacy by allowing tumor cells to acquire drug resistance. Therefore, a more complete understanding of the complex pathways involved will allow for the rational use of ESAs for the safe treatment of CIA in oncology patients.

### Late erythropoietin for preventing red blood cell transfusion in preterm and / or low birth weight infants [^1112L6ho]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO) in preterm infants provide a rationale for the use of EPO to prevent or treat anaemia.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of erythropoietin (EPO) between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL in July 2013. Additional searches included the Pediatric Academic Societies Annual Meetings from 2000 to 2013 (Abstracts2View™) and clinical trials registries (www.clinicaltrials.gov; www.controlled-trials.com; and who.int/ictrp/en). For this update we moved one study from the early EPO review to this late EPO review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of late initiation of EPO treatment (started at ≥ eight days of age) versus placebo or no intervention in preterm (< 37 weeks) and/or low birth weight (< 2500 g) neonates.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

We include 30 studies (31 comparisons) randomising 1591 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2013 did not identify any new study for inclusion. For this update we moved one study enrolling 230 infants from the early EPO review to this late EPO review. Most included trials were of small sample size. The meta-analysis showed a significant effect of the use of one or more RBC transfusions (20 studies (n = 1142); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8). There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 68%; RD I² = 60%). We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation. There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant [typical mean difference (MD) -1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants]. There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 92%). There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 94%). Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%). Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10). There was minimal heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%). There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes. There was no reduction in necrotizing enterocolitis in spite of a reduction in the use of RBC transfusions. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (< 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (ml/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant. Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry. Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP. Further research of the use of late EPO treatment to prevent donor exposure is not indicated. Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment. The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure.

### Erythropoietin or darbepoetin for patients with cancer [^115x8VUu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaemia associated with cancer and cancer therapy is an important clinical factor in the treatment of malignant diseases. Therapeutic alternatives are recombinant human erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and red blood cell transfusions.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ESAs to either prevent or treat anaemia in cancer patients.

Search Methods

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE and other databases. Searches were done for the periods 01/1985 to 12/2001 for the first review, 1/2002 to 04/2005 for the first update and to November 2011 for the current update. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials on managing anaemia in cancer patients receiving or not receiving anti-cancer therapy that compared the use of ESAs (plus transfusion if needed).

Data Collection and Analysis

Several review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. One review author assessed quality assessment and extracted data, a second review author checked for correctness.

Main Results

This update of the systematic review includes a total of 91 trials with 20,102 participants. Use of ESAs significantly reduced the relative risk of red blood cell transfusions (risk ratio (RR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.68, 70 trials, N = 16,093). On average, participants in the ESAs group received one unit of blood less than the control group (mean difference (MD) -0.98; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.78, 19 trials, N = 4,715). Haematological response was observed more often in participants receiving ESAs (RR 3.93; 95% CI 3.10 to 3.71, 31 trials, N = 6,413). There was suggestive evidence that ESAs may improve Quality of Life (QoL). There was strong evidence that ESAs increase mortality during active study period (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.29, 70 trials, N = 15,935) and some evidence that ESAs decrease overall survival (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11, 78 trials, N = 19,003). The risk ratio for thromboembolic complications was increased in patients receiving ESAs compared to controls (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 57 trials, N = 15,498). ESAs may also increase the risk for hypertension (fixed-effect model: RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.56; random-effects model: RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.33, 31 trials, N = 7,228) and thrombocytopenia/haemorrhage (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42; 21 trials, N = 4,507). There was insufficient evidence to support an effect of ESA on tumour response (fixed-effect RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.06, 15 trials, N = 5,012).

Authors' Conclusions

ESAs reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions but increase the risk for thromboembolic events and deaths. There is suggestive evidence that ESAs may improve QoL. Whether and how ESAs affects tumour control remains uncertain. The increased risk of death and thromboembolic events should be balanced against the potential benefits of ESA treatment taking into account each patient's clinical circumstances and preferences. More data are needed for the effect of these drugs on quality of life and tumour progression. Further research is needed to clarify cellular and molecular mechanisms and pathways of the effects of ESAs on thrombogenesis and their potential effects on tumour growth.

### Epoetin-beta treatment in patients with cancer chemotherapy-induced anaemia: the impact of initial haemoglobin and target haemoglobin levels on survival, tumour progression and thromboembolic events [^111kLAG1]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Anaemia frequently occurs in patients with cancer either as a result of the underlying malignancy or as a consequence of myelosuppressive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or due to a combination of both. The symptoms of anaemia have a significant impact on a patient's condition and QoL and as an independent prognostic factor, anaemia is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with a variety of malignancies.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) increase Hb levels and reduce transfusion requirements in patients with cancer. In addition, improvement in patients' QoL when compared with placebo or standard transfusion therapy was also shown following ESA therapy.

Pre-clinical data have suggested an enhanced tumour response and delayed tumour progression associated with ESA treatment. Moreover, in clinical studies, a potential survival benefit has been shown in patients undergoing cancer therapy who received treatment with ESAs. The first of two meta-analyses of controlled trials in cancer patients receiving ESAs, reported by the Cochrane Group, showed a trend toward increased survival in patients treated with ESAs and supported these findings. In the second meta-analysis (57 trials including 9353 patients), however, a shift of the hazard ratio for survival towards an increased risk for patients receiving various ESAs was shown.

An association between erythropoietin treatment and increased mortality was originally suggested by two studies in cancer patients raising concerns about the safety of ESAs when targeting high Hb levels (12–14 g dL −1 or higher). In addition, three studies reporting a detrimental impact of ESA treatment on survival have recently been published, although one of these studies remains to be reported in full. Methodological limitations of the clinical studies aimed at maintaining a high Hb level in cancer patients, may have confounded the results and influenced the findings. Studies evaluating different haematocrit levels in end-stage renal failure patients with cardiovascular risk factors have suggested that increased mortality may be because of a higher risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) under ESA therapy. Hypotheses that ESAs may promote tumour growth through erythropoietin receptor activation, stimulation of angiogenesis or through hypoxia improvement through Hb increases have also been proposed.

### Exploring sex-specific hematological changes and their impact on quality of life in patients with prolactinoma [^112AFJsT]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Anemia has been previously described as a common feature in men with macroprolactinoma However, data on RBC changes in men with microprolactinoma were missing before our study. Similarly to what has previously been reported, we identified at baseline anemia in 55% of men with macroprolactinoma but also in 22% of those with microprolactinoma. Moreover, different RBC parameters, including HCT and Hb significantly improved after PRL normalization with dopamine agonists treatment in both men with micro- and macroprolactinoma. Also, an increase of RBC count was observed in men with macroprolactinoma after PRL normalization. Elevated prolactin levels inhibit the activity of hypothalamic kisspeptin-producing neurons causing a decrease in gonadotropin-releasing hormone release and, consequently, a decrease in testosterone levels in men. Therefore, the improvement in RBC parameters could be most likely attributed to the normalization of hypogonadism and the concurrent increase in testosterone levels, due to the normalization of PRL. Indeed, testosterone exerts a stimulatory effect on erythropoietin production and hematopoietic stem cells. In addition to that, macroprolactinomas might affect erythropoiesis also by impairing normal pituitary gland function e.g. by their size. For instance, GH, thyroid hormones and cortisol exert a stimulatory role on erythropoiesis through different mechanisms, and therefore patients with the respective hormonal deficiencies often present with anemia. Of note, persistent hypogonadism after PRL normalization showed a negative correlation with RBC, HCT, and Hb levels, whereas hypothyroidism and any hormonal replacement therapy had no significant impact on hematological parameters. Although these results were observed in a small cohort, they suggest how hypogonadism might affect the erythropoiesis more than other pituitary hormone deficiencies in men with prolactinoma, while it has not a significant impact on hematological parameters in women.

### The effects of iron deficiency on estradiol-induced suppression of erythropoietin induction in rats: implications of pregnancy-related anemia [^114Yw4pR]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Pregnant women often develop anemia concomitant with the increase in serum erythropoietin levels, which are actually lower than those of nonpregnant anemic women due to the possible suppressive effect of endogenous estradiol on erythropoietin induction. The anemia, derived from hemodilution, does not act as a drive for erythropoietin induction, but iron deficiency, often observed during pregnancy, might. In order to demonstrate this, we investigated the effects of iron deficiency on estradiol-induced suppression of erythropoietin induction in rats. Single doses of estradiol suppressed hypoxia-, cobalt-, and bleeding-stimulated elevation of plasma erythropoietin levels and renal erythropoietin mRNA expression. Repeated administration of estradiol at 0.1 and 1 mg/kg for 2 months induced a slight anemic trend without elevation of plasma erythropoietin. Feeding an iron-deficient diet for 2 months induced plasma erythropoietin elevation without obvious anemia, but the simultaneous repeated administration of estradiol suppressed it and reversed the iron deficiency. Plasma erythropoietin levels had distinct negative correlations with plasma iron, plasma ferritin, and iron concentrations in the organs, but not with plasma hemoglobin level. These results suggest that iron deficiency would significantly stimulate erythropoietin induction during pregnancy, although estradiol might suppress it through iron restoration.

### Effects of recombinant human erythropoietin on resistance artery endothelial function in stage 4 chronic kidney disease [^1128CC7A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents were approved 20 years ago for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and have been widely accepted for this indication. However, large clinical trials raised concerns about their safety, especially in high‐hemoglobin target groups. The Normal Hematocrit Study involving patients with congestive heart failure or ischemic heart disease who were receiving hemodialysis was stopped because an interim analysis showed an excess of deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarction in the high‐hematocrit group. Clinical trials including patients with stage 3 to 4 CKD also showed an increase in cardiovascular (CV) events – and hypertensionin the highest‐hemoglobin group. Whether the increase in CV events was due to hematocrit levels or the dosage of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents required to reach the hematocrit target is still controversial.

Experimental models suggest that EPO influences nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial function. In human endothelial cell lines, EPO suppresses endothelial NO synthase expression and NO production. In rodent models, EPO has been shown to exert either protective – or deleteriouseffects on endothelial function depending on the rodent model and the size of the studied artery. – EPO‐induced hypertension in patients and animal models with CKD has been associated with higher endothelin (ET)‐1 plasma levels. In bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells, EPO induced ET‐1 secretion in a dose‐dependent manner.ET‐1 has been shown to induce endothelial dysfunction in, for example, mice overexpressing ET‐1or in the deoxycorticosterone acetate–salt hypertensive rat model. Taken together, the data obtained in rodents and cell lines suggest that EPO‐induced vascular injury could involve ET‐1 and endothelial dysfunction. However, in humans, and particularly in CKD patients, the effect of EPO on small resistance arteries has never been studied, and neither has the potential involvement of ET‐1.

Resistance artery remodeling and endothelial dysfunction have been associated with various diseases, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, and have a negative impact on patient outcomes. – Resistance arteries isolated from biopsy samples of gluteal subcutaneous tissue provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the function of human resistance arteries and to test the direct effects of pharmacological agents. We hypothesized that human recombinant EPO alters endothelial function of subcutaneous resistance arteries isolated from CKD patients through induction of ET‐1 expression and oxidative stress. We directly tested the effect of various concentrations of EPO on endothelial function of these vessels and the potential preventive effect of an ET type A receptor (ET A R) antagonist and of antioxidant pretreatment.

### Epoetin alfa (Epogen) [^112c86oD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 		 	Important Dosing Information

Evaluation of Iron Stores and Nutritional Factors

Evaluate the iron status in all patients before and during treatment. Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is less than 100 mcg/L or when serum transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The majority of patients with CKD will require supplemental iron during the course of ESA therapy.

Monitoring of Response to Therapy

Correct or exclude other causes of anemia (e.g., vitamin deficiency, metabolic or chronic inflammatory conditions, bleeding, etc.) before initiating Epogen. Following initiation of therapy and after each dose adjustment, monitor hemoglobin weekly until the hemoglobin level is stable and sufficient to minimize the need for RBC transfusion.

Selection of Formulation

In pregnant women, lactating women, neonates, and infants use only single-dose vials (the benzyl alcohol-free formulation) [see Contraindication s (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, and 8.4)].

### Effects of erythropoietin receptors and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on disease progression in cancer [^112bVeuh]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Recent randomised, controlled ESA studies also suggest no significant impact of ESAs on disease progression in chemotherapy patients. Of note, a retrospective study in 323 multiple myeloma patients receiving chemotherapy reported that median progression-free survival was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) in ESA-treated patients compared with non-ESA-treated patients. In contrast, a retrospective study of chemotherapy patient data from the SEER-Medicare database (from 1991 to 2002) indicated that overall survival was similar between patients receiving ESAs (N = 12 522) or not receiving ESAs (N = 34 820). In recently reported preliminary final results, the ARA Plus study (N = 1234) prospectively evaluated event-free survival and overall survival in a randomised controlled study of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without darbepoetin in node-positive breast cancer patients. After a median follow-up of 40 months, there were no significant differences in 3-year event-free survival (89.2% vs 87.6%, P = 0.97) or overall survival (95.4% vs 95.1%, P = 0.85) between patients receiving darbepoetin vs standard of care, respectively.

Meta-analyses of ESA trials

Several recent meta-analyses have examined ESA use and safety outcomes in cancer patients. The large meta-analyses byandreported a negative ESA impact risk on mortality but not on how ESAs affect disease progression. A recent meta-analysis byanalysed 52 controlled ESA-oncology trials; this meta-analysis was unique in that it did not include the BEST trial and included studies examining preoperative-ESA therapy. This meta-analysis did summarise two trials (N = 247) that reported numbers of complete and partial tumour responses. These numbers did not differ significantly between ESA-treated and control patients (risk ratio for complete response = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.69–1.12; risk ratio for partial response = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.44–1.11).

### Short-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anaemia in predialysis patients [^113eVuEn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The benefits of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have been previously demonstrated. However, the efficacy and safety of short-acting epoetins administered at larger doses and reduced frequency as well as of new epoetins and biosimilars remains uncertain.

Objectives

This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of different routes, frequencies and doses of epoetins (epoetin alpha, epoetin beta and other short-acting epoetins) for anaemia in adults and children with CKD not receiving dialysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 12 September 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE; handsearching conference proceedings; and searching the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing different frequencies, routes, doses and types of short-acting ESAs in CKD patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and four authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model.

Main Results

We identified 14 RCTs (2616 participants); nine studies were multi-centre and two studies involved children. The risk of bias was high in most studies; only three studies demonstrated adequate random sequence generation and only two studies were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel was at low risk of bias in one study. Blinding of outcome assessment was judged at low risk in 13 studies as the outcome measures were reported as laboratory results and therefore unlikely to be influenced by blinding. Attrition bias was at low risk of bias in eight studies while selective reporting was at low risk in six included studies. Four interventions were compared: epoetin alpha or beta at different frequencies using the same total dose (six studies); epoetin alpha at the same frequency and different total doses (two studies); epoetin alpha administered intravenously versus subcutaneous administration (one study); epoetin alpha or beta versus other epoetins or biosimilars (five studies). One study compared both different frequencies of epoetin alpha at the same total dose and at the same frequency using different total doses. Data from only 7/14 studies could be included in our meta-analyses. There were no significant differences in final haemoglobin (Hb) levels when dosing every two weeks was compared with weekly dosing (4 studies, 785 participants: MD -0.20 g/dL, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.07), when four weekly dosing was compared with two weekly dosing (three studies, 671 participants: MD -0.16 g/dL, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.10) or when different total doses were administered at the same frequency (four weekly administration: one study, 144 participants: MD 0.17 g/dL 95% CI -0.19 to 0.53). Five studies evaluated different interventions. One study compared epoetin theta with epoetin alpha and found no significant differences in Hb levels (288 participants: MD -0.02 g/dL, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.21). One study found significantly higher pain scores with subcutaneous epoetin alpha compared with epoetin beta. Two studies (165 participants) compared epoetin delta with epoetin alpha, with no results available since the pharmaceutical company withdrew epoetin delta for commercial reasons. The fifth study comparing the biosimilar HX575 with epoetin alpha was stopped after patients receiving HX575 subcutaneously developed anti-epoetin antibodies and no results were available. Adverse events were poorly reported in all studies and did not differ significantly within comparisons. Mortality was only detailed adequately in four studies and only one study included quality of life data.

Authors' Conclusions

Epoetin alpha given at higher doses for extended intervals (two or four weekly) is non-inferior to more frequent dosing intervals in maintaining final Hb levels with no significant differences in adverse effects in non-dialysed CKD patients. However the data are of low methodological quality so that differences in efficacy and safety cannot be excluded. Further large, well designed, RCTs with patient-centred outcomes are required to assess the safety and efficacy of large doses of the shorter acting ESAs, including biosimilars of epoetin alpha, administered less frequently compared with more frequent administration of smaller doses in children and adults with CKD not on dialysis.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^116xC9Q7]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Cardiovascular system — sex-related differences in cardiac structure, oxygen transport, and hormonal effects are described as follows: Males have both cardiac and hematological adaptations compared with females resulting in a significant performance gap in endurance events, including greater cardiac mass, blood volume, higher cardiac output and hemoglobin concentrations and thus larger VO₂max. At rest and across submaximal and maximal exercise, males have higher stroke volume and stroke volume index, while for the same absolute work females have the same cardiac output but a smaller stroke volume and higher heart rate; at the same relative work the heart rate is the same between sexes. Estrogens directly compromise cardiac contractility and result in a lower contractile reserve due to downregulation of L-type calcium channels, whereas testosterone is associated with greater ventricular mass and myocardial contractility and high exogenous testosterone analogues result in significant left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in athletes along with an elevated risk of developing cardiomyopathy. Testosterone has significant ergogenic effects on peripheral determinants of VO₂max as a potent inducer of erythropoiesis, recalibrating the set-point of erythropoietin and improving hemoglobin and hematocrit to raise the oxygen carrying capacity of blood; sex differences in blood volume and hemoglobin mass (males > females) enhance LV filling and peripheral oxygen delivery in males, while females partially compensate by increasing oxygen extraction but arteriovenous oxygen extraction remains lower at submaximal exercise. Testosterone administration in females result in improvements in mitochondrial respiration and 8% greater capillary to fiber ratio compared with placebo.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^115PMND3]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythropoiesis is one of the important physiological supply functions of the bone marrow. In healthy adults, about 200×10 9 red cells are produced per day in the bone marrow and are released into the peripheral blood. Depending on demand, red cell production can be adjusted and upregulated substantially. A complex network of oxygen sensors, cytokines, such as erythropoietin, and other factors, including regulators of iron metabolism, are involved in the control of steady-state and stress-induced erythropoiesis, thereby ensuring appropriate oxygen supply to the peripheral tissues. – This regulatory network can adjust itself to physiological requirements such as the oxygen concentration (altitude) or pregnancy as well as to pathological conditions such as blood loss. – However, in some pathological conditions this regulatory network is overwhelmed or is not functional, resulting in polycythemia or anemia.

In the elderly, the bone marrow and other organs undergo aging. As a result, erythropoietin synthesis and red cell production may decline. – However, even in very old individuals, red cell production and erythropoietin synthesis are usually adequate to keep hemoglobin levels within a reasonable range unless certain co-morbidities that lead to insufficient production of red cells have been acquired. – Therefore, such other etiologies must be ruled out when hemoglobin levels drop in older individuals. –

Anemia is a major cause of symptomatic morbidity in daily medical practice. The etiologies contributing to anemic states are complex. – Underlying disorders include trauma or coagulopathies with consequent bleeding, immunological and other inflammatory reactions as well as clonal (neoplastic) conditions. Clonal expansion of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow may result in central and peripheral expansion of erythropoiesis, and thus in the clinical picture of polycythemia vera (PV), but it may also result in clonal anemic states such as the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or even erythroid leukemia, characterized by a major or complete block of differentiation in early erythropoiesis. – Anemic MDS are characterized by red cell dysplasia, ineffective erythropoiesis, apoptosis of late erythroid precursor cells, and the paradoxical combination of erythroid bone marrow hyperplasia and peripheral anemia.

Patients with Cancer

An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions, some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 2 in Table 2 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]) of 939 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year. This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%). This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).

### Late erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to prevent red blood cell transfusion in preterm or low birth weight infants [^117GqhNk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Preterm infants have low plasma levels of erythropoietin (EPO), providing a rationale for the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to prevent or treat anaemia. Darbepoetin (Darbe) and EPO are currently available ESAs.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of late initiation of ESAs, between eight and 28 days after birth, in reducing the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in preterm or low birth weight infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 5 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 5 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 5 June 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of late initiation of EPO treatment (started at ≥ eight days of age) versus placebo or no intervention in preterm (< 37 weeks) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) neonates.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We include 31 studies (32 comparisons) randomising 1651 preterm infants. Literature searches in 2018 identified one new study for inclusion. No new on-going trials were identified and no studies used darbepoetin. Most included trials were of small sample size. The meta-analysis showed a significant effect on the use of one or more RBC transfusions (21 studies (n = 1202); typical risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.79; typical risk difference (RD) -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.12; typical number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 6, 95% CI 5 to 8). There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome (RR I² = 66%; RD I² = 58%). The quality of the evidence was very low. We obtained similar results in secondary analyses based on different combinations of high/low doses of EPO and iron supplementation. There was no significant reduction in the total volume (mL/kg) of blood transfused per infant (typical mean difference (MD) -1.6 mL/kg, 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6); 5 studies, 197 infants). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 92%). There was a significant reduction in the number of transfusions per infant (11 studies enrolling 817 infants; typical MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome (I² = 94%). Three studies including 404 infants reported on retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (all stages or stage not reported), with a typical RR 1.27 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.64) and a typical RD of 0.09 (95% CI -0.00 to 0.18). There was high heterogeneity for this outcome for both RR (I² = 83%) and RD (I² = 82%). The quality of the evidence was very low. Three trials enrolling 442 infants reported on ROP (stage ≥ 3). The typical RR was 1.73 (95% CI 0.92 to 3.24) and the typical RD was 0.05 (95% CI -0.01 to 0.10). There was no heterogeneity for this outcome for RR (I² = 18%) but high heterogeneity for RD (I² = 79%). The quality of the evidence was very low. There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes including mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. For the outcomes of mortality and necrotising enterocolitis, the quality of the evidence was moderate. Long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes were not reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Late administration of EPO reduces the use of one or more RBC transfusions, the number of RBC transfusions per infant (< 1 transfusion per infant) but not the total volume (mL/kg) of RBCs transfused per infant. Any donor exposure is likely not avoided as most studies included infants who had received RBC transfusions prior to trial entry. Late EPO does not significantly reduce or increase any clinically important adverse outcomes except for a trend in increased risk for ROP. Further research of the use of late EPO treatment, to prevent donor exposure, is not indicated. Research efforts should focus on limiting donor exposure during the first few days of life in sick neonates, when RBC requirements are most likely to be required and cannot be prevented by late EPO treatment. The use of satellite packs (dividing one unit of donor blood into many smaller aliquots) may reduce donor exposure.

### Effect of treatment with epoetin-beta on survival, tumour progression and thromboembolic events in patients with cancer: an updated meta-analysis of 12 randomised controlled studies including 2301 patients [^1138GZWC]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This updated meta-analysis, using individual patient data, was designed to evaluate differences between epoetin- β and control (placebo or standard care) with regard to overall survival, disease progression and thromboembolic events (TEEs) during and up to 28 days after end of therapy with epoetin- β. Eligible studies included all randomised, controlled studies of epoetin- β conducted by the drug sponsor (F Hoffmann-La Roche or Boehringer Mannheim) in patients with cancer undergoing treatment (chemotherapy (seven studies), surgery (two studies), radiotherapy (two studies) or radio-chemotherapy (one study)). A subgroup analysis of four controlled studies with extended follow-up provides information on the effect of epoetin- β on long-term survival and malignancy progression. Individual study details are summarised in Table 1.

The primary objectives of the meta-analysis were to evaluate the effects of epoetin- β on overall survival, disease progression and TEEs in cancer patients in the overall data set, and for solid tumours and nonmyeloid haematological malignancies separately. Secondary predefined objectives included the evaluation of the potential impact of various Hb intervention levels on mortality and disease progression as well as evaluation of the latter outcomes in a predefined subgroup analysis including patients with long-term follow-up or those with an Hb level at baseline (intervention Hb) ≤ 11 g dL −1.

Most of the studies were originally designed to evaluate the efficacy of epoetin- β with respect to anaemia correction and thus there was no follow-up for survival or tumour progression beyond study treatment plus a standard 28-day period used to assess SAEs, including deaths and disease progression. Although tumour status was not prospectively assessed in many of the earlier trials with short-term follow-up, details of disease progression were routinely reported as adverse events. For the present meta-analysis, this information was analysed retrospectively by reviewers blinded to treatment assignment. Other studies were, however, designed to assess the effects of epoetin- β on survival and/or disease progression or Hb response to treatment. Long-term follow-up information, up to 60 months, was available for overall survival in four studies and for tumour progression in three studies. All reported adverse events were also reviewed against a prespecified list of TEEs, the definition of which was consistently applied across all studies.

Decreased Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival

Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 2,098 anemic women with metastatic breast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a noninferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumor progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the median progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%). At the final analysis, 1653 deaths were reported (79.8% subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77.8% subjects in the SOC group). Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18).

Study 4 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, factorial design study in which darbepoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia in 733 women receiving neo-adjuvant breast cancer treatment. A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of approximately 3 years. The 3-year survival rate was lower (86% vs. 90%; HR 1.42, 95% CI: 0.93, 2.18) and the 3-year relapse-free survival rate was lower (72% vs. 78%; HR 1.33, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.79) in the darbepoetin alfa-treated arm compared to the control arm.

Study 5 was a randomized, open-label, controlled study that enrolled 114 of a planned 460 cervical cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive epoetin alfa to maintain hemoglobin between 12 and 14 g/dL or to RBC transfusion support as needed. The study was terminated prematurely due to an increase in thromboembolic adverse reactions in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control (19% vs. 9%). Both local recurrence (21% vs. 20%) and distant recurrence (12% vs. 7%) were more frequent in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared to control. Progression-free survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (59% vs. 62%; HR 1.06, 95% CI: 0.58, 1.91). Overall survival at 3 years was lower in the epoetin alfa-treated group compared to control (61% vs. 71%; HR 1.28, 95% CI: 0.68, 2.42).

Study 6 was a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 351 head and neck cancer patients where epoetin beta or placebo was administered to achieve target hemoglobins ≥ 14 and ≥ 15 g/dL for women and men, respectively. Locoregional progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.14; p = 0.0008) with medians of 406 days and 745 days in the epoetin beta and placebo arms, respectively. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients receiving epoetin beta (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.84; p = 0.02).

### L-carnitine treatment of anemia [^111PUH3G]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and iron supplementation have had a profoundly positive impact on the anemia of patients with chronic kidney disease. However, a significant number of patients remain hyporesponsive to rHuEPO, with hemoglobin values less than target levels. A suboptimal response to rHuEPO is associated with complications that can reduce quality of life and increase morbidity, mortality, and costs. There are a number of other metabolic derangements associated with uremia that can impact on the production and survival of red blood cells. Dialysis-related carnitine disorder is a functional metabolic deficiency, common in chronic dialysis patients, that can have a negative impact on erythrocyte production and survival. This article reviews the role of L-carnitine in the pathogenesis and adjunctive treatment of anemia associated with kidney failure. After a comprehensive database search, primary and secondary reports were analyzed. Laboratory studies examining the influence of carnitine on red blood cell function and clinical trials of L-carnitine in dialysis patients support the use of L-carnitine in the setting of rHuEPO hyporesponsiveness. Consensus groups, including the National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (K/DOQI), consider the use of L-carnitine for hyporesponsive rHuEPO-dependent anemia a promising application of this therapy, recommending an empiric trial of L-carnitine in these patients.

### Supportive medication in cancer during pregnancy [^112kbu8T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Literature on the profile of ESAs on pregnant cancer patients is wanting, but some conclusions concerning their safety and effects can be drawn from pregnant renal transplant recipients treated with these drugs. Although the relative body of evidence is not extensive, it is believed that ESAs are a safe therapeutic option, at least from the 14th week on, as its effects during the first trimester are unknown. Adverse effects such as thromboembolic events and hypertension are rare and generally manageable with suitable treatment adjustments. Moreover, fetal hematologic variables and growth until the end of the 4th week seem to be within the normal range. However, due to insufficient data, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suggests that erythropoietin should be reserved only for women with end-stage renal disease and hemoglobin levels below 9 g/dL after 3 weeks of oral iron administration.

Taking all these into consideration, ESAs during pregnancy appear relatively complication free, unfortunately though, some issues arise when a malignancy is added to the equation. Erythropoietin is a recognized growth factor for malignant cells and is associated with decreased survival in patients with breast and cervical cancer, although, this increase in mortality could be partially attributed to increased occurrence of thromboembolic events. Therefore, it is suggested that patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for a potentially curable cancer should be counseled as to the risks and benefits of ESAs and alternatives such as RBC transfusion or chemotherapy dose reduction be considered. Last but not least, there is a variety of factors, which may cause a patient not to respond to ESA treatment (extensive bone marrow involvement, a serum erythropoietin level > 500 IU/L, anemia of chronic disease, pure red cell aplasia due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies).

### Endocrine abnormalities in chronic renal failure [^1154HTNF]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Much needs to be achieved in improving survival and quality of life for chronic renal failure patients. Progress in attaining this goal may accrue from attention to underlying pathophysiologic processes early and throughout a person's life. The endocrine perturbations described in this article — alterations in the homeostasis of phosphorus, calcium, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone; erythropoietin deficiency; and sexual dysfunction in uremia — provide good examples for the need to identify early and manage prospectively over time manifestations of chronic renal failure. The complexity of the skeletal and extraskeletal sequelae of dysregulated mineral metabolism and the complications of chronic anemia have been discussed, while stressing possible implications of these endocrine abnormalities for both morbidity and mortality. There is a great need for more randomized clinical trials to evaluate new and old treatment approaches, with the goal of developing better evidence-based practice guidelines.

### Adding epoetin alfa to intense dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: randomized clinical trial [^111r6QxS]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Patients were stratified by center, menopausal status (pre- vs postmenopausal), and the number of affected lymph nodes (4–9 vs ≥ 10) at the central fax randomization. Computer-generated lists with permuted blocks of randomly variable size were used. Group assignment in all analyses was based on the randomization result.

The sample size of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie (AGO) trial was mainly driven by the requirements of the main research question on chemotherapy density and its long-term survival-type endpoint. Prospective power calculations revealed that the resulting sample size was sufficient to detect any meaningful difference in Hb levels and proportions needing transfusion. In addition, the planned patient number attained approximately 85% power to detect a 10% difference in the 5-year relapse-free survival rate after a median follow-up of 5 years using a log-rank test.

The numbers of patients who received at least one on-study RBC transfusion were compared between the two groups using Fisher exact test. On-study was defined as the period from randomization to the date of the last cycle of chemotherapy plus 14 days or the date of withdrawal, whichever occurred first.

Hb values at baseline, change from baseline to each post baseline time point, and change from baseline to the last on-study assessment were to be presented. Comparison of Hb levels between the two groups was evaluated with analysis of variance and Wilcoxon tests.

Kaplan-Meier estimates of the relapse-free survival rate through the clinical cutoff date were presented by treatment group for the intent-to-treat population. Comparison of relapse-free survival between the 2 treatment groups was performed using a 2-sided log-rank test with and without the stratification factors for menopausal status and number of positive lymph nodes. The reported P values result from the unstratified analyses. The results from the stratified analyses are virtually identical and therefore not represented.

In addition, Cox regression models, with and without adjustment for the stratification factors, were performed to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided, except for the primary endpoint of transfusions for which a one-sided hypothesis was prospectively defined based on previous knowledge of expected differences.

The impact of cancer and its treatment was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, version 3. Patients had to complete the questionnaire before the start of treatment, at every second cycle, at the end of treatment, and at each follow-up visit.

### Current use of androgens in bone marrow failure disorders: a report from the severe aplastic anemia working party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [^113fBBfy]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Synthetic and natural anabolic steroids act via the interaction with androgen receptors (AR), members of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor family and ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factors. These structures are widely expressed in many tissues ensuring a large range of biological effects, including maintenance of the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, reproductive, neural, hematopoietic, and immune systems.

Effects on hematopoiesis in the context of BMF may depend on pleiotropic mechanisms, including: 1) stimulation of erythropoietin (EPO) receptor expression on erythroid progenitors and increased iron mobilization via hepcidin inhibition;2) telomere elongation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) via binding to the estrogen response elements (ERE) present in the TERT gene promoter after estrogen aromatization, indirectly impacting cell survival and proliferation signaling;, 3) modulation of immune differentiation programs, reducing T-cell activation, Ig production, proinflammatory cytokines, and thymic cellularity. It is thus not unlikely that the effect on each BMF type is mediated by the activation of different pathways. Furthermore, despite the observation of hematologic improvement under different androgenic analogs, the mechanism of specific molecules remains poorly understood. For instance, danazol has been reported to be able to induce telomere elongation, despite the fact it is structurally not an aromatizable steroid, and is thus unable to interact directly via ERE with the TERT gene promoter. The biological consequences of AR stimulation on hematopoiesis have mostly been investigated in some inherited disorders including dyskeratosis congenita (DC) and Fanconi anemia (FA), where androgens still represent one of the main non-transplant therapeutical backbones, achieving satisfactory outcomes. In a setting of acquired disorders, they were used prior to the availability of ATG and later on, in combination with it as front-line therapy or as part of subsequent therapeutic approaches.5,9,10,28–33 anazol, 3-alpha-etiocholanolone, nandrolone, oxymetholone, oxandrolone are some of the anabolic androgenic compounds used in BMF, showing variable response and toxicity profiles.19,28–30,32, Although integrated into the therapeutic armamentarium for acquired and inherited BMF, many outstanding questions remain unanswered concerning the ideal molecule, optimal dose, timing, disease subgroup, place in the treatment algorithm, and factors influencing response. Moreover, the lack of a systematic analysis of long-term outcomes of patients receiving androgens precludes any clear conclusions as to their safety profile, especially in terms of oncogenic potential and toxicity.

### Myelodysplasia is in the niche: novel concepts and emerging therapies [^117EMmd6]. Leukemia (2015). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) represent clonal disorders mainly of the elderly that are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and an increased risk of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia. The pathogenesis of MDS is thought to evolve from accumulation and selection of specific genetic or epigenetic events. Emerging evidence indicates that MDS is not solely a hematopoietic disease but rather affects the entire bone marrow microenvironment, including bone metabolism. Many of these cells, in particular mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) and osteoblasts, express a number of adhesion molecules and secreted factors that regulate blood regeneration throughout life by contributing to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) maintenance, self-renewal and differentiation. Several endocrine factors, such as erythropoietin, parathyroid hormone and estrogens, as well as deranged iron metabolism modulate these processes. Thus, interactions between MSPC and HSPC contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS and associated pathologies. A detailed understanding of these mechanisms may help to define novel targets for diagnosis and possibly therapy. In this review, we will discuss the scientific rationale of 'osteohematology' as an emerging research field in MDS and outline clinical implications.

Methods

Subjects

Patients, 18–75 years, both sexes, with anemia (hematocrit ≤ 28% or hemoglobin ≤ 9 g/dL) due to end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (3 sessions per week), who gave their written, informed consent to participate were included. The exclusion criteria were: previous EPO treatment; pregnancy or nursing; sepsis or active infection; non-treated iron deficiency (serum iron < 60 mg/dL, ferritin < 100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation index < 20%); cancer; hormonal treatment (except thyroid hormone, contraceptive and insulin); liver disease (twice and half the transaminases normal values); diastolic arterial tension ≥ 120 and/or systolic ≥ 180 mmHg; severe psychiatric dysfunction or another limitation that prevented the patient to give his consent; epilepsy; thrombocytosis (≥ 500 000 /mm 3); signs of active bleeding; bone marrow aplasia; active collagen disease; severe hyperparathyroidism (serum parathormone > 400 ng/L), and hyperaluminemia (serum aluminum > 50 ng/mL). They were withdrawn from the trial if they died, abandoned voluntarily, had severe adverse reactions, were subjected to renal transplant, used not allowed medications or other EPO formulations, or if any exclusion criteria arose. The trial was in compliance with the Helsinki declaration. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the participant institutions and by the Cuban Regulatory Authority.

EPO formulations

Formulation A (Heberitro, Heber Biotec, Havana) was in vials containing 2000 IU of human recombinant (rHu) EPO (produced in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells at CIGB, Havana), 2.5 mg serum human albumin, 0.2 mg polysorbate 20, 2.9 mg NaCl, 4.6 mg NaH 2 PO 4.2H 2 O, 9.9 mg Na 2 HPO 4, and water for injection to complete 1 mL. Formulation B consisted in a commercially available preparation (Eprex, CILAG AG, Switzerland) presented in pre-filled syringes containing 2000 IU rHuEPO, 0.15 mg polysorbate 80, 2.192 mg NaCl, 0.580 mg NaH2PO 4.2H 2 O, 1.115 mg Na 2 HPO 4.2H 2 O, 2.50 mg glycine, and water for injection to complete 0.5 mL.

There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%). At the final analysis, 1653 deaths were reported (79.8% subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77.8% subjects in the SOC group. Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18).

### Testosterone suppresses hepcidin in men: a potential mechanism for testosterone-induced erythrocytosis [^112T9gqt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

The mechanisms by which testosterone increases hemoglobin and hematocrit are unknown.

Objective

The aim was to test the hypothesis that testosterone-induced increase in hematocrit is associated with suppression of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin.

Participants

Healthy younger men (ages 19–35 yr; n = 53) and older men (ages 59–75 yr; n = 56) were studied.

Methods

Weekly doses of testosterone enanthate (25, 50, 125, 300, and 600 mg) were administered over 20 wk, whereas endogenous testosterone was suppressed by monthly GnRH agonist administration. Blood and serum parameters from each individual were measured at wk 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 20. Longitudinal analyses were performed to examine the relationship between hepcidin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and testosterone while controlling for potential confounders.

Results

High levels of testosterone markedly suppressed serum hepcidin within 1 wk. Hepcidin suppression in response to testosterone administration was dose-dependent in older men and more pronounced than in young men, and this corresponded to a greater rise in hemoglobin in older men. Serum hepcidin levels at 4 and 8 wk were predictive of change in hematocrit from baseline to peak levels.

Conclusion

Testosterone administration is associated with suppression of serum hepcidin. Greater increases in hematocrit in older men during testosterone therapy are related to greater suppression of hepcidin.

### The effect of common hematologic abnormalities on the ability of blood models to detect erythropoietin abuse by athletes [^114DFxC1]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Algorithms that combine scores from multiple blood parameters are demonstrably effective in highlighting recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) administration, and have been used to deter rHuEPO use by athletes. These models are sensitive to atypical levels of blood parameters encountered during altered states of red cell production. Because hematologic abnormalities can also result in unusual blood profiles, the aim of this study was to document the incidence and magnitude of such abnormalities in an elite athlete population.

Design and Methods

We screened blood samples obtained from 413 female and 739 male elite athletes from 12 countries for known hematologic abnormalities, and compared the algorithm scores for these athletes with those of their healthy counterparts. We also established the magnitude of blood parameters required for model scores to exceed cut-offs associated with rHuEPO use.

Results

We found that 0.7% of male and 2.4% of female athletes were iron deficient either with our without anemia. An additional 1.4% of males and 1.0% of females had hemoglobinopathies. On average these athletes' model scores were at or below the score of their healthy counterparts. The greatest influence on our models was hemoglobin concentration. Values of other parameters must exceed normal ranges by a substantial margin in order for model scores to approach levels associated with rHuEPO use.

Interpretation and Conclusions

The hematologic disorders we encountered in elite athletes were not associated with model scores that exceeded the nominal cut-offs that we have previously recommended to delineate rHuEPO use. We did not find any abnormalities among elite endurance athletes that were associated with high model scores.

### Efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alpha in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ThWMJ]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Erythropoesis‐stimulating agents (ESAs) have been used to treat anaemic MDS patients in clinical practice to reduce the risk of RBC transfusion (Sekeres et al, 2008). Two retrospective studies (Spiriti et al, 2005; Park et al, 2010) and one prospective study (Greenberg et al, 2009) have suggested that use of ESA rather than transfusions improved the overall survival of MDS patients. Additionally, longer survival times have been reported in MDS patients with ESA therapy than without (Jadersten et al, 2008; Park et al, 2008).

Previous reviews reported on studies that used short‐acting epoetin alpha (EA) to treat MDS‐related anaemia (Ross et al, 2007; Moyo et al, 2008), but these reviews focused on EA and included few studies assessing long‐lasting darbepoetin alpha (DA). The number of studies that have assessed DA use has increased (Gabrilove et al, 2008; Gotlib et al, 2009; Oliva et al, 2010; Nilsson‐Ehle et al, 2011; Villegas et al, 2011; Kelaidi et al, 2013a; Jang et al, 2015). Studies have demonstrated efficacy and a safe profile with few reported adverse events (AEs) (Kelaidi & Fenaux, 2010); however, to our knowledge no meta‐analysis or systematic review has been conducted on these DA studies.

Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the use of DA as supportive care to treat anaemia in patients with MDS. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the erythroid response rate in MDS patients receiving DA. We also examined the response rate by baseline erythropoietin levels, DA dose, response measurement timing and transfusion history.

### Efficacy, tolerability and safety of darbepoetin alfa injection for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing dialysis: a randomized, phase-III trial [^1174oJat]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and safety assessments

Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were assessed throughout the correction and maintenance phases. Primary efficacy endpoint included the mean change in Hb level from baseline at the first evaluation visit (EOC) in patients treated with EPO versus DA-α. Secondary efficacy endpoints were Hb variability during correction phase, mean change in Hb levels from baseline to week-4 and week-36 (EOM), proportion of patients achieving the Hb target (defined as Hb increase ≥ 1 g/dL from baseline) at EOC, mean DA-α dose, proportion of patients who could maintain the target Hb of 10–12 g/dL at EOM, and time to initial achievement of Hb target. Safety assessment included serum chemistry, complete blood count, and urinalysis measured at baseline and after treatment. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored at each study visit. Safety endpoints were the incidence of treatmentemergent adverse events (TEAEs) and immunogenicity as assessed by anti-drug antibody titers using ELISA methods. Samples for immunogenicity to DA-α/EPO were withdrawn within 1 h of dosing before initial dosing, i.e. Day 1 of week 1 and on day 1 of weeks 5, 13, 25 and EOM. Since the screening time and evaluation periods of the various patient subgroups were different, the time points for immunogenicity varied accordingly.

### Management of RBC-transfusion dependence [^112i49Lz]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

Strategies for the management of anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have evolved following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of three new therapeutics from one of symptom amelioration with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to one of active treatment. Most patients develop transfusion-dependent anemia over the course of their disease, however, and its adverse consequence on the natural history of disease has only recently been appreciated. Although severe anemia contributes to symptoms of fatigue and reduced quality of life, transfusion dependence increases the risk of organ complications from iron overload coupled with an increased risk of leukemia transformation. Among World Health Organization categories without elevation in bone marrow myeloblasts, an incremental rise in RBC transfusion burden is associated with a proportionate reduction in both overall survival and leukemia-free survival, implying that anemia severity is an important variable limiting the otherwise favorable natural history of patients with lower risk disease. Moreover, therapeutic strategies that successfully restore effective erythropoiesis, such as erythropoetic stimulating agents, immunomodulatory agents, immunosuppressive therapies, or hypomethylating agents, may favorably affect the natural history of this disease, creating perhaps a new urgency for the initiation of erythropoietic promoters that have durable clinical benefit. Selection of primary therapy for the management of anemia should consider four response determinants: age, RBC transfusion burden and duration, endogenous erythropoietin production, and karyotype.

### Protective role of estrogen against excessive erythrocytosis in monge's disease [^116cD6jb]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Epidemiological studies have shown sex differences in the prevalence of CMS in the Andean region. In addition, the drastic increase in the occurrence of EE in females after menopause reinforces the hypothesis that sex hormones play a role in the etiology of this condition. Previous studies have shown a correlation of testosterone and progesterone with hemoglobin levels in CMS patients. but the effect of estrogen on RBC production is still unclear in CMS patients at high altitude. It is possible that all sex hormones have a direct effect on EPO and hepcidin levels and iron metabolism, which directly contribute to the increased hematocrit under hypoxia –. Physiological factors, such as ventilation, cardiopulmonary responses, and oxygenation, also depend on sex hormones and can also produce differences in hematocrit levels between the two sexes. Our in vitro model system provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of sex hormones at the cellular level in erythroid cells. In this study, we show a critical role of estrogen in CMS erythroid cells and provide a mechanistic basis for its influence on RBC production.

### Which reference range should we use for transgender and gender diverse patients? [^1123eZVt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

As Cheung et al describe, the key principles for the selection of the reference range are whether the patient has started gender-affirming hormone therapy and which organs and systems are influenced by hormone therapy. Individuals designated male at birth generally have larger organs (heart, liver, muscle, etc) after male puberty than those designated female, so the reference range differs for tests such as troponin, liver enzymes, and creatinine. Testosterone and estrogen therapy often influence bone density, erythropoiesis, lipid parameters, and chemistry tests such as reproductive hormones, prolactin, and sex-hormone binding globulin.

From a practical standpoint, phlebotomists needs to verify patient identities without misgendering patients. How does the laboratory know which reference range to use for a transgender patient? Rather than defaulting to the sex designated at birth field or to the affirmed gender field in the electronic health record (EHR) (assuming that these fields even exist), Cheung et al propose that ordering clinicians be responsible for providing the gender to be used to the laboratory. The advantage to this approach is that treating providers know the clinical histories of their patients, such as time on hormone therapy and organs present. Disadvantages could be the impracticality of requesting different reference ranges for different tests on the same order (eg, a male troponin reference range and a female hemoglobin reference range) and knowledge gaps among clinicians when it comes to how and which laboratory tests can be altered by hormone therapy. Perhaps an easier approach would be to provide both the male and female reference ranges for transgender patients. More information is better than less and gives clinicians greater flexibility to interpret test results. For example, when using the estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is based on a formula that includes sex, it would be helpful to know whether using one sex instead of the other would influence an important treatment decision such as the dosing of a medication. Another example is using the affirmed gender to calculate z -score for bone mineral density.

### Anaemia management with subcutaneous epoetin delta in patients with chronic kidney disease (predialysis, haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis): results of an open-label, 1-year study [^114EBcxp]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

This was a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled study to assess the safety and efficacy of subcutaneously administered epoetin delta over 1 year. The study was carried out at sites in the United States and Europe between 1998 and 2000.

Epoetin delta was administered subcutaneously once, twice or three-times per week, at the same frequency as patients received before entering the study. The initial dose of epoetin delta was identical to the last dose of epoetin the patient received before entering the study. This dose was maintained for 2 weeks with subsequent titration to maintain haemoglobin at 10–12 g/dL, in keeping with the European Best Practice Guidelines in place at the time of the study. Titration was as follows: dose was increased by 50% if haemoglobin dropped below 10 g/dL or decreased by 25% if haemoglobin was above 12 g/dL. Dose was also altered if a patient's dry weight changed by more than 5 kg. Dose adjustment based on haemoglobin level was only performed once in every 4-week period.

Endpoints and analysis

Haematological parameters were assessed weekly for the the first 12 weeks of the study and thereafter every 4 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was average haemoglobin over Weeks 12, 16, 20 and 24. Efficacy analyses were performed on data from a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population consisting of all patients who had a valid haemoglobin measurement at baseline and at least one haemoglobin measurement during Weeks 12, 16, 20 or 24. An analysis of the primary endpoint was also carried out in the ITT population using last observation carried forward and first observation carried back techniques. In addition, an adjusted average haemoglobin was calculated with an ANCOVA model including parameters for dialysis type, pooled centre, and covariates of baseline haemoglobin and baseline epoetin dose.

Secondary analyses included: epoetin delta dose levels; descriptive statistics of haemoglobin and haematocrit levels; the proportion of patients' haemoglobin values over 10 g/dL and the proportion of patients' haematocrit values over 30% during Weeks 12–24; and haematological parameters and dosing over the 52 weeks of the study.

Safety assessments were conducted by recording and monitoring adverse events at each visit. Laboratory safety assessments were carried out every 4 weeks, and physical examinations and ECG at baseline, mid-study and at the end of the study (or early withdrawal). Anti-erythropoietin antibodies were screened for by validated ELISA (Quintiles Inc. Kansas City, MO) on samples collected at baseline and then every 4 weeks for the duration of the trial.

### Esterified estrogens and methytestesterone [^115FgAJR]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Women's Health Initiative Memory Study

The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a substudy of WHI, enrolled 4,532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older (47% were age 65 to 69 years, 35% were 70 to 74 years, and 18% were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of CE/MPA (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared with placebo.

After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the estrogen/progestin group (45 per 10,000 women-years) and 21 in the placebo group (22 per 10,000 women-years) were diagnosed with probable dementia. The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2.05 (95% CI, 1.21 to 3.48) compared to placebo. Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women. (See BOXED WARNINGS and WARNINGS, Dementia .)

Androgens: Endogenous androgens are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as beard, pubic, chest, and axillary hair, laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature, and fat distribution. Drugs in this class also cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium.

Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein. Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for the eventual termination of linear growth which is brought about by fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause a disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate the production of red blood cells by enhancing the production of erythropoietic stimulating factor.

The dose and timing of estrogen addition are critical for erythroid cells

It is possible that the dosage or timing of sex hormone addition can change the cell response. To address this, we tested various doses ranging from 5 to 100 nM for estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone (Fig. 3a). Estrogen had a striking negative effect on the erythropoietic response in CMS subjects in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). At 5–10 nM (physiological estrogen levels: 0.1–10 nM), we observed a significant decrease in RBC production, and the addition of 50–100 nM led to extremely low RBC production. For testosterone, we observed a slight increase, but the changes were not significant (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 3
The figure shows the dose response and the stage specificity/effect of the timing of sex hormone addition on male erythroid cells.

a Different doses (0, 5, 10, 50, and 100 nM) of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone were used to study the effect of sex hormones on RBC production in CMS subjects. The addition of estrogen above a dosage of 10 nmol resulted in a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in RBC production in CMS cells. The line colors depict the following: (i) estrogen (pink), (ii) progesterone (green), (iii) testosterone (blue), (iv) no hormone added (gray). ✱ p < 0.05 (t test). b Sex hormones were added at various stages during RBC differentiation from iPS cells (at the 1-, 2-, and 3-week EB stages, as shown in the schematic in the "Methods" section) to study the stage specificity of the effect of hormones. Indeed, we observed that estrogen had the strongest impact on RBC reduction when added at the week 2 EB stage. Progesterone or testosterone did not show any specificity or significant effect on the EE phenotype. The bar colors represent the following: (i) estrogen (pink bar), (ii) progesterone (green bar), (iii) testosterone (blue bar), and (iv) no hormone added (first bar in each group). ✱ p < 0.01 (t test).

### Approach to the patient: management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^113ZtQ2k]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormone Replacement — Considerations

The mainstay of medical treatment in patients with hypopituitarism is replacement of the appropriate hormones.

GH is generally a safe treatment, and in tumor survivors, replacement dosages are not associated with recurrence or progression. A small increased risk of second primary neoplasms has been reported in patients who have previously received radiotherapy. There may be an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in GH-treated patients, but this appears to be confined to those with preexisting risk factors. GHD should be treated until linear growth is complete, and GH secretion should then be reassessed. Most data support the role of this therapy at transition and beyond in patients with permanent GHD. GH benefits during transition include improvements in peak BMD and body composition. In adulthood, benefits are based around cardiovascular surrogate outcomes, body composition, bone density, and quality of life (QoL). Monitoring should include IGF-I, lipid profile, glycated hemoglobin concentrations and QoL measures. IGF-I should be used to titrate GH dose, and this is lower than those used in childhood, (0.2–0.5 mg/d). Younger patients, especially women on oral estrogen, may require higher doses because oral estrogens cause hepatic GH resistance resulting from a first-pass effect in the liver.

Puberty may be normal, delayed/absent, or precocious in patients with hypopituitarism, the latter being mainly encountered in patients with SOD and in those with optic pathway glioma (OPG) and germ cell tumour.

In patients with CHH, it is not unusual to commence GH supplementation at least 6 months before sex steroid replacement. With respect to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), replacement in males is commonly administered in the form of testosterone (parenteral or transdermal). Puberty is induced slowly over approximately 2.5 to 3 years, with careful monitoring of growth, virilization, trough testosterone concentrations, and full blood count (for the adverse effect of polycythemia). Longer acting testosterone preparations (eg, 3 monthly) may be used once growth has been completed. Testosterone replacement in teenage boys induces secondary sexual characteristics, but does not induce testicular enlargement, which can be circumvented by gonadotropin treatment.

### A phase 1 study of ACE-536, a regulator of erythroid differentiation, in healthy volunteers [^113Z5bjn]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

ACE-536, a recombinant protein containing a modified activin receptor type IIB, is being developed for the treatment of anemias caused by ineffective erythropoiesis, such as thalassemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. ACE-536 acts through a mechanism distinct from erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to promote late-stage erythroid differentiation by binding to transforming growth factor-β superfamily ligands and inhibiting signaling through transcription factors Smad 2/3. The goal of this Phase 1 study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of ascending dose levels of ACE-536 in healthy volunteers. Thirty-two postmenopausal women were randomized in sequential cohorts of eight subjects each to receive up to two doses of either ACE-536 (0.0625–0.25 mg/kg) or placebo (3:1 randomization) given subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Mean baseline age was 59.4 years, and hemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL. ACE-536 was well tolerated at dose levels up to 0.25 mg/kg over the 1-month treatment period. There were no serious or severe adverse events, nor clinically meaningful changes in safety laboratory measures or vital signs. Mean ACE-536 AUC0–14d and Cmax increased proportionally after first dose; mean t½ was 15–16 days. Dose-dependent increases in hemoglobin concentration were observed, beginning 7 days after initiation of treatment and maintained for several weeks following treatment. The proportion of subjects with a hemoglobin increase ≥ 1.0 g/dL increased in a dose-dependent manner to 83.3% of subjects in the highest dose group, 0.25 mg/kg. ACE-536 was well tolerated and resulted in sustained increases in hemoglobin levels in healthy postmenopausal women.

### Associations of obesity and body shape with erythrocyte and reticulocyte parameters in the UK biobank cohort [^116vVhNe]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

A key factor stimulating erythropoiesis is erythropoietin (EPO). Literature reports relating EPO to obesity, however, are mainly focused on exogenous EPO administration, which reduces fat accumulation and improves glycaemic characteristics, and little information is available about endogenous EPO in obesity. Notably, however, in chronic kidney disease, when EPO production is restricted due to kidney damage, haemoglobin levels are higher for higher BMI and lower EPO doses are required to maintain haemoglobin levels in obese compared to normal weight patients. This suggests that a factor alternative to EPO is involved in the stimulation of erythropoiesis in obesity, with a prominent candidate being leptin, which is produced by adipose tissue. In agreement, obesity induced with high-fat diet in mice leads to higher bone marrow adipocyte infiltration and higher leptin levels, with a similar increase of red and white cell precursors. Furthermore, leptin levels are lower in patients with end-stage kidney disease requiring higher EPO doses to maintain haemoglobin levels compared to patients managing to maintain haemoglobin with lower EPO doses. Glucocorticoids may also contribute to stimulated erythropoiesis, as they are associated with both general and abdominal obesity and are important regulators of erythropoiesis. Glucocorticoid receptor activation stimulates erythroid progenitor self-renewal but inhibits terminal differentiation, which would be compatible with the shift towards immature cells that we have described. Furthermore, oestrogens, which are derived in obesity via peripheral aromatisation in subcutaneous adipose tissue, increase iron availability and facilitate erythropoiesis by suppressing hepcidin production, and increase haematopoietic stem-cell renewal. Nevertheless, oestrogens inhibit hypoxia induced EPO production in animal models and circulating oestradiol was higher in men and post-menopausal women with large HI, which is compatible with the inverse associations of erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts with hip size described in our study.

Although several mechanisms underlying normal and pathological red cell production in the bone marrow have been identified in recent years, little is known about disease-related markers and targets through which prognostication and therapy may be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss novel markers, targets and mechanisms as well as new therapeutic approaches and strategies in various erythroid disorders, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017 (April 28–29). The discussion in this meeting focused on pathological (neoplastic) erythropoiesis in adults. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review.

### Efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy in correcting anemia in men with hypogonadism: a randomized clinical trial [^111BRk61]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Complete blood counts and blood chemistries were measured at baseline, months 6 and 12, and then annually for the duration of the study. The Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire (HIS-Q) with 5 subdomains (sexual, energy, sleep, cognition, and mood), a validated patient-reported measure of symptoms of hypogonadism and response to TRT, was administered at baseline and months 6, 12, 24, and end of study. As reported, adverse events were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and reported for all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of the study drug.

Study Outcomes

The primary outcome of the TRAVERSE Anemia Study was the correction of anemia, defined as an increase in hemoglobin level to 12.7 g/dL or above during the intervention period, among randomized participants who had anemia at baseline. Secondary analyses compared the risk of developing anemia postrandomization in patients who did not have anemia at baseline and the proportions of participants whose hemoglobin increased postrandomization by more than 1.0 g/dL above baseline in those with anemia. Other secondary end points included change from baseline in hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell counts and indices, and energy and cognitive score, ascertained using the energy and cognition domains of HIS-Q. The time to first occurrence of MACE and time to first VTE event were recorded. The study also determined whether the changes in hemoglobin in testosterone-treated men were associated with improvements in energy and cognition in participants with anemia. Total testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and estradiol concentrations were analyzed at all available time points.

### Gender-affirming hormone therapy in the transgender patient: influence on thrombotic risk [^116L8mur]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Research regarding the hematologic sequelae of estrogen and testosterone therapy for transgender people is an emerging area. While estrogen therapy has been widely studied in cisgender women, studies in transgender individuals are limited, revealing variable adverse effects influenced by the dose and formulation of estrogen used. Thrombotic risk factors in transgender and gender-diverse individuals are multifactorial, involving both modifiable and nonmodifiable factors. Management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in individuals receiving gender-affirming estrogen entails standard anticoagulation therapy alongside shared decision-making regarding hormone continuation and risk factor modification. While data and guidance from cisgender women can offer a reference for managing thrombotic risk in transgender individuals on hormone therapy, fully applying these insights can be challenging. The benefits of gender-affirming hormone therapy include significantly reducing the risk of suicide and depression, highlighting the importance of a contemplative approach to the management of hormonal therapy after a VTE event. Although limited, the available data in the literature indicate a low thrombotic risk for transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming testosterone therapy. However, polycythemia is a common adverse effect necessitating monitoring and, occasionally, adjustments to hormonal therapy. Additionally, iron deficiency may arise due to the physiological effects of testosterone or health care providers' use of phlebotomy, an aspect that remains unstudied in this population. In conclusion, while the set of clinical data is expanding, further research remains vital to refine management strategies and improve hematologic outcomes for transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy.

### Different steroids co-regulate long-term expansion versus terminal differentiation in primary human erythroid progenitors [^116jUa9r]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Outgrowth, long-term self-renewal, and terminal maturation of human erythroid progenitors derived from umbilical cord blood in serum-free medium can be modulated by steroid hormones. Homogeneous erythroid cultures, as characterized by flow cytometry and dependence on a specific mixture of physiologic proliferation factors, were obtained within 8 days from a starting population of mature and immature mononuclear cells. Due to previous results in mouse and chicken erythroblasts, the proliferation-promoting effect of glucocorticoids was not unexpected. Surprisingly, however, androgen had a positive effect on the sustained expansion of human female but not male erythroid progenitors. Under optimal conditions, sustained proliferation of erythroid progenitors resulted in a more than 10⁹-fold expansion within 60 days. Terminal erythroid maturation was significantly improved by adding human serum and thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine [T3]) to the differentiation medium. This resulted in highly synchronous differentiation of the cells toward enucleated erythrocytes within 6 days, accompanied by massive size decrease and hemoglobin accumulation to levels comparable to those in peripheral blood erythrocytes. Thus, obviously, different ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptors massively influence the decision between self-renewal and terminal maturation in the human erythroid compartment.

### Bone health management after hematopoietic cell transplantation: an expert panel opinion from the American society for transplantation and cellular therapy [^115wCfa8]. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Gonadal hormone replacement therapy in women — Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) improves BMD and significantly reduces fracture risk; ERT may be considered as first-line osteoporosis therapy in early postmenopausal women, especially in those who have had a hysterectomy and have no risk factors for breast cancer or hypercoagulopathy, but ERT should not be initiated as first-line therapy for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women > 10 years postmenopause; transdermal ERT is preferred owing to lower risks of thromboembolism and stroke; ERT generally stops at natural menopause (~50 years), although benefits of hormonal therapy outweigh risks within the first 10 years postmenopause, so decisions regarding initiation and discontinuation should be individualized.

### Exploring sex-specific hematological changes and their impact on quality of life in patients with prolactinoma [^1119Rn74]. Pituitary (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our large monocentric study is the first to analyze sex-specific differences in RBC parameters in patients with prolactinoma and to explore the potential impact of these hematological changes as well as of PRL and sex hormones changes on QoL. While women did not show significant changes in RBC parameters, men exhibited lower levels of HCT and Hb at initial diagnosis of prolactinoma, independently from the size of the adenoma. Notably, normalization of PRL and testosterone levels in men after treatment with dopamine agonists resulted in increased HCT and Hb. However, our data suggest how the changes in HCT and Hb did not affect the QoL of both women and men, while persistency of hypogonadism significantly impair the QoL of men after PRL normalization.

Considering that anemia has been reported in men with macroprolactinoma, one of the main aims of this study was to determine whether similar alterations could be observed in women with prolactinoma. Despite hyperprolactinemia is frequently associated with hypogonadism, women with prolactinoma did not show any abnormalities in RBC parameters. This was a surprising result considering that estrogen typically plays an important role in iron homeostasis, with elevated estrogen levels being associated with increased systemic iron availability. Additionally, estrogen has a positive effect on erythropoiesis and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in several physiological conditions. Although 63% of the women in our study suffered from secondary hypogonadism, anemia was observed in only 5% of the patients. A possible explanation for this is the compensatory effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS), which in patients with prolactinoma is higher in women than in men. In fact, it has been demonstrated that DHEAS could stimulate the erythropoiesis. However, this remains speculative and requires confirmation through future studies, since the retrospective nature of the current study unfortunately does not allow us to perform this analysis.

### Perioperative care in cardiac surgery: a joint consensus statement by the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) cardiac society, ERAS international society, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [^116VhfiK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Patient blood management program in cardiac surgery — components and transfusion thresholds: Summary Statement: Blood product use and associated outcomes are optimized through the implementation of a comprehensive patient blood management program. Quality of Evidence: Moderate. Components of a PBM program are highlighted in Table 4, organized based on 3 major pillars: (1) preoperative anemia and iron deficiency screening and optimization, (2) minimization of iatrogenic blood loss or hemodilution, and (3) permissive intraoperative and postoperative anemia. A patient blood management program, led by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers, should be part of a comprehensive strategy to avoid unnecessary transfusion, and anemia and iron deficiency assessment and treatment with B12, folate, and intravenous iron preparations, as indicated, is reasonable to reduce blood transfusion; preoperative administration of intravenous iron and/or erythropoietin-stimulating agents is reasonable to increase red cell mass for anemic patients. Intraoperatively, laboratory measurement of antiplatelet drug effect for patients on preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy is reasonable to guide timing of surgery, routine use of intraoperative red blood cell salvage using centrifugation is indicated for blood conservation, and use of a standardized hemostasis checklist during cardiac surgery, before closing, can reduce bleeding and blood transfusion. For transfusion practices, a standardized, restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion protocol is favored in preference to a liberal strategy to reduce transfusion, goal-directed transfusion algorithms that incorporate point-of-care testing, such as with viscoelastic devices, are shown to reduce bleeding and transfusion, and red blood cell transfusion is unlikely to benefit nonbleeding patients with a hemoglobin concentration > 7.5 g/dL.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^111tXU8X]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Pathological erythropoiesis with consequent anemia is a leading cause of symptomatic morbidity in internal medicine. The etiologies of anemia are complex and include reactive as well as neoplastic conditions. Clonal expansion of erythroid cells in the bone marrow may result in peripheral erythrocytosis and polycythemia but can also result in anemia when clonal cells are dysplastic and have a maturation arrest that leads to apoptosis and hinders migration, a constellation typically seen in the myelodysplastic syndromes. Rarely, clonal expansion of immature erythroid blasts results in a clinical picture resembling erythroid leukemia. Although several mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal erythropoiesis and the pathogenesis of related disorders have been deciphered in recent years, little is known about specific markers and targets through which prognosis and therapy could be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss new markers, targets and novel therapeutic approaches in erythroid disorders and the related pathologies, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review, which includes a discussion of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, the updated WHO classification, and an overview of new drugs used to stimulate or to interfere with erythropoiesis in various neoplastic and reactive conditions. The use and usefulness of established and novel erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for various indications, including myelodysplastic syndromes and other neoplasms, are also discussed.

Safety outcomes

Four adverse events were identified during poststudy assessment. All were mild in intensity and considered unrelated to TX-001HR or the reference products. Laboratory test results showed that three women had anemia (considered unrelated to the study), for which they were advised to take supplemental iron, and one woman had an elevated glucose level. Poststudy assessments showed no other clinically significant changes in laboratory values for any of the women. No serious adverse events were reported, and no deaths occurred.

### Donor heart and lung procurement: a consensus statement [^1154KM8K]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Donor heart and lung procurement — hormone replacement therapy and endocrine management — Brain death results in a rapid decline in serum levels of cortisol, anti-diuretic hormone, thyroid hormones, and insulin, and in lung transplantation, high-dose corticosteroid administration is associated with improved oxygenation and increased success rates of lung procurement when compared with controls; to achieve these benefits, methylprednisolone is best administered as soon as brain death is confirmed and the patient declared a potential organ donor, while recent studies suggest that low-dose corticosteroid replacement (e.g., 300 mg hydrocortisone) achieves similar improvements with less hyperglycemia than high-dose methylprednisolone. The use of vasopressin in the treatment of vasoparesis after brain death is well established, and because approximately 80% of donors develop DI, treatment should be considered in patients with polyuria (urine output > 3 ml/kg/hour or 3 liters/day), increased serum osmolality, decreased urine osmolality, and/or hypernatremia (serum Na+ > 145 mmol/liter); the use of desmopressin may be considered in normotensive donors, whereas continuous infusion of low-dose vasopressin titrated to urine output goal < 3 ml/kg/hour decreases urine output although improving MAP, but doses > 2.4 U/hour have been associated with adverse cardiac effects and should be avoided. The role of thyroid hormone replacement remains debated; we conclude that the use of thyroid hormone replacement may be considered for managing low ejection fraction (< 45%) or hemodynamically unstable donors but efficacy remains uncertain, and most resources suggest maintaining blood glucose levels between 4 and 10 mmol/liter (72–180 mg/dl) or per individual institutional protocols.

### Late effects after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for β-thalassemia major: the French national experience [^117MdJCz]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Other complications

Other relevant long-term late effects were encountered. Eleven patients had acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection before transplant and had a positive HCV-RNA after HSCT. At last evaluation, 3 of 11 patients remained positive (2 of 3 did not require antiviral treatment), 7 of 11 became HCV-RNA negative after an antiviral treatment, and one recovered spontaneously. Five patients developed liver complications: 3 had liver fibrosis, one nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and one focal nodular hyperplasia; none of them developed hepatocellular carcinoma. At last visit, only 3 patients still had limited chronic GvHD that did not require any treatment, but another patient developed severe bronchiolitis obliterans. Two patients presented psychiatric disorders (one schizophrenia, one paranoia). No secondary malignancy was recorded. Creatinine levels (n = 99) at a median time of 11 years after transplant were within the normal range for sex and age groups in all patients except for one 14-year old male patient with a chronic kidney disease stage 2 (96 μmoles/L). Another patient with diabetes developed a chronic proteinuria (2 gr/L) without renal insufficiency. Proteinuria was not routinely investigated after transplant in the study population.

Ongoing medication

Half of the patients were on long-term treatment at last evaluation. Hormonal therapy (sex hormone replacement, thyroid hormone or insulin therapy) was prescribed for 34 patients, antibiotic therapy for 17, and cardiac treatment for 2. One patient with mixed chimerism was receiving long-term treatment with erythropoietin. The only patient receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy at last evaluation was treated for auto-inflammatory arthritis.

Serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels

Mean serum ferritin level at last evaluation was 405 μg/L ± 295. Thirty-seven patients were treated with phlebotomy, 7 with chelation therapy, and 11 with both. In multivariate analysis, serum ferritin levels after transplant significantly decreased with time and with the use of phlebotomy/iron chelation therapy. Serum ferritin levels after transplant were higher in older patients and/or in patients with high serum ferritin levels at HSCT (Online Supplementary Table S2).

Median hemoglobin value at last evaluation was 125 g/L (range 86–170 g/L). All patients were free of transfusion, and only one patient received erythropoietin therapy.

### Inflammatory biomarkers, hormone replacement therapy, and incident coronary heart disease… [^113tmAyH]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

levels of either CRP or IL-6, those taking or not taking HRT had similar CHD ORs. In analyses stratified by HRT, we observed a positively graded relationship between plasma CRP levels and the OR for CHD among both users and nonusers of HRT across the full spectrum of baseline CRP. In this analysis, higher baseline plasma levels of CRP and IL-6 appear to be associated with a stepwise increase in odds among both low and high body mass index strata. To evaluate the influence of HRT on markers of inflammation and coronary risk, we first computed the median values of CRP and IL-6 among current users. CRP levels were higher in current users. The CRP values were 55% higher in current users of HRT compared with nonusers in cases and 70% higher in HRT users vs nonusers among controls. To further assess the clinical significance of these findings, we divided. the study population into 6 groups according to HRT status and tertiles of each biomarker.

In matched analyses simultaneously adjusted for conventional coronary risk factors, we found that although increasing levels of CRP and IL-6 were independently associated with a graded increase in risk of CHD among current users and nonusers, the. postmenopausal, US women, demonstrate 3 major findings. First, baseline levels of CRP and IL-6 are independently associated with a 2-fold increase in the risk of developing CHD. Second, although long-term HRT use was associated with increased CRP levels, this effect was not seen for IL-6, suggesting that. mechanisms that may be up-regulated in susceptible individuals. In this regard, a consistent finding has been elevated CRP levels concomitant with either oral unopposed or combined estrogen-progestin therapy. 1–3, 29–31 Although the underlying mechanism of this effect is poorly understood, concurrent evaluation of the effect of HRT on other inflammation-sensitive biomarkers.

suggest that although long-term estrogen replacement therapy is associated with increased CRP, HRT users appear to be at a risk similar to that of nonusers for any level of baseline CRP. In addition, we have shown that despite attenuation of case-control differences in plasma CRP among current users, CRP levels.

### Effects of hormone replacement therapy and antioxidant vitamin supplements on coronary atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women… [^1111az6E]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

The active and placebo HRT groups were well-balanced with respect to baseline characteristics, with the exception of a statistically significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and higher fasting blood glucose levels in the HRT group. The randomization process to active or placebo vitamins resulted in a good balance for all characteristics except for a lower rate of angiotensin-converting. enzyme inhibitor usage and lower levels of serum triglycerides in the active vitamin group. In women assigned to HRT, levels of LDL cholesterol decreased by 18 mg/dL or 9. 5% after randomization. vs 0. 024 mm/y for the HRT placebo group, but the difference was not statistically significant. When results were inputed as the worst possible outcome for those who died or had an intercurrent MI, women in the active HRT group had an increased risk. However, this outcome was partially explained by differences.

### Circulating erythropoietin levels and prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure… [^112p4u6L]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Circulating EPO levels were higher in CHF patients and increased in subjects with higher New York Heart Association scores. Levels of EPO and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide were found to be strong predictors of mortality and CHF hospitalization, whereas C-reactive protein levels predicted CHF hospitalizations but not mortality. The study end points were all-cause mortality, hospitalization due to CHF, or the combined occurrence of each. Patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months. No patients were unavailable for follow-up. A similar trend demonstrating elevated levels of NT-proBNP with rise in the NYHA class was also evident and significant. With respect to CRP levels, although higher levels were observed in higher NYHA classes, the relationship was less statistically robust.

At a cutoff level of EPO above the 75th percentile, patients with values above this threshold exhibited significantly poorer prognosis in terms of all-cause mortality. The predictive power of EPO for detection of subsequent CHF hospitalizations or the combined end point of mortality or CHF hospitalizations during a 2-year follow-up was even more pronounced. We confirmed the findings of elevated EPO serum levels in CHF patients. 15, 16 Moreover, we have found that the severity of CHF as estimated by the NYHA score correlated with the elevation of serum EPO. Next, we assessed the prognostic value of circulating EPO, NT-proBNP, and CRP levels in the study cohort. We have found that there was a significant correlation among serum EPO, NT-proBNP, and CRP levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that activation hormonal and inflammatory processes are reactive to the progression toward more advanced CHF.

Serum EPO level was found to be an independent predictor of mortality and hospitalization in CHF patients and is more accurate than the LVEF. Accordingly, no correlation was found between EPO levels and LVEF, in contrast to the good relation between EPO levels and the NYHA class, suggesting that this humoral factor may be more applicable for assessment of patient prognosis and therapy monitoring in these patients.

### The effect of hormone replacement therapy on cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes… [^117DHT4K]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Total cholesterol concentration decreased by 7% during HRT. For low-density lipoprotein concentration, the mean decrease with HRT was 12%. Apolipoprotein B levels decreased in keeping with the reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. After 6 months, a significant decrease in total cholesterol level was found during treatment with HRT compared with placebo. This reduction in total cholesterol level was due to a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol concentrations with HRT treatment. In keeping with the reduction in LDL cholesterol level, apoB concentrations decreased with HRT treatment. Serum apoA-I concentrations increased significantly, and there was a nonsignificant trend toward an increase in levels of HDL cholesterol and HDL subfractions during treatment with HRT.

Total triglyceride, VLDL triglyceride, and total VLDL levels did not change significantly during HRT treatment compared with placebo. Lipoprotein concentrations decreased significantly during treatment with HRT. Significant reductions were noted in plasma fibrinogen levels with HRT treatment. Although a trend toward a reduction in plasma PAI-1 concentrations was noted, this was not significant. The increase in apoA-I levels seen in our study supports the belief that HRT has a favorable effect on HDL concentrations. Apolipoprotein A-I is located on the surface of HDL and plays a central role in the transfer of free cholesterol from tissues and other lipoproteins. 20 Apolipoprotein A-I also appears to protect lipoproteins from potentially atherogenic oxidative damage. In nondiabetic women, oral HRT increases plasma triglyceride levels primarily by increasing the production of large VLDL.

In diabetic women, however, combined HRT in the present study and estrogen-only therapy in 2 previous studies11, 12 did not alter plasma triglyceride concentrations. The mechanism for this lack of effect on triglyceride levels is unclear; however, it may be related to an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Hemostatic factors have an important role in determining cardiovascular risk. Our results show that combined HRT reduces fibrinogen and Lp concentrations in postmenopausal diabetic women. Fibrinogen, PAI-1, and Lp concentrations have all been shown to be independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

### Gonadorelin and erythropoiesis… [^114b4p9G]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Halvorsen1 and Feldman et al2 have reported that neurohumoral stimuli resulted in the release of erythropoietin. We recently noted that the number of peripheral reticulocytes increased up to 42% after transnasal administration of 5 mg of gonadorelin acetate and gradually decreased to normal levels by the end of the next two weeks. Circulating RBC counts increased as well. Four other volunteers were then tested in the same way, and serum erythropoietin levels were measured using a commercial kit. Serum erythropoietin levels increased considerably in three of five tested subjects. Sternalgia was noted in these subjects 30 minutes after gonadorelin inhalation and continued for one week. Our results suggest that gonadorelin may be a potent stimulator for secretion of erythropoietin and may influence erythropoiesis.

The regulation of erythropoietin release is influenced by several hormones, such as testosterone, adrenocorticoids, prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid hormone. Hashimoto T, Miyai K. Gonadorelin and Erythropoiesis. Arch Intern Med. 1981;
