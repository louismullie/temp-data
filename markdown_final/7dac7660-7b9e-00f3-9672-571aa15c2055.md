## Question

How many positive integers less than 2019 are divisible by either 18 or 21, but not both?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many positive integers less than 2019 are divisible by either 18 or 21, but not both. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total count of numbers divisible by 18 or 21 using inclusion–exclusion. Then, I should verify the count of numbers divisible by both 18 and 21, which is the same as divisibility by their least common multiple. Next, I will subtract the overlap to get the symmetric difference, and finally, I should double-check the arithmetic and edge cases to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the inclusion–exclusion framework. The count of positive integers less than 2019 divisible by 18 or 21 equals the count divisible by 18 plus the count divisible by 21 minus the count divisible by both, to avoid double-counting the intersection. Mathematically, that is |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|, where A is divisibility by 18 and B is divisibility by 21 [^notfound].

> I will now examine the count divisible by 18. The largest multiple of 18 less than 2019 is 2016, which is 18 × 112, so there are 112 such numbers. Wait, let me verify the floor division: floor(2018 ÷ 18) = 112, so yes, 112 numbers are divisible by 18 and less than 2019 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the count divisible by 21. The largest multiple of 21 less than 2019 is 2016, which is 21 × 96, so there are 96 such numbers. Hold on, I should verify: floor(2018 ÷ 21) = 96, so that is correct [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check the intersection, i.e., numbers divisible by both 18 and 21. That is the same as divisibility by the least common multiple of 18 and 21. Let me calculate the LCM: 18 = 2 × 3² and 21 = 3 × 7, so LCM(18, 21) = 2 × 3² × 7 = 126. The largest multiple of 126 less than 2019 is 2016, which is 126 × 16, so there are 16 such numbers. I should confirm: floor(2018 ÷ 126) = 16, which is correct [^notfound].

> Applying inclusion–exclusion, the total divisible by 18 or 21 is 112 + 96 − 16 = 192. But wait, the question asks for numbers divisible by either 18 or 21, but not both, which is the symmetric difference. So I should subtract the intersection once more from the union to get the exclusive count: 192 − 16 = 176. Let me reconsider to ensure I'm not off by one anywhere; the logic holds because the symmetric difference is (A ∪ B) minus (A ∩ B), which is exactly 192 − 16 = 176 [^notfound].

> Final answer: 176 positive integers less than 2019 are divisible by either 18 or 21, but not both.

---

The number of positive integers less than 2019 that are divisible by either 18 or 21, but not both, is **176**. This is found by calculating the count of numbers divisible by 18 or 21 and subtracting the count divisible by both, using the inclusion–exclusion principle and the least common multiple of 18 and 21.

---

## Step 1: Calculate the number of integers divisible by 18

The largest multiple of 18 less than 2019 is 2016, so the count is:

⌊[2018/18]⌋ = 112

---

## Step 2: Calculate the number of integers divisible by 21

The largest multiple of 21 less than 2019 is 2016, so the count is:

⌊[2018/21]⌋ = 96

---

## Step 3: Calculate the number of integers divisible by both 18 and 21

The least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 21 is 126, so the count is:

⌊[2018/126]⌋ = 16

---

## Step 4: Apply the inclusion–exclusion principle

The count of integers divisible by either 18 or 21 is:

112 + 96 − 16 = 192

---

## Step 5: Subtract the intersection to find the count divisible by either 18 or 21, but not both

192 − 16 = 176

---

The final answer is **176**.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^a1429634]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Screen positive results and cell-free DNA screening — test selection, counseling, and confirmation are outlined: if a patient chooses screening for aneuploidy, only one screening approach should be used, and cell-free DNA screening should not be sent concurrently with other screening; all laboratory-based screening tests are not diagnostic tests, and patients with a positive screening test result for fetal aneuploidy should undergo genetic counseling and a comprehensive ultrasound evaluation with an opportunity for diagnostic testing to confirm results. Because of inherent limitations, screening test results should not be the sole basis on which to make critical clinical decisions. For cell-free DNA, the positive predictive value is affected by population prevalence and disorder type, and lower individual risk in younger women increases the likelihood that a positive screening test result is a false positive; because the prevalence of trisomies 18 and 13 is much lower than trisomy 21, their positive predictive value is less. The positive predictive value can be calculated individually for each patient and some laboratories do not report it; online calculators are available to help determine the chance that a positive cell-free DNA result will be confirmed. In patients with a screen positive analyte or cell-free DNA result with abnormal fetal sonographic findings, the concern for a chromosomal abnormality is increased but not confirmed, and confirmatory testing with CVS or amniocentesis is recommended.

### Improving residency matching through computational optimization [^0f749f98]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Final data analyses were performed in April 2025. The residency optimizer was implemented using mixed-integer linear programming. The mixed-integer linear programming solver takes the following inputs: (1) a p × n matrix f, that represents the sum of the applicant and program rank preferences, and (2) constraints. For the residency matching problem, p and n are the number of programs and applicants, respectively. The solver determines the p × n match matrix x that minimizes the sum of element-wise multiplied f and x, subject to the constraints. Element x ij is 1 if applicant j matched to program i, and 0 otherwise. The constraints are that (1) no applicant matches more than 1 program, and (2) no program matches more their number of available spots.

To compare the residency optimizer directly with Gale-Shapley, f was chosen to be the sum of the applicant ranks and normalized program ranks. Normalized program ranks are the raw program ranks divided by the number of program spots, which makes programs of different sizes more equitable. For example, an applicant ranking a program second and a 5-spot program ranking an applicant 10th should have the same amount of impact in the optimizer, since in effect the program ranked the applicant among its second tier of candidates. Similarly, a 6-spot program ranking an applicant 18th and a 3-spot program ranking an applicant ninth will have the same normalized rank of 3.

Truncation Analyses

The robustness of residency optimizer and Gale-Shapley to shorter rank lists, and thereby fewer interviews for applicants and programs, was analyzed by truncating the rank lists of programs and applicants from 2011 to 2019. Rank lists were truncated from 0% to 95%, in incremental steps of 5%. For example, a truncation level of 10% for programs would remove the bottom 10% of ranks from each program rank list, while applicant rank lists were not truncated. Similarly applicant lists were truncated while leaving program lists unchanged. Finally, both applicant and program rank lists were truncated. The Gale-Shapley and residency optimizers were then applied to the truncated rank lists. The fraction of positions filled was computed for each truncation level for both algorithms.

Fellowship Matching

The residency optimizer was developed on the 2011 to 2019 ophthalmology residency match data. It was applied to the 10 years (2011–2020) of ophthalmology fellowship match data, without any modifications to the algorithm.

### Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity [^ff9759ff]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

So far in the examples with our algorithm, we used halved areas (Aₙ = A₀/2ⁿ for integer n ≥ 0). Even though the uncertainty is mostly defined by the largest area, and the range by the smallest, the middle areas are important for reaching the lowest uncertainty (see Fig. 3c: they partake in the optimal combination). Adding more areas at integer multiples of the smallest area decreases the uncertainty, though slightly (see Supplementary Note 4).

Algorithm measurement

In Fig. 2b, measurement results of our algorithm in the steep region are plotted (for details of the measurement see Supplementary Note 5), together with the Heisenberg limit (which is only true for a small range and infinite T 2) and the approximate large-range limit explained in Supplementary Note 3. As mentioned before, and just like in Fig. 3d, the focus is on the scaling that originates from the algorithm, hence all overhead time is ignored. Our algorithm is very close to the limit, as could be expected since at long measurement times most time is spent on the sequence with the largest area. Moreover, our results scale approximately as, which is less steep than the Heisenberg-like scaling of, since our algorithm keeps approaching this limit.

When merely halving areas in a measurement sequence, its range is defined by the smallest area. Therefore, it would only improve the uncertainty with respect to the standard single-area measurement, but not the range. In this way, given a limit on the time delay between the π/2-pulses, for example owing to a maximum time resolution or waiting time requirements, the maximum range is restricted. However, the range of our algorithm is the inverse of the greatest common divisor of the frequencies in measured signal of all included areas (see Supplementary Note 6). For halved areas, since all larger areas are integer multiples of the smaller ones, this means that the greatest common divisor is the lowest frequency, thus the one related to the smallest area. To increase the range beyond this limit, we combine areas that are not integer multiples of each other. When purely looking at the range, combining two sequences for slightly different areas increases the range far beyond the standard measurement's range. Thus in principle, the range can be extended unlimitedly. Adding the large areas as well, it is still possible to get arbitrarily close to the ultimate uncertainty (for details see Supplementary Note 6).

Figure
Cases of invasive meningococcal disease, by academic year, England, 2015–2020. Men, meningococcal conjugate vaccine (by serogroup).

IMD cases declined after the national COVID-19 lockdown on March 23, 2020, and remained low during April–August 2020. During 2018–19, PHE received 12,628 clinical samples from patients with suspected IMD; of these, 462 (4%) tested positive for N. meningitidis. These totals were 9,968 specimens, 401 (4%) positive, during 2019–20 (21% fewer cases). During April–August 2020, a total of 50 (1.8%) of 2,808 samples tested positive for N. meningitidis, compared with 134 (2.7%) of 5,025 samples during the same period in 2019 (p = 0.016). Combining culture-confirmed and PCR-confirmed cases, IMD incidence was 75% lower (IRR 0.25, 95% CI 0.18–0.35) during April–August 2020 than during April–August 2019 (Table). In contrast, IMD incidence during September 2019–March 2020 (the 7 months before national lockdown) was similar to that for September 2018–March 2019 (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91–1.23). Declines were observed for all age groups and serogroups. During lockdown, compared with the same period during the previous year, MenB was overrepresented (33/45 [73%] vs. 104/179 [58%] cases), whereasMenW (5/45 [11%] vs. 42/179 [23%] cases) and MenY (0/45 [0%] vs. 16/179 [9%] cases) were underrepresented.

Furthermore, non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) for trisomy 13, 18, 21, as a contingent test following positive DS screening test result would be implemented in the public healthcare system in 2019. This would lead to reduction in invasive prenatal testing for those who had false positive DS screening test result due to conventional screening method. The cost for diagnosis by implementing CMA as primary test thus is anticipated to be even lowered.

### Brain systems involved in arithmetic with positive versus negative numbers [^ba404315]. Human Brain Mapping (2014). Low credibility.

Positive number arithmetic is based on combining and separating sets of items, with systematic differences in brain activity in specific regions depending on operation. In contrast, arithmetic with negative numbers involves manipulating abstract values worth less than zero, possibly involving different operation-activity relationships in these regions. Use of procedural arithmetic knowledge, including transformative rules like "minus a negative is plus a positive", may also differ by operand sign. Here, we examined whether the activity evoked in negative number arithmetic was similar to that seen in positive problems, using region of interest analyses (ROIs) to examine a specific set of brain regions. Negative-operand problems demonstrated a positive-like effect of operation in the inferior parietal lobule with more activity for subtraction than addition, as well as increased activity across operation. Interestingly, while positive-operand problems demonstrated the expected addition > subtraction activity difference in the angular gyrus, negative problems showed a reversed effect, with relatively more activity for subtraction than addition. Negative subtraction problems may be understood after translation to addition via rule, thereby invoking more addition-like activity. Whole-brain analyses showed increased right caudate activity for negative-operand problems across operation, indicating a possible overall increase in usage of procedural rules. Arithmetic with negative numbers may thus shows some operation-activity relationships similar to positive numbers, but may also be affected by strategy. This study examines the flexibility of the mental number system by exploring to what degree the processing of an applied usage of a difficult, abstract mathematical concept is similar to that for positive numbers.

### Epidemiological and virological characteristics of respiratory tract infections in children during COVID-19 outbreak [^c91d72b7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparing positive cases of respiratory virus infections during the epidemic period with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019

During the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of completed tests for respiratory viruses declined significantly. From February to April, 2020, monthly number of completed tests for respiratory viruses was 2596, 2182 and 2227, respectively, which was lower than that in 2018 (21,490, 9731, 4816) and 2019 (18,317, 19,761, 17,025) (Fig. 2 a).

Fig. 2
Distribution of positive cases of respiratory viruses from January to April 2018–2020. a: The number of completed tests for respiratory viruses. b: Distribution of positive cases of ADV, FluA, FluB, RSV from January to April in 2018, 2019 and 2020

From January to April in 2020, ADV positive cases were 1853, 170, 95 and 94 respectively, which were lower than those in the same periods of 2018 (1484, 1151, 928, 737) and 2019 (3145, 1896, 1812, 2258) (Fig. 2 b).

During the study period, FluA positive cases in 2020 were 6412, 39, 13 and 13, respectively. In February-April 2020, FluA positive cases were much lower than those in 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 2 b).

During the study period, FluB positive cases in 2020 were 5565, 178, 34 and 8, respectively, which continued to decline. In February-April 2020, FluB positive cases were much lower than those in 2018 (Fig. 2 b). At the beginning of 2020, FluB positive cases were relatively higher than those in 2019, but kept declining since the epidemic of COVID-19 in February (Fig. 2 b).

From January to April in 2020, RSV positive cases were 2531, 114, 19 and 2, respectively. RSV positive cases from February to April in 2020 were lower than those in 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 2 b).

### Simple autonomous agents can enhance creative semantic discovery by human groups [^1b515d9a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Target and decoy nouns

We defined a target noun as the noun with the highest point value. Participants were incentivized to search for a target noun that we selected from the list of 20,000 nouns. A target noun had a point value of 20,000, and a noun that was semantically most similar to the target noun had a point value of 19,999. A noun that was semantically most distant from the target noun had a point value of 1. Thus, the point values of the 20,000 nouns ranged from 1 to 20,000. To prevent participants from making predictions about how many words were more valuable than the current guess, we multiplied the point values of each word in each game by a random number between 1 and 3 and then rounded this product to the nearest integer before displaying it on the game screen. Accordingly, the point values could exceed 20,000 depending on the multiplication factor. Thus, participants were told before the game that the highest possible point value for a noun may vary across games. For clarity, this was meant to prevent participants from utilizing meta-strategies when playing the game. But when discussing ranks in the paper, we do not multiply them. To avoid potential biases caused by using only one target noun in the experiment, we selected 18 different nouns from different semantic clusters as target nouns and randomly used one of them in each game. See Supplementary Methods for details.

### Using the number needed to treat in clinical practice [^646ae153]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is gaining attention as a method of reporting the results of clinical trails with dichotomous outcome measures. The NNT is defined as the number of patients who would need to be treated, on average, with a specific intervention to prevent 1 additional bad outcome or to achieve 1 desirable outcome in a given time period. Because it reports outcomes in terms of patient numbers, it is extremely useful to clinicians for making decisions about the effort expended with a particular intervention to achieve a single positive outcome. This special communication describes the NNT statistic and its utility for choosing clinical interventions.

### Too many digits: the presentation of numerical data [^a41454ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Thus a decimal places rule that ignores significant digits does not work. But equally, and perhaps surprisingly, a significant digits rule that ignores decimal places does not always work either. Reporting risk ratios to three significant digits for example leads to the largest ratio below 1 being reported as 0.999 and the smallest above 1 as 1.01, with three and two decimal places, respectively. This is clearly unsatisfactory as they differ in precision by a factor of ten. In this instance a combination of significant digits and decimal places, the rule of four, works best: round the risk ratio to two significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is four or more, otherwise round to three.

The rule of four gives three decimal places for risk ratios from 0.040 to 0.399, two from 0.40 to 3.99 and one from 4.0 to 39.9. Applying it to the example of 22.68 above gives 22.7 (95% CI 7.5 to 74). Alternatively one can apply the rule with one less significant digit, giving 23 with CI 8 to 70.

Another example is the reporting of test statistics such as t or F. Specifying one decimal place would permit say t = 30.1, where 30 is clearly sufficient as it is so highly significant. Conversely specifying two significant digits would permit t = −0.13, where again the extra precision is irrelevant as it is far from significant. A suitable rule specifies up to one decimal place and up to two significant digits.

When comparing group means or percentages in tables, rounding should not blur the differences between them. This is the basis for the Hopkins two digits rule, whereby the mean has enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the SD. An analogous rule for percentages might be to use enough decimal places to ensure two significant digits for the range of values across groups, eg, if the range is 10% or more use whole numbers, if less than 1% use two decimal places, and otherwise one. In practice percentages are usually given along with their corresponding frequencies, so precision is less critical as the exact values can be calculated.

### Prevaccination prevalence of type-specific human papillomavirus infection by grade of cervical cytology in Estonia [^5e2d7b97]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Large-scale data on type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and disease burden worldwide are needed to guide cervical cancer prevention efforts. Promoting the research and application of health care big data has become a key factor in modern medical research.

Objective

To examine the prevaccination prevalence of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) and type distribution by cervical cytology grade in Estonia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study used text mining and the linking of data from electronic health records and health care claims to examine type-specific hrHPV positivity in Estonia from 2012 to 2019. Participants were women aged at least 18 years. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2021 to August 2022.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Type-specific hrHPV positivity rate by cervical cytological grade.

Results

A total of 11 017 cases of cervical cytology complemented with data on hrHPV testing results between 2012 and 2019 from 66 451 women aged at least 18 years (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [21.0] years) were included. The most common hrHPV types were HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 51 and 52, which accounted for 73.8% of all hrHPV types detected. There was a marked decline in the positivity rate of hrHPV infection with increasing age, but the proportion did not vary significantly based on HPV type. Implementation of nonavalent prophylactic vaccination was estimated to reduce the number of women with high-grade cytology by 50.5% (95% CI, 47.4%-53.6%) and the number with low-grade cytology by 27.8% (95% CI, 26.3%-29.3%), giving an overall estimated reduction of 33.1% (95% CI, 31.7%-34.5%) in the number of women with precancerous cervical cytology findings.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, text mining and natural language processing techniques allowed the detection of precursors to cervical cancer based on data stored by the nationwide health system. These findings contribute to the literature on type-specific HPV distribution by cervical cytology grade and document that α-9 phylogenetic group HPV types 16, 31, 33, 52 and α-7 phylogenetic group HPV 18 are the most frequently detected in normal-to-high-grade precancerous lesions in Estonia.

### AGA institute rapid review and recommendations on the role of pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing and endoscopy [^4d371e1b]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing — estimating local asymptomatic prevalence for interactive Summary of Findings (iSOF) input uses a stepwise method drawing on recent case counts and population data. The steps are to visit the COVID Tracking Project, look up the state, obtain cumulative cases as of two dates 14 days apart, subtract to get new cases in the past 14 days, adjust for asymptomatic infections by multiplying by 10, obtain the state population from the US Census Bureau, and divide adjusted cases by population to yield the estimated prevalence in the asymptomatic population; this approach is informed by models indicating 10 asymptomatic or undiagnosed individuals per diagnosed symptomatic patient and by using cases from the past 2 weeks, and it cautions that the proportion of positive tests alone should not be used to assess prevalence.

### Notes from the field: testing for nonprescribed fentanyl and percentage of positive test results among patients with opioid use disorder-United States, 2019–2020 [^ab74614d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

The numbers of specimens tested among patients receiving and not receiving MOUD declined 65% and 72%, respectively, during March 29–April 11, 2020 (weeks 14–15), compared with the same weeks in 2019. During September–December 2020 (weeks 35–52), the numbers of specimens tested among patients receiving and not receiving MOUD were 43% and 13% lower, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019.

In the first 2 full weeks of January 2019, before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 9.6% of specimens from patients receiving MOUD tested positive for nonprescribed fentanyl; the percentage testing positive approximately doubled by the end of 2019 (weeks 51–52) to 26.7% (Figure). During 2020, positive test result rates were highest during March 29–April 11 (weeks 13–14) when the percentage of positive test results peaked at 40.5%. Despite the decline in volume during this period, the overall demographic proportions of patients receiving drug testing remained similar (3), suggesting that substantial shifts in the patient demographics were not driving the increase. During April 26–May 9, 2020 (weeks 17–18), the percentage of positive test results declined to 24.3% and continued to decline during September–December 2020 (weeks 35–52; range = 11.9%–18.5% positive per week), levels considerably lower than the corresponding period during 2019 (range = 18.5%–26.7% per week). Among patients not receiving MOUD, the prevalence of positive nonprescribed fentanyl test results did not increase significantly during the early pandemic months compared with that in 2019 (Figure). A limited but significant increase during the second half of 2020 (weeks 27–52; range = 1.4%–1.8%) was observed, compared with the corresponding period during 2019 (range = 1.1%–1.7%).

### The three numbers you need to know about healthcare: the 60-30-10 challenge [^d6cb22ab]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Healthcare represents a paradox. While change is everywhere, performance has flatlined: 60% of care on average is in line with evidence- or consensus-based guidelines, 30% is some form of waste or of low value, and 10% is harm. The 60-30-10 Challenge has persisted for three decades.

Main Body

Current top-down or chain-logic strategies to address this problem, based essentially on linear models of change and relying on policies, hierarchies, and standardisation, have proven insufficient. Instead, we need to marry ideas drawn from complexity science and continuous improvement with proposals for creating a deep learning health system. This dynamic learning model has the potential to assemble relevant information including patients' histories, and clinical, patient, laboratory, and cost data for improved decision-making in real time, or close to real time. If we get it right, the learning health system will contribute to care being more evidence-based and less wasteful and harmful. It will need a purpose-designed digital backbone and infrastructure, apply artificial intelligence to support diagnosis and treatment options, harness genomic and other new data types, and create informed discussions of options between patients, families, and clinicians. While there will be many variants of the model, learning health systems will need to spread, and be encouraged to do so, principally through diffusion of innovation models and local adaptations.

Conclusion

Deep learning systems can enable us to better exploit expanding health datasets including traditional and newer forms of big and smaller-scale data, e.g. genomics and cost information, and incorporate patient preferences into decision-making. As we envisage it, a deep learning system will support healthcare's desire to continually improve, and make gains on the 60-30-10 dimensions. All modern health systems are awash with data, but it is only recently that we have been able to bring this together, operationalised, and turned into useful information by which to make more intelligent, timely decisions than in the past.

### The global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal infection in adults in 2020: a modelling analysis [^31034d69]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Background

Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of meningitis in adults living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The estimates of national, regional, and global burden of cryptococcal meningitis are essential to guide prevention strategies and determine needs for diagnostic tests and treatments. We present a 2020 estimate of the global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal infection (antigenaemia), cryptococcal meningitis, and cryptococcal-associated deaths.

Methods

We defined advanced HIV disease as adults with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/μL, as this group is at highest risk for cryptococcosis. We used UNAIDS estimates (2019–20) and population-based HIV impact assessment surveys (2016–18) to estimate the number of adults with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/μL at risk for cryptococcosis, by country and region. Secondly, we summarised cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence in those with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/μL by reviewing published literature. Thereafter, we calculated the number of cryptococcal antigen (CrAg)-positive people in each country and region by multiplying the number with advanced HIV disease at risk for cryptococcal infection by the cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence of the respective country or region. We estimated progression from cryptococcal antigenaemia to meningitis or death based on estimates from the published literature.

Findings

We estimated that there were 4·3 million (IQR 3·0–4·8) adults with HIV and CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/μL globally in 2020. We calculated a mean global cryptococcal antigenaemia prevalence of 4·4% (95% CI 1·6–7·4) among HIV-positive people with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells/μL, corresponding to 179000 cases (IQR 133000–219000) of cryptococcal antigenaemia globally in 2020. Annually, we estimated that there are 152000 cases (111000–185000) of cryptococcal meningitis, resulting in 112000 cryptococcal-related deaths (79000–134000). Globally, cryptococcal disease accounts for 19% (13–24) of AIDS-related mortality.

Interpretation

Despite a reduction in the estimated absolute global burden of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis compared with 2014, likely to be due to antiretroviral therapy expansion, cryptococcal disease still accounts for 19% of AIDS-related deaths, similar to 2014 estimates. To end cryptococcal meningitis deaths by 2030, cryptococcal diagnostics, meningitis treatments, and implementation of preventive screening are urgently needed.

### Clinicopathologic features of 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology / college of American pathologists fluorescence in situ hybridization group 3 breast carcinoma (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 chromosome 17 centromere ratio [^ae6b702b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists 2018 update of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing guideline includes a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) group with a HER2 to chromosome 17 centromere (CEP17) ratio less than 2.0 and HER2 copy number 6.0 or greater (group 3), which requires integrated review of HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Objective —

To assess the clinicopathologic features of group 3 patients and determine features associated with HER2-positive status after workup.

Design —

Cases submitted for HER2 FISH between January 2019 and June 2022 were identified, and relevant clinicopathologic information was obtained.

Results —

One hundred forty-two HER2 FISH cases (1.6%) were group 3. In 52 cases (36.6%) IHC was negative (0/1+), in 3 (2.8%) IHC was positive (3+), and in 86 (60.6%) IHC was 2+. Annotated IHC 2+ slides were recounted by a second reviewer in targeted areas, where 16 of 86 (18.6%) had a HER2:CEP17 ratio less than 2.0 and a HER2 copy number of 4.0 or greater to less than 6.0 (HER2 negative). After combined IHC/FISH review, 74 of 142 (52.1%) were classified as HER2 positive. HER2 copy number/cell was higher in HER2-positive compared with HER2-negative cases after the workup. The extent and intensity of staining in IHC 2+ cases did not correlate with the level of gene amplification. Twenty percent of HER2-positive patients achieved pathologic complete response.

Conclusions —

About half of group 3 cases were classified as HER2 positive after additional workup. Pathologic complete response rates in HER2-positive cases were lower than expected for group 1 (HER2:CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0; HER2 copy number ≥ 4.0) patients. IHC-targeted FISH recounts may be redundant and may potentially lead to classification of some patients as HER2 negative, resulting in withholding of targeted therapy.

### Role of molecular biomarker human papilloma virus (HPV) E6 oncoprotein in cervical cancer screening [^606cbbfc]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Onco E6™ Cervical Test, based on detection of the E6 oncoprotein of HPV 16 and 18 genotypes is evaluated as a screen for the early detection cervical neoplasia in resource-limited countries.

Methods

This prospective study from June 2018 to June 2019 evaluated 235 women aged 21–65 years, who came to Gynaecological Oncology Outpatient Department by VIA, cytology, E6 oncoprotein test and by colposcopy. Screen-positive women by any of the tests or women with suspicious findings were further evaluated by biopsy at colposcopy. The McNemar test was used to compare the performance of E6 oncoprotein test with other screening tests.

Results

The E6 oncoprotein positivity rate was 6.8% (n = 16) with 81.25% HPV 16 positive and 18.75% HPV 18 positive. Among VIA positive cases (n = 100), E6 oncoprotein was positive in 9% (p < .001). In histopathology confirmed chronic cervicitis, CIN I, CIN II, CIN III and invasive cervical cancer, E6 test was positive for 2.8%, 4.7%, 25%, 50% and 100% respectively. E6 oncoprotein test had the highest specificity and Positive Predictive Value (PPV; 97% and 75%) compared to VIA (42% and 18%), cytology (95% and 46%) and colposcopy (94% and 59%). Sensitivity of the E6 oncoprotein test for detection of CIN3+ was significantly higher than that of cytology (52% VS 25%) but lower than that of VIA (52% VS 74%).

Conclusions

The HPV E6 oncoprotein test is highly specific and is an effective triage test to reduce colposcopy referrals for the large number of false positive test outcomes seen with VIA.

### Increasing yield also increases false positives and best serves to exclude GERD [^30667f15]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple diagnostic tests always improve diagnostic yield. However, with the addition of more true positives come more false positives. Therefore, positive predictive values likely decrease with additional testing. We show this is true even when no gold standard exists to verify the dual testing's sensitivity and specificity.

### Distribution of transmission potential during nonsevere COVID-19 illness [^02eb65ec]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often continue to test positive for the causative virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) even after clinical recovery, thereby complicating return-to-work plans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate transmission potential of COVID-19 by examining viral load with respect to time.

Methods

Health care personnel (HCP) at Cleveland Clinic diagnosed with COVID-19, who recovered without needing hospitalization, were identified. Threshold cycles (Ct) for positive PCR tests were obtained and viral loads calculated. The association of viral load with days since symptom onset was examined in a multivariable regression model, which was reduced by stepwise backward selection to only keep variables significant at a level of .05. Viral loads by day since symptom onset were predicted using the model and transmission potential evaluated by examination of a viral load-time curve.

Results

Over 6 weeks, 230 HCP had 528 tests performed. Viral loads declined by orders of magnitude within a few days of symptom onset. The only variable significantly associated with viral load was time since onset of symptoms. Of the area under the curve (AUC) spanning symptom onset to 30 days, 96.9% lay within the first 7 days, and 99.7% within 10 days. Findings were very similar when validated using split-sample and 10-fold cross-validation.

Conclusions

Among patients with nonsevere COVID-19, viral loads in upper respiratory specimens peak by 2 or 3 days from symptom onset and decrease rapidly thereafter. The vast majority of the viral load-time AUC lies within 10 days of symptom onset.

### Child mortality in england during the COVID-19 pandemic [^3d393372]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

While the overall prevalence of child deaths with a positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in England is higher than estimated by others, many of the positive tests were performed in cases without recognised symptoms of COVID-19, so direct COVID-19 mortality cannot be assumed. In addition, many children were not tested for SARS-CoV-2. In total 1.6% of children dying during the lockdown period we examined were known to be SARS-CoV-2 positive around the time of their death, while a small additional number presented with one of the recognised syndromes associated with SARS-CoV-2 (eg, paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2) but with a negative PCR. However, in contrast to emerging data on the mortality seen in adults, this national analysis demonstrates no measurable excess mortality in children under 18 years, consistent with other work reporting on an earlier epoch of the UK lockdown. We did see an increased risk of a positive COVID-19 test in older children; and in those from BAME backgrounds, consistent with other work. However, in contrast to adult data, we did not see a higher prevalence of underlying medical conditions in those children who died with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a measurable impact of sex on mortality. Indeed, there is some evidence in this work that dying from an underlying medical condition was less frequent during the second period of lockdown than a comparable period in 2019. This may be due to the unique nature of SARS-CoV-2 in younger children, or that social distancing and shielding was effective in this group. Indeed, overall child mortality between April and December 2020 is 8% lower than the corresponding period in 2019 and further work is needed to identify the reasons for this. Finally, concerns have been raised that social disruption caused by the lockdown (eg, overcrowded accommodation or those experiencing financial insecurity) might lead to increased unexpected infant deaths or increased deaths from child abuse. Our findings with the data collected thus far do not support these concerns. Children with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had similar deprivation measures to those with a negative test.

### Positive job search experience for new pathologists seeking first employment between 2017 and 2019 [^478afab6]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Context —

An aging population calls for an adequate response in the workforce of medical professionals. The field of pathology has seen a downward trend in numbers of graduating US allopathic medical students choosing the specialty. Concerns about the job market after residency and fellowship graduation may be a contributing factor.

Objective —

To provide an update on the trends emerging from a survey of pathology graduates' job search experience for their first nonfellowship position.

Design —

Data from an annual job search survey sent by the College of American Pathologists Graduate Medical Education Committee between 2017 and 2019 to College of American Pathologists junior members and fellows in practice 3 years or less actively looking for a nonfellowship position was analyzed. Various indicators of the job search experience were compared year to year and with the previously published 2012 to 2016 benchmark data.

Results —

Analysis revealed positive trends between the 2017 to 2019 data and the 2012 to 2016 benchmark data, including participants' perceiving more ease in finding a position, improved availability of jobs in their subspecialty choice, and higher ratings of satisfaction with the position accepted, as well as a greater proportion of respondents finding a position within 6 months of initiating their job search.

Conclusions —

The job market for pathology residents and fellows looking for their first nonfellowship position has improved with respect to multiple indicators, such as ease of finding a position, length of job search, and satisfaction with the position accepted when comparing 2017 to 2019 data with the 2012 to 2016 benchmark data.

### Exploratory analyses in aetiologic research and considerations for assessment of credibility: mini-review of literature [^b1afc8bf]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Consideration 3: do not base judgments on significance values only

Only reporting the results of analyses that provided a P value below the prespecified α level (eg, 0.05) is discouraged throughout all scientific disciplines (for example, as discussed in a 2019 supplementary issue of The American Statistician). Avoiding selective reporting based on significance values is particularly relevant to exploratory findings because the statistical properties of exploratory tests are less well known than those of confirmatory tests. For example, the expected number of false positives (that is, the type I error rate) is probably increased when the choice for a statistical test was based on pattens in the observed data. Although procedures have been developed for correction of multiple testing in confirmatory settings, consensus on how to prevent false positive findings in exploratory settings has not yet been established.

Increasing the number of exploratory analyses, without correction for multiple testing, raises the risk of deriving false positive conclusions, but too strict corrections for multiple testing increases the probability of false negative findings (that is, the type II error rate). A raised type II error rate could occur, for example, when an analysis of various positively correlated hypotheses is corrected for multiple testing as if all of the hypotheses were independent (eg, by applying a Bonferroni correction). The decision to statistically correct for multiple testing depends, among other issues, on the total number of tests performed in the same dataset, correlation between the hypotheses being tested, and sample size. Reporting each of these considerations clarifies the analytical context of findings and helps to assess the credibility of the results. This form of reporting is in line with the STROBE-MRand STREGAchecklists which recommend stating how multiple comparisons were managed, although recommendations for the handling of multiple testing seem more established in genome-wide association studies than in clinical aetiologic cohort studies.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 226 — serum analyte screening versus cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening and counseling — states that a patient's baseline risk should not limit testing options and that these options "should be discussed and offered to all patients regardless of maternal age or risk for chromosomal abnormality". Cell-free DNA is characterized as "the most sensitive and specific screening test" for trisomies 21, 13, and 18 and "can be performed any time after 9–10 weeks of gestation". Counseling "should include the possibility of incidental findings" such as maternal aneuploidy, mosaicism, or malignancy, and if fetal sex determination is elected, the risk of maternal and fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy should be discussed. Serum analyte screening also screens for fetal anomalies in the first and second trimesters, indirectly identifies other chromosomal abnormalities, and second-trimester screening provides a risk for open fetal defects. In a general-population series of 15,841 patients (mean maternal age 30.7 years), cfDNA had a lower false-positive rate (0.06% vs 5.4%) and a higher PPV (80.9% vs 3.4%) than first-trimester screening. A randomized trial of 1,366 patients with normal ultrasound at 11 to 13 weeks found first-trimester screening had a 2.5% false-positive rate, while cfDNA had a 1.5% no-call rate. A retrospective study of 66,166 patients reported first-trimester screening sensitivity of 89.6% with a 2.9% screen positive rate versus cfDNA sensitivity of 100% with a 2.4% screen positive rate when no-calls were counted as positive. Sequential screening identified more chromosomal abnormalities including other aneuploidies, mosaicism, or large deletions or duplications than cfDNA; diagnosis of these aneuploidies requires diagnostic testing, and if cfDNA is used as follow-up screening these abnormalities would not be detected. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of any major chromosomal abnormality detected on prenatal or postnatal diagnostic testing after a low risk screening result.

### Guidance on community viral load: a family of measures, definitions, and method for calculation [^b1513dd5]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Table 1b — Minimum sample size for detecting geometric mean (GM) ratio k with α = 0.05 and W = 0.9 — presents required sample sizes by standard deviation (S) strata and defines parameters; α is significance level, W is power, GM is geometric mean, and S is standard deviation, noting that 1.2 is the standard deviation of national viral load (VL) data. Each jurisdiction will need to assess the standard deviation of their local VL data and then determine the appropriate sample size needed to assess VL, and if the sample size is inadequate to meet the recommended case inclusion criterion, an alternate method may need to be used, such as combining multiple years of data. For k = 3, sample sizes across S = 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 are 75, 91, 108, 127, 147, 169, and Table 1b uses power = 90%; jurisdictions may also explore differences in means of viral loads, including categorical differences in the proportion with undetectable or very low VL.

### Point-of-care tests detecting HIV nucleic acids for diagnosis of HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection in infants and children aged 18 months or less [^0ac891e2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the strength of the evidence

We summarized the main findings from the review, reporting the numbers of true‐positives, true‐negatives, false‐positives, and false‐negatives per 1000 tested in a summary of findings table (Bossuyt 2013). GRADE for Diagnostic Test Accuracy reviews is still under development (Gopalakrishna 2014). Rather than following any formal process for downgrading the evidence, we planned to fully describe the following concepts, which constitute an assessment of the strength of the evidence.

Precision of study estimates.
Heterogeneity in study findings.
Risk of bias.
Concerns about applicability.
Indirect test comparisons.

These issues cover the key domains of GRADE (except publication bias) and would allow the evidence to be included in a GRADE assessment should a guideline developer wish to do so.

### Developing a clinical prediction score: comparing prediction accuracy of integer scores to statistical regression models [^91dd14ad]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Researchers often convert prediction tools built on statistical regression models into integer scores and risk classification systems in the name of simplicity. However, this workflow discards useful information and reduces prediction accuracy. We, therefore, investigated the impact on prediction accuracy when researchers simplify a regression model into an integer score using a simulation study and an example clinical data set. Simulated independent training and test sets (n = 1000) were randomly generated such that a logistic regression model would perform at a specified target area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7, 0.8, or 0.9. After fitting a logistic regression with continuous covariates to each data set, continuous variables were dichotomized using data-dependent cut points. A logistic regression was refit, and the coefficients were scaled and rounded to create an integer score. A risk classification system was built by stratifying integer scores into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk tertiles. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by calculating the AUC and index of prediction accuracy (IPA) for each model. The optimism in performance between the training set and test set was calculated for both AUC and IPA. The logistic regression model using the continuous form of covariates outperformed all other models. In the simulation study, converting the logistic regression model to an integer score and subsequent risk classification system incurred an average decrease of 0.057–0.094 in AUC, and an absolute 6.2%-17.5% in IPA. The largest decrease in both AUC and IPA occurred in the dichotomization step. The dichotomization and risk stratification steps also increased the optimism of the resulting models, such that they appeared to be able to predict better than they actually would on new data. In the clinical data set, converting the logistic regression with continuous covariates to an integer score incurred a decrease in externally validated AUC of 0.06 and a decrease in externally validated IPA of 13%. Converting a regression model to an integer score decreases model performance considerably. Therefore, we recommend developing a regression model that incorporates all available information to make the most accurate predictions possible, and using the unaltered regression model when making predictions for individual patients. In all cases, researchers should be mindful that they correctly validate the specific model that is intended for clinical use.

### Oxygenation index in the first three weeks of life is a predictor of bronchopulmonary dysplasia grade in very preterm infants [^87397cb5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of variables

Birth weight (BW) was converted to a birth weight z-score (BW-Z) using the 2013 Fenton sex-specific growth charts. Gestational age (GA) in completed weeks was included in the multinomial regression analysis. Each blood gas report had an associated timestamp, which was used to calculate the day of life (DOL). One DOL was defined as a 24-h interval beginning at birth. Decimal points were allowed when calculating DOL in trajectory modeling. DOL as an integer was used for the multinomial regression analysis. Dexamethasone administration data was obtained from the medication administration records. Infants were considered to have received dexamethasone if the medication was given for 10 days or more. The average daily OI change rate (DOI AVG) for each infant was calculated as follows: Step 1 — calculate the mean OI for the first and last DOLs for which OI data was available; Step 2 — calculate the difference between the first and last mean OI values; Step 3 — divide the difference in mean OI by the total number of DOLs (full days) between the two mean OI values. Those infants with only one mean OI value were excluded, as it was impossible to calculate DOI AVG. BPD grade was determined at 36 weeks PMA based on respiratory support following the publication by Jensen et al. in 2019. In brief, nasal cannula support of ≤ 2 L per minute (LPM) was classified as Grade 1, nasal cannula support of > 2 LPM or non-invasive positive pressure support was classified as Grade 2, and invasive positive pressure support is classified as Grade 3. Throughout this report, Grade 1 was considered Low-Grade, whereas Grades 2 and 3 were considered High-Grade.

### Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Arkansas over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic [^04b53149]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that by the end of April 2021, approximately 25% of children in Arkansas had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The seroprevalence was much higher than the total number of confirmed cases which on April 28, 2021, was 11% for the total population of Arkansas (335 288 positive cases according to the Arkansas Department of Health, population of 3 011 524 according to 2019 census data). This finding strongly suggests that those children had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and are likely to have at least some natural immunity. Conversely, our findings indicate that most children in Arkansas likely have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain susceptible to infection. Although COVID-19 was less severe in children than adults early in the pandemic, the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in May 2021 dramatically increased infection and hospitalization rates, including among those below 18 years of age. Developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a severe inflammatory disorder that results from a current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, is also a risk for those below 18 years. Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates combined with a highly susceptible pediatric population led us to predict that SARS-CoV-2 would spread rapidly in schools and daycares as in-person learning resumed, which was indeed the case. More children infected with SARS-CoV-2 led to an increase in the number of severe COVID-19 and MIS-C cases, and a rise in pediatric deaths.

### Using the COVID-19 to influenza ratio to estimate early pandemic spread in wuhan, China and Seattle, US [^c521ccbb]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. Twenty-one days later, the US identified its first case — a man who had traveled from Wuhan to the state of Washington. Recent studies in the Wuhan and Seattle metropolitan areas retrospectively tested samples taken from patients with COVID-like symptoms. In the Wuhan study, there were 4 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 7 influenza positives out of 26 adults outpatients who sought care for influenza-like-illness at two central hospitals prior to January 12, 2020. The Seattle study reported 25 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 442 influenza positives out of 2353 children and adults who reported acute respiratory illness prior to March 9, 2020. Here, we use these findings to extrapolate the early prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle.

Methods

For each city, we estimate the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza infections from the retrospective testing data and estimate the age-specific prevalence of influenza from surveillance reports during the same time period. Combining these, we approximate the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections.

Findings

In Wuhan, there were an estimated 1386 [95% CrI: 420–3793] symptomatic cases over 30 of COVID-19 between December 30, 2019 and January 12, 2020. In Seattle, we estimate that 2268 [95% CrI: 498, 6069] children under 18 and 4367 [95% CrI: 2776, 6526] adults were symptomatically infected between February 24 and March 9, 2020. We also find that the initial pandemic wave in Wuhan likely originated with a single infected case who developed symptoms sometime between October 26 and December 13, 2019; in Seattle, the seeding likely occurred between December 25, 2019 and January 15, 2020.

Interpretation

The spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle was far more extensive than initially reported. The virus likely spread for months in Wuhan before the lockdown. Given that COVID-19 appears to be overwhelmingly mild in children, our high estimate for symptomatic pediatric cases in Seattle suggests that there may have been thousands more mild cases at the time.

### Quality indicators for the care and outcomes of adults with atrial fibrillation [^0666d026]. Europace (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation quality indicators — evidence synthesis and selection process included a systematic review restricted to English full-text publications between 1 January 2014 and 5 October 2019 and eligible studies of adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with atrial fibrillation (AF) that explicitly reported at least one quality indicator (QI) or outcome measure with specifications from randomized controlled trial (RCT) or registry full-texts. Candidate QIs were classified as structural, process, or outcome measures, each with a detailed definition to facilitate evaluation. A modified Delphi process was used: measures were rated on a 9-point ordinal scale where 1 to 3 signified not valid, 4 to 6 uncertain, and 7 to 9 valid; QIs were included if ≥ 75% ranked them 7 to 9 and excluded if ≥ 75% ranked them 1 to 3. Indicators not meeting these thresholds advanced to a second round using a 3-point scale with the same ≥ 75% agreement cut-off, followed by a final binary 'yes' or 'no' round to confirm agreement.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Clinical characteristics and risk factors of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients with false-negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid [^14b780a0]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study investigates the clinical and imaging characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with false-negative nucleic acids. Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, including 19 cases of nucleic acid false-negative patients and 31 cases of nucleic acid positive patients, were enrolled. Their epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory examination data and imaging characteristics were analyzed. Risk factors for false negatives were discussed. Compared with the nucleic acid positive group, the false-negative group had less epidemiological exposure (52.6% vs 83.9%; P = 0.025), less chest discomfort (5.3% vs 32.3%; P = 0.035), and faster recovery (10 [8, 13] vs 15 [11, 18.5] days; P = 0.005). The number of involved lung lobes was (2 [1, 2.5] vs 3 [2, 4] days; P = 0.004), and the lung damage severity score was (3 [2.5, 4.5] vs 5 [4, 9] days; P = 0.007), which was lighter in the nucleic acid false-negative group. Thus, the absence of epidemiological exposure may be a potential risk factor for false-negative nucleic acids. The false-negative cases of COVID-19 are worth noting because they have a risk of viral transmission without positive test results, lighter clinical manifestations, and less history of epidemiological exposure.

### Firearm-related injuries and deaths in children and youth [^e44172f5]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Homicide — Evidence on children and youth indicates associations between stronger firearm laws and lower homicide metrics, with specific findings from reviews and individual studies. In general, states with stronger firearm laws were associated with lower firearm homicide rates; a 2017 systematic review concluded stronger firearm legislation was associated with decreased firearm homicide rates, and laws strengthening background checks with permit-to-purchase requirements were associated with decreased firearm homicide rates. A 2019 scoping review concluded CAP laws were not associated with decreased firearm homicide. States with stronger firearm laws were also associated with a decreased likelihood of firearm carrying by youth, defined as having carried a firearm on at least 1 day in the prior 30 days. Regarding age-limit policies, 1 study found raising the minimum age from 18 to 21 years for handgun purchase and/or possession was not associated with a lower rate of firearm related homicides perpetrated by young adults, while 1 study found states with negligence CAP laws had an associated 15% decreased rate of firearm homicides.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^65b49a36]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 226 — ultrasonographic screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: Nuchal translucency (NT) alone to modify age-related trisomy 21 risk has a detection rate that is approximately 70%, and a NT measurement alone does not add benefit in detecting aneuploidy when cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening has been performed in a singleton gestation. As isolated markers, the absence of the nasal bone shows 49% sensitivity with a 1% false-positive rate and an abnormal ductus venosus waveform shows 67% sensitivity with a 5% false-positive rate for trisomy 21. For structural anomalies, all patients should be offered a second-trimester ultrasound for fetal structural defects, ideally performed between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation (with or without second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein). If a soft marker is identified on the anatomic survey, the patient's medical record should be reviewed to determine if aneuploidy screening has been performed previously; if not, it should be offered, and if screening has been performed, the finding should be placed in context with those results. Soft ultrasonographic markers are nonspecific findings that are generally not pathologic but are more common among fetuses with trisomy 21 or trisomy 18.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — evidence synthesis and certainty assessment details include that a member of the review team completed data extraction with a standardized form and IDSA panel members served as a second reviewer with no major discrepancies. For each study, sensitivity and specificity were calculated and the Clopper–Pearson method was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals. Accuracy estimates were pooled with a random-effects bivariate binomial model via the glmer function of the lme4 package in R (version 4.1.2), and analyses including fewer than5 studies used a fixed effects model in the meta package in R (version 4.1.2). Forest plots summarized individual and pooled estimates and subgroup analyses explored heterogeneity. To estimate absolute effects across plausible prevalence values, sensitivity and specificity were applied to calculate true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, using 1%, 5%, and 10% pre-test probability to mirror community prevalence in asymptomatic persons. Risk of bias for diagnostic accuracy studies used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool, and overall certainty was assessed with the GRADE framework across the domains of risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias, with summary of findings tables developed in GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool.

### Out-of-hospital deaths among children during COVID-19 pandemic: indicator of collateral damage? [^89a4df6d]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2020). High credibility.

The institutional research committee approved the study protocol (§24/2020). There was no patient and public involvement.

There were four out-of-hospital deaths in 2 months in 2020 compared with eight in the preceding 12 months (table 1). All were separate incidents. Three (2.7%) of the 113 children contacting the paediatric EDs for infectious symptoms were positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA.

Table 1
Characteristics of the EMS contacts with children (age 0–15 years) leading to on-scene death during the local peak of the pandemic (1 March 2020 to 30 April 2020) and the previous 12 months (1 March 2019 to 29 February 2020)

The prevalence of COVID-19 in children requiring ED care for infectious symptoms was low, but the number of sudden out-of-hospital deaths was noticeable. These findings do not justify advising families with acutely ill children to avoid paediatric ED contacts in order to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Sudden out-of-hospital deaths in children are extremely rare, and thus it is difficult to find statistically significant differences for short periods. We find the increase in out-of-hospital deaths noteworthy, especially during a period when children were less exposed to for example, traffic hazards following social distancing measures. In addition, the overall number of EMS contacts with children decreased by 18.0% compared with the previous 12 months. These findings may suggest that the concern about seriously ill children presenting late during the pandemic is justifiable. Unfortunately, we cannot give detailed information about the causes of deaths, as the children could be identifiable.

Both our cohorts were small but regionally inclusive. As paediatric mortality or intensive care admissions due to COVID-19 have not been reported in Finland, we feel that the increase in sudden paediatric out-of-hospital deaths deserves further attention, and there is a need for more studies on the effects of the control measures on the health and welfare of children.

### Imaging pediatric acute appendicitis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: collateral damage is variable [^62cdbcb9]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a worldwide pandemic in March 2020, many authors have noted the collateral damage on non-COVID-19-related illnesses. These indirect effects of the pandemic have resulted in people presenting later and with more severe stages of disease, even if their diagnoses are not directly related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Objective

We studied these indirect effects of COVID-19 on the imaging workup and outcomes for pediatric patients at our center who had acute appendicitis during the pandemic.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of cases in children ≤ 18 years who were evaluated for acute appendicitis during the same period, March 1 to May 31, in both 2019 and 2020. We compared demographic and clinical data as well as surgical and pathological findings, and we graded imaging findings according to severity. Differences in patient outcomes were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Pearson chi-square test.

Results

The total number of pediatric patients evaluated with imaging for acute appendicitis dropped by 43% between 2019 and 2020 (298 vs. 169), but the total number of children treated remained similar (59 vs. 51). There was proportionate use of US and CT in each timeframe but a higher percentage of positive imaging findings in 2020 (50/169, 29.6% vs. 56/298, 18.7% in 2019, P = 0.04). There were more imaging examinations with features of complicated appendicitis among positive cases (9/51, 18% vs. 5/59, 8% in 2019, P = 0.08) and more pathologically proven perforated cases during the pandemic (14/51, 27% vs. 6/59, 10% in 2019, P = 0.11), although these results did not reach statistical significance. There were no changes in surgical management, vital signs, laboratory values, length of stay or complication rates.

Conclusion

There was a large drop in the number of pediatric patients imaged for acute appendicitis during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic despite similar numbers of patients treated. The utilization trends of US vs. CT remained stable between time periods. The differences in imaging findings and perforation rates were less pronounced compared to other published studies.

### Revisiting "how many steps are enough? " [^1c927d3d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

With continued widespread acceptance of pedometers by both researchers and practitioners, evidence-based steps/day indices are needed to facilitate measurement and motivation applications of physical activity (PA) in public health. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reprise, update, and extend the current understanding of dose-response relationships in terms of pedometer-determined PA. Any pedometer-based PA guideline presumes an accurate and standardized measure of steps; at this time, industry standards establishing quality control of instrumentation is limited to Japan where public health pedometer applications and the 10,000 steps.d slogan are traceable to the 1960s. Adult public health guidelines promote ≥ 30 min of at least moderate-intensity daily PA, and this translates to 3000–4000 steps if they are: 1) at least moderate intensity (i.e., ≥ 100 steps.min); 2) accumulated in at least 10-min bouts; and 3) taken over and above some minimal level of PA (i.e., number of daily steps) below which individuals might be classified as sedentary. A zone-based hierarchy is useful for both measurement and motivation purposes in adults: 1) < 5000 steps.d (sedentary); 2) 5000–7499 steps.d (low active); 3) 7500–9999 steps.d (somewhat active); 4) ≥ 10,000–12,499 steps.d (active); and 5) ≥ 12,500 steps.d (highly active). Evidence to support youth-specific cutoff points is emerging. Criterion-referenced approaches based on selected health outcomes present the potential for advancing evidence-based steps/day standards in both adults and children from a measurement perspective. A tradeoff that needs to be acknowledged and considered is the impact on motivation when evidence-based cutoff points are interpreted by individuals as unattainable goals.

### Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the COVID-19 pandemic significantly decreased the spread of enterovirus in children [^49eb406c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Precise prevention and control measures have been adopted to impede the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. This study was performed to investigate the effect of protective measures on gastrointestinal infection in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data on the rotavirus and adenovirus antigen tests were collected in outpatient children due to gastroenteritis from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, at the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. According to age and month distribution, the positive number and rate of rotavirus and adenovirus in 2020 were compared with 2019. A 3.8-fold and 4-fold reduction in the number of rotavirus- and adenovirus-positive patients in 2020 were found, respectively. The overall positive rate of rotavirus and adenovirus infection was drastically decreased in 2020 (rotavirus 2020: 18.18% vs. 2019: 9.75%, p < 0.001; adenovirus 2020: 3.13% vs. 2019: 1.58%, p < 0.001). The proportions of rotavirus and adenovirus in all age groups in 2020 decreased compared with those in 2019. The highest frequency of rotavirus infection occurred among children aged 1–3 years both in 2019 and 2020 (2019: 27.95% vs. 2020: 17.19%, p < 0.001), while adenovirus infection was detected in children aged 3–5 years, which had the highest percent positivity (2019: 8.19% vs. 2020: 4.46%; p < 0.001). An obvious peak prevalence of rotavirus incidence was found during December-April, and the percent positivity of rotavirus significantly decreased in 2020 (December 2019: 24.26% vs. 2020: 8.44%, p < 0.001; January 2019: 40.67% vs. 2020: 38.18%, p < 0.05; February 2019: 40.73% vs. 2020: 15.04%, p < 0.001; March 2019: 31.47% vs. 2020: 7.88%, p < 0.001; April 2019: 15.52% vs. 2020: 4.78%, p < 0.001). The positive rate of adenovirus distributed throughout 2019 was 1.91%-4.86%, while the percent positivity during 2020 in the same period was much lower (0.00%-3.58%). Our results confirmed that the preventive and control measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic and the collateral benefit of these interventions have significantly decreased the transmission of rotavirus or adenovirus.

### Shared genomic segment analysis with equivalence testing [^274e1ecb]. Genetic Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2 ESTIMATING POSITIONS OF CANDIDATE DOMINANT DISEASE VARIANTS

In our approach, we focus on dominantly inherited disease variants and estimate their positions with a recently developed method, HA (Imai‐Okazaki et al. 2019), but the approach developed here is rather general. Briefly, DNA variants in the vicinity of a rare dominant trait variant tend to show a heterozygote excess (Klein et al. 1998). In fact, if f is the minor population allele frequency of a variant in the immediate vicinity of an inherited dominant trait variant (population heterozygosity = 2 f [1 – f]), then variants in the immediate vicinity of the dominant trait variant tend to be heterozygous with probability P(H) > 1 – f (Imai‐Okazaki et al. 2019). Thus, the discrepancy in heterozygosity for variants far from versus close to a dominant trait variant is particularly striking for small f.

To accommodate variants with varying heterozygosity, we work with a "window" of (2 m + 1) adjacent variants, that is, we consider a given DNA variant and the m variants on either side of it. Average heterozygosity, H, is then computed as h /(g + h), where g and h are numbers of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes at the (2 m + 1) variants, respectively. A suitable value is m = 50, but our implementation of HA dynamically determines optimal values of m (Imai‐Okazaki et al. 2019; PH program). We slide such a window of variants, one variant at a time, from one end to the other of each chromosome. Thus, except for m variants at chromosome ends, there are as many H values as DNA variants.

As inherited dominant disease variants tend to be surrounded by DNA variants with increased heterozygosity, the next step is to determine, for each individual, runs of increasing heterozygosity up to a maximum, H max, followed by variants with decreasing heterozygosity. While the number of H values can be several million, only a few dozen of such runs and associated H max values tend to emerge and known disease variants are generally found close to one of the H max positions. Details are provided in our previous publication (Imai‐Okazaki et al. 2019). As outlined in the next section, here we only work with H max values (however many occur for an individual) and consider their positions as candidate disease variant locations for that individual.

### Women's representation in emergency medicine journals across two decades: 2000–2019 [^e84168c4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary aim was to determine women's representation as authors in emergency medicine journals in various authorship positions over the last 20 years. The secondary aim was to compare the two decades to analyze the development over time.

Method

We conducted a retrospective bibliometric analysis of three emergency medicine journals from the online archives of 2000–2019.

Results

We analyzed a total of 7939 original research and review articles. Female authorships at the first (25,8%), last (18,7%), and corresponding (21,6%) positions were limited, despite the relatively high presence rate (72,5%). Women authored 13,1% of all single-authored publications. When the number of authors increased, the odds for women as co-authors increased. However, the odds for last and corresponding authorship decreased, while the odds for the first authorship remained unchanged. When two decades were compared, we found that proportions of women as first and corresponding authorship increased ([23,8% vs. 27,0%] p = 0.001 and [20,0% vs. 22,6%] p = 0.228, respectively) while the representation as the last author remained unchanged ([19,4% vs 18,3%] p = 0.006). The presence of women in any authorship position also increased significantly ([66,1% vs. 76,5%] p = 0.000) across two decades, with similar trends for the different journals studied. However, the yearly analysis shows that women's representation follows a fluctuating pattern with a minimal increase. When analyzing specific journals, we found that the increase in female authors as first and corresponding authors was limited to Academic Emergency Medicine ([24,7% vs 34,5%] p = 0.000 and [21,4% vs 32,1%] p = 0.000).

Conclusions

Results of this study are promising in showing that the representation of women in emergency medicine publications is rising during the recent decade. Although the academic gender gap has not been closed, steps taken for gender equality in academic emergency medicine are clearly notable.

### Cycle threshold values as indication of increasing SARS-CoV-2 new variants, england, 2020–2022 [^4b8912ed]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Emergence of Alpha

From September 1, 2020, through January 31, 2021, daily S− test results (proxy Alpha) rose from 1 to 6,487, peaking at 22,936 on January 2, 2021. Sequencing of 169,823 (4.7%) of 3,617,137 viruses over this period showed that 78,410 (46.2%) were Alpha (Appendix Table 1). With the growth of Alpha, the daily mean Ct value for S− tests decreased from 26.1 on September 1, 2020, to 19.6 on December 20, 2020.

At that time, we were not using ISR in real time, but as we implemented the approach in mid-2021, we detected the first break point in mean daily Ct values in S− tests on November 22, 2020 (and it took 14 days for the ISR model to notice this break point), which was ≈6 days before incidence increased further. The drop in Ct value, if observed in real time, could have provided an early indicator of the Alpha increase. Retrospectively, we detected a break point for the plateau/increase in Ct values on December 24, 2020 (noticed 32 days later), and the peak in positive tests 11 days later on January 4, 2021 (noticed 16 days later) (Figure 3).

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^04f11ca9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — study selection and reference standard rules are described as follows: studies reporting diagnostic test accuracy were included, and when comparing different tests in the same population, direct comparative test accuracy studies were used; for this analysis, studies were excluded if all patients did not receive all tests. Exclusions also encompassed index tests without EUA or CE status or with unconfirmed EUA/CE due to lack of test name reporting, studies with fewer than 30 patients/samples, machine learning studies, protocols, incomplete test accuracy information, atypical sample site collection, uncommonly available assays, and studies comparing two RT-PCR component kits. Patients were presumed truly positive for SARS-CoV-2 if an assay provided a positive result for at least one target gene. In direct comparative test accuracy studies, each test was treated as the index test and the combination of tests served as a reference standard, with examples stating that if one of four tests were positive the patient would be considered negative, whereas if two out four tests were positive the patient would be considered positive. For comparisons of self versus healthcare provider sample collection, any single positive result was considered the reference standard, and if the sample was positive by self-collection only, it was considered positive and became part of the total positive samples for sensitivity calculation.

### Indication of measures of uncertainty for statistical significance in abstracts of published oncology trials: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d1de4b98]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

There is growing consensus that reliance on P values, particularly a cutoff level of .05 for statistical significance, is a factor in the challenges in scientific reproducibility. Despite this consensus, publications describing clinical trial results with P values near .05 anecdotally use declarative statements that do not express uncertainty.

Objectives

To quantify uncertainty expression in abstracts describing the results of cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with P values between .01 and .10 and examine whether trial features are associated with uncertainty expression.

Data Sources

A total of 5777 prospective trials indexed on HemOnc.org, as of September 15, 2019.

Study Selection

Two-arm RCTs with a superiority end point with P values between .01 and .10.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Abstracts were evaluated based on an uncertainty expression algorithm. Ordinal logistic regression modeling with multiple imputation was performed to identify whether characteristics of study design, results, trial authors, and context P values were normalized by dividing by prespecified α value.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Uncertainty expression in abstracts as determined by the algorithm and its association with trial and publication characteristics.

Results

Of 5777 trials screened, 556 met analysis criteria. Of these, 222 trials (39.9%) did not express uncertainty, 161 trials (29.0%) expressed some uncertainty, and 173 trials (31.1%) expressed full uncertainty. In ordinal logistic regression with multiple imputation, trial features with statistically significant associations with uncertainty expression included later year of publication (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.24–2.32; P < .001), normalized P value (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.67; P = 0.003), noncooperative group studies (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.12–2.63; P = 0.01), and reporting an end point other than overall survival (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01–1.96; P = 0.047). Funding source, number of authors, journal impact tier, author nationality, study of unapproved drugs, abstract word count, whether the marginal end point was a primary or coprimary end point, and effect size (in subgroup analysis) did not have statistically significant associations with uncertainty expression.

Conclusions and Relevance

Published oncology articles with marginally significant results may often incompletely convey uncertainty. Although it appears that more uncertainty is expressed in recent abstracts, full uncertainty expression remains uncommon, and seemingly is less common when reporting overall survival, results with P values lower than α levels, and cooperative group studies.

European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2019). High credibility.

Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy with [111In]DTPA-pentetreotide — interpretation, quantification, pitfalls, and diagnostic accuracy is summarized as follows: Pathological uptake is considered to represent somatostatin receptor (SSTR) binding when seen on scintigrams at the two standard imaging time points. For quantification, the optimal time interval after injection is 24 h or more, tumour uptake is scored according to the Krenning scale using liver and spleen as reference organs, and a modified Krenning score has also been applied to single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) but is not necessarily equivalent, particularly for small hepatic lesions. Pitfalls include false-positive findings from renal parapelvic cysts, accessory splenic tissue, or abdominal hernia; uptake by neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) or other tumours expressing SSTR subtype 2 (SSTR2); and overexpression of SSTR2 in activated lymphocytes and macrophages that can yield false positives in granulomatous and/or inflammatory diseases. False-negative findings can occur with small HNPGLs and abdominal PGLs. Regarding diagnostic accuracy, [111In]DTPA-pentetreotide scintigraphy is superior to [131I/123I]MIBG scintigraphy for HNPGLs, with sensitivity of 79–100% and 18–50%, respectively; it may provide complementary information to [123I]MIBG for detection of HN and metastatic PGLs, although the diagnostic performance of both single-photon agents has been shown to be inferior to that of other PET/CT procedures.

### Trends in the incidence of pulmonary nodules in chest computed tomography: 10-year results from two Dutch hospitals [^50a19a0d]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results on patient level

In hospitals A and B, 74,803 unique patients underwent a chest CT scan between 2008 and 2019 (Table 1). From these patients, 40,440 patients were examined in hospital A and 34,363 patients in hospital B (Table 1). The total number of patients who underwent a chest CT scan doubled from 6845 in 2008 to 13,286 in 2019 (Table 3). The total number of patients with a positive finding increased from 2595 (38%) in 2008 to 6654 (50%) in 2019. In Fig. 3, this trend is visualized and compared with the total annual number of patients who underwent a chest CT scan. For positive findings with a minimum nodule diameter of 5 mm, the total number of patients with a positive finding tripled from 994 (15%) in 2008 to 3108 (23%) in 2019. The mean age of patients who underwent a chest CT scan linearly increased from 58.1 ± 15.2 years in 2008 to 62.6 ± 14.3 years in 2019.

### Developing emergency medicine leaders: the AACEM / SAEM chair development program at 10 years [^4fb40af3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2
CDP class sizes and male/female composition, 2019–2023.

Overall, participants' academic positions at the time of CDP enrollment were similar in the second cohort to the first cohort, with 50%–60% each year being vice chairs or associate chairs in academic departments of EM. The percentage of enrollees who were chairs or interim chairs at entry to the program was 20% in the 2019–2023 cohort compared with 19% in the 2014–2018 cohort. There were more division directors, residency program directors, and clinical emergency department directors in the 2019–2023 cohort than the 2014–2018 cohort. At entry to the program 50% of CDP 2019–2023 survey respondents were associate professors and 43% were professors. A higher percentage of men (47.1%) than women (30.6%) indicated that their academic rank was professor (χ²(1) = 2.0, p = 0.16.) By the time of completion of the survey in 2024, the overall percentage of professors in this group of survey respondents had increased to 66% but was lower in women (61%) than in men (70%). The percentage of survey respondents who were chairs at the time of the post‐CDP survey was lower among women (22%) than men (38%).

The percentage of participants in this cohort who have become chairs during or after completing the CDP was 17%. In the previous 5‐year cohort it was 29% at a similar time point. Some survey respondents assumed non‐EM chair leadership positions with five reporting that they were associate deans for graduate medical education (GME) at their institutions and/or designated institutional officers (DIO) for GME. One reported being an associate DIO and another reported being an assistant dean for clinical applications.

For those survey respondents who were not chairs at the time of the survey, 25 of 70 (36%) responded "yes" to the question: "Have you pursued a chair position or positions where the result was that you were not selected for the position you had applied for?" A higher percentage of men (41.2%) than women (30.6%) indicated that they had an unsuccessful chair application, but this difference was not statistically significant (χ²(1) = 3.4, p = 0.18).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to provocative testing, AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend to use BMI-appropriate GH cut-points for glucagon stimulation test to reduce the possibility of misclassifying GH-sufficient patients because increased BMI is associated with decreased glucagon-induced GH stimulatory effect. Use the GH cut-point of 3 mcg/L in patients with normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m²) and overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m²) with a high pretest probability, and a lower GH cut-point of 1 mcg/L in patients with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) and overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m²) with a low pretest probability.

### Preschool children with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic: fewer infections, less wheezing [^526aef03]. The Journal of Asthma (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A few studies have already investigated preschool children with asthma during the pandemic. The purpose of this research was to investigate how preschool children with asthma were affected by the precautionary measures adopted during the pandemic.

Methods

Preschool children with asthma aged 18–60 months evaluated in our clinic in March-May 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic, were included in the study. The lockdown continued during March, April, and May 2020. The questionnaires and asthma symptom control tests for preschool children with asthma in 2019 and 2020 were then evaluated.

Results

Sixty-three preschool children with asthma, 37 boys and 26 girls, aged 18–60 months (median 47) were included in the study. The median number of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), and the use of antibiotics were significantly lower in 2020 than 2019 (p < .01). The median numbers of the pediatric emergency department (PED) visits and hospitalizations were also lower in 2020 than in 2019 (p < .05). In 2019, 31 children with asthma were well controlled, 28 were partly controlled, and 4 were uncontrolled, compared to 58 well controlled, four partly controlled, and one uncontrolled in 2020 (p < .01).

Conclusions

Preschool children with asthma have been positively affected in terms of PED admission, hospitalization, and asthma symptom control in association with the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown measures. This study revealed that wheezing decreased significantly in the absence of respiratory infection in preschool children with asthma. Namely, fewer infections meant less wheezing.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a 2019 evidence analysis center evidence-based practice guideline [^2b39eae3]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2021). High credibility.

Energy intake evidence in COPD — A total of nine studies were included in the evidence analysis supporting the recommendation. There was improvement in dyspnea scores with higher energy intakes, with less robust evidence supporting a beneficial relationship with functional status, healthcare utilization or duration of illness. Respiratory symptoms (three studies): all three studies found significant associations with dyspnea scores. Functional status (one study): the study found a significant association with activities of daily living scores. Healthcare utilization (one study): the study found a significant association with number of infections requiring antibiotics. Duration of illness (one study): the study found a significant association with duration of disease in years. Findings for the impact of energy intake on exacerbations, quality of life (QoL), weight status and body composition were mixed, with the majority supportive of an association; one study did not find an association with number of ER visits due to AEs when energy intakes of either 1.7 x or 1.3 x Harris-Benedict Equation (HBE), illustrating that energy intake targets studied included 1.7 x HBE and 1.3 x HBE.

Fig. 2
Finite OSC test space.

Left panel: Chemical space network (CSN) representation of the finite OSC test space of 65.552 unique molecules generated by exhaustive application of all morphing operations up to 14 times. Each molecule is surrounded by morphing-related analogs (see text). Benzene as the smallest base molecule is colored in blue. All other molecular nodes are colored according to their fitness function F as calculated at the semi-empirical density-functional tight-binding level. 2438 red nodes form the target discovery group of top-performing molecules with high fitness F ≥ −0.2. Right panel: Example molecules from the top-performing group, chosen randomly from different areas of the CSN to illustrate the structural diversity contained in the test space.

The finite test space contains a total of 2438 top-performing molecules with a high fitness F ≥ −0.2. As a quantitative benchmark, we thus measure the discovery success S (N) as the fraction of these molecules that are identified after the descriptors of N molecules have been queried. With 179 queries used for the initialization, see above, the final measure S (5179) thus evaluates the discovery success after n = 50 learning steps when using N batch = 100. Supplementary Fig. 6 compiles the corresponding success curves S (N), when systematically combining N batch = 50, 100, or 200 with κ values in half-integer steps between 0 and 5, as well as for a search depth of one- or two-time exhaustive application of all morphing operations. Fortunately, we find the AML search to be highly robust with respect to the choice of N batch and κ. Only a small variation of 0.71 < S (N = 5179) < 0.80 is obtained over all tested combinations for a search depth of one, meaning that 70–80% of the top-performing molecules are consistently found after descriptors for less than 8% of the entire test space have actually been computed. For a search depth of two, this success rate becomes slightly higher, reaching up to 85% as compiled in Supplementary Fig. 7. Generally, larger batch sizes seem to implicitly increase the explorative behavior, such that an almost indistinguishably optimum performance is obtained for larger N batch in combination with successively smaller exploration weights κ in the acquisition function, cf. Eq. (2). For too small κ, the success curves become stepped though, indicating that temporarily the mainly exploitative algorithm then only meanders through identified sub-pockets of the test space. Too large κ, on the other hand, diminish the initial success of a then too explorative algorithm in the first learning steps. Overall, an intermediate value pair (N batch, κ) = (100, 2.5) thus provides a robust setting and is henceforth employed in all AML runs. For these values of (N batch, κ), we also performed a sensitivity analysis with regard to the employed weight vector w in Eq. (1) and the bond radius in the Morgan fingerprints used to assess molecular similarity. The results are summarized in Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9, respectively, and again demonstrate a high robustness with respect to these parameters.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task Force on Clinical practice guidelines [^690de969]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — ASCVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and in the United States it is the leading cause of death with an estimated cost of > $200 billion annually in healthcare services, medications, and lost productivity. Most Americans who have had a myocardial infarction had unfavorable levels of at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor before their ASCVD event. The AHA's model of ideal cardiovascular health, referred to as Life's Simple 7, is presented, and an increasing number of ideal cardiovascular health factors have been associated with a lower prevalence and incidence of ASCVD events and other conditions; moving individuals toward ideal cardiovascular health is critically important for prevention of many important health conditions. The guideline consolidates existing recommendations and includes newly generated recommendations for aspirin use, exercise and physical activity, and tobacco use, along with recommendations related to team-based care, shared decision-making, and assessment of social determinants of health. Prevention strategies must include a strong focus on lifestyle optimization (improvements in diet, physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke) to minimize the risk of future ASCVD events, and a comprehensive patient-centered approach that addresses all aspects of a patient's lifestyle habits and estimated risk of a future ASCVD event is the first step in deciding on where there may be a need for pharmacotherapy; even if a blood pressure (BP)–reducing medication, lipid-lowering medication, or diabetes medication is ultimately prescribed, lifestyle goals should be emphasized on a regular basis.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and British society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (BSPGHAN) joint consensus guidelines on the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic oesophagitis in children and adults [^9a8979d1]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for eosinophilic esophagitis, more specifically with respect to esophageal biopsy, BSG/BSPGHAN 2022 guidelines recommend to express eosinophil density as eosinophil counts per 0.3 mm² (this equates to a conventional optical hpf) and use the cut-off ≥ 15 eosinophils per 0.3 mm² in any biopsy specimen for diagnosis.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer [^8eac3ee9]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Immunotherapy with PD-(L)1 inhibitors for the treatment of advanced/metastatic breast cancer — at the time of publication, two immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were FDA-approved for advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (atezolizumab and pembrolizumab), although the atezolizumab TNBC indication was voluntarily withdrawn in 2021; accelerated approval for atezolizumab was granted in March 2019 in combination with nab-paclitaxel for PD-L1+ disease as measured by the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) immunohistochemical assay on immune cells (ICs). In the IMpassion130 randomized trial, 902 patients were randomized, 451 in each arm; the primary analysis met the progression-free survival (PFS) endpoint in both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1+ populations, and no benefit was observed in the PD-L1-negative group; for overall survival (OS), a statistically significant benefit was not seen in the ITT subgroup and formal statistical testing could not be performed in the PD-L1+ subgroup per the hierarchical plan. Exploratory analyses in the PD-L1+ subgroup with nab-paclitaxel reflected a HR of 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.86), with consistency across analyses, including a final HR of 0.67 and a final OS improvement of 7.5 months at a median follow-up of 18.8 months. KEYNOTE-355 was a randomized, double-blind study of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy in previously untreated, locally recurrent, inoperable, or metastatic TNBC, with PD-L1 status determined by the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay assessing both tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs) to yield a combined positive score (CPS) defined as the number of PD-L1 staining cells divided by the total number of viable TCs, multiplied by 100.
