## Question

To be a useful inhaled glucocorticoid the drug should have:

a. High oral bioavailability
b. Additional bronchodilator activity
c. Low oral bioavailability
d. Prodrug character

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which property is most important for a useful inhaled glucocorticoid: high oral bioavailability, additional bronchodilator activity, low oral bioavailability, or prodrug character. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core therapeutic objective of inhaled corticosteroids and the importance of pulmonary selectivity. Then, I should verify how oral bioavailability influences systemic adverse effects. Next, I will consider the clinical roles of bronchodilator activity and prodrug features. Finally, I will review representative ICS pharmacokinetics to ensure the mechanistic reasoning aligns with clinical evidence before concluding the best answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical objective for an inhaled corticorticoid: to deliver high local anti-inflammatory activity in the lung while minimizing systemic exposure and adverse effects, thereby maximizing the therapeutic index. Low or negligible oral bioavailability is repeatedly cited as a key design feature to reduce systemic effects from the swallowed fraction, alongside high pulmonary deposition and efficient systemic clearance [^111x53RE] [^113Hb7eH] [^113zQ3iw] [^117VdEg6].

> Wait, let me verify the systemic exposure issue carefully, because a large portion of the delivered dose is typically swallowed rather than inhaled. High oral bioavailability would increase systemic corticosteroid exposure and risks such as HPA axis suppression, growth effects, and bone effects, whereas low oral bioavailability reduces these risks via extensive first-pass inactivation, as demonstrated with agents like budesonide and fluticasone [^114vQThP] [^115gD44H] [^116JuDRg].

> I will now examine option a, high oral bioavailability. That would increase the amount of active steroid entering systemic circulation from the oropharyngeal/gastrointestinal route and is the opposite of what we want for an inhaled steroid, so I should reject this option because it would undermine safety and worsen the therapeutic margin [^111x53RE] [^114vQThP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about option b, additional bronchodilator activity. At first glance, it sounds convenient to have an ICS that also dilates airways, but I need to ensure we are not conflating classes. Inhaled corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory controllers, while bronchodilation is the role of beta-agonists; while fixed-dose ICS/LABA combinations are widely used, bronchodilator activity is not a required or defining feature of a useful ICS per se, and the question is about the intrinsic properties of the steroid itself rather than fixed-dose combinations [^114HTXh7] [^111hgwgB].

> Let me consider option d, prodrug character. It can be beneficial, as with ciclesonide which is activated locally in the lung, reducing oropharyngeal side effects and potentially lowering systemic activity, but I should confirm that prodrug status is a desirable optional feature rather than a core requirement for a useful ICS, and several effective ICS (for example, budesonide, fluticasone) are not prodrugs, so prodrug character is not the most universal or essential characteristic here [^111kvvHv] [^115rB6ba] [^111x53RE].

> I should double-check option c, low oral bioavailability. This is consistently described as a core attribute of an ideal ICS because it minimizes systemic effects from swallowed drug, thereby improving the therapeutic index and allowing safer long-term use, which aligns with the principle of pulmonary selectivity that drives ICS design and clinical dosing strategies [^111x53RE] [^117VdEg6] [^113zQ3iw].

> Let me review concrete pharmacokinetic data to ensure the mechanism is supported: budesonide undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism with only about 6–13% systemic availability after oral administration, fluticasone propionate has approximately 99% first-pass inactivation, and beclomethasone dipropionate shows about 70% first-pass metabolism. These profiles explain why low oral bioavailability translates into reduced systemic steroid exposure from the swallowed fraction and contribute to safer chronic therapy when inhaled doses are titrated to effect [^1173HB7d] [^114vQThP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost conflated "low oral bioavailability" with "no systemic effects". I should correct that because a portion of the inhaled dose is absorbed through the lung and can be systemically active, which is why low oral bioavailability reduces but does not eliminate systemic exposure, reinforcing the importance of using the lowest effective dose and choosing agents with favorable PK profiles [^111x53RE] [^111gkW85].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion maps tightly to the question. Low oral bioavailability is the most consistently cited and essential pharmacokinetic feature for a useful inhaled glucocorticoid because it directly reduces systemic exposure from the swallowed fraction and thereby enhances the safety-efficacy balance, whereas bronchodilator activity is a separate drug class function and prodrug status is an advantageous but non-universal feature, so the best answer is c. low oral bioavailability [^111x53RE] [^113Hb7eH] [^117VdEg6].

---

The correct answer is **c. low oral bioavailability**. Inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) must have **low oral bioavailability** to minimize systemic exposure from swallowed drug and reduce systemic side effects such as adrenal suppression and growth effects [^111x53RE] [^115gD44H]. High oral bioavailability increases systemic effects and is undesirable [^115gD44H]. Additional bronchodilator activity is not required for ICS, and prodrug character is optional and not essential for efficacy or safety [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

- **Oral bioavailability**: Low oral bioavailability ensures that the swallowed portion of the dose undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, reducing systemic exposure and minimizing systemic side effects [^117VdEg6].

- **First-pass metabolism**: High first-pass hepatic metabolism inactivates swallowed drug, further limiting systemic exposure [^114vQThP].

- **Systemic exposure**: Even with low oral bioavailability, a portion of the dose is absorbed through the lungs, so minimizing oral bioavailability is critical to limit overall systemic exposure [^115gD44H].

---

## Clinical implications of oral bioavailability

High oral bioavailability increases systemic exposure and the risk of **adverse effects**, including adrenal suppression, growth impairment in children, and bone density loss [^114P9vKa] [^116YJHRc]. Low oral bioavailability, in contrast, **reduces systemic exposure**, thereby improving the therapeutic index and safety profile of ICS therapy [^111x53RE] [^111gkW85].

---

## Additional bronchodilator activity

ICS primarily exert anti-inflammatory effects and do not provide **bronchodilation**; bronchodilation is typically achieved with beta-agonists. Therefore, additional bronchodilator activity is not a necessary characteristic for ICS efficacy.

---

## Prodrug character

Some ICS, such as ciclesonide, are designed as prodrugs activated locally in the lungs, which may reduce oropharyngeal side effects [^115rB6ba]. However, prodrug character is **not essential** for ICS efficacy or safety and is not universally adopted across all ICS formulations [^111kvvHv].

---

## Summary of key characteristics

| **Characteristic** | **Importance for ics** |
|-|-|
| Low oral bioavailability | Essential for minimizing systemic exposure and side effects |
| High oral bioavailability | Undesirable due to increased systemic side effects |
| Additional bronchodilator activity | Not required; ICS primarily provide anti-inflammatory effects |
| Prodrug character | Optional; may reduce oropharyngeal side effects but not essential |

---

The most important characteristic for a useful inhaled glucocorticoid is **low oral bioavailability**, which minimizes systemic exposure and side effects, thereby improving the therapeutic index and safety profile [^notfound].

### Inhaled steroids and risk of pneumonia for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^117D3Qru]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are anti-inflammatory drugs that have proven benefits for people with worsening symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and repeated exacerbations. They are commonly used as combination inhalers with long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) to reduce exacerbation rates and all-cause mortality, and to improve lung function and quality of life. The most common combinations of ICS and LABA used in combination inhalers are fluticasone and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol and a new formulation of fluticasone in combination with vilanterol, which is now available. ICS have been associated with increased risk of pneumonia, but the magnitude of risk and how this compares with different ICS remain unclear. Recent reviews conducted to address their safety have not compared the relative safety of these two drugs when used alone or in combination with LABA.

Objectives

To assess the risk of pneumonia associated with the use of fluticasone and budesonide for COPD.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), clinicaltrials.gov, reference lists of existing systematic reviews and manufacturer websites. The most recent searches were conducted in September 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies were included if they compared the ICS budesonide or fluticasone versus placebo, or either ICS in combination with a LABA versus the same LABA as monotherapy for people with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study characteristics, numerical data and risk of bias information for each included study. We looked at direct comparisons of ICS versus placebo separately from comparisons of ICS/LABA versus LABA for all outcomes, and we combined these with subgroups when no important heterogeneity was noted. After assessing for transitivity, we conducted an indirect comparison to compare budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy, but we could not do the same for the combination therapies because of systematic differences between the budesonide and fluticasone combination data sets. When appropriate, we explored the effects of ICS dose, duration of ICS therapy and baseline severity on the primary outcome. Findings of all outcomes are presented in 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADEPro.

Main Results

We found 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria, and more evidence was provided for fluticasone (26 studies; n = 21,247) than for budesonide (17 studies; n = 10,150). Evidence from the budesonide studies was more inconsistent and less precise, and the studies were shorter. The populations within studies were more often male with a mean age of around 63, mean pack-years smoked over 40 and mean predicted forced expiratory volume of one second (FEV1) less than 50%. High or uneven dropout was considered a high risk of bias in almost 40% of the trials, but conclusions for the primary outcome did not change when the trials at high risk of bias were removed in a sensitivity analysis. Fluticasone increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events (requiring hospital admission) (odds ratio (OR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 2.12; 18 more per 1000 treated over 18 months; high quality), and no evidence suggested that this outcome was reduced by delivering it in combination with salmeterol or vilanterol (subgroup differences: I(2) = 0%, P value 0.51), or that different doses, trial duration or baseline severity significantly affected the estimate. Budesonide also increased non-fatal serious adverse pneumonia events compared with placebo, but the effect was less precise and was based on shorter trials (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.62; six more per 1000 treated over nine months; moderate quality). Some of the variation in the budesonide data could be explained by a significant difference between the two commonly used doses: 640 mcg was associated with a larger effect than 320 mcg relative to placebo (subgroup differences: I(2) = 74%, P value 0.05). An indirect comparison of budesonide versus fluticasone monotherapy revealed no significant differences with respect to serious adverse events (pneumonia-related or all-cause) or mortality. The risk of any pneumonia event (i.e. less serious cases treated in the community) was higher with fluticasone than with budesonide (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.34); this was the only significant difference reported between the two drugs. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of possible differences in the assignment of pneumonia diagnosis, and because no trials directly compared the two drugs. No significant difference in overall mortality rates was observed between either of the inhaled steroids and the control interventions (both high-quality evidence), and pneumonia-related deaths were too rare to permit conclusions to be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

Budesonide and fluticasone, delivered alone or in combination with a LABA, are associated with increased risk of serious adverse pneumonia events, but neither significantly affected mortality compared with controls. The safety concerns highlighted in this review should be balanced with recent cohort data and established randomised evidence of efficacy regarding exacerbations and quality of life. Comparison of the two drugs revealed no statistically significant difference in serious pneumonias, mortality or serious adverse events. Fluticasone was associated with higher risk of any pneumonia when compared with budesonide (i.e. less serious cases dealt with in the community), but variation in the definitions used by the respective manufacturers is a potential confounding factor in their comparison. Primary research should accurately measure pneumonia outcomes and should clarify both the definition and the method of diagnosis used, especially for new formulations such as fluticasone furoate, for which little evidence of the associated pneumonia risk is currently available. Similarly, systematic reviews and cohorts should address the reliability of assigning 'pneumonia' as an adverse event or cause of death and should determine how this affects the applicability of findings.

### Multidimensional analyses to assess the relations between treatment choices by physicians and patients' characteristics: the example of COPD [^112ZYW4o]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Finally, several studies including some performed in France found that treatment choices by physicians differ sometimes markedly from guidelines recommendations, e.g. regarding the use of inhaled corticosteroids. For these treatments as well as for choices between bronchodilators, the criteria on which physicians rely are quite unclear.

This observational study was performed to identify the patients characteristics associated with treatment choices in COPD patients visiting a respiratory physician at stable state. More generally, it aimed at exploring whether multidimensional analyses performed with no a priori hypothesis could link some typologies of clinical characteristics to some typologies of treatments, using data that are readily available in routine practice.

### Evaluation of tests of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function used to measure effects of inhaled corticosteroids [^11274wXA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the evidence supporting the evaluation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function as a measure of systemic exposure and clinical adverse events, discuss factors that affect systemic exposure to inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and review the effects of various ICSs that are currently available or under development on HPA axis function from a therapeutic perspective.

Data Sources

Randomized published clinical trials and review articles on the topic of HPA axis suppression were retrieved in MEDLINE. Searches dating back to 1988 were restricted to human studies published in English.

Study Selection

Studies that evaluated HPA axis function and the methods used to measure its activities and the effects of ICSs (fluticasone propionate, budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, mometasone furoate, and ciclesonide) were selected.

Results

Factors that influence adverse events caused by ICSs include pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, delivery devices, and therapeutic dose and duration. Basal measurements of blood and urinary cortisol levels, reflecting basal HPA axis function, are the most sensitive markers for assessing systemic ICS bioavailability but, compared with dynamic stimulation tests, are poor clinical predictors of adrenal dysfunction.

Conclusions

Basal serologic and urinary cortisol tests provide the best measures of assessing and comparing systemic ICS exposure. Long-term clinical studies are needed to determine whether such tests are predictive of ICS toxicity.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111Ri3zH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma — as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol for symptom relief is supported by randomized evidence, with low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed investigated in six randomized controlled trials and showing reduced severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA). Compared with regular ICS, severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, and a meta-analysis reported the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower versus regular ICS–plus as-needed SABA. As-needed ICS–formoterol was as effective as daily ICS for reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and reductions in severe exacerbations versus regular ICS (or SABA alone) were independent of baseline characteristics; qualitative research found it was preferred by most patients with mild asthma but emphasized shared decision making is needed.

### Treatment of interstitial lung disease associated cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115kED7o]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis-associated cough — effects of inhaled corticosteroids: in sarcoidosis, three trials of inhaled corticosteroids did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cough, although trials reported trends toward improvement in cough. Further trials are needed to clarify the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, ideally in carefully selected patients with active, airway-centered disease and a clinically significant cough.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — Inhaled corticosteroids in ambulatory mild-to-moderate disease: Among ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the panel suggests against inhaled corticosteroids (Conditional recommendation††, Moderate certainty of evidence). The remark specifies that patients who are on inhaled corticosteroids for other indications may continue them. The panel explains that the undesirable effects outweigh the desirable effects, though uncertainty still exists. Background context notes that systemic corticosteroids have become a mainstay of therapy for severe COVID-19 and that some corticosteroids, including ciclesonide, have shown in vitro coronavirus replication inhibition.

### Interventions to improve adherence to inhaled steroids for asthma [^1166zNBb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Despite its proven efficacy in improving symptoms and reducing exacerbations, many patients with asthma are not fully adherent to their steroid inhaler. Suboptimal adherence leads to poorer clinical outcomes and increased health service utilisation, and has been identified as a contributing factor to a third of asthma deaths in the UK. Reasons for non-adherence vary, and a variety of interventions have been proposed to help people improve treatment adherence.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions intended to improve adherence to inhaled corticosteroids among people with asthma.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent searches on 18 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cluster randomised controlled trials of any duration conducted in any setting. We included studies reported as full-text articles, those published as abstracts only and unpublished data. We included trials of adults and children with asthma and a current prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (as monotherapy or in combination with a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA)). Eligible trials compared an intervention primarily aimed at improving adherence to ICS versus usual care or an alternative intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the searches, extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were adherence to ICS, exacerbations requiring at least oral corticosteroids and asthma control. We graded results and presented evidence in 'Summary of findings' tables for each comparison. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios, and continuous data as mean differences or standardised mean differences, all using a random-effects model. We described skewed data narratively. We made no a priori assumptions about how trials would be categorised but conducted meta-analyses only if treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense.

Main Results

We included 39 parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults and children with asthma, 28 of which (n = 16,303) contributed data to at least one meta-analysis. Follow-up ranged from two months to two years (median six months), and trials were conducted mainly in high-income countries. Most studies reported some measure of adherence to ICS and a variety of other outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control. Studies generally were at low or unclear risk of selection bias and at high risk of biases associated with blinding. We considered around half the studies to be at high risk for attrition bias and selective outcome reporting. We classified studies into four comparisons: adherence education versus control (20 studies); electronic trackers or reminders versus control (11 studies); simplified drug regimens versus usual drug regimens (four studies); and school-based directly observed therapy (three studies). Two studies are described separately. All pooled results for adherence education, electronic trackers or reminders and simplified regimens showed better adherence than controls. Analyses limited to studies using objective measures revealed that adherence education showed a benefit of 20 percentage points over control (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.52 to 32.74; five studies; low-quality evidence); electronic trackers or reminders led to better adherence of 19 percentage points (95% CI 14.47 to 25.26; six studies; moderate-quality evidence); and simplified regimens led to better adherence of 4 percentage points (95% CI 1.88 to 6.16; three studies; moderate-quality evidence). Our confidence in the evidence was reduced by risk of bias and inconsistency. Improvements in adherence were not consistently translated into observable benefit for clinical outcomes in our pooled analyses. None of the intervention types showed clear benefit for our primary clinical outcomes - exacerbations requiring an oral corticosteroid (OCS) (evidence of very low to low quality) and asthma control (evidence of low to moderate quality); nor for our secondary outcomes - unscheduled visits (evidence of very low to moderate quality) and quality of life (evidence of low to moderate quality). However, some individual studies reported observed benefits for OCS and use of healthcare services. Most school or work absence data were skewed and were difficult to interpret (evidence of low quality, when graded), and most studies did not specifically measure or report adverse events. Studies investigating the possible benefit of administering ICS at school did not measure adherence, exacerbations requiring OCS, asthma control or adverse events. One study showed fewer unscheduled visits, and another found no differences; data could not be combined.

Authors' Conclusions

Pooled results suggest that a variety of interventions can improve adherence. The clinical relevance of this improvement, highlighted by uncertain and inconsistent impact on clinical outcomes such as quality of life and asthma control, is less clear. We have low to moderate confidence in these findings owing to concerns about risk of bias and inconsistency. Future studies would benefit from predefining an evidence-based 'cut-off' for acceptable adherence and using objective adherence measures and validated tools and questionnaires. When possible, covert monitoring and some form of blinding or active control may help disentangle effects of the intervention from effects of inclusion in an adherence trial.

### Measuring safety of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma [^1145qpwX]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite evidence demonstrating generally excellent therapeutic ratios for inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in asthma treatment, many clinicians and patients have ongoing concerns regarding their safety. To frame discussions of ICS safety, it is important to understand how safety is measured.

Objective

To discuss how ICS safety is and should be measured.

Methods

Discussion is augmented by relevant articles from the literature.

Results

The therapeutic value of corticosteroids depends on the activation and repression of thousands of genes. However, it is not fully known which genes cause the desirable, therapeutic effects and which cause the adverse effects. The drug development process attempts to elucidate the clinically significant therapeutic effects and adverse effects of a candidate molecule and then compare them to those of currently available corticosteroids. Approaches to monitoring safety include clinical trials, retrospective comparison to historical efficacy and safety data, surrogate markers, animal models, and in vitro assays. Both preclinical and clinical data are used to compare safety among corticosteroids; however, no specific pathway or model that can robustly predict therapeutic ratios has been identified. Furthermore, variation in adverse effects is influenced by isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor, differences in corticosteroid characteristics, differences among patients, and environmental variation.

Conclusion

Although some preclinical and patient-based metrics have predictive value, there is a clear need for improved biomarkers of corticosteroid adverse effects. Integrated analysis of preclinical and clinical data, including long-term safety data, could be used to address this important unmet need.

### Factors that affect the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids for infants and young children [^114PW5Uy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Infants (0–1 years of age) and young children (1–3 years of age) are a unique subpopulation with regard to inhaled therapies. There are various anatomic, physiological, and emotional factors peculiar to this age group that present significant difficulties and challenges for aerosol delivery. Most studies of therapeutic aerosols that have been performed with patients of this age group, particularly recent studies with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), administered aerosols with relatively large particles (ie, > 3 microm in mass median aerodynamic diameter). These drugs were designed for use in adults and older children and were administered with masks, which are frequently rejected by patients. Based on these studies, it was recently suggested that ICSs might not be as therapeutically effective in infants and young children as in adults. We review the reasons that large-particle corticosteroid aerosols are not likely to be effective in infants and young children. This patient population differs from adults in airway anatomy and physiology, as well as in behavior and adherence to therapy. We suggest that the benefit of ICSs in this age group requires further evaluation to determine whether better therapeutic outcomes might be achieved with smaller particles.

### Comparing clinical features of the nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, and dry powder inhaler [^113QQF5C]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Topically inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These medications are delivered via jet or ultrasonic nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler (MDI), or dry powder inhaler (DPI). While the number of devices may be confusing to patients and clinicians, each device has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Most clinical evidence shows that any of these devices will work for most situations, including exacerbations and in the stable outpatient setting. There is a high rate of errors in device use with all these devices, especially the MDI. In choosing a drug/device combination for a patient, the clinician must take into account several factors, including the cognitive and physical ability of the patient, ease of use, convenience, costs, and patient preferences. Clinicians should also have a rudimentary understanding of aerosol principles in order to be able to teach appropriate use of aerosol devices to their patients.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in children: effects on bone mineral density and growth [^116YJHRc]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Potent, topically active corticosteroids with minimum systemic activity have fewer adverse effects than do systemic corticosteroids, and can control both asthma and allergic rhinitis when given in recommended doses. However, study findings show that children with asthma receiving budesonide and beclometasone dipropionate have decreased linear growth, and that children who receive long-term inhaled corticosteroid therapy for asthma have height deficits 1–2 years after treatment initiation that persist into adulthood. The effects of inhaled corticosteroids on growth seem to be dependent on both dose and duration; the degree of systemic effects is dependent on pharmacokinetic properties (ie, absorption, distribution, and elimination), whereas the effective dose delivered is dependent on the delivery system and potency of the molecule. The effects of corticosteroids on bone mineral density in children seem to be more amenable to intervention; long-term therapy with inhaled corticosteroid therapy is safer than frequent bursts of oral corticosteroids on bone mineral accretion in this regard. Importantly, adequate nutrition (particularly sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D) should prevent or blunt the effects of corticosteroids on bone mineral density. The potential adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids need to be weighed against the large and well established benefit of these drugs to control persistent asthma. To minimise any adverse effects, treatment with inhaled corticosteroids should always aim to reach the lowest effective dose that gives the patient good asthma control.

### Designing corticosteroid drugs for pulmonary selectivity [^111RBQ9i]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids have become indispensable for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Significant progress has been made toward minimizing side effects through the use of increasingly selective molecules, and through a variety of lung targeting strategies. Many of these developments have occurred in advance of a greatly improved understanding of corticosteroid biology at the molecular and pharmacologic level, and it has become clear that additional opportunities exist for the further enhancement of therapeutic index. This article discusses significant recent developments in the chemistry, biology, and pharmacology of corticosteroids, and considers the implications for the future use of inhaled corticosteroids.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116QSan5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of Glucocorticoid-induced Adrenal Insufficiency

Glucocorticoids suppress HPA axis activity by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary. Inhibition of CRH and ACTH induced by exogenous glucocorticoids is similar to the mechanisms involved in the physiologic cortisol negative feedback. Prolonged duration of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy often leads to a reduction in the overall responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland. In rodent models, glucocorticoids exert pro-apoptotic effects on the pituitary gland and promote protein degradation as represented by Crooke's hyaline in corticotroph cells. This ultimately results in atrophy of the adrenal cortex. Conversely, following withdrawal of glucocorticoids, there is resurgence of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex. In most instances, the adrenal cortex will recover and produce adequate levels of cortisol. Despite these adaptive responses, the time to full biochemical and clinical restitution of the HPA axis is highly variable.

Any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily dose equivalent can potentially lead to suppression of the HPA axis. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure, which, amongst other factors, is determined by potency of the glucocorticoid (Table 1), glucocorticoid dose, length of therapy, and individual susceptibility. Notably, any route of administration has the potential of HPA axis suppression, including oral, topical, inhaled, intra-nasal, intravenous and intra-articular administration.

Table 1.
Pharmacologic characteristics of commonly prescribed systemic glucocorticoids

With regards to glucocorticoid therapy, immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory doses considerably exceed the equivalent of endogenous cortisol production and, therefore, invariably result in HPA axis suppression. While tapering glucocorticoids within the supraphysiologic dose range, patients can develop glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, which manifests with clinical features similar to those of adrenal insufficiency. However, symptoms due to adrenal insufficiency are much more likely to develop when overall total daily glucocorticoid dose is below physiologic levels, or levels required for an adequate stress response.

Inhaled corticosteroid dosing and local side-effect mitigation — the minimum effective dose of ICS to maintain good asthma control should be used; if decreased growth velocity is seen, other factors should be considered, including poorly controlled asthma, frequent use of oral corticosteroids (OCS), and poor nutrition, and referral should be considered. If ICS is delivered through a face-mask or nebulizer, the skin on the nose and around the mouth should be cleaned shortly after inhalation to avoid local side-effects such as steroid rash (reddening and atrophy).

### Inhaled corticosteroids for asthma: common clinical quandaries [^113K8Ar4]. The Journal of Asthma (2003). Low credibility.

This narrative review provides evidence-based explanations to some of the common clinical concerns regarding inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for a newly diagnosed asthmatic patient. Better results are obtained when treatment is initiated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Asthma control can be achieved and maintained in most patients with a low or moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid administered in two daily doses. Longer duration of treatment provides more sustained benefits than treatment that is intermittent and for short periods of time. The clinical benefits can be observed within 24 hours of commencing treatment and may be more pronounced in patients with an eosinophilic bronchitis. Inhaled corticosteroids provide additional benefit when used in conjunction with prednisone in acute severe asthma. Low doses do not have clinically deleterious side effects on the bones, growth, eye, or hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis. However, they do not normalize lung function and prevent structural changes in the airway wall in all asthmatic patients.

### Inhaled vs oral steroids for adults with chronic asthma [^111HNRFM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine therapeutically equivalent doses of inhaled versus oral steroids for adults with chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group trials register was searched using the terms: (drug delivery systems OR ((nebuli* OR inhal* OR MDI) AND oral*)) AND (steroid* OR corticosteroid* OR glucocorticoid* OR beclomethasone OR betamethasone OR fluticasone OR cortisone OR dexamethasone OR hydrocortisone OR prednisolone OR prednisone OR triamcinolone).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were selected of at least 4 weeks duration and included patients over the age of 15 years with chronic asthma. Trials compared inhaled steroids and oral prednisolone or prednisone; where the maximum dose for inhaled steroids was 2000 mcg/day and prednisolone 60 mg (on alternate days).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent reviewers screened 1285 titles and abstracts from the electronic search, bibliography searches and other contacts. Of these, 10 trials met previously defined inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, and outcome measures.

Main Results

All trials were small and no data could be pooled. Carry-over effects were present in at least one cross-over trial. Data from six trials produced the same pattern, in which prednisolone 7.5–12 mg/day appeared to be as effective as inhaled steroid 300–2000 mcg/day. In two trials, inhaled steroid 300–400 mcg/day was more effective than prednisolone 5 mg/day. All doses of inhaled steroid appeared to be more effective than alternate day doses of prednisolone up to 60 mg on alternate days. Side-effect data were reported too variably to permit comparisons. A 30% incidence was reported in one study in patients receiving prednisolone 5 mg/day, none were reported in patients on inhaled steroids. A further search was conducted in October 2000 which yielded no further trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A daily dose of prednisolone 7.5–10 mg/day appears to be equivalent to moderate-high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Side-effects may be present on low doses, so if there is no alternative to oral steroids, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in COPD and the risk of serious pneumonia [^116B3sog]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

There is good evidence supporting the effect of ICS on human pulmonary host defence, acting through several biological pathways, such as an inhibitory action on macrophage functions, a decrease in cytokine production and nitric oxide expression, which may lead to a failure to control infection. Although there have been no studies directly comparing the effects of fluticasone and budesonide on host defence, differences are likely related to their contrasting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Fluticasone is known to be more potent (ie, greater effect on intracellular steroid receptors), more lipophilic and has a longer half life than budesonide. Accordingly, fluticasone has a better penetration at the site of action and a more prolonged effect. It is therefore not surprising that a greater risk of oropharyngeal side effects is found with fluticasone compared with budesonide. While high potency and lipophilicity can be positive features allowing a lower dose to exert the desired effect, these characteristics may adversely affect drug safety. Indeed, a more prolonged corticosteroid effect in the lungs and greater pulmonary retention will facilitate the local immunosuppressive action. Budesonide enters the lungs with a lower lipophilicity, dissolves more quickly into pulmonary fluids, leading to a reduced local effect because of a more rapid cleavage and passage into the systemic circulation.

### Clinical pharmacology of corticosteroids [^111Eg3UJ]. Respiratory Care (2018). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have numerous applications in treating inflammation and diseases of immune function based on their significant anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. Corticosteroids modulate immune function through various effects in the nucleus of numerous cells. When used in pharmacologic doses to suppress allergic responses or inflammation, these agents can cause numerous adverse effects associated with an excess of glucocorticoid activity. Prolonged use (> 2 wk) results in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which requires tapering of doses. Dosing strategies for systemic corticosteroids are designed to minimize the risk for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Topical administration of corticosteroids, including oral inhalation, is often used to avoid the significant adverse effects associated with chronic use. Inhaled corticosteroids are potent synthetic agents that exert their actions locally in the airways but can cause systemic effects based on several factors that influence systemic bioavailability. Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone of asthma therapy and important options for COPD in patients who experience frequent exacerbations. By the nasal route, they are the most effective therapy for treating moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113pQ9XK]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113CD9Bg]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

### Dose response and therapeutic index of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma [^115uQyDs]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Inhaled glucocorticoids play an indispensable role in the therapy of asthma. Development of new compounds was initially directed to increase the potency of the individual corticosteroid; thereafter, pharmacokinetic characteristics were modified to reduce unwanted systemic effects. Target of the present development is to attain compounds with the most favorable risk-to-benefit ratios. Since then, there has been substantial discussion about how to rank and weigh the different glucocorticoids. This article provides an evaluation of the relevant clinical studies published between May 2001 and June 2002, identifying the main determinants of the therapeutic value of inhaled glucocorticoids.

### Weighing the risks of treatment versus nontreatment in pediatric asthma [^1171cNYf]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

During the past dozen years, great strides have been made in the understanding of asthma. In addition, an excellent choice of effective and safe medications has become available for use in both the acute and chronic manifestations of this disease. Unfortunately, asthma continues to affect society adversely in terms of cost and morbidity. Following the NHLBI guidelines for the management of persistent asthma could substantially reduce the health care expenditures associated with asthma and, more importantly could significantly reduce asthma exacerbations, emergent care visits, hospitalizations, and even asthma deaths. All who care for children with asthma must continue to relay the message that asthma is a chronic condition that is best treated with controller agents. Inhaled glucocorticoids are considered first-line agents for all patients with persistent asthma. They have been shown to improve asthma control, improve lung function, and reduce morbidity and mortality. Whether the leukotriene-modifying agents will be shown to reduce morbidity and mortality significantly remains an important and unanswered question at present. Another important question is whether combination therapy and which combination (inhaled glucocorticoid plus LABA or inhaled glucocorticoid plus leukotriene-modifying agent) will provide even further improvement in asthma control and further reductions in hospitalizations and mortality than seen with the use of inhaled glucocorticoids alone.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in asthma management [^114dCynX]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

Asthma is a disorder of the lower airways, characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airflow limitation, the pathogenesis of which is yet to be fully understood. Regardless of its triggers, asthma's hallmark is a state of inflammation that, when uncontrolled, results in persistence of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are established as the mainstay of asthma therapy. This paper examines what is currently available among this class of drugs, features of the ideal inhaled corticosteroid, the delivery systems, dose-response relationships, adverse effects, combination with long-acting beta agonists, equipotent doses among the different types, and several special scenarios that involve the apparent incomplete or lack of response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids among certain subgroups of patients, such as smokers and obese individuals, and we will discuss the scientific basis of such resistance and suggest alternative approaches to therapy.

### Relative receptor affinity comparisons among inhaled / intranasal corticosteroids: perspectives on clinical relevance [^116uUT5j]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacokinetic properties, dosing regimen, and potency at the site of action are among the factors that influence activity of a corticosteroid. The potency of a corticosteroid at the site of action is determined significantly by its affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. Recent literature on topical corticosteroids reveals an increasing emphasis on comparative relative receptor affinity values as a key method of differentiating among various corticosteroid compounds, particularly with regard to clinical efficacy.

Methods

A response was formulated to: Valotis A, Högger P: Human receptor kinetics and lung tissue retention of the enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate. Respir Res 2007, 8:54.

Results

Relative receptor binding affinities, while often showing significant variability across different laboratories, are a valid parameter when a comparison of the pharmacological activity of various glucocorticoids at the site of action is desired. Unfortunately within this context, scientific literature including the article from Valotis and Högger, confuse differences in potency (concentration or dose necessary to achieve a certain effect) with differences in efficacy (a quantitative difference in the overall maximum effect, even if all the receptors are occupied). All glucocorticoids will show the same efficacy as long as the selected dose will occupy the same number of receptors.

Conclusion

While relative receptor affinities are useful for comparing in vitro potencies of corticosteroids, these data are not representative of physiologic conditions and should not be used as a basis for comparing the presumed effectiveness of compounds in a clinical situation.

### Locally-acting orally-inhaled and nasal drug products… [^115cMPXi]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Performance of orally inhaled and nasal drug products is governed by complex interactions between device, formulation, and patient factors. Because existing in vitro methods have limited predictability of these interactions, both development and bioequivalence demonstration of generic OINDPs is very challenging, time-consuming and expensive, in part due to their reliance on in vivo studies. 4) Identification, validation and standardization of novel techniques that may have the potential to reduce the burden of current BE requirements for generic OINDPs. Under these initiatives, OGD has explored advanced in vitro/in silico methods such as CFD modeling and clinically relevant in vitro dissolution and deposition tests to understand and predict performance of OIDNPs in a more realistic way.

These clinically relevant in vitro methods have shown good in vivo predictability of regional nasal and lung drug deposition and dissolution, as well as local and systemic drug bioavailability of OIDNPs. Some of these methods are described below. CFD simulation results for the three nasal sprays were used as model inputs to simulate absorption of the corticosteroids fluticasone propionate and budesonide. The PBPK models included the effects of mucociliary clearance, drug dissolution, diffusion through nasal epithelial layers, binding kinetics to the glucocorticoid receptor, liver metabolism, and systemic clearance. The PBPK models can be used to determine which physicochemical properties of the ICS affect the absorption and systemic bioavailability.

In addition, preliminary data from a CFD model of a human nasal cavity also indicated that local delivery of several intranasal corticosteroids may not be sensitive to actuation force when assessed across the range normally seen within a clinical setting. The collection system has been validated for impactor stage mass recovery versus a standard impactor over a range of drug loadings for both dry powder inhaler and metered dose inhaler products. A good correlation was observed between in vivo mean absorption time and the first order half-life of the dissolution profiles of a range of inhaled corticosteroids for the drug collected on the aerosol collection chamber. These research findings indicated that this dissolution method has the potential to be used to investigate both formulation and device related factors and determine the possible influence of dissolution on the absorption behavior of poorly soluble drugs.

### Benefit versus risk for oral, inhaled, and nasal glucocorticosteroids [^116K7G9W]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Many factors affect the benefit-to-risk analysis of the use of the glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of allergic inflammation. For most patients the benefit-to-risk ratio favors topical over oral administration, but in severe disease oral administration may be required. It is clear from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies that inhaled glucocorticosteroids in particular are absorbed into the systemic circulation and that they can have clinical adverse effects when given in high doses. Therefore, with inhaled and nasal glucocorticosteroids, the dose that will achieve the optimal benefit/risk ratio is the lowest dose that controls symptoms and prevents exacerbations requiring treatment with oral glucocorticosteroids. This optimal dose needs to be determined on an individual basis and is likely to vary as disease severity changes over time.

### Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of synthetic glucocorticoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ej8pk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Moreover, further research into the underlying mechanism of neuropsychiatric adverse effects is warranted, especially since the reasons why some individuals experience symptoms and some remain asymptomatic are unclear. Of interest are studies investigating GR genetics, in which, for example, a certain MR haplotype shows increased expression with associated positive effects. In addition, polymorphisms of the GR gene have also shown to be associated with the severity of (side) effects, in particular also with respect to inhaled corticosteroids, and may be taken into account in further studies. In this context, it is of interest to mention that there is ongoing research into selective GR modulators that have the potential to enable targeted medication usage, achieving the desired effect without the accompanying adverse effects.

There are some limitations that need to be discussed. First, there is the heterogeneity regarding study population, the underlying disease, type of glucocorticoid, the dose, and duration. Also, reporting of data was different between studies, for example the dosages were given in mg/d, mg/kg/d, and mean mg/kg (see Supplementary Table S1). This makes a formal comparison difficult and resulted in small subgroups with low power for such subgroup analyses. Second, only a few studies could be included in the analysis comparing glucocorticoid users with nonusers, and residual confounding may be present thereby hampering a firm statement regarding causality. Lastly, it is important to mention that the current meta-analysis does not prove causality between glucocorticoid use and the development of neuropsychiatric adverse effects. However, we would like to stress that the discussion on causality should consider the full body of evidence, including preclinical data.

In order to get clear incidences of specific neuropsychiatric adverse effects, future studies should state in a detailed manner the type, dose, duration, and route of administration of the glucocorticoid used. We also showed the need for comparative evidence for some of the neuropsychiatric conditions (eg, anxiety). Furthermore, the use and study of standard dosages and durations would make it easier to investigate the effect of dose and duration on complaints. Also, the use of control groups, like cross-over studies, to compare psychiatric complaints between users and nonusers or off-on periods, and a general assessment tool to capture these complaints are preferred. This might give better insights in which synthetic glucocorticoids are the most likely culprits, including at what dose and/or duration. Moreover, studies are warranted to assess whether tapering doses, if the underlying disease allows, would relieve some of the neuropsychiatric symptoms.

### Safety of inhaled corticosteroids in children [^116JuDRg]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2002). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are now first-line therapy for persistent asthma in children. The major safety concerns of long-term ICS therapy for childhood asthma are potential effects on adrenal function, growth, and bone mass. Dosage, type of inhaler device, and individual drug characteristics influence systemic effects of ICS. Sensitive measures of basal adrenal function can show statistically significant changes during ICS therapy, but these do not accurately predict clinically meaningful adrenal axis suppression. Adrenal insufficiency is rare and confined to children receiving high doses of ICS. Dose-related inhibition of growth has been seen in some short- and intermediate-term studies, but long-term studies have found no detrimental effect on final height. ICS therapy has not been associated with significant changes in measurements of bone and bone biomarkers, but more studies of high doses and of therapy in adolescents are needed. Overall, although ICS are the most effective anti-inflammatory treatment available for asthma, high doses of ICS in children are still of concern. The risk of high doses is compounded in children with concomitant allergic conditions that require multiple forms of topical corticosteroids. Benefits of ICS clearly outweigh potential adverse effects and risks associated with poorly controlled asthma. Risk can be minimized by using the lowest effective ICS dose, limiting systemic availability of the drug through proper technique to minimize swallowed drug, and selection of agents with efficient first-path hepatic inactivation of swallowed drug. Adjuvant treatments can reduce the dose of ICS required for asthma control, allowing a reduction in overall systemic exposure for most children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Therefore, these agents should be added to, but should not replace, ICS therapy.

### Inhaled drugs and systemic corticosteroids for bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^114qR2Ye]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

All definitions of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have limitations and a new definition for the purpose of clinical research, benchmarking, and prognostic prediction is needed. Different inhaled and systemic drugs are currently used to prevent or treat BPD. Despite some positive effects on BPD, more information about the effects of inhaled corticosteroids is required to assess overall efficacy and associated risks. One needs to balance the risks of neurodevelopmental impairment owing to systemic corticosteroids against those of BPD itself. Future studies should, therefore, focus on infants with a very high risk of developing BPD and include pharmacokinetics and long-term developmental outcomes.

### Inhaled corticosteroids in lung diseases [^112ptBcq]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are used extensively in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to their broad antiinflammatory effects. They improve lung function, symptoms, and quality of life and reduce exacerbations in both conditions but do not alter the progression of disease. They decrease mortality in asthma but not COPD. The available ICSs vary in their therapeutic index and potency. Although ICSs are used in all age groups, younger and smaller children may be at a greater risk for adverse systemic effects because they can receive higher mg/kg doses of ICSs compared with older children. Most of the benefit from ICSs occurs in the low to medium dose range. Minimal additional improvement is seen with higher doses, although some patients may benefit from higher doses. Although ICSs are the preferred agents for managing persistent asthma in all ages, their benefit in COPD is more controversial. When used appropriately, ICSs have few adverse events at low to medium doses, but risk increases with high-dose ICSs. Although several new drugs are being developed and evaluated, it is unlikely that any of these new medications will replace ICSs as the preferred initial long-term controller therapy for asthma, but more effective initial controller therapy could be developed for COPD.

### Comparative pharmacology, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of inhaled glucocorticosteroids [^111kvvHv]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

A comparison of the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of inhaled corticosteroids is necessary for their assessment. A good knowledge of these two aspects allows the optimization of efficacy and safety. The currently available inhaled corticosteroids already show some of the desired PK/PD parameters. The local adverse effects are decreased as soon as the inhaled corticosteroid is administered as an inactive prodrug or shows a bet-ter lung deposition. HFA-MDI beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and ciclesonide are two agents that illustrate this. Low oral bioavailability, rapid systemic clearance, and high plasma protein binding can minimize systemic adverse effects. Mometasone furoate, ciclesonide, and fluticasone propionate possess those characteristics. The pulmonary efficacy is maximized by high lung deposition and long pulmonary residence times. This effect can be achieved by slow dissolution in the lungs, as is the case for fluticasone propionate or lipid conjugation and has been shown for budesonide and ciclesonide. Furthermore, the lung deposition depends on the inhalation device, the particle size, and the inhalation technique. Therefore, improvement in the design of MDIs, DPIs, and nebulizers, and the development of more effective drug particles will lead to an optimized pulmonary targeting. Much progress has been made in the treatment of asthma. The available inhaled corticosteroids show a high safety profile and a good pulmonary selectivity. Development of newer compounds showed that improvement is possible as the result of a complete understanding of the PK/PD concepts. However, the introduction of further improved formulations with a better efficacy/safety profile will be difficult and protracted because the existing drugs are already highly efficient.

### Optimizing inhaled corticosteroid therapy in children with chronic asthma [^115Pc5ub]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective long-term therapy available for suppressing airway inflammation in persistent asthma. While the primary aim of ICS therapy is good efficacy with minimal side effects, early diagnosis and treatment of asthma can also improve asthma control and normalize lung function, and may prevent irreversible airway injury. Poor patient compliance is a major barrier to treatment. Simplified dosing regimens (e.g., once-daily administration), good inhaler technique, and education of the patient/caregiver should improve patient compliance. Concerns over ICS therapy are often based on the potential for systemic effects associated with oral corticosteroids (e.g., effects on bone mineral density, or growth suppression in children). Since adverse events are associated with high doses of ICS, the dose in all patients should be titrated to the minimum effective dose required to maintain control. Optimal distribution of an ICS in the lungs rather than the systemic compartment is affected by several factors, including the drug's pharmacokinetic profile, inhaler type, inhaler technique, and drug particle size. For young patients unable to use a dry-powder inhaler or pressurized metered-dose inhaler, a nebulizer facilitates drug delivery through passive inhalation; ICS therapy in the form of budesonide inhalation suspension can be given to children with persistent asthma from 12 months of age. In conclusion, selecting a drug with good efficacy and minimal side effects, such as budesonide, together with an easy-to-use delivery system and ongoing patient/caregiver education, is important in optimizing ICS therapy for children with persistent asthma.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled glucocorticoids [^114HFz4Z]. The Journal of Asthma (2008). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids are used widely to treat asthma. A number of different steroids and inhalation devices are available. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the different inhaled corticosteroids may influence their efficacy and safety profiles. Properties of an ideal inhaled corticosteroid include low oropharyngeal deposition, low oral bioavailability, high lung deposition, long pulmonary residence times, high receptor affinity, high plasma protein binding, and efficient systemic clearance. Attention to these parameters might help clinicians optimally balance between the safety and efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in treating individual patients with asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112G8gaC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Inhaled corticosteroids and adult asthma [^111gkW85]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The best way to show an ICS dose response and compare ICS products is therefore not to use unselected patients but, rather, to choose patients with either high sputum eosinophils or high F NO and then perform dose escalation studies. Furthermore, ICS dose response also depends on the outcome measured, with airway hyperresponsiveness showing the best dose-dependent improvement over time.

As stated in all guidelines, we should always consider using the lowest possible dose of ICS (or oral corticosteroids [OCS], and ideally no OCS) to control asthma while avoiding the risks for adverse effects. Doses of ICS may be minimized by various measures, including environmental control, use of adjunct therapies such as long-acting inhaled bronchodilators, and in the more severe patient, by the early introduction of biologics. However, prevention of OCS use and related exacerbations should be a priority, which could be avoided in some patients by using high doses of ICS. In this regard, in a study over a median period of 10 years (maximum, 30 yr), we showed that when the dose of ICS/prednisone was adjusted to keep sputum eosinophils under control, exacerbations and the rate of decline of lung function were significantly reduced, although at a price of adverse effects, mainly when OCS was needed. Adverse effects of high doses of ICS have been confounded by methodologic issues and intercurrent OCS use, and there is probably also a variation in susceptibility to those effects from one patient to another.

We therefore agree with Beasley and colleagues that we should prevent overdosing with ICS when not necessary, and that in this regard, there is a significant care gap in asthma management with an underutilization of noninvasive measurements of airway inflammation, particularly in moderate to severe asthma. We endorse the need for rigorous dose–response studies of ICS to be conducted in patients who are well characterized on the basis of their inflammatory endotypes.

### What drives inhaler prescription for asthma patients? Results from a real-life retrospective analysis [^1129LfcT]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The choice of inhaler device for asthma patients depends upon multiple attributes. We investigated factors that may drive general practitioners (GPs) and respiratory specialists in the prescription of inhaler devices for asthma patients who initiated inhalation therapy.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed prescriptions by GPs and respiratory specialists to asthma patients commencing inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist combination therapy available as both pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Patient characteristics were compared by device and multivariate analysis was used to model the likelihood of receiving a pMDI as opposed to a DPI in order to identify drivers for prescription. A sample of the respiratory specialists completed an ad-hoc survey of their perceived success in achieving asthma control in their patients and barriers to attaining full control.

Results

Prescription of a particular inhaler device was unrelated to the characteristics of the patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that the main driver for the choice of inhaler device was the medication (Odds Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval, respectively for GPs and specialists: 0.19 [0.16–0.23]; 0.17 [0.08–0.37]). Specialists perceived asthma as being inadequately controlled in 41% of their patients, and considered patients' difficulties in using DPIs and pMDIs as instrumental in this, citing a need for a novel, more effective inhaler technology.

Conclusion

Physicians choose inhaler devices according to the prescribed drugs and not to the characteristics of the individual patient. This may reflect a lack of confidence in existing inhaler devices and underlines the need for technologies, which are more reliable and easier to use by patients.

Inhaled corticosteroid dose categories and monitoring: The table of low, medium and high doses of various inhaled corticosteroids, alone or in combination with LABA, does not imply potency equivalence; if switching from a 'medium' dose of one inhaled corticosteroid to a 'medium' dose of another, this may represent a decrease or increase in potency with risks of instability or adverse effects, and after any change of treatment or inhaler device, patients should be monitored to ensure stability.

### Factors guiding the choice of delivery device for inhaled corticosteroids in the long-term management of stable asthma and COPD: focus on budesonide [^11298i9T]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) have become the mainstay of chronic controller therapy to treat airways inflammation in asthma and to reduce exacerbations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An array of ICSs are now available that are aerosolized by a range of delivery systems. Such devices include pressurized (or propellant) metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), pMDIs plus valved holding chambers or spacers, breath-actuated inhalers, and nebulizers. More recently, dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) were developed to help overcome problems of hand-breath coordination associated with pMDIs. The clinical benefit of ICSs therapy is determined by a complex interplay between the nature and severity of the disease, the type of drug and its formulation, and characteristics of the delivery device together with the patient's ability to use the device correctly. The ICSs budesonide is available by pMDI, DPI, and nebulizer-allowing the physician to select the best device for each individual patient. Indeed, the availability of budesonide in three different delivery systems allows versatility for the prescribing physician and provides continuity of drug therapy for younger patients who may remain on the same ICSs as they mature.

### The efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids: are we ignoring the potential advantages of ciclesonide? [^115ufB6B]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There is an article associated with this Editorial:

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are still the cornerstone of treatment in asthmaand many physicians also prescribe ICS in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The introduction of ICS in the late 1970s caused a large shift in clinical practice regarding the treatment of asthma. Before that time asthma was considered a disease predominantly caused by proliferation of the smooth muscle cell and the only treatment for this was considered to be bronchodilators. When the efficacy of ICS was finally proven by several studies, and ICS were introduced in primary care, the number of deaths, hospital admissions and night-time calls for emergency primary care services almost disappeared. Furthermore, in many parts of the world ICS replaced the use of regular oral corticosteroids, and with that the incidence of severe side effects secondary to oral steroid treatment diminished.

Since then, asthma therapy guidelines have not changed much. The majority of asthma patients are still treated with a combination of ICS and short- or long-acting bronchodilators. Asthma guidelines recommend measuring asthma control and stepping-up of therapy when patients are uncontrolled on current therapy and stepping-down when patients are controlled. However, guidelines may be too conservative in that they ignore some evidence from both mechanistic and clinical studies regarding the development of inhaled steroids and their effects.

The most important factor when deciding on ICS treatment is the balance between benefit and harm of the ICS concerned. Research over the past decades has shown that not all patients are equal. Although some patients might experience very few side effects from even high-dose ICS, research from Foster et al.showed that, when asked, most patients mentioned several side effects from their 'brown inhaler' such as hoarseness, thin skin and disturbed vision. Measurements of patient populations by Foster et al.with the Inhaled Corticosteroids Questionnaire showed that 45% of patients reported moderate to severe side effects due to ICS when given in a dose ⩾800 mcg budesonide daily.

### How the lung handles drugs: pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled corticosteroids [^113Hb7eH]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis are among the most common diseases of modern society and to an increasing degree a major cause of illness, hospitalization, loss of productivity, and death. Despite improvements in drug therapy over the years, the incidence is still increasing. Inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids are the drugs of choice in the therapy of asthma and allergic rhinitis. Inhalation and intranasal use result in better, target-specific delivery of corticosteroids. Higher concentrations at the site of action and minimized systemic exposure provide improved therapeutic ratios. However, there is still considerable concern over the risk of systemic side effects. It is the goal of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroid therapy to produce long-lasting therapeutic effects at the site of action and minimize systemic side effects with high clearance, low oral bioavailability and high plasma protein binding. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of corticosteroids used in asthma and allergic rhinitis.

### Monitoring the initial pulmonary absorption of two different beclomethasone dipropionate aerosols employing a human lung reperfusion model [^1129QZAs]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current asthma management guidelines recommend inhaled glucocorticoids as preferred therapy for control of mild persistent, moderate and severe asthma. Glucocorticoids are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents and inhalation is an efficient way to deposit the compound in the therapeutic target tissue. The dose and the percentage of lung deposition as well as the specific receptor binding affinity determine the therapeutic efficacy of the corticosteroid. Prolonged residence of an inhaled glucocorticoid in the lung tissue is associated with an extended duration of action. In contrast, the rate and extend of absorption of the glucocorticoid into systemic circulation might result in systemic adverse effects such as adrenal suppression or decreased bone mineral density. Though the tissue residence time and the time course of distribution into systemic circulation significantly contribute to the risk-benefit value of inhaled corticosteroids the precise determination of the pulmonary absorption is a challenge.

The time course of inhaled drug absorption has been frequently studied in life animals. For this purpose, the drugs are usually administered intratracheally as solution or via intratracheal nebulization. This, however, is not directly comparable to the administration of therapeutically used glucocorticoids in humans which are usually formulated as aerosols or dry powder inhalers containing micronized drug crystals.

The in vivo distribution of inhaled glucocorticoids between human lung tissue and plasma has been determined in patients undergoing thoracotomy. During surgery tissue and plasma samples were obtained and analyzed for drug concentrations which were found to be significantly higher in lung tissue compared to plasma. The strength of this type of evaluation is that tissue concentrations of the drug can be measured up to ten or more hours after inhalation. However, one patient provides one data point only and thus many patients are needed to sufficiently describe a time course of tissue – plasma distribution.

### Therapeutic margin of budesonide in patients with mild to severe asthma [^113iAdpC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The therapeutic margin of a drug is the difference between the optimal effective dose and the dose at which unacceptable adverse effects occur. This margin is particularly important in the case of therapies that are used long term for the control of chronic illnesses, such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in the treatment of asthma. Because data from controlled clinical studies indicate that the available ICSs have similar clinical efficacy, the safety profile is central to differentiating between them on the basis of their therapeutic margins. The main safety concern with long-term use and high doses of ICSs is systemic exposure that could result in such unwanted effects as cortisol suppression, a reduction in the final adult height of pediatric patients, and decreased bone mineral density.

Objective

This article reviews data from clinical trials, including long-term prospective studies, to compare the therapeutic margin of budesonide with those of other second-generation ICSs and to determine whether there are variations in the therapeutic margin with different delivery devices, severities of disease, or patient age.

Results

Based on the tolerability data for budesonide from short-term (6–12 wk) and long-term (1–9 y) studies in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma, the dose-response and dose-tolerability curves for budesonide delivered by dry-powder inhaler can be plotted in parallel. The margin between these curves-the therapeutic margin-is favorable and consistent in pediatric and adult patients and at all degrees of asthma severity. Fewer tolerability data are available for other ICSS.

Conclusion

Whereas budesonide has clinical efficacy similar to that of other currently available ICSs, it has a good safety profile-and hence a favorable therapeutic margin-that is supported by long-term clinical data. Budesonides favorable therapeutic margin is probably a result of its pharmacokinetic and physical properties.

### Relevance of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled corticosteroids to asthma [^111x53RE]. The European Respiratory Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have shaped the efficacy and safety of these agents in the treatment of asthma. Important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that can enhance the efficacy of ICS include small particle size, high glucocorticoid-receptor-binding affinity, long pulmonary residence time and lipid conjugation. These characteristics can increase or prolong the anti-inflammatory effects of an ICS. Important pharmacokinetic characteristics that can enhance the safety of ICS include on-site activation in the lung, low oropharyngeal exposure, negligible oral bioavailability, high protein-binding and rapid systemic clearance. The degree of oropharyngeal exposure is relevant to local side-effects, such as oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia and coughing. Pharmacokinetic properties that influence the degree of systemic exposure are relevant to the pharmacodynamic effect of ICS-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and cortisol suppression, an indicator of potential long-term systemic side-effects, such as reduced growth velocity and bone density, fractures, and skin bruising and thinning. Therefore, significant differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the currently available inhaled corticosteroids warrant careful consideration when used in clinical practice as they may result in differences in efficacy and local and systemic safety profiles.

### Budesonide [^116v9U3n]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dose and highest recommended dose of budesonide inhalation suspension, based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in the following table.

2.1 Dosing Recommendations

Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:

Bronchodilators alone: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily

In symptomatic children not responding to non-steroidal therapy, a starting dose of 0.25 mg once daily may be considered. If once-daily treatment does not provide adequate control, the total daily dose should be increased and/or administered as a divided dose. In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.

2.2 Directions for Use

Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration of budesonide inhalation suspension and, therefore, are NOT recommended.

The effects of mixing budesonide inhalation suspension with other nebulizable medications have not been adequately assessed. Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered separately in the nebulizer [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

A Pari-LC-Jet Plus®Nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a Pari Master®compressor was used to deliver budesonide inhalation suspension to each patient in 3 U.S. controlled clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established.

### Distribution of receptor targets in the lung [^113xT3Ve]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Most of the drugs that are currently used to treat airway diseases interact with receptors expressed by cells in the airways. This makes inhaled delivery efficient because it reaches the key target cells and has a low risk of systemic side effects. Both beta(2)-agonists and anticholinergics target autonomic receptors on airway smooth muscle of large and small airways. Inhaled beta(2)-agonists also interact with beta(2)-receptors expressed on other important target cells, including mast cells and postcapillary venules. Anticholinergic bronchodilators target M(3) muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle, which in small airways may be activated by extraneuronal acetylcholine. Corticosteroids target glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which are widely distributed so that they are best given by inhalation to interact with intracellular GR in the respiratory tract and to avoid side effects from activation of GR in extrapulmonary tissues such as bone. By contrast, cysteinyl-leukotriene 1 receptors are mainly expresses in airway smooth muscle so that antileukotrienes are less effective clinically than beta(2)-agonists and corticosteroids, but oral delivery is possible as there are minimal side effects. There are many other receptor targets in lung and for several of these receptors, such as receptors for chemotactic agonists, selective antagonists are in clinical development. For drugs that inhibit chemotactic receptors, systemic delivery is more appropriate to prevent the inflammatory cells that bear these receptors from being recruited into the airways by locally released chemotactic factors. Many novel receptors, including orphan receptors, have now been identified as these may be future targets for developing novel therapies for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Initial starting dose of inhaled corticosteroids in adults with asthma: a systematic review [^113c4Np1]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma guidelines vary in their recommendations for the initial dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in asthma. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to establish the optimal starting dose of ICS for asthma in adults.

Methods

Randomised controlled trials comparing two doses of the same ICS in adults with asthma and no concomitant inhaled or oral corticosteroid were assessed. Included trials were analysed according to the following ICS dose comparisons: high (≥ 800 microg/day beclomethasone (BDP)) versus moderate (400 < 800 microg/day BDP) (n = 7); moderate versus low (< 400 microg/day BDP) (n = 6); step down versus constant dose (n = 4).

Results

Fourteen publications describing 13 trials were included in the review. Studies (n = 4) that compared a step down approach with a constant moderate/low dose of ICS found no difference in lung function, symptoms, or rescue medications between the two treatment approaches (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the change in morning peak flow after treatment with high compared with moderate dose ICS. When compared with low dose ICS, moderate dose ICS significantly improved morning peak flow (change from baseline WMD 11.14 l/min, 95% CI 1.34 to 20.93) and nocturnal symptoms (SMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.06).

Conclusions

For patients with asthma who require ICS, starting with a moderate dose is equivalent to starting with a high dose and stepping down. The small non-significant benefits of starting with a high ICS dose are not of sufficient clinical benefit to warrant its use. Initial moderate ICS doses appear to be more effective than an initial low ICS dose.

### Comparison of inhaled corticosteroids: an update [^116nWEvz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the basis for the estimated comparative daily dosages of inhaled corticosteroids for children and adults that are presented in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Expert Panel Report 3; in addition, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic basis for potential clinical differences among inhaled corticosteroids is discussed.

Data Sources

A complete MEDLINE search was conducted of human studies of asthma pharmacotherapy published between January 1, 2001, and March 15, 2006, followed by a PubMed search up until August 2008, using ciclesonide, inhaled corticosteroids, and pharmacokinetics as key words. Product information on each inhaled corticosteroid was also included.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Comparative clinical trials of inhaled corticosteroids and systematic reviews for efficacy comparisons were evaluated. Extensive literature reviews, meta-analyses, and selected clinical studies that illustrate or represent specific points of view were selected. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data extracted from previously published reviews and specific studies were included.

Data Synthesis

Pharmacodynamic characteristics (glucocorticoid receptor binding) and lung delivery determine the relative clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties (oral bioavailability, lung retention, systemic clearance) and determine comparative therapeutic index of the inhaled corticosteroids. Secondary pharmacokinetic differences (intracellular fatty acid esterification, high serum protein binding) that have been posited to improve duration of action and/or therapeutic index are unproven, and current comparative clinical trials do not support the hypotheses that they provide an advantage. Ultrafine particle meter-dose inhalers (MDIs) have not demonstrated superior asthma control or improved safety over older MDIs. All of the inhaled corticosteroids demonstrate efficacy with once-daily dosing, and all are more effective when dosed twice daily.

Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that all of the inhaled corticosteroids have sufficient therapeutic indexes to provide similar efficacy and safety in low to medium doses. Whether or not some of the newer inhaled corticosteroids offer any advantages at higher doses has yet to be determined.

In this article, we briefly summarise evidence for the effectiveness and safety of ICS in COPD, gleaned from both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We comment on patient characteristics guiding recommended use and the factors contributing to the ongoing overuse of ICS in COPD. We also include strategies for safe ICS withdrawal. Lastly, we provide a practical guide to appropriate ICS prescribing, to help primary care providers identify those patients for whom the benefits of ICS are likely to outweigh the risks. In doing so, we hope to enable and encourage evidence-based use of ICS in COPD.

### Expected characteristics of an ideal, all-purpose inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma [^117VdEg6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are well established as the mainstay of asthma therapy. A number of ICSs are now available, each with unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and physical characteristics.

Objective

This article reviews the key characteristics of an ideal ICS and uses examples of existing agents to indicate the extent to which therapies reach these goals.

Results

Improved therapeutic efficacy in an ICS may be offset by an increase in systemic effects. The ideal characteristics of an ICS include optimal clinical efficacy and no toxicity in combination with a convenient and easy-to-use inhaler device. To achieve this optimal profile, an ICS should have the following: a high affinity for and potency at the glucocorticoid receptor; prolonged retention in the lung; minimal or no oral bioavailability (ie, high first-pass inactivation); and rapid, complete systemic inactivation. The formulation and type of inhaler device are also important considerations: they should provide deposition in the lung in both large and small airways with no absorption effects outside the lung. ICSs should be evaluated for administration with several different delivery devices to ensure ease of use by patients of all ages with different asthma severities. An ICS that can be administered QD is also likely to improve patient adherence by simplifying the treatment regimen.

Conclusion

An ideal ICS should have a large therapeutic margin, be used safely and effectively for long periods, be administered QD, be suitable for use in patients of all ages and asthma severities, and offer both control and prevention of asthma symptoms and exacerbations.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^113fCEr7]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

### Pharmaceutical characteristics that influence the clinical efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids [^111qAC7M]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the most effective therapy for the management of persistent asthma. The aim of ICS therapy is to achieve a high anti-inflammatory effect in the airways with a concomitant low risk of unwanted local and systemic effects. Direct estimates of clinical efficacy and potency based on studies in humans are difficult to interpret.

Objective

To examine the challenges of using alternative estimates of ICS efficacy and potency, including pharmaceutical characteristics.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Articles published from 1990 to 2002 on the potency, efficacy, and tolerability of ICSs were identified using MEDLINE and in-house databases and were then reviewed. Search terms included inhaled corticosteroid, budesonide, fluticasone, beclomethasone, mometasone, and potency.

Results

Differences among ICSs can be readily shown using preclinical measures, such as glucocorticoid receptor binding or skin blanching tests. However, pharmaceutical (delivery and pharmacokinetic) differences of ICSs can have a greater impact on clinical efficacy than in vitro potency differences. For example, the unique esterification of budesonide in the airways prolongs its local activity and may contribute positively to its efficacy and therapeutic index. Although comparative clinical trials suggest 6-fold differences in potencies among ICSs, there is currently no evidence to support differences in efficacy when they are administered at equipotent dosages.

Conclusions

Greater preclinical potency of an ICS does not imply greater clinical efficacy. Pharmacokinetic factors can have a significant impact on relative clinical efficacy.

### Predictors of a more favourable response to combined therapy with salmeterol and fluticasone as initial maintenance therapy in asthma [^116yEEML]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Orally inhaled corticosteroids represent the usually recommended initial controller therapy for most patients with persistent asthma. Some patients might benefit from earlier use of a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an orally inhaled long-acting beta agonist, however. We wished to identify clinical characteristics of patients which would enable one to identify a sub-group of patients who would benefit most from initiating sustained controller therapy with combination therapy.

Methods

We carried out a secondary analysis of five randomized clinical trials including 1606 subjects in order to examine whether differences in baseline characteristics of patients might predict a greater preferential response to combination therapy with salmeterol and fluticasone.

Results

Subjects whose asthma had been present for 10 or more years were 2.2 times more likely to achieve well-controlled asthma by 12 weeks on combination therapy, while subjects with a shorter duration of asthma were only 1.4 times as likely to achieve asthma control with combination therapy as opposed to inhaled corticosteroids alone. None of the other factors examined including symptom frequency or severity, rescue beta-agonist use, severity of lung function impairment or degree of reversibility, was able to distinguish subjects who would benefit preferentially from such combination therapy.

Conclusions

Longer duration of asthma might be used to identify subjects who will benefit more from combined maintenance therapy with a long-acting beta agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid rather than an inhaled corticosteroid alone.

### Effect of inhaled corticosteroid particle size on asthma efficacy and safety outcomes: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^113EyadX]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For the safety endpoints considered, no appreciable differences were observed for most endpoints though it should be noted that the majority of studies were not designed to test treatment differences for safety endpoints. Adult/adolescent patients experienced more local steroid effects with standard particles than small particles. The observation that the local steroid effects at the upper airways favored small particles was likely due to the fact that CIC is administered as a pro-drug which is only activated in the lower airways. Overall, the cortisol data were variable with no clear differentiations between particle sizes.

Particle size, lung deposition, and clinical outcomes

Although there is a relationship between smaller particle size and increased delivery to the distal lung, the current study demonstrated that increased deposition in the distal lung does not appear to translate into improved clinical outcomes for patients with asthma. These results are unsurprising for a number of reasons, not least because an increased proportion of the inhaled dose is likely to deposit in the distal respiratory compartment beyond the conducting airways. Based on current understanding, the effect of using an aerosol with smaller particle size or a 'finer' aerosol is both to increase the dose reaching the lungs by reducing the oropharyngeal deposition and to increase the proportion of that dose depositing distally. While simplistically this increased distal deposition might be considered to result in increased deposition in the 'small airways', it is important to recognize the increased deposition in fact occurs in the respiratory compartment beyond the conducting airways.

In considering the impact of ICS with different particle sizes it is important to understand the factors influencing the pattern of deposition of an aerosol in the complex 3D structure formed by the conducting airways (large and small) and pulmonary/alveolar compartments of the lung. Current mathematical modeling methods combined with 3D imaging suggest that the vast majority of inhaled aerosol (> 90%) inhaled during tidal breathing is delivered to the pulmonary/alveolar compartment beyond the conducting airways, and this will increase with the modified inspiratory breath when using a pMDI (with or without a holding chamber). Hence for a given dose administered to the conducting airways (large, medium, and small), the dose delivered more distally will be relatively greater with the 'finer' aerosol. With such a small proportion of the aerosol depositing in the conducting airways it is unlikely that there will be a major change in the concentration of aerosol at the epithelial surface of the conducting airways. This is particularly true of the small conducting airways which have a much greater relative surface area than the more central airways.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115CDv4a]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD — general considerations — indicate limited steroid responsiveness and uncertain long-term safety: "In vitro evidence suggests that COPD-associated inflammation has limited responsiveness to corticosteroids. Moreover, some drugs including beta2-agonists, theophylline or macrolides may partially facilitate corticosteroid sensitivity in COPD. The clinical relevance of this effect has not yet been fully established". In vivo data "suggest that the dose-response relationships and long-term (> 3 years) safety of ICS in people with COPD are unclear and require further investigation". Additionally, "both current and ex-smokers with COPD benefit from ICS use in terms of lung function and exacerbation rates, although the magnitude of the effect is lower in heavy or current smokers compared to light or ex-smokers".

### Pharmacologic characteristics and adrenal suppression with newer inhaled corticosteroids: a comparison of ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate [^115rB6ba]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the most potent anti-inflammatory choice for patients with asthma. Selecting the most appropriate ICS for a patient requires a thorough understanding of the pharmacologic properties of each drug.

Objective

This review details the pharmacologic properties of ciclesonide (CIC) and fluticasone propionate (FP) and reviews the available data on suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as a measure of systemic exposure and safety profile.

Methods

Clinical studies and case reports were identified through a MEDLINE and EMBASE search of English-language articles. The databases were searched for the years 1990 to April 2005 using the terms ciclesonide, fluticasone, ICS, and adrenal suppression. All studies were clinical trials of pharmacologic properties of the ICSs in humans.

Results

A total of 1082 articles were identified. CIC and FP are 2 of the most potent ICSs. Both have high receptor-binding affinities (12 times and 18 times that of dexamethasone, respectively), and both may provide enhanced respiratory effects through a prolonged pulmonary residence time. The CIC metered dose inhaler dispenses smaller and more highly respirable particles than FP (1.1–2.1 pm vs 2.8–3.2 microm, respectively). Therefore, a greater percentage of administered CIC is topically deposited in the lungs (52% vs 12% to 13% for FP). CIC is delivered as an inactive parent compound, which is converted to its active metabolite, desisobutyryl-CIC (des-CIC), by esterases in the airways. More than 50% of a dose of CIC is deposited and distributed evenly throughout the lungs of healthy adults; lipid conjugation in the lung also may increase lung residence time. On entering the systemic circulation, both corticosteroids are rapidly cleared by the liver (elimination half-life of 3.5 hours for CIC vs 7.8 hours for FP). However, plasma protein binding is greater with CIC/des-CIC (99%/ approximately 99%) than FP (90%), resulting in reduced amounts of des-CIC (< I%) versus FP (10%) circulating free in the plasma. Although studies of low or medium doses of FP have produced conflicting results, high doses of FP (> 660 pg/d) may result in adrenal suppression. CIC has not been reported to produce any significant adrenal suppression throughout its studied dose range (up to 1280 micro/d).

Conclusions

A review of the literature suggests that CIC, as compared with FP, achieves greater pulmonary deposition, causes fewer adverse oropharyngeal effects, deposits less biologically active drug in the systemic circulation, and has less potential for adrenal suppression.

### Side effects with inhaled corticosteroids: the physician's perception [^115hM74j]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 1997 guidelines and 2002 update provide an overview of potential local and systemic side effects associated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and suggest ways of minimizing the risk of these side effects occurring. Despite the guidelines and extensive clinical experience of the safe use of ICS, a significant number of physicians retain concerns regarding side effects. Local side effects may lead to patients discontinuing therapy, with or without the knowledge of their physicians. In particular, concerns regarding systemic side effects, such as growth retardation in children and osteoporosis, remain relatively widespread. Pharmacokinetic studies reveal that different ICS compounds and formulations result in different degrees of systemic bioavailability, indicating possible differences in their potential to cause systemic side effects. However, clinical studies that can be used to differentiate between ICS formulations are generally lacking. Consequently, there is a need to continue to further our understanding of side effects with ICS, with the aim of identifying formulations, devices, and doses with an optimal risk/benefit ratio. The introduction of new agents with potentially improved safety profiles may reassure physicians and patients as to the relative benefits of ICS therapy in asthma.

### The bioavailability and airway clearance of the steroid component of budesonide / formoterol and salmeterol / fluticasone after inhaled administration in patients with COPD and healthy subjects: a randomized controlled trial [^1168bBgT]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in combination with a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) are recommended for the treatment of patients with severe COPD and a history of repeated exacerbations. Two such combinations, budesonide/formoterol and salmeterol/fluticasone, are licensed for use in COPD and a number of randomized, double-blind clinical studies have demonstrated improvements in lung function and reduced numbers of exacerbations with their use.

Although these combinations both contain an ICS and a LABA, differences exist with regard to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of both components, such as the oral bioavailability and clearance, volume of distribution and speed of airway uptake, which may impact on the clinical efficacy and safety of the treatments. The degree of lipophilicity, for example, varies widely. Budesonide is several times less lipophilic than fluticasone and, as a result, dissolves more readily in airway mucus and is more rapidly absorbed into the airway tissue and systemic circulation. Fluticasone, being more lipophilic and thus less water soluble, is more likely to be retained in the lumen of the airways and therefore, has a greater chance of being removed from the airways by mucociliary clearance and cough. These differences in lipophilicity may be particularly relevant in patients with severe COPD because marked airflow obstruction will lead to greater proximal deposition of inhaled drugs and therefore mucociliary clearance. Indeed, previous studies in patients with asthma and airflow obstruction have shown that the systemic exposure of fluticasone is more affected by lung function than budesonide.

This is the first study to investigate and clarify the absorption of the two ICSs, budesonide and fluticasone delivered via ICS/LABA combination products, in patients with severe COPD and healthy subjects. The novel aspect of the study is the assessment of the proportion of ICS that is expectorated in sputum in patients with severe COPD.

### Review of the unique properties of budesonide [^117Et2U1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for asthma is to attain high therapeutic activity in the airways while keeping the risk of systemic adverse effects relatively low. However, the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of various ICSs affect this ratio, thereby influencing their ability to fulfill the requirements of an ideal agent.

Objective

This article reviews the physical and pharmacokinetic properties of budesonide, outlining how they, safety data, and use of different inhalation devices enable budesonide to meet many of the clinical requirements of an ideal ICS for the treatment of asthma.

Results

ICS efficacy is influenced by lipophilicity, lung deposition, and retention in airway tissue, whereas the rate of elimination determines systemic activity. Budesonide is retained in the airways to a greater extent than other ICSs because of an esterification process that increases its lipophilicity. The prolonged retention of budesonide in the airways may contribute to its efficacy when administered QD. In addition to a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, budesonide is available as a dry-powder inhaler and in nebulized form, which can be used by asthma patients aged ≥ 6 months.

Conclusions

When combined with delivery devices suitable for a spectrum of patient groups, the physical and pharmacokinetic properties of budesonide lend it many of the characteristics of an ideal ICS, including favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles.

### Relative receptor affinity comparisons among inhaled / intranasal corticosteroids: perspectives on clinical relevance [^114oeRg3]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

As a case in point, I refer to a recent publication in Respiratory Research (2007:8:54) in which Valotis and Högger report data comparing the glucocorticoid-receptor and lung-tissue binding affinities of FF, FP, and MF While the methodology of the study and the resulting data are sound, the authors imply, that a high receptor affinity, such as the one reported in this publication for FF, improves the local efficacy of a topical glucocorticoid (see Background section of the article) and that the high relative receptor affinity of the "enhanced-affinity" FF "that exceeds the RRAs of all other clinically used glucocorticoids" "may contribute to a highly efficacious profile for FF". To be fair, Högger's group is not the only one confusing potency and efficacy of inhaled glucocorticoids, as the interchangeable use of the two terms can be found throughout the literature, often with the underlying assumption that a high affinity glucocorticoid must be the better one. The clinical and pharmacologic reality, however, is that "potency" and "efficacy" are not interchangeable terms and that differences in the receptor affinity do not necessarily translate into differences in local or clinical efficacy. It only indicates that for a "weaker" glucocorticoid, higher concentrations at the site of action are necessary to achieve the same pharmacodynamic effect. In the clinical setting, differences in potency, therefore can be overcome by adjusting the dose. Therefore, two glucocorticoids that differ only in the receptor binding affinity (e.g. by 25%) would show the same clinical efficacy and systemic side effects when the "weaker" steroid is given at a 25% higher dose.

In summary, while it is not my intent to discredit the importance of studying RRA, I am recommending caution in the interpretation of and reliance on such data, particularly when claims of clinical distinction are drawn. As recent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic evaluations have shown, the topical selectivity and local targeting of glucocorticoids is independent of the binding affinity and solely determined by pharmacokinetic properties.

### Rational use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD [^116n9qVp]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

ICS use in asthma versus COPD

ICS are absorbed systemically from the peripheral lung and exert their immunosuppressant effects locally in the upper and lower airways, as well as potentially inducing systemic immunosuppressant effects. In most patients with asthma, low doses of ICS are highly effective in reducing chronic eosinophilic inflammation of the airways. However, the lung inflammation characteristic of COPD is predominantly neutrophilic. This difference in inflammatory endotype accounts for corticosteroid resistance in the majority of patients with COPD, with no effect on inflammation, disease progression or mortality, and only a small improvement in spirometry/reduction in exacerbations. Only a minority of patients with COPD have an eosinophilic phenotype – and can therefore be considered corticosteroid sensitive, as reflected in COPD treatment guidelines.

Although the term "asthma-COPD overlap" is no longer in widespread use, patients with COPD can have concomitant asthma. Prevalence estimates vary, and some evidence suggests that asthma is over-diagnosed in patients with COPD. However, in cases where COPD and asthma are confirmed to coexist, pharmacotherapy should predominantly follow asthma guidelines (i.e. prescription of ICS).

Key points
ICS are very effective in treating asthma, even at low doses, due to their effects on eosinophilic inflammation.
In most patients with COPD, airway inflammation is not eosinophilic, and even high doses of ICS have poor efficacy.
ICS use should be limited to patients with eosinophilic COPD and those with concomitant asthma.

### Combination formoterol and inhaled steroid versus beta2-agonist as relief medication for chronic asthma in adults and children [^115uftTn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Formoterol has a fast onset of action and can therefore be used to relieve symptoms of asthma. A combination inhaler can deliver formoterol with different doses of inhaled corticosteroid; when used as a reliever both drugs will be delivered more frequently when asthma symptoms increase. This has the potential to treat both bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the early stages of exacerbations.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of combined inhalers containing both formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid when used for reliever therapy in adults and children with chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

We last searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in adults and children with chronic asthma, where a combination inhaler containing formoterol and inhaled corticosteroid is compared with fast-acting beta2-agonist alone for the relief of asthma symptoms. This should be the only planned difference between the trial arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the characteristics and results of each study. Authors or manufacturers were asked to supply unpublished data in relation to primary outcomes.

Main Results

Three trials involving 5905 participants were included. In patients with mild asthma who do not need maintenance treatment, no clinically important advantages of budesonide/formoterol as reliever were found in comparison to formoterol as reliever. Two studies enrolled patients with more severe asthma who were not controlled on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (around 700 mcg/day in adults), and had suffered a clinically important asthma exacerbation in the past year. Hospitalisations related to asthma in the two studies comparing budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief with the same dose of budesonide/formoterol for maintenance with terbutaline for relief yielded an odds ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.16), which was not a statistically significant reduction. One adult study found a reduction in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids compared to terbutaline, odds ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.74) and the study in children found less serious adverse events with budesonide/formoterol used for maintenance and relief. There was no significant difference in annual growth in children using budesonide/formoterol reliever in comparison to terbutaline.

Authors' Conclusions

In mild asthma it is not yet known whether patients who use a budesonide/formoterol inhaler for relief of asthma symptoms derive any clinically important benefits. In more severe asthma, one study that enrolled patients who were not controlled on quite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, and had suffered an exacerbation in the previous year, demonstrated a reduction in the risk of exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids with budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief in comparison with budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and terbutaline or formoterol for relief. The incidence of serious adverse events in children was also less using budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief in one study, which similarly enrolled children who were not controlled on medium to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, and compared to terbutaline relief with an explorative maintenance dose of budesonide/formoterol that is not approved for treatment.

Biomarkers in COPD — There is rapidly increasing interest in the use of biomarkers in COPD. Biomarkers are characteristics (either clinical, functional, biologic and/or imaging) that are objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological or pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses to therapeutic interventions, and in general such data has proven difficult to interpret, largely as a result of weak associations and lack of reproducibility between large patient cohorts. At present blood eosinophil counts (≥ 300 cells/μL) provide guidance to identify COPD patients at higher risk of exacerbations and more likely to benefit from preventive treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.

### Inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β ₂-agonist pharmacological profiles: effective asthma therapy in practice [^111hgwgB]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) have been used to manage asthma for several years. They are the preferred therapy option for patients who do not achieve optimal control of their asthma with low-dose ICS monotherapy. In Europe, four ICS/LABA products are commercially available for asthma maintenance therapy (fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate, budesonide/formoterol fumarate and beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate), and other combinations are likely to be developed over the next few years (e.g. mometasone/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, mometasone/indacaterol). Data from randomized, controlled, clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear overall efficacy difference among ICS/LABA combinations approved for asthma therapy. Conversely, pharmacological data indicate that there may be certain advantages to using one ICS or LABA over another because of the specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles associated with particular treatments. This review article summarizes the pharmacological characteristics oft he various ICSs and LABAs available for the treatment of asthma, including the potential for ICS and LABA synergy, and gives an insight into the rationale for the development of the latest ICS/LABA combination approved for asthma maintenance therapy.

### Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of synthetic glucocorticoids: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Mj64S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widely used drugs because of their anti-inflammatory effects, with an annual prevalence estimated at approximately 24% in 2022 in The Netherlands, including systemic, inhaled, nasal, and topical glucocorticoids. Although these drugs are very efficacious, they can be accompanied by (severe) side effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms and disorders, such as mood changes, depression, anxiety, mania, delirium, and even suicidality, with devastating effects on quality of life. While at low doses many synthetic glucocorticoids do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, their use has been associated with a higher likelihood of mood and anxiety disorders. This includes particular types of inhaled glucocorticoids. In terms of biological effects, van der Meulen et al (2022) found associations of systemic and inhaled glucocorticoid use with reduced white matter integrity in the brain in a large sample from the UK Biobank. In addition, Kachroo et al (2022) found systemic effects in metabolomic profiles of inhaled glucocorticoids, even in use of low-dose glucocorticoids. Next to macroscopic and metabolomic changes, there is a plethora of neurochemical processes that may be affected by glucocorticoid medication.

The endogenous glucocorticoid hormones cortisol and corticosterone target 2 receptor types, the high affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the lower affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast, synthetic glucocorticoids have been developed based on a high affinity for GR, which mediates their many and potent anti-inflammatory effects even though relative affinities differ. The most common assumption is that overactivation of the GR — in particular during the natural trough of cortisol secretion — mediates the adverse effects of glucocorticoid medication on the brain. A complementary view is that suppressed cortisol secretion via GR-dependent negative feedback contributes to mental side effects by depleting the MR from its ligand. This notion leads to the prediction that re-activation of the MR with cortisol add-on will counteract these adverse effects. There is preliminary evidence that this approach is beneficial in patients with leukemia, but this finding is not replicated in the same study population that included only patients with clinically relevant neurobehavioral problems. Currently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is ongoing to investigate the prevention of neuropsychiatric adverse effects caused by dexamethasone in an adult brain tumor population. The occurrence of central side effects is expected to depend on the potency to activate MR and GR, pharmacokinetic characteristics route of administration, dose, and duration of exposure to the particular drug. It is not exactly known in what frequency psychiatric adverse effects occur with the different glucocorticoids that are available.

### What harm are we doing to our patients with asthma by using high-dose inhaled corticosteroids? [^116emt7J]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids have been a cornerstone of antiinflammatory therapy for more than 6 decades, including for asthma. Despite their effectiveness, serious adverse effects remain a major safety limitation. Concerns over these side effects have been further heightened with the evidence that dose-associated risks are cumulative, with a threshold of 1.5 g, equivalent to approximately four bursts of prednisone.

The development of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) mitigated many of these adverse effect concerns. ICSs provide direct antiinflammatory effects on the asthmatic airway, realizing benefits in microgram rather than milligram doses. Principal worries about adverse events of ICSs are largely from local oropharyngeal deposition: hoarseness, odynophagia, and oral fungal infections. Based on their efficacy and presumed safety, ICSs have become the asthma "controller" treatment of choice for millions of patients. With increasing disease severity, the guidelines recommend escalation of ICS doses (typically in a stepwise fashion) to achieve symptom control. For example, a high-dose ICS (≥ 1,000 μg/d of beclomethasone or equivalent), usually in combination with another controller drug, is recommended for patients with Global Initiative for Asthma step 5 disease severity, although in reality, many patients with even lesser disease severity are treated with high-dose ICSs. In other therapeutic areas, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ICSs, especially in high doses, have been associated with increased risk of serious adverse effects, such as pneumonia. However, the safety data of ICSs in asthma have been inconsistent.

### Budesonide (Pulmicort) [^117N41SV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be administered twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used.

The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established.

After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1–2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control.

2.1 Asthma

If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.

Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily.

Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily.

For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved.

Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief.

If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116gcij6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) — As a last resort, add-on low-dose OCS (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone equivalent) may be considered for some adults with severe asthma (Evidence D), but maintenance OCS is often associated with substantial cumulative side effects (Evidence A). It should only be considered for adults with poor symptom control and/or frequent exacerbations despite good inhaler technique and adherence with Step 5 treatment, and after exclusion of other contributory factors and trial of other add-on treatments including biologics where available and affordable. Patients should be counseled about potential side-effects, and they should be assessed and monitored for risk of adrenal suppression and corticosteroid-induced side effects.

### Significant receptor affinities of metabolites and a degradation product of mometasone furoate [^1143C3E8]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In contrast to other inhaled corticosteroids MF generates an active metabolite, 6β-OH MF, in the liver. The degradation product 9,11-epoxy MF, which is formed in human lung tissue and plasma, exhibits significant receptor affinity as well. Additionally, we found that 9,11-epoxy MF undergoes follow-up reactions. Our data contribute to the understanding of how the claimed low bioavailability of MF parent compound after inhalation might still be accompanied by HPA axis suppression. Thus, our findings are consistent with both pharmacokinetic and clinical data. We strongly suggest a clinical trial that determines both efficacy and safety in parallel as well as all known metabolites and degradation products after application of MF.

### Developing the ideal inhaled corticosteroid [^117Dc15M]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered the most effective asthma therapy, but concerns remain about side effects. The ideal ICS would have a larger therapeutic ratio than currently available agents, allowing doses to be increased but without greatly increasing the frequency or severity of adverse events. The ideal ICS would possess the following pharmacokinetic properties to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects: high pulmonary deposition, conversion to an active metabolite, high receptor potency, high pulmonary retention, low oral bioavailability, extensive metabolism, and rapid elimination. The new ICS ciclesonide has been shown to possess many of these characteristics. Ciclesonide has also been shown to improve lung function, to treat the underlying inflammation, to be effective as monotherapy in patients with persistent asthma, to have reduced side effects compared with other ICS, and to be easy to use with once-daily dosing. However, as with all new products, the advantages witnessed in clinical trials still have to be demonstrated to be beneficial long-term in general clinical use. ICS with an improved therapeutic index may have the potential to increase patient adherence, enhance the use of ICS monotherapy in the primary care setting, and increase the range of patients for whom ICS monotherapy would be appropriate.

### New developments in corticosteroids [^113zQ3iw]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

The goal of inhaled corticosteroid therapy is the targeted delivery of drug into the lung to achieve distinct pulmonary effects with reduced systemic side effects. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessment of pulmonary delivery suggests that an ideal inhaled corticosteroid and/or its delivery system should have the following characteristics: high pulmonary deposition efficiency, low oral bioavailability, high systemic clearance, optimized pulmonary residence time, and selective binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Therefore, future developments will focus on improved delivery devices with higher pulmonary deposition; drugs or drug formulations providing prolonged pulmonary residence time (e.g., use of liposomes, microspheres, and nanothin coatings, or use of biological systems that achieve prolonged pulmonary residence time by ester formation and reactivation); drugs with efficient systemic clearance (e.g., soft drugs/hydrolyzable drugs); and/or improved pharmacodynamic selectivity.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1111cf8t]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD exacerbations — systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

### Potential adverse effects of the inhaled corticosteroids [^115gD44H]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide the clinician with an update on the potential adverse effects caused by the inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). The systemic effects of ICSs are a result of that portion swallowed and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and not eliminated by first-pass metabolism and that portion delivered to the lung and absorbed. If administered in high enough doses, any of the ICSs will produce clinically significant systemic activity. This review will explore the risks for clinically significant adverse effects from sustained use of ICSs, as recommended by the current guidelines. The standard method for assessing systemic activity in short-term studies is measurement of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function. The ICSs provided in the medium dose range can produce measurable effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. However, clinically significant suppression is unlikely to occur except at high doses. The effect on growth in children over 1 to 4 years occurs at low to medium doses, might be dependent on the specific ICS, and is small (1–2 cm). The data are insufficient to determine whether there is an effect on attainment of predicted adult height. The ICSs affect bone mineral density and risk of fractures in a dose-dependent fashion that appears significant at high doses.

### Multidimensional analyses to assess the relations between treatment choices by physicians and patients' characteristics: the example of COPD [^114uS7y6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Associations between treatments and clinical characteristics

There appeared to be separate gradients in the use of ICS + LABA, short acting bronchodilators, nebulised treatments and oral corticosteroids, and respiratory support. Such data suggest that several independent (at least in part) factors influence treatment choices. The very low variation of pharmacological treatments explained by clinical subtype is in line with data from other studies, which showed that the treatment of COPD is notably heterogeneous, either for stable disease or exacerbations. This can be due to several factors. Firstly, some physicians may have their own "specific" and "patient-independent" therapeutic habits. This could have prevented us from detecting an overall strategy since the investigator effect could not be taken into account due to the too low number of patients per physician. Secondly, the investigator's therapeutic strategy may depend mostly on what was already prescribed to the patient in the past. This might not be detected since this was a cross-sectional study, providing only a snapshot of the situation at a given time and preventing from capturing the evolution of the treatment strategy over time. In addition, we did not record treatment changes that were decided during the visit, which would have allowed us to detect how new prescriptions were influenced by previous treatments. Thirdly and most importantly, physicians may consider that currently available treatments are not markedly different in terms of efficacy and safety profile. This would be in accordance with the impossibility to identify well-defined subgroups of responders or non-responders in recent major treatment trials. This can be explained in two ways: either recorded patients characteristics are not the correct predictors of response, or response is not adequately defined (e.g. by FEV 1, which is used in most studies). Indeed, available guidelines are quite vague about clinical criteria that may allow to choose, e.g. between available classes of inhaled bronchodilators. This relates to the lack of convincing evidence on the superiority of any treatment in well-defined subgroups, even in large randomised controlled trials. Considering these observations, there is a clear need for further research on phenotypes and predictors of response to treatments.

### Scientific rationale for inhaled combination therapy with long-acting beta2-agonists and corticosteroids [^114HTXh7]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The addition of an inhaled long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) to an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) gives optimal control of asthma in most patients and two fixed combination inhalers (salmeterol/fluticasone and formoterol/budesonide) are increasingly used as a convenient controller in patients with persistent asthma. There is a strong scientific rationale for the combination of these two drug classes. ICS suppress the chronic inflammation of asthma and reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and this is achieved at low doses in most patients. LABA act on different aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma. In addition to their bronchodilator action, LABA also inhibit mast cell mediator release, plasma exudation and may reduce sensory nerve activation. Thus these two classes of drug address complementary aspects of the pathophysiology of asthma that neither drug class is able to achieve alone. There are several positive interactions between LABA and ICS. Corticosteroids increase the expression of beta2-receptors by increasing gene transcription. Experimentally this protects against the loss of beta2-receptors in response to long-term exposure to beta2-agonists. While this is unlikely to be important in bronchodilator responses to beta2-agonists, in view of the large beta-receptor reserve, it is probably important in preventing loss of beta-agonist effects on the nonbronchodilator actions of LABA discussed earlier. beta2-Agonists may potentiate the molecular mechanism of corticosteroid actions, with increased nuclear localization of glucocorticoid receptors and additive or sometimes synergistic suppression of inflammatory mediator release. Thus LABA and ICS may optimize each others beneficial actions in the airways, but the low systemic effects of these drugs do not result in any increase in adverse effects. Long-acting beta2-agonists corticosteroid inhaler therapy is therefore a logical advance and results in effective control of asthma in the majority of patients without significant adverse effects. This simplified approach to long-term asthma therapy has a strong scientific rationale.

### Preclinical properties of budesonide: translation to the clinical setting [^116ruRB7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Since the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) nearly 30 years ago, the management of asthma has been transformed. It is now understood that asthma is primarily a disease of chronic inflammation, even in its milder forms, and that to delay treatment may lead to deterioration in lung function. International treatment guidelines for asthma recommend early intervention with a potent ICS, with the greatest benefit observed when treatment is started within 2 years of the onset of symptoms. Each of the currently available ICSs has distinct physical and pharmacokinetic properties and is delivered via different devices.

Objective

This article brings together the findings and concepts presented in this supplement. It provides an overview of budesonide's predicted clinical efficacy and tolerability in patients with asthma based on its physical properties and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics.

Conclusions

Budesonide's physical properties and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles help predict its clinical efficacy and tolerability when used as early intervention in asthma. Study results indicate that lung deposition of budesonide is increased by delivery via dry-powder inhaler, enhancing the drug's efficacy in patients with newly diagnosed mild persistent asthma. The preclinical, clinical, and safety data support budesonide's predicted performance in the clinical setting.

### An official ATS clinical practice guideline: interpretation of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FENO) for clinical applications [^112mYgJM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

High FENO (> 50 ppb [> 35 ppb in CHILDREN]) or rising FENO (> 40% CHANGE FROM PREVIOUSLY STABLE LEVELS) implies uncontrolled or deteriorating eosinophilic airway inflammation. In a symptomatic patient (chronic cough and/or wheeze and/or shortness of breath during past > 6 wk) presenting for the first time, the patient is likely to benefit from a trial of inhaled corticosteroid treatment. In symptomatic patients with established asthma, contributors include high persistent allergen exposure; inhaled corticosteroid delivery problems (poor adherence, poor inhaler technique, proximal drug deposition with untreated distal airway/alveolar inflammation); or inadequate inhaled corticosteroid dose, which is likely to respond to increased inhaled corticosteroid dose, while truly steroid resistant asthma (a trial of systemic steroid will confirm this: FENO will remain high). In an asymptomatic patient, no change in inhaled corticosteroid dosing, but refer to FENO trend over time in individual patient; withdrawing inhaled corticosteroid is likely to be followed by relapse; an increase in therapy is indicated as some patients are asymptomatic, but the high FENO could be a risk factor for an upcoming exacerbation; and "High" FENO may be normal in a certain percent of the population.

### Budesonide inhalation suspension [^116ExL7Z]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activities and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide dose range of inhaled budesonide in a variety of formulations and delivery systems including an inhalation-driven, multi-dose dry powder inhaler and the inhalation suspension for nebulization. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85 to 95%) and the low potency of metabolites (see below).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The therapeutic effects of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct local action on the respiratory tract. To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in adult patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally administered budesonide, even though systemic budesonide exposure was comparable for both treatments, indicating that the inhaled treatment is working locally in the lung. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract.

### Update on glucocorticoid action and resistance [^116uBHnc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Extensive development of inhaled and oral glucocorticoids has resulted in highly potent molecules that have been optimized to target activity to the lung and minimize systemic exposure. These have proved highly effective for most asthmatic subjects, but despite these developments, there are a number of subjects with asthma who fail to respond to even high doses of inhaled or even oral glucocorticoids. Advances in delineating the fundamental mechanisms of glucocorticoid pharmacology, especially the concepts of transactivation and transrepression and cofactor recruitment, have resulted in better understanding of the molecular mechanisms whereby glucocorticoids suppress inflammation. The existence of multiple mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid insensitivity raises the possibility that this might indeed reflect different diseases with a common phenotype, and studies examining the efficacy of potential new agents should be targeted toward subgroups of patients with severe corticosteroid-resistant asthma who clearly require effective new drugs and other approaches to improved asthma control.

### Systemic adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroid therapy… [^114vQThP]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Lipophilic substitutions of the basic glucocorticosteroid nucleus result in compounds that exhibit a high level of receptor potency and affinity, a high degree of local tissue uptake and retention with topical application, and a high degree of first-pass biotransformation in the liver. Corticosteroids administered by inhalation exhibit a high degree of topical potency at the glucocorticoid receptor, and so delivery of low doses may achieve a high local concentration within the airway. Evidence also suggests that the degree of lipophilicity will determine the dwell time at the local tissue site after topical administration. 11 A high degree of lipophilicity will also result in a larger volume of distribution due to more extensive binding within systemic tissues.

12 In this respect, fluticasone has the highest level of lipophilicity among the inhaled corticosteroids, 9 which may in part explain the greater systemic activity of this compound as a consequence of more prolonged systemic tissue retention. Thus, enhanced lipophilicity may represent a 2-edged sword in terms of greater airway and systemic retention. Thus, most of the respirable dose delivered to the lung will be bioavailable in the systemic circulation as unchanged active drug. For the swallowed moiety, absorption occurs from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal circulation to the liver, where there is a varying degree of first-pass metabolism to inactive metabolites, ie, 70% for beclomethasone, 90% for budesonide and triamcinolone, and 99%. for fluticasone. 14–17 The situation for beclomethasone is somewhat different in that there is partial transformation to metabolites that are active and inactive.

18 It is evident that the lung component of absorption is the larger determinant of the overall systemic bioavailability for inhaled corticosteroids that exhibit a high degree of first-pass inactivation, such as fluticasone, budesonide, and triamcinolone. With all inhaled corticosteroids given at high dosage, there is likely to be a dual effect due to topical bioactivity from the airway dose as well as prednisonelike activity from the systemic bioavailable dose. The component of systemic bioactivity is therefore likely to be greater with fluticasone, which along with its topical potency may contribute to its antiasthmatic effects when given at high doses.

### Treating the side effects of exogenous glucocorticoids; can we separate the good from the bad? [^116RSd7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

All GCs (endogenous and synthetic) bind and activate the GC receptor (GR) (see Classical Steroid Hormone Action section) with differing potencies and have differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Many GCs, although not all, are able to activate the mineralocorticoid (MC) receptor (MR) to varying degrees. In addition, there are numerous different routes of administration (including oral, intravenous, inhaled, and topical). There is therefore a vast spectrum of available drugs and formulations, and the precise choice of agent is determined by their clinical utility and efficacy but also balanced against the potential for adverse effects.

All steroidal synthetic GCs are structurally related to hydrocortisone (cortisol) but have often been modified such that they bind to the GR with a higher affinity and thus have more potent GC actions or have a prolonged half-life. Most synthetic GCs are 21-carbon polycyclic compounds with a basic steroid structure, a fused 17-carbon atom ring system with an aliphatic side chain at carbon-17, a keto-group at carbon-3, 1 or 2 double bonds in the A-ring, and an oxygen at carbon-11 (Fig. 1). Differences in GR and MR activation are determined by the side groups. GC potency is increased by an 11-hydroxy group, while MC potency is increased by a 9α or a 6α-fluoro substituent. In contrast, a hydrophilic substituent at position 16 decreases both MC and GC properties. Metabolism of GCs (both endogenous and synthetic) is a crucial determinant of their ability to activate both GR and MR. While there are multiple enzyme systems that are crucial in clearing GCs, including the A-ring reductases (5α- and 5β-reductases), CYP3A4, and the 20α- and 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, perhaps the most fundamentally important are the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (11βHSDs) (see 11β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 Inhibition section), which regulate target cell GC availability through the dynamic interconversion of active (hydroxy) and the inactive (oxo) forms. The presence of an 11β-hydroxyl group is essential for the anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive effects of GCs and for the sodium-retaining effects of MCs. Therefore, the reversible interconversion of the 11β-hydroxyl into the corresponding 11β-keto group plays a pivotal role in the efficacy of prescribed steroids.

### Pharmacotherapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: molecules and delivery are equally important [^116yD29Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

When prescribing inhaled maintenance therapy for an individual with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, healthcare professionals (HCPs) should ideally perform three steps: 1) assess dyspnea/symptoms and future risk of an exacerbation, 2) select a long-acting inhaled β-agonist and/or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist as well as possibly an inhaled corticosteroid, and 3) select one of four delivery systems. The recent American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline on Pharmacologic Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease addresses four clinically relevant PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome) questions related to inhaled therapies. The recommendations provide up-to-date and authoritative guidance for HCPs when they consider the first two steps of the decision process noted above.

This guideline as well as the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy recommend long-acting inhaled β-agonists, long-acting muscarinic antagonists, and inhaled corticosteroid as groups of medications by necessity rather than as specific molecules with unique delivery systems — pressured metered-dose inhaler, dry powder inhaler, slow/soft mist inhaler, and nebulization. By grouping medications, there are two inherent assumptions: 1) similar but different molecules are comparable in efficacy and 2) inhalation of the molecule into the lower respiratory tract using correct technique is comparable regardless of the delivery system. Unfortunately, this overall approach lacks specific guidance for matching individual patient characteristics such as cognitive function, including coordination ability, manual dexterity, and peak inspiratory flow, with the most appropriate delivery system, each of which requires specific instructions for use.

Algorithms for selecting the most appropriate inhaler delivery system based on patient characteristics have been proposed. However, to our knowledge, randomized trials have not been performed to examine whether a particular algorithm makes a difference in patient outcomes. Appropriate guidance for HCPs in inhaler selection appears to be a major unmet need in caring for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To fill this gap, we encourage professional organizations such as the American Thoracic Society, patient advocacy groups, and pharmaceutical companies to support prospective studies that examine matching molecule and inhaler according to the abilities and skills of the individual patient (i.e. precision medicine). The inhaler delivery system is equal in importance to the prescribed molecule.

### Budesonide inhalation [^116KpBFg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended starting dose and highest recommended dose of budesonide inhalation suspension, based on prior asthma therapy, are listed in the following table.

2.1 Dosing Recommendations

Dosing recommendations based on previous therapy are as follows:

Bronchodilators alone: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily
Inhaled corticosteroids: 0.5 mg once daily or 0.25 mg twice daily up to 0.5 mg twice daily
Oral corticosteroids: 0.5 mg twice daily

In symptomatic children not responding to non-steroidal therapy, a starting dose of 0.25 mg once daily may be considered. If once-daily treatment does not provide adequate control, the total daily dose should be increased and/or administered as a divided dose. In all patients, it is desirable to downward-titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.

2.2 Directions for Use

Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered via jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor with an adequate air flow, equipped with a mouthpiece or suitable face mask. Ultrasonic nebulizers are not suitable for the adequate administration of budesonide inhalation suspension and, therefore, are NOT recommended.

The effects of mixing budesonide inhalation suspension with other nebulizable medications have not been adequately assessed. Budesonide inhalation suspension should be administered separately in the nebulizer [see Patient Counseling Information (17.1)].

A Pari-LC-Jet Plus Nebulizer (with face mask or mouthpiece) connected to a Pari Master compressor was used to deliver budesonide inhalation suspension to each patient in 3 U.S. controlled clinical studies. The safety and efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension delivered by other nebulizers and compressors have not been established.

### Budesonide inhalation [^116Hw9TW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard in vitro and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

The activity of budesonide inhalation suspension is due to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. In vitro studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert.

The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not well known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic- and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.

Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activities and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide dose range of inhaled budesonide in a variety of formulations and delivery systems including an inhalation-driven, multi-dose dry powder inhaler and the inhalation suspension for nebulization. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85 to 95%) and the low potency of metabolites (see below).

### How to match the optimal currently available inhaler device to an individual child with asthma or recurrent wheeze [^113FxMkC]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled medications are the cornerstone of treatment in early-childhood wheezing and paediatric asthma. They should be targeted to areas in the lungs where they will be most effective. Treating paediatric asthma (children aged 5 years or older) with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and bronchodilators has resulted in improvements in asthma control. In early-childhood wheezing (0–4 years), treatment outcomes are less positive probably because of diverse clinical phenotypes. In this young age it is difficult to achieve and maintain an optimal inhalation technique.

The most important advantage of inhaled delivery of medicines is that they are delivered directly into the airways and lungs, resulting in higher local concentrations, lower systemic exposure and fewer systemic side effects compared with the oral or intravenous route. However, inhalation of medicines can be complicated and difficult for some children. Drug deposition in the lungs depends on the type of inhaler device, the characteristics of the inhaled medicine, and on patient-related characteristics.

There are many reports of treatment failure due to poor inhalation technique. The number of inhalation devices is immense. Physicians and pharmacists who prescribe and supply them may lack knowledge on the best choice of device for each individual or may be unaware of the specific inhalation technique that best matches the patient's needs.

Several studies have demonstrated that large numbers of patients do not use their inhalers correctly, thereby gaining little or no therapeutic benefit from the prescribed treatment. Focussing on which inhalers are the easiest to use correctly by children of varying ages is at least as important as the in vitro output characteristics of any inhaler. Because of patient heterogeneity, no single inhaler will satisfy the needs of all. This is particularly true in children where different age groups possess different psychomotor skills. Cost is another important consideration, but will vary from country to country and is beyond the scope of this review.

The aim of this paper is to propose an inhaler strategy that will facilitate an inhaler choice most likely to benefit different groups of children. The main focus will be on pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), highlighting practical difficulties with the devices and with inhaled therapy. In addition, we will discuss the optimal location for depositing the medicines in the lungs. Finally, we will propose a practical and easy way to make the best match between the inhaler device and the individual patient. The hope is that this will improve consistency of inhaler prescribing in primary and secondary care, in children with early-childhood wheeze and asthma (Box 1).

### Can inhaled corticosteroids prevent asthma exacerbations? [^112xBPT5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

asthma exacerbations occur unpredictably, are a cause of morbidity and mortality, and contribute significantly to increased healthcare costs. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life.

Recent Findings

the aetiopathology of asthma exacerbations is heterogeneous. Attempts to phenotype the heterogeneity of the pattern of airway inflammation by noninvasive monitoring of airway inflammation has identified a subgroup of patients with eosinophilic inflammation who are most likely to respond to steroid therapy. Strategies directed to normalize eosinophilic airway inflammation with corticosteroids have consistently led to a marked reduction in exacerbations. In contrast, their role in modulating the natural history of disease is less certain.

Summary

in the near future, improvements in our understanding of the mechanisms of exacerbations may identify therapeutic targets. While we await these developments, inhaled corticosteroids remain the first choice anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma.

### Human receptor kinetics and lung tissue retention of the enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate [^112yu1n9]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Besides a high receptor binding affinity, a prolonged retention of the glucocorticoid in the lung tissue is a desired property. We compared the tissue binding behaviour of FF with FP and MF. After one hour equilibration of glucocorticoid-saturated lung tissue pieces with human plasma at 37°C, we found highest concentrations of FF and FP compared to MF remaining in the tissue. Obviously, these compounds have the most favourable tissue affinity and it should be expected that the distribution of these glucocorticoids from lung tissue into systemic circulation is slow in vivo. Clinical data confirm this for FP.

To conclude, we have characterized the novel glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate. Its relative receptor binding affinity exceeds the RRAs of all other currently clinically used glucocorticoids. Based on the tissue binding experiments a high retention of fluticasone furoate in human lung tissue is expected. These advantageous binding attributes may contribute to a highly efficacious profile for FF as a topical treatment for inflammatory disorders of the respiratory tract.

### Safety of inhaled corticosteroids [^117WczU4]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

Systemic bioavailability from the gastrointestinal tract is reduced with newer inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) such as fluticasone, but systemic absorption still occurs via the lung. Observational studies have shown an association between ICS use and several adverse outcomes such as cataracts, glaucoma, and adrenal failure, and prospective controlled studies have confirmed a causal relationship between ICS use and bruising, reduction in bone mineral density, and reduced growth velocity. The evidence suggests that the effect of ICSs on bone mineral density is small in the short term but that patients taking moderate or high doses for long periods will be at increased risk of fractures and that this could be an appreciable public health problem. There is also evidence to suggest that the risk of long-term adverse effects is likely to differ between ICSs. The clinical message that follows is that ICSs should be used widely because they reduce the need for courses of oral corticosteroids and improve quality of life, but that they need to be managed carefully to reduce the risk of adverse effects with long-term use.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114SSNBj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been the subject of much controversy. Major international guidelines recommend selective use of ICS. Recently published meta-analyses have reported conflicting findings on the effects of inhaled steroid therapy in COPD.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids in stable patients with COPD, in terms of objective and subjective outcomes.

Search Methods

A pre-defined search strategy was used to search the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register for relevant literature. Searches are current as of July 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials comparing any dose of any type of inhaled steroid with a placebo control in patients with COPD. Acute bronchodilator reversibility to short-term beta(2)-agonists and bronchial hyper-responsiveness were not exclusion criteria. The a priori primary outcome was change in lung function. We also analysed data on mortality, exacerbations, quality of life and symptoms, rescue bronchodilator use, exercise capacity, biomarkers and safety.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.

Main Results

Fifty-five primary studies with 16,154 participants met the inclusion criteria. Long-term use of ICS (more than six months) did not consistently reduce the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) in COPD patients (generic inverse variance analysis: mean difference (MD) 5.80 mL/year with ICS over placebo, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.28 to 11.88, 2333 participants; pooled means analysis: 6.88 mL/year, 95% CI 1.80 to 11.96, 4823 participants), although one major trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference. There was no statistically significant effect on mortality in COPD patients (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.16, 8390 participants). Long-term use of ICS reduced the mean rate of exacerbations in those studies where pooling of data was possible (generic inverse variance analysis: MD -0.26 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.14, 2586 participants; pooled means analysis: MD -0.19 exacerbations per patient per year, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.08, 2253 participants). ICS slowed the rate of decline in quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (MD -1.22 units/year, 95% CI -1.83 to -0.60, 2507 participants). Response to ICS was not predicted by oral steroid response, bronchodilator reversibility or bronchial hyper-responsiveness in COPD patients. There was an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OR 2.65, 95% CI 2.03 to 3.46, 5586 participants) and hoarseness. In the long-term studies, the rate of pneumonia was increased in the ICS group compared to placebo, in studies that reported pneumonia as an adverse event (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86, 6235 participants). The long-term studies that measured bone effects generally showed no major effect on fractures and bone mineral density over three years.

Authors' Conclusions

Patients and clinicians should balance the potential benefits of inhaled steroids in COPD (reduced rate of exacerbations, reduced rate of decline in quality of life and possibly reduced rate of decline in FEV(1)) against the potential side effects (oropharyngeal candidiasis and hoarseness, and risk of pneumonia).

### Withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in individuals with COPD – a systematic review and comment on trial methodology [^116hubYS]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Meta-analysis

There are reasons for being cautious about the one meta-analysis we conducted and, in general, meta-analysing results from these types of trial. First, there are differences in patient characteristics between trials, in this case duration of use of ICS and exacerbation rate prior to entry to the trial which may be related to a patient's dependency on inhaled steroids, and differences in outcome definition, in this case definition of exacerbations (Table 5). The two trials conducted most recently also showed less effect of withdrawal which may reflect the increased efficacy of more recent medications which might have been taken alongside the inhaled steroids, although the use of other medication is not reported in detail in the trial reports. An additional reason for being cautious about meta-analysis in trials where medication is withdrawn relates to patient management during the trial, specifically in these trials, the management of exacerbations severe enough to make it unethical for patients to continue on the randomised treatment (Table 4). The WISP study had the highest number of patients discontinuing randomised treatment; 46% in the placebo group and 26% in the fluticasone group. In this trial, a patient's own doctor managed any exacerbation according to usual guidelines. The decision to stop the study inhaler and return to the usual (pre-randomisation) inhaler was made by the patient and doctor without a clearly defined protocol. The procedure was similar in the COSMIC study. By contrast, in the COPE study patients only returned to their usual medication following an examination and decision by one of the trial physicians. Thus, patients in WISP and COSMIC may have had a lower threshold for accepting changes in their normal level of symptoms than in the COPE study and may have left the randomised treatment earlier, especially in the placebo group, resulting in a smaller observed difference in outcome between this group and the fluticasone group in these trials. It is not possible to be prescriptive about a protocol for managing severe exacerbations; different approaches reflect the point of the trial on the pragmatic/explanatory spectrum, and trials at all points are useful in this context. For example, COPE suggests that withdrawing ICS results in an increase in the likelihood of an exacerbation but from WISP there is no indication that doing so in a routine clinical setting with patients participating in the decision to discontinue randomised treatment is likely to result in a change in proportions exacerbating.
