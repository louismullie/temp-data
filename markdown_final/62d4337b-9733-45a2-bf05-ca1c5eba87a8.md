## Question

in the case of a skin care rountine made up of salicylic acid and alpha arbutin twice a day (at night and at day), would it benefit (and be compatible) to add lactic acid from the ordinary which comes in a presentation of 10% + ha, and how would it be better integrated for the patient, explain also the mechanism of actions of the 3 ingredients mentioned as well as the benefits (and provide evidence please) lactic acid has on the skin, salicylic acid and alpha arbutin as well as the possible important facts such as the ideal time of use, best routine in this scheme and so on, thank you!

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether adding The Ordinary 10% lactic acid + HA to a twice-daily regimen of salicylic acid and alpha-arbutin is advisable, how to integrate it safely, and what the mechanisms and evidence are for each ingredient. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current regimen and whether it already constitutes over-exfoliation. Then, I should verify the mechanisms and expected benefits of salicylic acid, alpha-arbutin, and lactic acid. Next, I will assess compatibility and the risk of irritation or barrier compromise. After that, I need to check regulatory safety considerations, especially AHA-induced photosensitivity. Finally, I will propose a cautious, evidence-informed integration plan with monitoring and alternatives if irritation occurs [^1153WKrP] [^111EWVnW].

> Let me first confirm the current regimen and its exfoliative load. Twice-daily salicylic acid is already a meaningful keratolytic exposure; salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid with comedolytic and keratolytic effects used commonly in acne care, typically at 0.5–2% in leave-on or wash-off formulations, and guidelines note that cumulative irritancy can occur when multiple topicals are layered, especially with other acids or retinoids, so I need to ensure we are not exceeding a safe exfoliation threshold [^113SkLCU] [^113QNsbf].

> Now, I should review alpha-arbutin's role. Alpha-arbutin is a tyrosinase inhibitor used for hyperpigmentation; it is generally considered non-exfoliative and complementary to acids, but I should confirm that it does not meaningfully alter barrier function or pH in ways that would synergize negatively with acids, and the available literature does not suggest it adds mechanical or chemical exfoliation, which supports its compatibility in a regimen focused on tone correction rather than exfoliation per se [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine lactic acid's mechanism and benefits. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid that thins the stratum corneum, promotes epidermolysis, disperses basal melanin, and can stimulate dermal collagen, thereby improving texture, radiance, and hyperpigmentation; it also has humectant properties and the HA in the formulation can aid hydration, which may mitigate some irritation risk if introduced thoughtfully [^111BN34n] [^112Ro8s8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply layering another acid. I need to check compatibility and cumulative irritation risk. AHAs and BHAs both lower stratum corneum pH and increase transepidermal water loss transiently; layering them twice daily, especially at higher total concentrations, can compromise barrier function and provoke stinging, erythema, and xerosis, so the combination is mechanistically compatible but practically high risk for irritation if not titrated carefully [^113QNsbf].

> I should confirm photosensitivity considerations next. The FDA notes that AHAs, including lactic acid, can increase UV sensitivity during use and for up to a week after discontinuation, and CIR safety guidance supports AHA use at ≤ 10% with pH ≥ 3.5 when combined with sun protection; therefore, strict daily broad-spectrum SPF is mandatory if lactic acid is added, and I need to ensure the patient understands this non-negotiable aspect of safe use [^1153WKrP] [^111EWVnW].

> Let me think about a safer integration strategy. Rather than immediate twice-daily acids, I would start by reducing salicylic acid to once daily and introduce lactic acid on alternate nights at first, allowing the skin to acclimate; if tolerated for 2–4 weeks, frequency can be cautiously increased while maintaining vigilant barrier support and SPF, and I should double-check that any escalation is paused if irritation emerges [^113QNsbf].

> Wait, I should verify whether morning AHA use is advisable. Given AHA-induced photosensitivity, morning application of lactic acid is less desirable unless the patient has impeccable SPF adherence and low sun exposure; if used in the morning, it should be paired with a high-SPF, broad-spectrum sunscreen and ideally antioxidants, but evening use is generally preferred to minimize UV risk during the sensitization window [^1153WKrP] [^111EWVnW].

> I will now examine a practical, evidence-aligned routine. Option A: keep salicylic acid in the morning and use lactic acid at night, with alpha-arbutin layered after the acid at night and again in the morning if needed; Option B: alternate nights with salicylic acid one evening and lactic acid the next, again layering alpha-arbutin after the active; both approaches reduce simultaneous acid exposure while preserving anti-acne and anti-pigmentation benefits, and I should confirm tolerance before increasing frequency [^111BN34n].

> But wait, what if the patient has sensitive skin or develops barrier symptoms. I need to ensure we have a mitigation plan: pause acids temporarily, prioritize fragrance-free moisturizers with ceramides and HA, and consider using alpha-arbutin alone until the barrier recovers; in patients with rosacea or atopic tendencies, barrier-first strategies are emphasized, and I should confirm that any reintroduction is slow and spaced to avoid flares [^115QxB4y] [^113frhW5].

> Let me reconsider the overall benefit-risk balance. Adding 10% lactic acid can enhance textural smoothness, hydration, and pigment dispersion, and may synergize with alpha-arbutin for dyschromia, but the regimen must be individualized and sun-protection behavior must be reliable; if adherence to SPF is uncertain, I would avoid adding lactic acid or limit it to very infrequent, low-duration contact before rinsing until habits are solid [^111BN34n] [^1153WKrP].

> In summary, yes, adding The Ordinary 10% lactic acid + HA can be beneficial and compatible if introduced gradually with barrier support and strict photoprotection, but I should confirm that the current twice-daily salicylic acid is reduced to once daily or used on alternate nights to mitigate cumulative irritation, and I will monitor closely for redness, stinging, or peeling before escalating frequency [^113QNsbf] [^1153WKrP].

Adding **lactic acid 10%** to a routine with salicylic acid and alpha arbutin is compatible and can enhance results by targeting different layers and mechanisms, but it increases the risk of irritation and photosensitivity [^1153WKrP]. Use lactic acid at **night only**, alternating nights with salicylic acid, and apply alpha arbutin after acids to reduce irritation. Always use **SPF 30+** during the day, and start lactic acid 2–3 times weekly, increasing slowly as tolerated. If irritation occurs, reduce frequency or pause acids and prioritize barrier repair [^113QNsbf].

---

## Mechanisms of action and benefits

### Salicylic acid (BHA)

- **Mechanism**: Lipid-soluble BHA that penetrates pores, dissolves keratin plugs, and reduces sebum; anti-inflammatory and antibacterial.

- **Benefits**: Treats acne, blackheads, and whiteheads; reduces oiliness and inflammation [^113SkLCU].

---

### Alpha arbutin

- **Mechanism**: Competitive tyrosinase inhibitor that reduces melanin synthesis without cytotoxicity.

- **Benefits**: Lightens hyperpigmentation, melasma, and post-inflammatory marks; suitable for sensitive skin.

---

### Lactic acid (AHA)

- **Mechanism**: Water-soluble AHA that exfoliates the stratum corneum, increases ceramides, and stimulates GAGs and collagen.

- **Benefits**: Improves texture, tone, and hydration; reduces fine lines and hyperpigmentation [^111BN34n].

---

## Compatibility and potential interactions

Salicylic acid and lactic acid are complementary because they target different skin layers and mechanisms, but their combination increases the risk of irritation, dryness, and barrier disruption. Alpha arbutin is generally well tolerated and can be layered after acids to enhance depigmentation while minimizing irritation.

---

## Recommended integration strategy

To balance efficacy and tolerability, follow a **stepwise approach**:

| **Step** | **Morning routine** | **Evening routine** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Cleanse | Cleanse |
| 2 | Salicylic acid (alternate days) | Lactic acid (alternate nights) |
| 3 | Alpha arbutin | Alpha arbutin (after acids) |
| 4 | Moisturizer | Moisturizer |
| 5 | Sunscreen (SPF 30+) | ∅ |

---

Start lactic acid **2–3 times per week**, gradually increasing frequency as tolerated. If irritation occurs, reduce frequency or pause acids temporarily.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination use

Although direct triple-combination studies are limited, evidence supports the synergistic use of acids with depigmenting agents: salicylic acid enhances penetration of other topicals, and alpha arbutin provides additional tyrosinase inhibition. Lactic acid improves hydration and barrier function, which may offset irritation from acids [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and side effects

- **Irritation**: Redness, stinging, dryness, and peeling are common, especially with dual acids.

- **Photosensitivity**: AHAs increase UV sensitivity; strict sunscreen use is essential [^1153WKrP].

- **Barrier disruption**: Overuse can impair the barrier; prioritize moisturizers and barrier repair if needed [^115QxB4y].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Skin type**: Sensitive or reactive skin may require lower frequencies or buffering with moisturizers.

- **Skin concerns**: Tailor the regimen to acne, hyperpigmentation, or aging priorities.

- **Tolerance**: Adjust frequency based on response; consider short-contact application initially.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Sun protection**: SPF 30+ is mandatory with AHAs/BHAs to prevent photodamage [^notfound].

- **Gradual introduction**: Start low and go slow to minimize irritation.

- **Barrier support**: Use moisturizers and avoid over-exfoliation [^113Rsy7a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Compatibility**: Salicylic acid, alpha arbutin, and lactic acid can be combined safely with caution.

- **Integration**: Use lactic acid at night, alternate nights with salicylic acid; apply alpha arbutin after acids.

- **Sun protection**: Daily SPF 30+ is essential [^113frhW5].

- **Monitoring**: Adjust frequency based on tolerance and barrier status [^113QNsbf].

---

Adding lactic acid 10% to salicylic acid and alpha arbutin can improve texture, tone, and pigmentation when introduced gradually and paired with strict sun protection and barrier care.

### Efficacy and consumer perception of topical over-the-counter regimens involving beta-hydroxy acid for acne vulgaris [^113upuoT]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs) for acne treatment and their integration into daily skincare routines for better cosmetic outcomes has increasingly become a norm, particularly in light of steep insurance deductibles and restricted access to prescription options. This article presents an analysis from a single-center, open-label study with 20 participants conducted to evaluate if an over-the-counter (OTC) barrier-restoring cream gel can alleviate the adverse skin reactions caused by a conventional dermatologist-recommended acne treatment plan in individuals with mild to moderate acne over 6 weeks. This evaluation encompassed both objective clinical assessments of facial skin health and subjective reports of product tolerability, complemented by before-and-after images and questionnaires to capture consumer feedback on the OTC moisturizer as well as an OTC salicylic acid-containing cleanser and spot treatment.

Options for skin care are varied. New products are introduced constantly and it is important for the practitioner to have an understanding of products that impart beneficial results for aging skin. Educating patients to use products with scientifically proven benefits leads to better outcomes. Patients should be encouraged to use daily sunscreen, a topical retinoid every night, and a topical antioxidant daily. Supplementing the routine skin care regimen with alpha hydroxy acids, growth factors, heparin sulfate, and defensins can be addressed individually. Exogenous stem cells do not have sufficient evidence to warrant recommending them currently.

### Low-dose 5-fluorouracil in combination with salicylic acid as a new lesion-directed option to treat topically actinic keratoses: histological and clinical study results [^114GzgNm]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Actinic keratoses (AKs) arise after chronic sun exposure. Because long-term ultraviolet (UV) damage may induce proliferation of atypical keratinocytes, treatment of AKs is recommended.

Objectives

To compare 5-fluorouracil 0·5%/salicylic acid 10·0% [low-dose 5-FU/SA (Actikerall®)] with diclofenac 3% in hyaluronic acid (diclofenac HA) and vehicle for the treatment of AKs.

Methods

This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre trial. Patients received topical low-dose 5-FU/SA once daily, its vehicle or diclofenac HA twice daily for a maximum of 12 weeks. The final evaluation was at week 20. The primary objectives were to demonstrate the histological clearance rate of one predefined lesion. The secondary objectives were the improvement of treated lesions, tolerability and safety.

Results

There were 470 patients with 4–10 AK lesions each (grade I or II) on the face/forehead or bald scalp included in the study. Low-dose 5-FU/SA was superior to diclofenac HA (P < 0·01) and vehicle (P < 0·0001) for histological clearance of one representative lesion 8 weeks post-treatment. In 72·0%, 59·1% and 44·8% of patients in the low-dose 5-FU/SA, diclofenac HA and vehicle groups, respectively, the week-20 biopsy revealed no AKs. Significantly more lesions were cleared with low-dose 5-FU/SA (74·5%) compared with diclofenac HA (54·6%; P < 0·001) or vehicle (35·5%; P < 0·001). Low-dose 5-FU/SA was superior in terms of complete clinical clearance: 55·4%, vs. diclofenac HA (32·0%, P < 0·001) and vehicle (15·1%P < 0·001). Application-site disorders (mainly burning and inflammation) were more frequent with low-dose 5-FU/SA but mainly of mild to moderate intensity.

Conclusions

Topical low-dose 5-FU/SA demonstrated higher histological and clinical clearance rates vs. diclofenac HA or vehicle. Low-dose 5-FU/SA is an effective lesion-directed treatment for AKs.

### The effects of a daily skincare regimen on maintaining the benefits obtained from previous chemical resurfacing treatments [^116G7uEt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chemical peels are versatile treatments that involve chemical exfoliation of the skin for cosmetic improvement. Deeper peels produce more significant results, but can be associated with longer healing time and potential complications. Novel chemical resurfacing treatments (AGE and MELA) were developed in Europe to produce skin resurfacing via controlled inflammation to promote cell regeneration with minimum negative effects associated with conventional peelings. The AGE Resurfacing regimen is indicated for the treatment of photoaging, and consists of multi-ingredient peeling solution with trichloroacetic acid, pyruvic acid, salicylic acid, mandelic acid, and lactobionic acid. The MELA Resurfacing regimen addresses hyperpigmentation concerns and contains mandelic acid, potassium azeloyl diglycinate, retinol, salicylic acid, phytic acid, lactobionic acid, and lactic acid. Results of previously conducted US clinical experience trial of AGE and MELA resurfacing protocols rated 81% of subjects with some level of improvement according to physician assessment. <br/>

Objectives

To evaluate whether a daily skin care regimen used for 12 weeks could maintain the benefits achieved with AGE and MELA chemical resurfacing treatments. <br/>

Methods

Subjects who completed participation in the AGE and MELA skin resurfacing clinical trial were recruited to participate in a continuation trial and used a daily regimen of MDRejuvena facial products for 12 weeks. No other facial products were permitted. Physicians assessed the severity of individual skin parameters at baseline and week 12 and provided global assessment. Subjects assessed improvement of individual skin parameters at week 12 and provided an overall assessment. <br/>

Results

Thirteen subjects participated in the 12-week continuation trial. According to the physician's global assessment, all subjects demonstrated some level of improvement at week 12 compared to baseline. Physician assessment showed a decrease in severity of all skin parameters assessed at week 12 compared to baseline. According to the subject overall assessment at week 12, 11 of 12 subjects noted some level of improvement, 1 subject saw no improvement, and 1 subject did not provide an overall assessment. Mild to moderate improvement was observed by subjects in all individual skin parameters assessed except for skin discoloration. < BR / >

Conclusions

The results of the continuation study demonstrate that use of a daily skin care regimen, which include combination of 2 various strengths of MDRejuvena Rejuvaphyl ® Rejuvenating Complex: low strength (LS) and high strength (HS), not only maintains but can enhance the beneficial effects of skin resurfacing treatments for at least 12 weeks. <br/> <br/> J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(9):1145–1150.

### A review of existing therapies for actinic keratosis: current status and future directions [^112Yi8yf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Two novel 5-FU formulations were recently introduced for treatment of grade I–II AK in immunocompetent patients. The first was the 4% 5-FU cream, which is an effective topical treatment applied once or twice daily for 2–4 weeks and has been demonstrated to have tolerability superior to that of 5% 5-FU cream used twice daily. The second formulation combined 0.5% solution 5-FU with 10% salicylic acid (5-FU-SA) and was more effective than placebo for field treatment: the percentage of patients with complete clinical clearance was up to 49.5 and 18.2%, respectively, when the drug was applied once daily for 12 weeks to a total maximum area of 25 cm², for AK located on the face and balding scalp. In a single randomized phase III trial, 5-FU-SA was superior to 3% diclofenac gel in hyaluronic acid, as measured by histological clearance (72 vs. 59.1%) and by complete clinical clearance (55.4 vs. 32.0%). Moreover, topical application of 5-FU-SA resulted in successful treatment for AK on distal extremities and had a good safety profile.

Side effects with 5-FU include inflammation, pain, burning, crusting, and erosions but rarely affect patient adherence to therapy. No specific studies or sub-analyses on the use of 5-FU have been performed in elderly patients, but no dosage adjustment is needed in this specific population. However, close monitoring is recommended for patients with diabetes with decreased tactile, pain, and temperature perception. In addition, antiviral drugs (e.g. brivudine), phenytoin, and methotrexate may increase the rate of side effects.

4 CONCLUSIONS

HA is present in many cosmetic formulations due to excellent hygroscopic, rheological, and viscoelastic properties, and some literature highlights its benefits when used topically in dermatological practice. Indeed, several clinical studies indicate that HA is both well tolerated and effective, adjuvant to both postsurgical and facial rejuvenation procedures.

As described in this manuscript, the body of evidence is growing in terms of studies which associate HA with various facial rejuvenation procedures, including in combination with BoNTA, PDT, fractional CO₂ laser skin resurfacing, fillers, microneedling, and chemical peeling. The recent RCT we presented, combining BoNTA and HA‐filler serum, was robustly designed with a 6‐month follow‐up and control group. The findings support that HA‐filler serum lengthened the duration of BoNTA's effect in reducing wrinkles, was well tolerated, and led to high patient satisfaction. Despite the limitations of certain other studies including short duration and lack of a control group, we consider these results to be pertinent and applicable to patients who may benefit from using HA‐based cosmeceuticals as part of their daily skin care routine. From the literature to clinical evidence, clinicians can integrate this information with both a science‐based and practical approach.

In conclusion, a greater number of long, well‐conducted, controlled studies that provide objective data are warranted. Nevertheless, results from several trials generally support that HA‐based cosmeceuticals are a non‐invasive, effective solution for improving skin hydration, rejuvenation, and healing. Furthermore, in addition to educating about healthy lifestyle habits and skin protection including the regular use of sunscreen, clinicians can advise patients that HA‐based cosmeceuticals may help to counterbalance the negative impact of the exposome.

### Rapid treatment of mild acne with a novel skin care system containing 1% salicylic acid, 10% buffered glycolic acid, and botanical ingredients [^112daARr]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The biggest hurdle in the treatment of acne vulgaris is patient non-compliance that is due in large part to poor tolerability to common acne medications. As such, new acne treatments must be developed that balance good anti-acne efficacy with excellent tolerability in order to ensure patient adherence and by extension ensure good clinical outcomes. The goal of the present study was to determine the tolerability and efficacy of a novel skin care system, composed of a cleanser, containing 1% salicylic acid and botanical ingredients, and a treatment gel, containing 1% salicylic acid, 10% buffered glycolic acid and botanical ingredients for the treatment of mild acne. In this single-center, open-label clinical study, 25 male and female volunteers used the test cleanser and test gel twice daily over six weeks. Tolerability assessments showed that the skin care regimen was very well tolerated by all study volunteers. Acne severity was significantly reduced by two acne grades at six weeks. Inflammatory lesion counts were significantly reduced, on average, by 59.06% (P ≤ 0.0001), 91.62% (P ≤ 0.0001), 90.85% (P ≤ 0.0001) and by 98.55% (P ≤ 0.0001) at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Non-inflammatory lesion counts were reduced, on average, by 13.54% (ns), 38.95% (P ≤ 0.0001), 44.48% (P ≤ 0.0001), and by 56.10% (P ≤ 0.0001) at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6, respectively. Standardized photography also demonstrated a progressive reduction in acne lesions over time. In conclusion, results of the present study suggest that the tested skin care regimen offers rapid acne clearance and excellent tolerability that together may help to improve patient adherence as well as treatment outcome.

### Evidence of barrier deficiency in rosacea and the importance of integrating OTC skincare products into treatment regimens [^115QxB4y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rosacea, an inflammatory skin disease that leads to an impaired skin barrier function commonly involves the face. Symptoms of rosacea can be bothersome and include pain, stinging, burning, itching, and facial flushing. This review explored skin barrier impairment in rosacea and reduced symptomatology when using over the counter (OTC) skincare products.

Methods

Nine dermatologists (the panel) completed a survey on OTC products they recommend for rosacea. The survey results were summarized, presented, and discussed during the online meeting, together with the results of a literature review. The outcome of these discussions, coupled with the panel's expert opinion and experience, is shown in the current review.

Results

Addressing barrier dysfunction by use of moisturizer and cleanser formulations that restore skin hydration, normalize skin pH, restore the microbiome, and skin lipids can assist in improving rosacea signs and symptoms. The panel's consensus was that in addition to the use of prescription medications, skincare recommendations are a crucial part of successful rosacea therapy. In addition to occlusives and humectants, barrier restoring ingredients such as ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide were considered beneficial. Equally important was the absence of potentially irritating substances.

Conclusions

The use of OTC products can improve rosacea symptomatology and signs. As adjuncts, these products are recommended before and during prescription therapy and as part of a maintenance regimen.

### Hyaluronics for soft-tissue augmentation: practical considerations and technical recommendations [^111sgcSg]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are long chains of sugar molecules. Depending on various physical properties, such as chain length and cross-linking, they can have different textures and durations. Injections of hyaluronic acids for soft-tissue augmentation is one of the most popular procedures performed in the U.S. Europe, Asia and Canada. With the development of newer HA molecules, it is likely that this trend will continue. Choosing the right HA for a particular patient depends on various factors, including the area to be treated, skin thickness and patients' risk tolerance. Understanding the various molecules, and how they interact, is essential for ensuring optimal patient outcomes.

Actinic keratoses (AKs) — alpha hydroxy acid pretreatment before ALA-blue light photodynamic therapy (PDT) showed no benefit and added harm, and is conditionally recommended against. Patients treated with 10% alpha hydroxy acid solution for 2 weeks before 2 ALA-PDT treatments 14 days apart had no reduction in carcinoma development during 3 years (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.54–1.90; p = 0.98), and permanent scarring occurred in 3 of 34 (8.8%). The Work Group therefore conditionally recommends against pretreatment with alpha hydroxy acid solution before ALA-blue light PDT based on very low quality evidence.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^113SZBPd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Salicylic acid — topical keratolytic use, combination practices, and precautions are detailed. Salicylic acid is a topical keratolytic agent used in psoriasis and may reduce keratinocyte-to-keratinocyte binding and reduce the pH of the stratum corneum, softening psoriatic plaques. While there are no placebo-controlled studies verifying the efficacy and safety of salicylic acid, it is often combined with topical corticosteroids or immunomodulators; however, combination agents containing both salicylic acid and topical corticosteroids are not currently available in the United States. Precautions include that topical salicylic acid should not be used with other oral salicylate drugs; systemic absorption, although rare, can occur especially when applied to more than 20% of the body surface or in patients with abnormal hepatic or renal function; and it decreases the efficacy of UVB phototherapy and therefore should not be applied before UVB phototherapy.

### Benefits of topical hyaluronic acid for skin quality and signs of skin aging: from literature review to clinical evidence [^112DE8Pi]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Photodynamic therapy

While PDT has been unexpectedly found to impact cosmetic rejuvenation, standard treatment guidelines have not been developed for this indication. Results from a 12‐week pilot study (n = 6) of PDT (three sessions using a 2% 5‐aminolevulinic acid [ALA] gel along with HA) suggest that the procedure is well tolerated and can lead to both clinical and subject‐assessed improvements in skin damage.

Lasers for skin rejuvenation

Few studies were identified using topical HA as adjunct to fractional CO₂ laser skin resurfacing, yet topical HA was either used in a standard care/controlor comparator group. In one study aiming to reduce the inflammatory reaction associated with laser treatment, a probiotic‐derived experimental cream was applied post‐treatment twice daily to 42 consecutively enrolled subjects, and a topical antibiotic cream 3 times daily for 3 days followed by a HA‐based cream twice daily for 15 days was administered to the control group of 20 subjects. There were between 1 to 4 laser sessions for the face or hands every 2–3 months. Researchers found that the experimental cream decreased the average time of expected side effects (erythema and swelling) compared to control, and suspected that HA's optimal protection could reduce fluid drainage and augment infection risk. In a different prospective study, laser treatment of the perioral area was performed in 50 subjects. Postprocedure, 25 subjects self‐applied topical platelet‐rich plasma (Prp) containing growth factors twice daily for 12 weeks, and 25 subjects applied both a topical antibiotic and topical steroid for 7 days followed by HA gel for 12 weeks. There was no mention of randomization in the methods section. Based on a digital skin analyzer and the clinician's/subject's assessments, moisture, quantity of collagen fiber, elasticity, wrinkle reduction, and satisfaction improved for both groups from baseline to week 12 (significantly for the Prp group).

### Benefits of topical hyaluronic acid for skin quality and signs of skin aging: from literature review to clinical evidence [^115eeVak]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Skin aging goes beyond a chronological process and also results from extrinsic factors referred to as the exposome. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an important component of the extracellular matrix, with loss starting at 25years old. While many studies of HA concern topical use, few literature reviews only address the use of topical HA in dermatology. This review describes the different characteristics of HA-containing cosmeceuticals, with a focus on skin aging and the impact of exposome factors on HA synthesis and degradation. A review was performed using the terms HA, hyaluronan, topical, dermatology, cosmetic, aging treatment, exposome, and cosmeceuticals. Results are also presented from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), which investigated the additional benefit of using a HA epidermic filler (HA-filler serum) combined with Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) to treat signs of skin aging. Subjects were randomized to two groups: HA-filler serum starting 24h after the BoNTA injection then twice daily for 24weeks, or the control group, which received BoNTA. HA is a key ingredient used in cosmeceuticals for its hydration/antiaging properties (hygroscopic, rheological, and viscoelastic). Several clinical studies indicate that HA is both well tolerated and effective, adjuvant to both post-surgical and facial rejuvenation procedures. In the RCT, one of few studies to combine BoNTA and HA with a 6-month follow-up, the HA-filler serum lengthened the duration of BoNTA's effect in reducing wrinkles. Numerous studies support HA-based cosmeceuticals as a noninvasive, effective solution for improving skin hydration and rejuvenation.

### Topical azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc and fruit acid (α-hydroxy acid) for acne [^117W71WW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life.

Main Results

We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the United States. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs.

Visible light therapy in psoriasis — blue and red light monotherapy with salicylic acid pretreatment shows erythema benefits. Kleinpenning et al treated 20 patients with either blue or red light 3 times a week for 4 consecutive weeks; a compound of 10% salicylic acid in petrolatum was used as a pretreatment for 1 week before and then daily throughout the study. Pretreatment equalized desquamation and induration across groups, but improvements in erythema were better with light treatments (43% with blue light, 36% with red light, and 10% with salicylic acid monotherapy); improvement with blue light continued throughout the study, whereas no significant improvement was seen over the final 6 treatments with red light. Treatment was safe with minimal side effects, as no patients developed erythema surrounding treated lesions, and hyperpigmentation was the most common side effect, seen in nearly all patients undergoing blue light.

Salicylic acid peels — prescribing information for comedonal acne lists dosing as follows: concentrations of 20–30% are available; Very superficial: 20% salicylic acid; Superficial: 30% salicylic acid; applied for 2–4 minutes depending on intensity of clinical response. Contraindications include lack of psychological stability and mental preparedness, unrealistic expectations, poor general health and nutritional status, isotretinoin therapy within the last 6 months, and active infection or open wounds (eg, herpes simplex, excoriations, or open acne cysts), with relative contraindications of history of abnormal scar formation or delayed wound healing, history of therapeutic radiation exposure, and history of rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, or active retinoid dermatitis. For medium and deep peels, medium-depth or deep resurfacing procedure within the last 3–12 months and recent facial surgery involving extensive undermining are noted. Adverse effects/toxicities include mild stinging and discomfort, burning, erythema, and mild to intense exfoliation.

### Improvement in ocular symptoms and signs in patients withanterior blepharitis using a novel terpinen-4-ol (2.5%) and hyaluronic acid (0.2%) cleansing wipe [^112Mf5Nr]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been previously reported that compliance is critical in the successful treatment of blepharitis. However, it can be difficult to ensure patients adhere to a treatment regimen, and the ease, comfort, and convenience of use are believed to facilitate compliance in the longer term. Whilst previous reports using differing concentrations of TTO have generally proved effective in reducing ocular signs and symptoms of Demodex -associated blepharitis. all have reported major compliance issues, potentially related to the adverse effects of other ingredients contained within TTOA study performed by Koo et alpreviously showed that only 38% of patients adhered to the treatment (10% TTO daily scrubs in addition to a 50% TTO weekly scrub) with the efficacy of TTO vs control only observed in compliant patients. In a similar study by Nicholls et al, non-compliance was estimated at 25%. This is in comparison to our observed non-compliance rate of 0% in Group 1 and 4% in Group 2 (one patient with compliance < 80%), which could be a result of the reduced adverse effects of T4O alone and at a lower concentration when compared with other Demodex treatment regimens. Alternatively, the unique formulation of the study wipe T1172, which also contains 0.2% HA, a natural moisturizing agent known to sooth, and regenerate skin,–may account for the improved compliance. Promisingly, all patients were sufficiently satisfied to continue using the study wipes, with no clear indication that compliance was lower with the once or twice daily regimen. This would suggest that the unique T1172 formulation may reduce compliance issues. An additional issue with moderate-to-severe cases of Demodex -associated blepharitis is the recommended treatment regimen which includes an in-office procedure once a week due to the higher concentration of TTO utilized. This could have an impact on treatment compliance, in addition to a socio-economic burden impact, particularly if the patient is located a distance away from the ophthalmologist practice. This study demonstrated that using a 2.5% T4O impregnated wipe once or twice daily could be safely administered at home.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: real-world clinical experience with a neuro-peptide serum in combination with botulinum toxin type – A injections [^113pCP46]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

We evaluated real-life experiences of a topical neuro-peptide serum containing 2% acetyl hexapeptide-8, 2% dipeptide diaminobutyroyl, 5% polyhydroxy acids (PHA), 5% niacinamide, and 1% laminaria extract (topical neuro-peptide serum [TNP-serum]). The TNP-serum works synergistically by stimulating 9 key skin biomarkers to reduce wrinkles and produce a skin-brightening effect. Here, we highlight the real-life experiences of 5 dermatologists and 2 surgeons, using an integrated skincare regimen consisting of botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) injection in conjunction with twice daily TNP-serum. Real-world cases provide evidence for combination treatments that may be used in cosmetic dermatology to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. TNP-serum appears to complement BTX-A injections to improve radiance, reduce fine lines, and reduce wrinkles in diverse patients. Incorporating TNP-serum into integrated skincare regimens may offer an additive effect to BTX-A injections and, ultimately, optimize patient results. J Drugs Dermatol. 2024;23:11(Suppl 2):s3–14.

### Effects of a topical growth factor regimen following pre-elected cosmetic facial injection procedures [^1152EviM]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited studies evaluating topical cosmetic skincare products following cosmetic facial injections.

Objective

An open-label study assessed a novel medical-grade topical skincare regimen following cosmetic facial injections.

Methods

The study enrolled 20 women with moderate to severe facial photodamage who used non&ndash; physician-dispensed skincare products and pre-elected to receive facial neuromodulator and hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal filler injections. All subjects continued regular skincare through week 4 after facial injection, then switched to the novel regimen (growth factor product, TNS Advanced+; day/night antioxidant serum system, Lumivive; HA-based hydrator, HA5; and basic skincare components) through week 16.

Results

At week 4, significant (P&le;0.05) improvements from baseline were seen for multiple investigator-graded skin quality parameters, including overall photodamage, tactile roughness, and skin tone evenness, as well as fine and coarse lines/wrinkles. After switching to the novel regimen, additional significant improvements in overall skin quality and forehead, cheek, and perioral fine lines/wrinkles were observed at week 8 (all P&le;0.05 vs week 4), which continued through week 16.

Conclusion

This study highlights the importance of topical skincare in conjunction with cosmetic facial injections to holistically optimize overall skin quality and appearance. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;21(1): doi:10.36849/JDD.7160.

### Benefits of topical hyaluronic acid for skin quality and signs of skin aging: from literature review to clinical evidence [^116tzDoF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Literature search

A literature review was conducted of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases for English literature among adults (from 1992 through July 2021) using the terms HA, hyaluronan, topical, dermatology, cosmetic, aging treatment, exposome, and cosmeceuticals. Injectable HA was excluded from the search. Starting with biochemistry, the subsequent sections outline clinical study results of topical HA, from its versatile role in dermatology to both preventing harm from exposome factors and improving postprocedural outcomes.

2.2 Clinical study

A prospective, single‐blind, 24‐week RCT investigated the additional benefit of using a HA epidermic filler (Liftactiv HA epidermic filler [HA‐filler serum], Vichy, Paris, France) combined with BoNTA in the treatment of facial skin aging. The HA‐filler serum, with 1.5% multimolecular weight HA, contains ingredients including Vitamin C glucoside (Cg), peptides, and volcanic mineralizing water that are intended to provide antioxidant and anti‐aging effects as well as strengthen the skin barrier. Subjects were randomized to two groups: HA‐filler serum starting 24 h after the botulinum toxin injection followed by twice daily, or the control group, which received BoNTA. Both treatment groups received SPF 50+ sunscreen for use throughout the study.

Evaluations were performed before the BoNTA injection at day 0, then once at days 14, 84, and 168. Deep wrinkles, fine lines, Crow's feet wrinkles, skin tone, skin texture, radiance, and skin elasticity were assessed by a dermatologist, and safety (i.e. tolerability and any adverse event) was monitored throughout the study. Instrumental evaluations were carried out to investigate skin barrier integrity using Tewameter® readings. Subject satisfaction questionnaires were also performed regarding the HA‐filler serum. Subjects signed informed consent for participation.

### Benefits of topical hyaluronic acid for skin quality and signs of skin aging: from literature review to clinical evidence [^113WdE2K]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

The maximum effect of BoNTA was reached at day 14 for all clinical parameters. Additionally, a significant benefit in terms of skin radiance was already observed at day 14 in favor of HA‐filler serum (p = 0.018 vs. BoNTA only). Significant improvement with a plateau effect was sustained after 24 weeks of HA‐filler serum use in terms of fine lines, Crow's feet wrinkles, skin tone, skin texture, radiance, and skin elasticity compared to the control group with differences of approximately 16%, 17%, 14%, 24%, 24%, and 20%, respectively (p < 0.05; Figure 3). Tewameter® results showed significant reduction in TEWL, and thus improved skin barrier integrity, after 12 weeks of HA‐filler serum use when compared to baseline (p < 0.001); a trend toward better skin barrier function favored the serum throughout the study. There were no reported local adverse events related to HA‐filler serum. Subjects were satisfied with their skin appearance in both groups, and while nonsignificant, a trend toward greater satisfaction was found in favor of HA‐filler serum at week 24 (mean percentage improvement of 66% vs. 41% for procedure only). Moreover, all subjects were willing to reuse the HA‐filler serum. Therefore, this study supports that adding a 1.5% HA‐containing cosmeceutical along with BoNTA improves signs of aging and skin quality compared to BoNTA alone and is well tolerated, even when used around eye contours. Indeed, while using sunscreen was required as key to a daily skin care routine, added benefits of an HA‐containing cosmeceutical were observed in this study which may be partly due to the effects of the HA‐filler serum's ingredients (notably Vitamin Cg, peptides, and volcanic mineralizing water). Additionally, this HA‐filler serum appears to prolong the duration of effect of BoNTA injections in reducing wrinkles.

### In vitro and in vivo efficacy and tolerability of a non-hydroquinone, multi-action skin tone correcting cream [^114r95eJ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Pigmentation disorders are therapeutically challenging to treat, requiring complicated regimens.

Objectives: Alternatives to hydroquinone (HQ) are desired. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a non-HQ multi-action skin tone corrector (ETCS) developed to inhibit melanin production and improve skin quality.

Design and Methods: Twice-daily use of ETCS and ETCS + AHA-Ret, a retinoid-based alpha hydroxy acid cream, was evaluated in subjects with mild to severe dyschromia. Digital images were obtained at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks and included assessment of dyschromia, erythema, fine lines/wrinkles, pores, texture, and global improvement. Melanin Index (MI) measurements were obtained at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Subject self-assessments were obtained over the course of the study. Adverse Events (AEs) were collected throughout the study. An extension study evaluated use over 16-weeks.

Results: Significant mean reductions from baseline occurred in dyschromia for ETCS (n = 42) and ETCS + AHA-Ret (n = 10) over 12 weeks (P < 0.0001, each). Significant mean reductions from baseline in MI were achieved in both groups at every timepoint (ETCS: P < 0.0001; ETCS + AHA-Ret: P < 0.02, 4 weeks; P < 0.0001, 8 and 12 weeks). Substantial improvements were demonstrated in global improvement, fine lines/wrinkles, erythema, pores, and texture at 12 weeks. Reductions from baseline occurred in dyschromia and MI (P < 0.0001, each) at 16 weeks. High levels of subject satisfaction were reported with nearly all subjects reporting reduced appearance of uneven skin tone/discoloration and lightened darker patches, and improvement in overall skin tone. Mild, transient AEs were reported with no discontinuations due to an AE.

Conclusions: Twice daily use of ETCS led to early, significant reductions in dyschromia and melanin index. Combination use with a retinoid-based, AHA cream in the evening demonstrated enhanced reductions. ETCS effectively reduced hyperpigmentation, improved overall skin appearance, and was highly tolerable.

### Tolerance and efficacy of a product containing ellagic and salicylic acids in reducing hyperpigmentation and dark spots in comparison with 4% hydroquinone [^111eFv2b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hydroquinone (HQ) is the benchmark prescription agent for skin lightening. However, HQ use is recently banned in Europe and in parts of Asia because of potential long-term consequences, including carcinogenesis when orally consumed. This has resulted in development of alternative skin-lightening agents with comparable efficacy to HQ, but better safety profiles. This study examined the skin-lightening ability of a topical product containing 0.5% ellagic acid and 0.1% salicylic acid and compared its efficacy with that of a prescription generic 4% HQ product. Fifty-four multiethnic subjects were randomly assigned to use the topical test formulation or generic 4% HQ twice daily for 12 weeks to evaluate product tolerability and efficacy. Under the conditions of this double-blinded clinical study, the test product demonstrated comparable tolerance and efficacy to that of a benchmark product 4% HQ, as assessed by clinical grading, physical measurement of spot size using image analysis, and questionnaire response analysis. This study suggests that this new product provided comparable skin depigmentation benefit to the benchmark product. In addition, the product appears to have better esthetics (texture, pleasantness to use, skin feel) than the 4% HQ product.

### A review of toxicity from topical salicylic acid preparations [^115RER4a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Topical salicylic acid is often used in dermatologic conditions because of its keratolytic, bacteriostatic, fungicidal, and photoprotective properties. The bioavailability of salicylic acid differs depending on the vehicle used and pH of transcellular fluids. Although rare, salicylic acid toxicity (salicylism) can occur from topical application. Physicians should be mindful of the potential for salicylism or even death from topically applied salicylic acid.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^111i6eGF]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Combination topical therapy — corticosteroids with salicylic acid may be beneficial but should be potency-limited: "The combination of topical corticosteroids and salicylic acid may be valuable because of the ability of salicylic acid to enhance the efficacy of corticosteroids by increasing penetration", and to avoid toxicity, "it is recommended that this combination be limited to no more than medium-potency (class 3–4) topical corticosteroids". This aligns with the general statement that "combination regimens, utilizing medications from different categories, have been studied and shown to be potentially beneficial".

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^114SwC4G]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis topical therapy — combination use, potency strategy, supervision, and adherence: Topical medications can sometimes be used concurrently to take advantage of varied mechanisms of action, and calcipotriene can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids; however, calcipotriene should not be used concurrently with products that can alter the pH of its base, such as topical lactic acid. Use of topical agents can be both intermittent and long-term, and it is recommended that more potent agents be used on a short-term basis to allow for response, after which patients should be instructed to use these agents intermittently for long-term management; alternatively, patients who require continuous topical treatment should be instructed to use the least potent agent that allows for disease control or be transitioned to a topical agent that is associated with the lowest long-term risk, and unsupervised use of potent topical medications is not recommended. Adherence to topical treatment of psoriasis is a major issue, being generally poor in the majority of patients, and measures to improve patient adherence, including choosing topical medications with enough potency to achieve a favorable clinical response and individualizing the vehicle to allow for patient tolerance, are strongly encouraged.

Pediatric psoriasis — calcipotriene combinations and steroid-sparing strategies: Pretreating involved skin with 6% to 10% salicylic acid for 1 week may enhance the efficacy of subsequent calcipotriene monotherapy, but care is required because the acid pH of salicylic acid will inactivate calcipotriene when the 2 are given simultaneously; combination calcipotriene and betamethasone may result in adverse effects (such as striae and HPA axis suppression) and maximum weekly dosage guidelines should be followed, whereas rotational therapy with topical vitamin D analogues, TCIs, emollients, tar-based therapies, and topical corticosteroids should be considered in children as steroid-sparing regimens to reduce potential adverse effects from overreliance on topical steroid therapy.

### Skin care products and subtle data manipulation [^117YUBKG]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

The dermatologists of today need to master the skills to help their patients in choosing skin care products. As physicians and scientists, we are naturally inclined to trust sophisticated and objectively derived data that are published in scientific, peer-reviewed journals and are presented to us in the form of numbers, tables, and graphs. The question that should be asked is whether a product that scored well in sophisticated tests is really superior and more suitable to the needs of our patients? Or, how far can we trust the data in scientific publications? There is no generally accepted methodology for unbiased evaluation of the efficacy and performance of skin care products. There is also no consensus on which test method best reflects the real-life performance of these products. And, most importantly, even the most objective methods and measuring devices can be and often are manipulated to support the claims of superiority of given products. We will show several out of many, many ways of how the study design, protocols, techniques, and end points can legitimately be adapted to the special characteristics of the specific product, emphasizing its advantages.

### Making the right choices: attaining predictable aesthetic results with dermal fillers [^112SRJBc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The types and number of dermal fillers have evolved, allowing clinicians to select the most appropriate agent for each specific use. Filler properties differ both between and among classes, so clinicians must have a thorough understanding of these properties and the best techniques to use to provide the most satisfactory outcomes. This article reviews and highlights the key properties of different types of fillers, technical aspects of their use, safety considerations and the importance of patient factors in treatment selection. Making the right treatment choices must involve all of these issues to optimize aesthetic outcomes and patient satisfaction. The authors illustrate how to make the best choices through a series of case examples using a variety of filler types. Although most fillers can provide acceptable outcomes when used appropriately, the hyaluronic acids have become the most frequently used products because of their physicochemical properties and clinical benefits.

### Α-hydroxy acid-based cosmetic procedures. guidelines for patient management [^111BN34n]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

alpha-Hydroxy acid (AHA) peels and home regimens have recently been recognized as important adjunctive therapy in a variety of conditions including photodamage, actinic damage, melasma, hyperpigmentation disorders, acne, and rosacea. Overall in our experience and in the literature, AHAs have a proven level of safety and efficacy in a variety of skin types. Although their exact mechanism of action is unknown, it has been demonstrated that AHAs improve these disorders by thinning the stratum corneum, promoting epidermolysis, dispersing basal layer melanin, and increasing collagen synthesis within the dermis. In patients with photodamage, AHA peels and topical products are often combined with retinoids and other antioxidants for maximum benefit. Similarly, synergistic effects of fluorouracil and glycolic acid are observed in the treatment of diffuse actinic keratoses. For patients with melasma, AHA peels and combination products containing bleaching agents such as hydroquinone, kojic acid, and glycolic acid seem to have increased efficacy. Acne and rosacea patients can see improved results when standard regimens like antibacterials and topical retinoids are supplemented with AHA peels and lotions. However, care should always be taken prior to commencing treatment with AHA peels and topical products. By obtaining a thorough history and physical examination, the physician will identify any specific factors like medications, prior procedures and medical conditions which can affect the outcome of the peel. During the interview, there should be open discussion of patient questions and concerns so that realistic expectations can be made. Pre- and post-peel regimens should also be reviewed in full as patient compliance is essential to ensure the success of a series of AHA peels.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^113QNsbf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Prescribing information for salicylic acid — used alone or in combination with other drugs for the symptomatic treatment of acne — includes topical dosing, safety, interactions, and pediatric cautions. Salicylic acid is used alone or in combination with other drugs for the symptomatic treatment of acne, and dosing is to apply topically using appropriate preparations containing salicylic acid 0.5–2%, with appropriate 0.5–2% salicylic acid preparation applied 1–3 times daily; initially apply once daily then gradually increase to 2 or 3 times daily, and if dryness or peeling occurs reduce application to once daily or every other day. Contraindications are known sensitivity to salicylic acid or any other ingredient in the formulation; adverse effects/toxicity include hypersensitivity reactions, salicylate toxicity, excessive erythema, and scaling; and interactions are listed with acidifying agents, anticoagulants, antidiabetic agents, aspirin, corticosteroids, diuretics, methotrexate, pyrazinamide, sulfur, and uricosuric agents. Other issues note cumulative irritant or drying effect and state that if excessive dryness occurs, use only 1 topical medication unless directed by a clinician; pregnancy category C is stated; and for nursing, discontinue nursing or the drug and, if used by nursing women, avoid applying to the chest area. Pediatric use guidance states that salicylic acid 6% cream, lotion, and gel and 15% plaster are not recommended in children < 2 years of age, there is increased risk of salicylate toxicity with prolonged, excessive use in children < 12 years of age, treatment area should be limited with monitoring for possible signs of salicylate toxicity, and use of salicylates in children with varicella infection or influenza-like illnesses is associated with an increased risk of developing Reye syndrome.

### Benefits of topical hyaluronic acid for skin quality and signs of skin aging: from literature review to clinical evidence [^115cqhXH]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

As previously described in Section 2, a prospective, single‐blind, 24‐week RCT was recently performed using an innovative cosmeceutical with 1.5% multimolecular weight HA, Vitamin Cg, peptides, and volcanic mineralizing water (Liftactiv HA epidermic filler [HA‐filler serum]) in combination with BoNTA (Botulinum Toxin A 300 U [Dysport®], Galderma Laboratories, L.P.) to treat facial skin aging. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT to combine BoNTA and HA with a 6‐month follow up.

This study included adult females with moderate symmetrical facial wrinkles graded Scale 3 to 4 by the Skin Aging Atlas (forehead, glabellar, and Crow's feet wrinkles). Wrinkles and fine lines were by far their main skin concern (approximately 94%), however only 11%–13% used a serum or eye care products, 71% used sunscreen, and nearly 20% smoked. Subjects were randomized to two groups: 31 subjects used HA‐filler serum 24 h after the BoNTA injection then twice daily (over the entire face including the eye contour) for 24 weeks, and 32 in the control group received the procedure alone. Both treatment groups received SPF 50+ sunscreen (UV Age daily photoprotection [SPF50+, UVA‐PF 46] with Netlock technology, Vichy Laboratories) for use during the study. The primary objective was to evaluate the benefit of HA‐filler serum with BoNTA injection compared to the procedure alone in improving signs of facial skin aging (graded on a 0–10 visual analog scale by a dermatologist) and subject satisfaction.

### Benefits of topical hyaluronic acid for skin quality and signs of skin aging: from literature review to clinical evidence [^1161xqGw]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Skin aging goes beyond a chronological process and also results from extrinsic factors referred to as the exposome. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an important component of the extracellular matrix, with loss starting at 25 years old. While many studies of HA concern topical use, few literature reviews only address the use of topical HA in dermatology. This review describes the different characteristics of HA‐containing cosmeceuticals, with a focus on skin aging and the impact of exposome factors on HA synthesis and degradation. A review was performed using the terms HA, hyaluronan, topical, dermatology, cosmetic, aging treatment, exposome, and cosmeceuticals. Results are also presented from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), which investigated the additional benefit of using a HA epidermic filler (HA‐filler serum) combined with Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) to treat signs of skin aging. Subjects were randomized to two groups: HA‐filler serum starting 24 h after the BoNTA injection then twice daily for 24 weeks, or the control group, which received BoNTA. HA is a key ingredient used in cosmeceuticals for its hydration/antiaging properties (hygroscopic, rheological, and viscoelastic). Several clinical studies indicate that HA is both well tolerated and effective, adjuvant to both post‐surgical and facial rejuvenation procedures. In the RCT, one of few studies to combine BoNTA and HA with a 6‐month follow‐up, the HA‐filler serum lengthened the duration of BoNTA's effect in reducing wrinkles. Numerous studies support HA‐based cosmeceuticals as a noninvasive, effective solution for improving skin hydration and rejuvenation.

Other procedures (fillers, peels, etc.)

Fillers, microneedling, and chemical peeling were found to benefit from a topical HA when used postprocedurally, according to a randomized, investigator‐blinded, split‐face, parallel‐arm trial conducted among 24 adult females with dry facial skin (skin hydration level ≤ 60 arbitrary units [A.U.] via corneometry) and aging signs. Starting 2 days post‐procedure and for 28 days, the HA serum was applied twice daily, combined with a HA‐based balm for 2 days after the procedure. The HA serum was well tolerated, and three‐dimensional in vivo imaging of the lateral canthal areas, bioinstrumental including corneometry and cutometry (i.e. increased skin hydration, firmness, tonicity, and elasticity), and clinical assessments showed significantly greater improvement than untreated areas. A meta‐analysis in eight countries among 2363 subjects corroborates that a HA‐containing product can be applied topically with improved efficacy and tolerability following a variety of procedures: peels, fractional ablative lasers and/or continuous (CO₂), pigment lasers, laser tattoo removal, intense pulsed light, cryotherapy, injections, and minor surgery. In addition, these authors present pediatric cases where topical HA use resulted in high efficacy after thermal burns to prevent scarring.

Use of topicalin combination with BoNTA

BoNTA is frequently used in clinical practice for relaxing facial muscles of the upper face, which in turn gives the perception that there are fewer wrinkles. BoNTA is injected into muscle, binding at the nerve terminal, which prevents release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, from the nerve synapse. Thus, muscle contraction (and hyperdynamic wrinkle) is prevented. Its duration of effect is considered to last 4–6 months, however, authors of a recent Cochrane review note that defining its duration of effect needs further study.

Benefits of using topical HA in conjunction with BoNTA injection are also present in the literature. An open‐label, before‐and‐after, interventional study highlighted the possible benefits post‐BoNTA of a topical HA, which led to significant improvement in facial fine lines and wrinkles after 8 weeks of treatment when compared to baseline.

Sensitive skin is a multifactorial condition, where the underlying pathology is not fully understood, and the clinical signs may not always be present or obvious. Despite this challenge, there has been recent progress to understand the different subtypes of sensitive skin, as well as new methods to measure the sensorial response that may not be obvious from visual examination. Similarly, there has been progress in understanding in the management of symptoms through skin care regimens designed for sensitive skin. The implications of this new research indicate the potential of better clinical outcomes for sensitive skin sufferers, as well as regimens more personalized to different triggers in the full spectrum of sensitive skin.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^117EqA4c]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Miscellaneous therapies and physical modalities — evidence and opinions are summarized as follows: There is limited evidence to recommend the use and benefit of physical modalities for the routine treatment of acne, including pulsed dye laser, glycolic acid peels, and salicylic acid peels, whereas intralesional corticosteroid injections are effective in the treatment of individual acne nodules. There is limited evidence published that addresses the efficacy of comedo removal for the treatment of acne, but the work group states comedo removal is often helpful when comedones are resistant to other therapies. Studies suggest that chemical peels may improve acne, though large, multicenter, double-blinded control trials comparing peels to placebo and comparing different peels are lacking; glycolic acid and salicylic acid chemical peels may be helpful for noninflammatory (comedonal) lesions, but multiple treatments are needed and the results are not long-lasting. Some laser and light devices may be beneficial for acne, but additional studies are needed, with evaluated options including pulsed dye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, fractionated and nonfractionated infrared lasers, the fractionated CO2 laser, and nonlaser light devices such as radiofrequency, intense pulsed light, photopneumatic therapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT).

Vitamin D analogue combinations and precautions — drug interaction and special-site guidance are provided. Simultaneous use of salicylic acid with calcipotriene should be avoided because the acid pH of salicylic acid will inactivate calcipotriene and reduce its effectiveness. Topical vitamin D analogues combined with betamethasone dipropionate can be used for nail psoriasis to reduce nail thickness, hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and pain. Topical maxacalcitol (not available in the US) ointment can be considered as an initial treatment for palmoplantar psoriasis, including palmoplantar pustulosis. Calcipotriene ointment combined with topical tacrolimus is more efficacious than tacrolimus alone, and combination products with calcipotriene and topical nicotinamide are effective for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis.

### Study on the efficacy and safety of supramolecular salicylic acid in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea: results from a multicenter randomized double-blind placebo-controlled superiority study [^114cM6n4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder with a complex etiology involving genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Despite various treatments, managing papulopustular lesions remains challenging. Salicylic acid, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has been used in dermatology for decades, but its efficacy in treating rosacea needs further exploration. This study investigated the effectiveness and safety of 30% supramolecular salicylic acid (SSA) in treating papulopustular rosacea.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 480 patients aged 18 to 60 years with papulopustular rosacea. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 30% SSA or placebo biweekly for six weeks, with follow-up assessments up to week 8. The study assessed primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, including lesion reduction rates, IGA and ISA scores, VISIA red area improvements, and skin barrier functions, as well as safety and tolerability evaluations.

Results

The SSA group showed a significant improvement in the primary efficacy endpoint at week 8, with efficacy rates of 51.25% (full-analysis set, FAS) and 59.90% (per-protocol set, PPS), compared to 18.33% (FAS) and 20.50% (PPS) in the placebo group (P < 0.0001 for both). Secondary endpoints also favored SSA, demonstrating notable improvements in lesion reduction, IGA and ISA scores, and skin condition. Safety profiles were comparable between the SSA and placebo groups, with no significant difference in adverse event rates.

Conclusion

The study's findings highlight the superior efficacy of 30% SSA in improving papulopustular rosacea symptoms compared with that of a placebo, coupled with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Although the multicenter design and rigorous methodology strengthen the validity of the study, limitations such as short-term follow-up and potential site variability warrant consideration. Further long-term studies are recommended to fully ascertain the therapeutic potential of SSA in rosacea treatment.

### Therapeutic efficacy and safety of three different modalities in pediatric patients with plantar warts [^114xviUY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus infection is relatively common in communities. Thus, determining an effective and painless treatment method, especially in pediatric patients is of utmost importance. This study aimed to compare the outcomes of three different methods of treating plantar warts in pediatric patients. Children with verruca plantaris treated with a salicylic acid-lactic acid combination once daily (SA/LA 1), a salicylic acid-lactic acid combination applied in three to seven layers under occlusion every 3days (SA/LA 2), or a combination of 5-fluorouracil (0.5%) and salicylic acid (10%) (SA/5-FU) were evaluated retrospectively. Treatment responses and recurrence rates were also evaluated after a minimum of 4 months. Among the 98 children with verruca plantaris, 19 were treated with SA/LA 1, 53 were treated with SA/LA 2, and 18 were treated with SA/5-FU; the eight patients who received cryotherapy were excluded. The mean treatment duration was significantly shorter in the SA/LA 2 group than in the SA/LA 1 group and the SA/5-FU group. (p = 0.000 for both) Application of a salicylic acid-lactic acid combination in multiple layers under occlusion is a safe, painless, and effective treatment method for plantar warts in children.

### Evaluating hyaluronic acid dermal fillers: a critique of current characterization methods [^112xrAuS]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSION

A growing body of literature reports experimental data on HA dermal fillers, however, correlation within clinical application and long‐term performance is lagging behind.

Overall, the methods described in this review and commonly reported on fillers do not predict the long‐term performance of the gels. However, a large set of physico‐chemical parameters can act as an indicator of performance, which, alongside clinical experience, is extremely helpful in guiding clinicians in choosing the optimal product for a specific application.

Future work should focus on establishing standardized experimental protocols and link them to clinical data.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116LqUs2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the past decade, many high-quality studies have been conducted, and the level of evidence for many treatment or prevention regimens has strengthened. As reflected in my reprised review here, these changes have led to pathologic scar management strategies that now effectively and safely prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate these pernicious scars. However, given ethnic differences in pathologic scar propensity, prevention and treatment algorithms should be optimized for each human race by means of international collaboration.

In 1987 the American Academy of Dermatology began to create Guidelines of Care for clinical disease processes in dermatology. The format of the guidelines has changed dramatically over the past several years; now all of the recent guidelines are in the evidence-based style. These guidelines have been recognized nationally both in print and on the World Wide Web, establishing dermatologists as the skin experts. We believe that these guidelines continue to serve as effective educational tools for dermatologists around the world.

### Alpha hydroxy acids… [^1153WKrP]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

These studies confirmed previous industry studies indicating that applying AHAs to the skin results in increased UV sensitivity. After four weeks of AHA application, volunteers' sensitivity to skin reddening produced by UV increased by 18 percent. Similarly, the volunteers' sensitivity to UV-induced cellular damage doubled, on average, with considerable differences among individuals. However, the studies also indicated that this increase in sensitivity is reversible and does not last long after discontinuing use of the AHA cream. One week after the treatments were halted, researchers found no significant differences in UV sensitivity among the various skin sites. The studies did not identify exactly how AHAs bring about the increased UV sensitivity, although the effects did not appear to involve dramatic increases in UV-induced damage to DNA in the skin.

Previous FDA studies have indicated that a cosmetic-type cream base caused an AHA to penetrate more deeply into the skin when compared to an AHA solution without the usual cosmetic ingredients. However, further studies will be needed to learn how much, if at all, those cosmetic-type ingredients influence the AHA-related effects on UV sensitivity. FDA also has collaborated with the National Toxicology Program to assess the safety of the long-term use of AHAs. This study determined that glycolic acid did not affect photocarcinogenesis in mice, and that salicyclic acid had a photoprotective effect in mice.

FDA recommends that the labeling of a cosmetic product that contains an AHA as an ingredient and that is topically applied to the skin or mucous membrane, such as the lips, bear a statement that conveys the following information: Sunburn Alert: This product contains an alpha hydroxy acid that may increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterwards. Based on industry-sponsored studies, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel — the industry's self-regulatory body for reviewing the safety of cosmetic ingredients — concluded that products containing the AHAs glycolic and lactic acid are safe for use by consumers if:

- The AHA concentration is 10 percent or less.
- The final product has a pH of 3. 5 or greater.
- The final product is formulated in such a way that it protects the skin from increased sun sensitivity or its package directions tell consumers to use daily protection from the sun.

### Beta hydroxy acids… [^113LixLc]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Throughout the last decade, alpha hydroxy acids have increasingly appeared as ingredients in cosmetics intended to reduce the signs of aging in the skin. More recently, beta hydroxy acids, or a combination of AHAs and BHAs, have appeared as ingredients in these skin care products. While both AHAs and BHAs act as exfoliants, it has been claimed that BHAs are effective in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and improving overall skin texture, without the occasional irritation associated with the use of AHAs. BHA ingredients may be listed as
- - salicylic acid *
- beta hydroxybutanoic acid
- tropic acid
- trethocanic acid Currently, the BHA most commonly used in cosmetics is salicylic acid. On rare occasions, citric acid is also cited as a BHA in cosmetic formulations. More commonly, citric acid is referred to as an AHA.

The safety of salicylic acid used as a cosmetic ingredient has been evaluated by both the cosmetic industry and FDA. At a meeting in February 2000, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel, the cosmetic industry's independent body for reviewing the safety of cosmetic ingredients, reached the tentative conclusion that the use of salicylic acid related substances in cosmetics is "safe as used when formulated to avoid irritation and when formulated to avoid increased sun sensitivity. " CIR added that "when sun sensitivity would be expected, directions for use include the daily use of sun protection". In other words, according to CIR Director Alan Andersen, products containing salicylic acid should either contain a sunscreen or bear directions advising consumers to use other sun protection.

In order to comply with the CIR recommendations, cosmetic manufacturers should test their products to determine whether or not they cause an increase in sensitivity to the harmful ultraviolet radiation in sunlight. The long-term safety of salicylic acid in cosmetics also is being evaluated in studies initiated by FDA and sponsored by the National Toxicology Program. These government-sponsored studies are examining the long-term effects of both glycolic acid and salicylic acid on the skin's response to ultraviolet light. These studies have determined that applying glycolic acid to the skin can make people more susceptible to the damaging effects of the sun, including sunburn.

### Labeling for cosmetics containing alpha hydroxy acids… [^111EWVnW]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

FDA has considered evidence that suggests that topically applied cosmetic products containing alpha hydroxy acids as ingredients may increase the sensitivity of skin to the sun while the products are used and for up to a week after use is stopped, and that this increased skin sensitivity to the sun may increase the possibility of sunburn. "Sun Alert: Because this product may make your skin more sensitive to the sun, be certain you have adequate sunscreen protection while using this product and for a week after you discontinue use". "Based on the available information included in this report, the CIR Expert Panel concludes that Glycolic and Lactic Acid, their common salts and their simple esters, are safe for use in cosmetic products at concentrations ≤ 10%, at final formulation pH ≥ 3. 5, when formulated to avoid increasing sun sensitivity or when directions for use include the daily use of sun protection.

FDA's AHA Review Committee, which met on February 12, 1997, and May 6, 1997, agreed that the evidence suggests that topical application of AHAs increases skin sensitivity to UV radiation, as measured by increased SBC formation and decreased MED. The Committee noted that in the human clinical studies they reviewed, a small proportion of people showed an amplified effect on increased SBC formation or decreased MED. Five of the studies measured increased SBC formation and/or decreased MED. The sixth study measured increased CPD formation. The studies used solar-simulating radiation and/or UVB radiation for determining baseline MEDs and for determining changes in MED and SBC or CPD formation. Although the studies investigated the effects of glycolic acid, FDA believes that the effects of other types of AHAs used in cosmetic products may be the same.

The human clinical studies that measured increased SBC formation or decreased MED found that topical application of glycolic acid at concentrations as low as 4% and for as short a duration as four days can alter the skin's response to UV radiation. Furthermore, the skin's enhanced sensitivity to UV radiation continues during exposure to glycolic acid of up to 12 weeks. In most of the studies reviewed, a subset of subjects appeared to be more susceptible to the effects of glycolic acid on UV-induced increased SBC formation and decreased MED. This suggests that some individuals are more responsive than others to AHA-induced increased skin sensitivity to UV radiation. However, the studies did not identify any basis for identifying this subset of sensitive individuals, as a wide range of skin types was implicated.
