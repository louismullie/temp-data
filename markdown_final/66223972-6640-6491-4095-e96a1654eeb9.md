## Question

Bradycardia algorithm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the bradycardia algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework and scope. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, including stability, ECG, and reversible causes. Next, I will examine acute management pathways for unstable versus stable patients. After that, I need to check the chronic management algorithms for sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block, including pacing indications. Finally, I will review special populations, shared decision-making, and summarize key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the framework and scope so I don't miss anything important. The 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS guideline is the primary source for adult bradycardia and conduction disease, emphasizing symptom correlation, reversible causes, and a stepwise evaluation from history and ECG to ambulatory monitoring and, when needed, electrophysiology study, with the 2025 AHA ALS update informing acute management and the 2021 ESC pacing guideline aligning on pacing indications and device selection, so I should anchor to these documents throughout [^2242d5fc] [^6e3368ec] [^7de23d41].

> I need to ensure the initial assessment is methodical. Stability comes first: hypotension, altered mental status, shock, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure define cardiopulmonary compromise and mandate immediate treatment while supporting ABCs and oxygen as needed; if no compromise, I should obtain a 12-lead ECG, establish IV access, and begin identifying reversible causes such as ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbances, acidosis, hypothermia, or drug effects like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or antiarrhythmics, because correcting these can obviate pacing in many cases [^6e3368ec] [^25bc10b4] [^3be205a2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the ECG's diagnostic yield. I initially thought the ECG would correlate with symptoms in most cases, but wait, let me verify — unless the patient is symptomatic or bradycardic at the time of recording, the 12-lead ECG often does not provide rhythm–symptom correlation, and in syncope only about 10% are attributable to bradycardia or conduction disease at initial presentation, though an abnormal ECG predicts worse outcomes and is included in risk scores, so I should interpret a normal ECG cautiously and plan ambulatory monitoring when suspicion remains [^42004b1a] [^003c1f9c].

> Next, I should review acute management for unstable bradycardia. Atropine 0.5–1 mg IV every 3–5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mg is first-line when the block is likely AV nodal; if atropine fails or is inappropriate, transcutaneous pacing and/or catecholamine infusions such as dopamine or epinephrine are reasonable bridges while preparing for transvenous pacing; I should double-check special cautions — atropine is ineffective for infranodal block and should be avoided in heart transplant, and in drug toxicity with severe symptoms I should prepare for pacing while treating the overdose [^6e3368ec] [^35c14e5b] [^98e4034f] [^05825a95].

> For stable patients, I should confirm the diagnostic pathway. A comprehensive history and physical, targeted labs including electrolytes, thyroid function, and troponin when indicated, and a 12-lead ECG are foundational; if structural disease is suspected, transthoracic echocardiography is appropriate, and if symptoms are exercise-related, exercise ECG testing can unmask conduction disease; ambulatory ECG monitoring should be selected based on symptom frequency — Holter for frequent symptoms, external loop or patch for weekly to monthly events, and implantable cardiac monitoring for infrequent symptoms with a nondiagnostic initial workup [^2242d5fc] [^bb63b3e2] [^02dc6824] [^d1774709].

> Let me consider sinus node dysfunction next. I should confirm symptoms correlate with bradycardia and rule out reversible causes; if SND is due to required guideline-directed therapy with no reasonable alternative, permanent pacing is Class I; if symptoms correlate with bradycardia, pacing is Class I; if symptoms do not correlate or the patient is asymptomatic, pacing is Class III harm; oral theophylline may be considered as a temporizing measure when pacing is deferred, with reassessment of symptom correlation and patient preference guiding next steps [^02b0147c] [^4367c658] [^9ccec7f1].

> I will now examine atrioventricular block management. For acquired second-degree Mobitz II, high-grade AV block, or third-degree AV block not due to reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms; for other AV blocks, pacing is generally reserved for symptomatic patients or when there is evidence of progressive conduction disease; I should confirm that reversible causes like ischemia, sleep apnea, or drug toxicity are treated first, and if AV block persists despite correction, pacing is indicated [^736f3d41] [^2242d5fc] [^5b6d04f0].

> But wait, what if the site of block is unclear, such as 2:1 AV block. I should double-check the diagnostic steps: exercise testing can help distinguish nodal from infranodal block, and electrophysiology study may be considered when noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic; this matters because infranodal block carries a stronger indication for pacing even if asymptomatic, so I need to ensure I don't misclassify the level of block before deciding on therapy [^5e51e872] [^12626756].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In epilepsy with severe symptomatic ictal bradycardia refractory to antiseizure therapy, permanent pacing is reasonable to reduce symptom severity; in patients with conduction disease who also have ventricular arrhythmia risk, I should evaluate for ICD candidacy and consider combined devices; in pediatrics, the threshold for pacing and drug dosing differ, so I must apply pediatric ALS algorithms rather than adult pathways [^69ae13e9] [^522862cb] [^bcf1693e].

> I need to ensure shared decision-making is embedded throughout. Pacemaker decisions should incorporate patient preferences, prognosis, comorbidities, and goals of care, with explicit discussion of procedural risks, lead management over time, and end-of-life considerations including pacemaker deactivation; this is especially critical when benefit is uncertain or when pacing is unlikely to change outcomes [^07674dd2] [^75e55c1e] [^28e07c7b].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. First, treat instability immediately with atropine, pacing, and catecholamines while correcting reversible causes. Second, never anchor on a single heart rate threshold — symptoms and correlation drive therapy. Third, reversible causes must be identified and treated before committing to permanent pacing. Fourth, ambulatory monitoring selection should match symptom frequency. Fifth, pacing is mandatory for high-grade infranodal block regardless of symptoms, whereas SND and other AV blocks generally require symptom correlation. Sixth, shared decision-making is essential, particularly when benefits are modest or comorbidity limits gain [^6e3368ec] [^2242d5fc] [^736f3d41] [^07674dd2].

---

The bradycardia algorithm is a **stepwise approach** to evaluate and manage slow heart rates, prioritizing hemodynamic stability, reversible causes, and symptom correlation [^6e3368ec] [^2242d5fc]. For unstable patients, **immediate atropine, transcutaneous pacing, or catecholamines** are indicated; for stable patients, identify and treat reversible causes, use ECG and ambulatory monitoring to correlate symptoms, and consider permanent pacing only when symptoms are due to bradycardia or when high-grade AV block is present [^584c5c76] [^3bc0158a]. The algorithm emphasizes **shared decision-making** and individualized care, especially in chronic or complex cases [^07674dd2] [^75e55c1e].

## Initial assessment and stabilization

### Hemodynamic stability assessment

Assess for **cardiopulmonary compromise**, including hypotension, altered mental status, shock, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, or syncope [^6e3368ec]. Unstable patients require **immediate intervention**, whereas stable patients proceed to diagnostic evaluation [^25bc10b4].

---

### Immediate interventions for unstable bradycardia

- **Atropine**: 0.5 mg IV every 3–5 minutes, up to 3 mg (Class IIa) [^584c5c76] [^35c14e5b].
- **Transcutaneous pacing**: If atropine is ineffective or contraindicated (Class IIb) [^584c5c76] [^4b2e4e74].
- **Catecholamines**: Dopamine or epinephrine infusions if pacing is unavailable or ineffective (Class IIb) [^584c5c76] [^6eac6188].
- **Transvenous pacing**: For persistent instability despite above measures (Class IIa) [^584c5c76] [^584c5c76].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation for stable patients

### History and physical examination

Obtain a **comprehensive history and physical exam** to identify symptoms, triggers, comorbidities, and medications (Class I) [^74dcde10]. Focus on **reversible causes** such as ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, and medication effects (e.g. beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin) [^4ac6f3f8].

---

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

Obtain a **12-lead ECG** to define rhythm, rate, conduction abnormalities, and ischemia (Class I) [^2242d5fc]. If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic, repeat ECGs or use ambulatory monitoring to correlate symptoms with rhythm [^bb63b3e2].

---

### Laboratory tests

Order **directed labs**, including electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, and thyroid function (Class IIa) [^2242d5fc]. Consider **troponin** if ischemia is suspected.

---

### Ambulatory ECG monitoring

- **Holter monitor**: For frequent symptoms (24–72 hours) [^97cf6bd1].
- **External loop recorder**: For symptoms likely to recur within 2–6 weeks [^02dc6824].
- **Implantable cardiac monitor (ICM)**: For infrequent symptoms (> 30 days between episodes) [^d1774709].

---

## Management based on underlying cause

### Reversible causes

Treat identified **reversible causes** (e.g. ischemia, electrolyte imbalance, medication adjustment) (Class I) [^4ac6f3f8]. Re-evaluate symptoms after correction; **pacing is not indicated** if bradycardia resolves [^c6082231].

---

### Sinus node dysfunction (SND)

- **Symptom correlation**: Confirm symptoms align with bradycardia (Class I) [^9ccec7f1].
- **Permanent pacing**: Indicated for symptomatic SND or when bradycardia is due to required GDMT with no alternatives (Class I) [^02b0147c].
- **Asymptomatic SND**: No pacing; consider oral theophylline if symptoms are uncertain (Class IIb) [^05c2e1eb].

---

### Atrioventricular (AV) block

- **High-grade AV block**: Mobitz II, advanced, or complete heart block not due to reversible causes requires permanent pacing regardless of symptoms (Class I) [^736f3d41].
- **Other AV blocks**: Pacing indicated only if symptoms correlate with bradycardia (Class I) [^3bc0158a].
- **Unclear block level**: Use exercise testing or electrophysiology study to determine site of block (Class IIa/IIb) [^5e51e872].

---

## Special considerations

### Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)

In AMI, **atropine is first-line** for nodal block; avoid in infranodal block. Temporary pacing is reserved for **high-grade AV block with instability** or **contraindicated atropine** [^notfound].

---

### Drug toxicity

Treat the **toxicity** (e.g. beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, digoxin) and provide supportive care. Pacing is reserved for **persistent instability** despite antidote therapy [^05825a95].

---

### Pediatric patients

Use **epinephrine as first-line** for unstable bradycardia; atropine is second-line. Pacing is considered if **medications fail** [^bcf1693e].

---

## Shared decision-making and patient-centered care

Engage patients in decisions about pacing, discussing **risks, benefits, and alternatives** (Class I) [^07674dd2]. Consider **end-of-life issues**, including pacemaker deactivation and patient preferences [^28e07c7b].

---

## Summary of the bradycardia algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Assess hemodynamic stability |
| 2 | Stabilize unstable patients (atropine, pacing, catecholamines) |
| 3 | Evaluate stable patients (history, ECG, labs, monitoring) |
| 4 | Identify and treat reversible causes |

| 6 | Consider permanent pacing if indicated |
| 7 | Engage in shared decision-making |

---

The bradycardia algorithm provides a **structured approach** to rapidly stabilize unstable patients and systematically evaluate stable patients, ensuring that pacing is reserved for those with symptom-correlated bradycardia or high-grade AV block, with ongoing emphasis on reversible causes and patient preferences [^6e3368ec] [^2242d5fc].

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — ECG role and yield in syncope notes that unless a patient with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder is symptomatic or bradycardic at the time of the recording, the 12-lead ECG will not provide a rhythm correlation with symptoms; in patients presenting with syncope, the initial ECG provides a diagnosis in only approximately 5%, but an abnormal initial ECG is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with syncope and near syncope, including increased all-cause mortality at 1 year and inclusion of abnormal ECG in most multivariate risk scores; risk does not necessarily indicate bradycardia as cause, as only approximately 10% of syncope can be attributed to bradycardia or a conduction disorder at initial presentation, and an additional 18% can be attributed to neurally mediated syncope which frequently manifests with both bradycardia and hypotension; ECG also helps confirm rhythm and rate, define conduction disturbance, and document abnormalities suggestive of structural or systemic disease.

Atrioventricular block initial evaluation — the algorithm directs that when a 'Reversible or Physiologic cause' is present, 'Treat underlying cause as needed, e.g., sleep apnea (Class I)'. With 'Suspicion for structural heart disease', it lists 'Transthoracic echocardiography (Class I)'. When there is 'Suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, ACHD etc'. it lists 'Advanced imaging* (Class IIa)'. For cases that are 'Unclear (e.g., 2:1 AV Block)', testing steps include 'Exercise testing (Class IIa)' and 'Electrophysiology study (Class IIb)', after which care proceeds via the 'AV block treatment algorithm†'.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — unless a patient with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorder is symptomatic or bradycardic at the time of the recording, the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will not provide a rhythm correlation with symptoms. However, an abnormal initial ECG is predictive of adverse outcomes in patients presenting with syncope and near syncope, and a multicenter, prospective observational study concluded that electrocardiographic abnormalities were associated with increased all-cause mortality at 1 year. The prognostic value of an abnormal initial ECG is reflected in its inclusion in most published multivariate risk scores, and this risk does not necessarily correlate with pathological bradycardia because only approximately 10% of syncope can be attributed to bradycardia or a conduction disorder at the time of initial presentation; an additional 18% can be attributed to neurally mediated syncope.

Chronic SND management algorithm — Begin by confirming symptoms and ruling out reversible causes. If bradycardia is due to required guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT) with no reasonable alternative, proceed to permanent pacing (Class I). If symptoms correlate with bradycardia, permanent pacing (Class I) is pursued. For cases not clearly symptomatic, oral theophylline (Class IIb) may be used, followed by reassessment of whether the response suggests symptomatic sinus node dysfunction and whether the patient is willing to have a permanent pacemaker (PPM). In patients who are asymptomatic or in whom symptoms do not correlate, permanent pacing is designated Class III: Harm.

Shared decision-making process — The bradycardia guideline writing committee endorses shared decision-making as part of the general care for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, and a commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making, and if time permits the patient should be directed to trusted material which supports and itemizes appropriate considerations which should be factored into their decision-making.

Acute pacing algorithm — branch points and classes of recommendation — The algorithm starts with "Hemodynamic instability despite medical therapy" and assesses "Critically ill due to bradycardia?"; if "Permanent pacemaker indicated and capability immediately available", proceed to "Implant Permanent pacemaker†". Otherwise, "Transcutaneous pacing (Class IIb)" is used while determining "Prolonged temporary pacing needed?" and, when prolonged support is needed, options include "Externalized permanent pacing lead (Class IIa)" or "Temporary transvenous pacing wire (Class IIa)". The footnote specifies "†Careful management of anesthesia to avoid or minimize the use of drugs associated with bradycardia is required".

Bradycardia guideline — initial evaluation of suspected or documented sinus node dysfunction (SND) proceeds by first assessing for a reversible or physiologic cause; when present, "Treat underlying cause as needed, e.g., sleep apnea (Class I)". If there is "Suspicion for structural heart disease", perform "Transthoracic echocardiography (Class IIa)", and if there is "Suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, ACHD", consider "Advanced imaging† (Class IIa)". For symptomatic assessment, if exercise-related, the algorithm includes "If not already performed: Exercise ECG testing (Class IIa)", and rhythm correlation is addressed with "If not already performed: Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I)". Invasive testing is limited to "Electrophysiology study† (if performed for other reasons) (Class IIb)", and "The electrophysiology test should not be done primarily for sinus node dysfunction". The figure also specifies SND manifestations as "Sinus pauses, sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythm, ectopic atrial rhythm (all with heart rates < 50 bpm) while awake".

Evaluation of conduction disorders — algorithm-driven testing and monitoring are outlined as follows: The pathway begins with identifying evidence for a conduction disorder and addressing reversible or physiologic causes with "Treat underlying cause as needed, e.g., ischemia", proceeding to "Observe" if treatment is effective. When there is "Suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, ACHD", the algorithm specifies "Advanced imaging (Class IIb)", and the legend notes advanced imaging options may include magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or transesophageal echocardiography. Conduction type guides echocardiography: "LBBB" leads to "Transthoracic echocardiography (Class I)", while "RBBB or fascicular block" leads to "Transthoracic echocardiography (Class IIa)". For symptomatic patients, the pathway includes "Symptoms suggestive of intermittent bradycardia?" with "Ambulatory ECG Monitoring (Class I)", and elsewhere shows "Ambulatory ECG Monitoring (Class IIb)" and "Electrophysiology study (Class IIb)", with the legend stating "Monitor choice based on the frequency of symptoms".

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^ebf68f32]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals, and in patients as part of normal aging or disease (Table 1). Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. In this review, we will highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

Adult bradycardia with a pulse — management follows a branch algorithm starting with "Assess appropriateness for clinical condition. Heart rate typically < 50/min if bradyarrhythmia". If there is "Cardiopulmonary compromise?" defined by hypotension, acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, ischemic chest discomfort, or acute heart failure, proceed to "Assessment and support" to maintain the patient airway and provide oxygen, assist breathing with positive-pressure ventilation as necessary, attach a cardiorespiratory monitor, and monitor pulse. If no compromise, identify and treat underlying causes, support ABCs, consider oxygen, obtain a 12-lead ECG, and observe. If "Bradycardia persists with cardiopulmonary compromise?" give atropine; if atropine is ineffective, use transcutaneous pacing and/or dopamine or epinephrine infusion, and consider expert consultation and transvenous pacing.

### Management of patients with unexplained syncope: derivation and validation of a simplified 2-step diagnostic approach [^2c5de70f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to develop a structured 2‐step approach, based on noninvasive diagnostic criteria, that led to an electrophysiology study in patients with unexplained syncope.

Methods and Results

Two independent cohorts were used: the derivation cohort with 665 patients based on electronic health record data to develop our 2‐step diagnostic approach, and the validation cohort based on 160 prospectively screened patients, presenting with unexplained syncope episodes. Noninvasive electrocardiographic and imaging markers and an electrophysiology study–based invasive assessment were combined. A positive diagnostic approach according to our study's prespecified criteria resulted in a decision to proceed with a permanent pacemaker/implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator. The primary end point was the time until the event of recurrent syncope (syncope‐free survival). Number needed to treat was calculated for patients with a positive diagnostic approach. The number of patients with unexplained syncope and borderline sinus bradycardia needed to treat was 5, and the number of patients with unexplained syncope and bundle branch block needed to treat was 3 over a mean follow‐up of ≈4 years. After the structured 2‐step approach, the primary outcome occurred in 14 of 82 (17.1%) with a pacemaker/implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator and 19 of 57 (33%) with a negative approach, with a mean follow‐up of ≈2.5 years (29.29 ± 12.58 months, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

The low number needed to treat in the derivation cohort and the low percentage of syncope recurrence in the validation cohort supports the proposed 2‐step electrophysiology‐inclusive algorithm as a potentially low‐cost, 1‐day, structured tool for these patients.

Top 10 take-home messages — left bundle branch block and atrioventricular block evaluation state that the presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease and of diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test for structural heart disease, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not caused by reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms, whereas for all other types of atrioventricular block, in the absence of conditions associated with progressive atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, permanent pacing should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — transient/reversible causes and initial management — states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms. Negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin can decrease the sinus rate, and sodium-channel and potassium-channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs can exacerbate bradycardia in preexisting SND; hypothyroidism can cause clinically significant bradycardia and such cardiovascular abnormalities respond well to replacement therapy with thyroxine (T4), and metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia can uncommonly cause sinus bradycardia in acute settings.

"Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making". While "pacemaker implantation or revision are commonly performed heart procedures and are not typically associated with high procedural risk in most patients", adverse events "such as pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can complicate the procedure". Moreover, "patients with significant comorbid conditions may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support or an improved QOL", and "the benefit-risk ratio is not favorable if the probable benefit is also quite low", particularly in terminal progressive illness where "the benefits of pacing support may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome".

Management of patients needing pacing who may also be at risk for ventricular arrhythmias — supportive guidance: "Some patients who require or may benefit from pacing therapy may also be at risk for ventricular arrhythmias and an ICD should be considered". Before implantation for bradycardia or conduction tissue disease, "a separate evaluation for potential risk of sudden cardiac death attributable to ventricular arrhythmias should be performed", and final device choice should follow "an individualized choice based on shared decision-making principles".

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

Introduction

Bradycardia is a common finding in the emergency department (ED) and presents along a clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to hemodynamic compromise and cardiac arrest.

Objective

This manuscript evaluates the management of bradycardia through a discussion of several cases.

Discussion

Bradycardia may result in severe hemodynamic compromise and is defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute (bpm). There are a variety of causes and associations, including physiologic, pathologic, and pharmacologic. Patients may present with a range of signs and symptoms, from no symptoms to hemodynamic collapse. Obtaining an electrocardiogram is essential, which will determine the severity of bradycardia and underlying rhythm, including first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block, among others. Management is based on the underlying etiology and patient hemodynamic status, aiming to improve the heart rate and address the underlying cause. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require resuscitation with chronotropic agents and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

Conclusion

Severe bradycardia requires emergent management, and a knowledge of the treatment strategies can optimize patient care.

Adult advanced life support — bradycardia definition and clinical assessment states that bradycardia has historically been defined as a ventricular heart rate of less than 60/min, and the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline adopted a lower threshold of less than 50/min. Bradycardia can be a normal finding in healthy adults, athletes, or during sleep, and its clinical manifestation ranges from stable (asymptomatic) through symptomatic to unstable with signs of poor perfusion. Patients with symptomatic bradycardia can present with dizziness or light‑headedness, acute altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, hypotension, or syncope due to decreased cardiac output and tissue hypoperfusion. Clinicians must evaluate whether bradycardia is a manifestation of another underlying disease process (eg, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte disturbance, acidosis, hypothermia) or the primary driver of the presentation. Immediate treatment of symptomatic bradycardia is focused on both supporting perfusion and identifying and reversing the underlying cause(s).

Pacemaker implantation care — In patients with bradycardia who have indications for pacemaker implantation, shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized, and treatment decisions are based on the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences. Using the principles of shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with decision-making capacity or his/her legally defined surrogate has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent, which should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide, and any decision is complex, should involve all stakeholders, and will always be patient specific.

Epilepsy and symptomatic bradycardia — In patients with epilepsy associated with severe symptomatic bradycardia (ictal bradycardia) where antiepileptic medications are ineffective, permanent pacing is reasonable for reducing the severity of symptoms. In approximately 0.15% to 0.3% of patients with seizures, profound bradycardia can be observed and is often referred to as ictal bradycardia; bradycardia can be attributable to either sinus node arrest or complete heart block and is most commonly associated with temporal lobe source of seizures. Rate support in patients with profound bradycardia during seizures could theoretically attenuate the severity of associated syncope.

Cardiac rhythm monitors (Table 6) — Holter monitoring provides continuous recording for 24–72 h; up to 2 wk with newer models and is selected when symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within a fairly short period (24–72 h) of monitoring. External loop recorders continuously record over weeks to months and can be patient activated or auto triggered to provide a recording of events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) the triggered event, typically for frequent, spontaneous symptoms potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder, likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders have various models that record from 2–14 d and can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data (up to 30 d) to a central monitoring station attended by trained technicians 24 h/d and is suited to spontaneous symptoms that are too brief, too subtle, or too infrequent to be readily documented with patient activated monitors, including high-risk patients whose rhythm requires real-time monitoring. Implantable cardiac monitors are subcutaneously implanted with a battery life of 2–3 y and are used for recurrent, infrequent, unexplained symptoms, potentially related to bradycardia or conduction disorder after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease.

Temporary pacing synopsis — use history, safety signals, and technique considerations: Temporary transvenous pacing techniques have been used for nearly 60 years but have remarkably little data to guide their appropriate use; early literature suggests a high rate of complications and dislodgement that has prompted some authors to advise very limited use, whereas more recent case series and trials with balloon flotation catheters suggest better safety profile; the cause of atrioventricular block must be taken into account when considering the timing and necessity of temporary pacing, and in MI settings initial focus on primary reperfusion rather than temporary pacing for rate support may be associated with improved outcomes; the safety of prolonged temporary pacing with an externalized active fixation permanent pacing lead has been demonstrated over the past 10 years; transcutaneous pacing, devised > 60 years ago, has a limited role in the acute setting.
