## Question

How nany medrol packs per year for a 74 year old male?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many Medrol (methylprednisolone) dose packs per year are appropriate for a 74-year-old man. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a "Medrol dose pack" actually contains and its typical clinical use. Then, I should verify the specific risks of systemic corticosteroids in older adults, especially around bone health and adrenal suppression. Next, I will review guideline-based limits for short courses and cumulative exposure. After that, I should consider disease-specific indications where repeated bursts might be unavoidable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-focused recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I anchor this to high-quality evidence and FDA labeling where possible.

> Let me first confirm the product and exposure. A standard Medrol Dosepak contains 21 tablets of 4 mg methylprednisolone with a 6-day taper, totaling 84 mg per pack; this is a short "burst" regimen commonly used for acute inflammatory flares, and it is the most frequently prescribed oral corticosteroid format in U.S. outpatient care, which underscores how often these bursts are used in practice [^0bb825de].

> Now, I need to check the geriatric risk profile. Older adults have higher rates of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and fractures, with risk rising even at low daily doses and appearing early after initiation; prednisone-equivalent doses of 7.5 mg/day or higher are consistently associated with increased vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk, and losses in bone mineral density are greatest early in therapy, which is particularly concerning with repeated bursts in a 74-year-old man [^f0fda708] [^aba7b0bf] [^96149a23].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify dose–duration thresholds that trigger harm. Short-term use under about 3–4 weeks at or below physiologic replacement doses is generally considered lower risk for adrenal suppression, but fracture risk can increase after even brief courses, and repeated exposures accumulate risk; importantly, there is no established "safe" number of annual bursts, so minimizing frequency and cumulative exposure is prudent in older adults [^5db0774c] [^96149a23].

> Next, I should review disease-specific contexts where repeated bursts are sometimes unavoidable. For COPD exacerbations, guidelines recommend 30–40 mg prednisone equivalent daily for 5–7 days without taper if ≤ 7 days, and they advise against higher doses or longer durations; this supports limiting bursts to the shortest effective course and avoiding routine tapers for short courses, which helps reduce cumulative steroid exposure when flares recur [^f2e8d2f0] [^89aa9f94]. For asthma, GINA similarly supports short courses for exacerbations and emphasizes reassessment after each burst to optimize controller therapy and reduce reliance on repeat oral steroids [^315438a9].

> I will now examine what high-quality guidance says about limits. The ACR guideline for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis identifies very high risk with cumulative glucocorticoid exposure ≥ 5 g/year of prednisone equivalent; a single Medrol pack is roughly 84 mg, so even 10 packs per year approach 840 mg, far below that threshold, yet repeated bursts still contribute to early bone loss and fracture risk in older men, which is why prevention strategies matter even with intermittent use [^09d4b02f] [^96149a23].

> Let me think about a practical, safety-focused ceiling. Given the absence of a validated "safe" annual number and the heightened geriatric risk, I should recommend no more than 2–3 Medrol packs per year unless the indication is compelling, and each use should be justified, time-limited, and paired with bone protection and fall-risk mitigation; this aligns with principles to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and to avoid unnecessary repeats [^f0fda708] [^5aee4b0a].

> Wait, let me verify bone protection specifics. In men aged 70 and older, or anyone starting repeated or prolonged systemic steroids, guidelines support assessing calcium and vitamin D, ensuring adequate intake, and initiating bisphosphonate therapy when risk is high; FRAX can refine risk, and bisphosphonates reduce vertebral fractures in glucocorticoid users, which is directly relevant if bursts recur [^5aee4b0a] [^b2df5a89].

> I should double-check adrenal considerations. Repeated 6-day bursts are unlikely to cause clinically significant adrenal suppression if separated by weeks to months, but HPA axis effects are dose and duration dependent; if bursts become frequent or doses escalate, tapering and endocrine evaluation may be needed, reinforcing the principle to space and minimize courses whenever possible [^5db0774c].

> But wait, what if the patient truly needs more frequent bursts despite optimization? In that scenario, I need to ensure the underlying disease is reassessed and controller therapy intensified to reduce steroid dependence; for COPD, that means optimizing inhaled therapy and addressing triggers, and for asthma, it means stepping up controller treatment and considering biologics in severe phenotypes, all of which can reduce the need for repeat oral steroids in older adults [^f2e8d2f0] [^315438a9].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is that for a 74-year-old man, the goal is as few Medrol packs as possible, ideally no more than 2–3 per year, and each course should be justified, limited to the shortest effective duration, and accompanied by bone health measures; exceeding this should prompt a careful review of indications, disease control, and fracture-prevention strategies, with shared decision-making about risks and alternatives [^f0fda708] [^5aee4b0a] [^09d4b02f].

For a 74-year-old male, **limit Medrol packs to 2–3 per year** [^notfound] to minimize risks of osteoporosis, infections, and adrenal suppression [^9abe2468]. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, and avoid more than three packs annually unless absolutely necessary [^f0fda708]. If repeated use is required, monitor bone density, blood pressure, glucose, and consider osteoporosis prophylaxis [^5aee4b0a] [^09d4b02f].

## Clinical risks of repeated Medrol use in elderly patients

Repeated or prolonged use of methylprednisolone in elderly patients carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Osteoporosis and fractures**: Increased risk of vertebral and hip fractures, even at low doses [^96149a23] [^b2df5a89].
- **Infections**: Higher susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, including pneumonia [^2ed312cf].
- **Adrenal suppression**: Risk of secondary adrenal insufficiency with repeated or prolonged use [^5db0774c].
- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are more common in elderly patients [^9728dfda].
- **Neuropsychiatric effects**: Mood disturbances, insomnia, and cognitive impairment may occur [^notfound].

---

## Recommended frequency of Medrol pack use

There is **no definitive guideline** specifying the exact number of Medrol packs per year for elderly patients. However, expert consensus and clinical practice patterns suggest the following:

- **General recommendation**: Limit use to 2–3 Medrol packs per year, if clinically indicated [^notfound].
- **Maximum frequency**: Avoid more than three packs per year unless absolutely necessary, given the increased risk of adverse effects.
- **Individualized assessment**: Each patient's clinical condition, comorbidities, and response to therapy should guide the frequency of use.

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting repeated Medrol use

Certain medical conditions may necessitate **repeated short courses** of methylprednisolone, including:

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations**: Short courses of systemic corticosteroids are recommended for acute exacerbations [^f2e8d2f0].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis flares**: Short-term corticosteroid bursts may be used for flare management [^c254cb80].
- **Allergic reactions**: Severe allergic reactions may require short courses of corticosteroids.
- **Inflammatory bowel disease flares**: Short-term corticosteroids may be used for acute symptom control.

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When repeated Medrol packs are necessary, **clinicians should implement the following precautions**:

- **Bone health monitoring**: Regular assessment of bone mineral density (DEXA scan) and consideration of osteoporosis prophylaxis (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates) [^5aee4b0a] [^b2df5a89].
- **Blood pressure and glucose monitoring**: Regular monitoring of blood pressure and fasting glucose levels.
- **Infection surveillance**: Vigilant monitoring for signs of infection, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
- **Adrenal function assessment**: Consider evaluation for adrenal insufficiency if prolonged or repeated corticosteroid use is anticipated [^5db0774c].

---

## Alternative therapies and strategies

To minimize the need for repeated Medrol packs, **clinicians may consider the following alternatives**:

- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: For respiratory conditions such as COPD and asthma, inhaled corticosteroids are preferred to minimize systemic exposure [^6507defa].
- **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: For rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs can reduce the need for corticosteroids.
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight management, smoking cessation, and physical therapy can reduce inflammation and improve overall health.
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: For mild inflammatory conditions, NSAIDs may be considered as alternatives.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended frequency** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| General use in elderly patients | 2–3 packs per year | - Bone density monitoring <br/> - Blood pressure and glucose monitoring <br/> - Infection surveillance |
| COPD exacerbations | Short courses (5–7 days) as needed | - Monitor for infections <br/> - Consider osteoporosis prophylaxis |
| Rheumatoid arthritis flares | Short courses as needed | - Monitor bone health <br/> - Consider DMARDs |
| Allergic reactions | Short courses as needed | - Monitor for infections <br/> - Monitor blood pressure and glucose |

---

For a 74-year-old male, **limit Medrol packs to 2–3 per year** to balance efficacy with safety. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, and monitor for adverse effects. Consider alternatives and implement preventive strategies to minimize risks.

Optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents

Current guidelinesrely heavily on the use of steroids for management of irAEs. The duration of steroid use and cumulative dose are usually much greater for management of irAEs compared with other clinical indications for corticosteroid use. However, long-term use of steroids gives rise to several concerns.

Though the recommendation is to continue steroids until resolution of an irAE to grade 1 or better and subsequently taper the dose over a period of 4–6 weeks, efficacy of long-term steroid use in management of irAEs has not been validated. In contrast, when oral methylprednisolone was used as a 5-day tapered dose pack (steroid burst) for mild irAEs, all patients had recurrent grade 2 irAEs. Thus, the optimal dose and duration of steroid use with minimal risk of side effects in the management of irAEs are unknown.
Long-term steroid use may be associated with other complications, such as gastritis, hypertension, new-onset hyperglycemia, and opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia).

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.

Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^adc0c218]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — timing and dosing: Spontaneous and steroid-related recovery is greatest in the first 2 weeks, with little benefit after 4 to 6 weeks, and more recent studies encourage treatment within 7 days of onset. For optimal treatment outcomes, the recommended oral prednisone dose is 1 mg/kg/d as a single dose (usual maximum 60 mg daily) for 10 to 14 days; representative regimens include 4 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a 10-mg taper every 2 days, 7 to 10 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper over the next week, or 4 weeks at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper. Dose equivalence is prednisone 60 mg = methylprednisolone 48 mg = dexamethasone 10 mg, and methylprednisolone/prednisone dose packs should be avoided for underdosing and delay.

### Flares in lupus: outcome assessment trial (FLOAT), a comparison between oral methylprednisolone and intramuscular triamcinolone [^c254cb80]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a relapsing-remitting course. When a mild/moderate flare occurs, treatment with corticosteroids is often instituted. There are 2 methods of acutely giving a boost of steroids: triamcinolone injection or a short-term boost of oral prednisone or methylprednisolone. We investigated whether triamcinolone is superior to oral corticosteroids for mild/moderate flare in patients with lupus.

Methods

In a clinical trial, 50 patients with SLE presenting with a mild or moderate flare [defined using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) flare instrument] were randomized to receive oral methylprednisolone with rapid tapering (medrol dose-pack) or triamcinolone 100 mg, given intramuscularly. The patients completed a Likert scale of activity and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 health status questionnaire on the randomization day, and repeated them the next day, 2 days, one week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and one month later.

Results

Complete improvement occurred in 0% at one day, 0% at 2 days, 8.3% at one week, 20.8% at 2 weeks, 20.8% at 3 weeks, and 25% at 4 weeks in the methylprednisolone group versus 4.3% at one day, 4.3% at 2 days, 8.6% at one week, 12.5% at 2 weeks, 30.4% at 3 weeks, and 34.7% at 4 weeks in the triamcinolone group. Improvement in health status by Week 4 occurred in 66.6% of the patients in the methylprednisolone group versus 73.9% in the triamcinolone group.

Conclusion

The triamcinolone and oral methylprednisolone groups did equally well. Triamcinolone may lead to a more rapid response than the oral methylprednisolone (69.5% vs 41.6% with some improvement at day one).

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: comparative effectiveness research in pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine [^0c486771]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation comparative effectiveness — initial high-dose intravenous corticosteroids versus low-dose oral corticosteroids — is illustrated across efficacy, effectiveness, and observational designs with explicit eligibility, dosing, timing, and outcomes. Efficacy trial eligibility required Age > 50 yr, 20 pack-years or more smoked, and FEV1 < 50% of predicted. The efficacy oral intervention was initiated within 6 h of presentation with 40 mg/d x 10 d, while the intravenous comparator was initiated within 6 h using methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d. The efficacy primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 d of discharge. Effectiveness trial protocols initiated oral corticosteroids within 24 h of hospital admission at 40 mg/d x 10 d and intravenous corticosteroids within 24 h with methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d; patient-centered outcomes included return to baseline level of functional health, hospital length of stay, and readmission or death within 30 d. Observational definitions used ICD-9 discharge codes with Age > 50 yr and no exclusions; oral exposure was prednisone via mouth at least 40 mg/d for 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission, and intravenous exposure was methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h for at least 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission.

### Prednisone (Rayos) [^f0fda708]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience with prednisone has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the incidence of corticosteroid-induced side effects may be increased in geriatric patients and are dose-related. Osteoporosis is the most frequently encountered complication, which occurs at a higher incidence rate in corticosteroid-treated geriatric patients as compared to younger populations and in age-matched controls. Losses of bone mineral density appear to be greatest early on in the course of treatment and may recover over time after steroid withdrawal or use of lower doses (i.e., ≤ 5 mg/day). Prednisone doses of 7.5 mg/day or higher have been associated with an increased relative risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, even in the presence of higher bone density compared to patients with involution osteoporosis. Routine screening of geriatric patients, including regular assessments of bone mineral density and institution of fracture prevention strategies, along with regular review of prednisone indication should be undertaken to minimize complications and keep the prednisolone dose at the lowest acceptable level. Co-administration of certain bisphosphonates have been shown to retard the rate of bone loss in corticosteroid-treated males and postmenopausal females, and these agents are recommended in the prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

It has been reported that equivalent weight-based doses yield higher total and unbound prednisolone plasma concentrations and reduced renal and non-renal clearance in elderly patients compared to younger populations. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Should you recommend inhaled corticosteroids for this patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^6507defa]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 12 million adults in the United States receive a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) each year, and it is the fourth leading cause of death. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease refers to a group of diseases that cause airflow obstruction and a constellation of symptoms, including cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoke, but other environmental exposures also may contribute. The GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 2020 Report aims to provide a nonbiased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with COPD. To date, no conclusive evidence exists that any existing medications for COPD modify mortality. The mainstay of treatment for COPD is inhaled bronchodilators, whereas the role of inhaled corticosteroids is less clear. Inhaled corticosteroids have substantial risks, including an increased risk for pneumonia. Here, 2 experts, both pulmonologists, reflect on the care of a woman with severe COPD, a 50-pack-year smoking history, frequent COPD exacerbations, and recurrent pneumonia. They consider the indications for inhaled corticosteroids in COPD, when inhaled corticosteroids should be withdrawn, and what other treatments are available.

### Effect of prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone therapy in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^fb3ac23a]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

We report on a 74-year-old man with an acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was successfully treated with prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone, initiated at a loading dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by 2 mg/kg per day for 14 days. The dose was then tapered. The exacerbation observed on the chest radiograph and high-resolution computed tomography was found to have abated after the treatment. This successful case suggests the feasibility of this methylprednisolone treatment protocol for patients with IPF accompanied by accelerated deterioration. Furthermore, this case suggests possible similarities between acute exacerbation of IPF and late acute respiratory distress syndrome, as the same treatment protocol was previously proved to be beneficial for patients with late acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Results

Description of corticosteroid users

Among 1 548 945 adults in the study cohort, 327 452 (21.1%) received at least one outpatient prescription for short term oral corticosteroids during the three year study period. The mean age for users was 45.5 (SD 11.6) years compared with 44.1 (SD 12.2) years for non-users (P < 0.001). Among the 327 452 corticosteroid users, the median number of days of use was 6 (interquartile range 6–12 days) with 47.4% (n = 155 171 of 327 452) receiving treatment for seven or more days. Overall, the median prednisone equivalent daily dose was 20 mg/day (interquartile range 17.5–36.8 mg/day) with 23.4% (n = 76 701 of 327 452) receiving ≥ 40 mg/day. The most common prescription written for oral corticosteroids was a six day methylprednisolone "dosepak", which accounted for 46.9% (n = 216 437 of 461 208) of prescriptions during the study period. Among corticosteroid users, 70.5% (n = 230 980 of 327 452) received one course of treatment, 20.7% (n = 67 732 of 327 452) received two courses, and 8.8% (n = 28 740 of 327 452) received three or more courses. For those patients with two or more prescriptions, the average prescription count was 2.4 (SD 0.7).

The initial dosage of MEDROL Tablets may vary from 4 mg to 48 mg of methylprednisolone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, MEDROL should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.

It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of MEDROL for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective.

Immunoglobulin A nephropathy — systemic glucocorticoids considerations for implementation: Healthcare providers should provide an individualized assessment of patient risk of progression and risk of treatment-emergent toxicity with systemic glucocorticoids, and Healthcare providers may choose not to consider systemic glucocorticoids as a treatment option in patients having particular clinical characteristics placing them at higher risk of treatment-emergent toxicity, especially if there are other options readily available and accessible. Healthcare providers should consider that, similar to Nefecon, there was an increase in proteinuria and a decline in eGFR after methylprednisolone was stopped in the TESTING study, and the increase in proteinuria and decline in eGFR observed after cessation of methylprednisolone suggest that IgAN, like most other immune-mediated glomerular diseases, may likely need longer-term immunomodulation. Repeated courses of systemic glucocorticoids, even at the reduced dose used in TESTING, will put patients at risk of long-term complications from systemic steroid exposure, such as bone disease and metabolic syndrome, in addition to the acute metabolic, cosmetic, and neuropsychiatric side effects.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience with prednisolone has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the incidence of corticosteroid-induced side effects may be increased in geriatric patients and appear to be dose-related. Osteoporosis is the most frequently encountered complication, which occurs at a higher incidence rate in corticosteroid-treated geriatric patients as compared to younger populations and in age-matched controls. Losses of bone mineral density appear to be greatest early on in the course of treatment and may recover over time after steroid withdrawal or use of lower doses (i.e., ≤ 5 mg/day). Prednisolone doses of 7.5 mg/day or higher, have been associated with an increased relative risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, even in the presence of higher bone density compared to patients with involutional osteoporosis.

Routine screening of geriatric patients, including regular assessments of bone mineral density and institution of fracture prevention strategies, along with regular review of Orapred indication should be undertaken to minimize complications and keep the Orapred dose at the lowest acceptable level. Co-administration of bisphosphonates has been shown to retard the rate of bone loss in corticosteroid-treated males and postmenopausal females, and these agents are recommended in the prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

It has been reported that equivalent weight-based doses yield higher total and unbound prednisolone plasma concentrations and reduced renal and non-renal clearance in elderly patients compared to younger populations. However, it is not clear whether dosing reductions would be necessary in elderly patients, since these pharmacokinetic alterations may be offset by age-related differences in responsiveness of target organs and/or less pronounced suppression of adrenal release of cortisol. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

### Management of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis [^3e1bde96]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment with corticosteroids can adversely affect bone metabolism. In particular, it lowers bone mineral density (BMD) and increases the likelihood of fragility fractures, the hallmarks of osteoporosis, hence the term 'corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis'. Since corticosteroids are used for a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis represents a substantial disease burden. Here we aim to provide advice on prophylaxis and treatment for osteoporosis in adults receiving corticosteroid therapy.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^5aee4b0a]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Statement 100. We recommend that patients starting corticosteroids should be assessed for risk of osteoporosis. Those at high risk should be started on bisphosphonate therapy at the onset of corticosteroid therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), after ensuring adequate calcium intake and supplementing vitamin D (Agreement: 90.7%).

Reduction in bone mineral density and fracture risk are worsened by oral corticosteroid use, and the greatest bone loss occurs in the first 6 months of treatment. Before starting oral steroids, patients should have their fracture risk assessed as shown in figure 5. For patients aged over 40, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) can be used to assess the 10 year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with a high FRAX score (score ≥ 20% major fracture and ≥ 3% hip fracture), those aged under 40 with risk factors or those receiving prolonged (more than 3 months) or repeated courses of oral corticosteroids should have their bone mineral density assessed by bone densitometry. Note that FRAX does not discriminate past versus current corticosteroid use, nor does it stratify risk according to doses beyond 7.5 mg, and risk should be adjusted accordingly. Patients on long-term steroids should have a repeat bone densitometry at 1 year, and if stable, repeated at 2–3-year intervals, but if declining, repeated annually. Women and men aged 70 or more, with past fragility fracture, taking high-dose steroids (7.5 mg or more prednisolone-equivalent), or at high risk based on FRAX score, should be considered for bone-protective therapy at the start of steroid treatment. Alendronate or risedronate should be used, unless contra-indicated or not tolerated, in which case intravenous zoledronate or teriparatide should be given. For women of childbearing age requiring bone-protective therapy, if they are taking effective contraception (or not sexually active), oral bisphosphonates are the first-line therapy followed by teriparatide if oral bisphosphonates cannot be used. Denusomab and high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates should not be used in this situation due to lack of data on the risk of fetal harm should an unplanned pregnancy occur. There is a lack of safety data on use of denosumab with immunosuppressive therapy, and on all osteoporosis therapies during pregnancy, other than calcium and vitamin D.

Systemic glucocorticoids are an essential therapy for a range of conditions, but their multiple side effects can produce significant morbidity for patients. The objective of this review is to discuss these side effects while addressing 3 questions: 1) What dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy should prompt concern for individual side effects?; 2) How should clinicians counsel patients about these complications?; and 3) How can these problems be prevented or managed? To accomplish these objectives, we have created a series of tables and algorithms based on a review of relevant data to guide counseling, prophylaxis, and management of 11 glucocorticoid side effects. The first article in this 4-part continuing medical education series begins with a review of glucocorticoid pharmacology followed by a discussion of bone health (ie, osteoporosis and osteonecrosis).

Key messages

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is the most common cause of secondary osteoporosis, the most common cause before 50 years of age, and the most common iatrogenic cause of the disease.
Previous and current exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) increases the risk of fracture and bone loss.
The increase in fracture risk is not fully assessed by bone mineral density measurements, as it is also related to alteration in bone quality and increased risk of falls.
Prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should be considered in all patients who receive GCs.
Recent international guidelines are available and should guide management of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, which remains under-diagnosed and under-treated.

Caplacizumab was used in all patients. Days from admission to initiation of caplacizumab was a median 2 days (range, 0–12). Thirteen patients weighing ≥ 40 kg were dosed 10 mg once daily of caplacizumab. Three patients weighing < 40 kg were dosed 5 mg once daily (Table 3). There were no adverse events recorded in this group.

Table 3.
Characteristics of patients dosed with caplacizumab 5 mg once daily

The duration of caplacizumab treatment was 31 days (range, 15–74). Caplacizumab was discontinued when ADAMTS13 activity level was measured at > 20 IU/dL or 30 days after finishing daily PEX therapy.

All of the patients received steroids and anti-CD20 treatment. The initial steroid used was methylprednisolone 1 gm once daily (n = 9), 500 mg (n = 2), or prednisolone 1 mg/kg (n = 5). Prednisolone 1 gm/kg was used in the 2 children aged < 4 years, and under 40 kg in weight. Anti-CD20 treatment, rituximab or biosimilar, was administered at a dose of 375 mg/m², median 4 doses (range, 4–8).

Prophylactic anticoagulation in the form of low molecular weight heparin was used in 7 patients (9 patients not used) according to local guidelines.

Aspirin was used in 1 patient for 10 days. This 14-year-old patient was also reported to have a hematoma at the Vascath insertion site, diagnosed on ultrasound, and possible renal bleeding.

Adverse effects

Bleeding events were identified in 4 patients: 2 were minor, with a petechial rash and minor epistaxis, and 2 were moderate, with 1 developing a hematoma at the Vascath site and possible renal bleeding (in the patient on aspirin). The other patient was a 17-year-old and 7-month-old male, with moderate bleeding and prolonged epistaxis requiring nasal packing and cautery, with VWF replacement given in the form of 1 dose of 1000 units of Wilate (18.9 units/kg body weight). Thereafter, his caplacizumab dose was altered to 5 mg on alternate days. There were no bleeding events recorded in the 13 other patients.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

### ACG clinical guideline update: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^96149a23]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Corticosteroid use — fracture risk, dose thresholds, and timing: Different studies report that 30%–50% of patients receiving corticosteroids develop fractures, and long-term therapy is associated with a 30%–50% increase in fracture risk. Low doses are implicated, as doses equivalent to prednisone 3–10 mg a day are associated with escalated fracture risk, with dose–response thresholds where doses of prednisone over 7.5 mg a day confer a fivefold higher risk of spine and hip fractures and doses as low as 2.5 mg a day are associated with a 1.55-fold risk of spinal fractures. Temporal dynamics include early harm noted to occur 3–6 months after initiation and improvement after cessation, decreased in frequency as early as 3 months after discontinuation with risk that returns to baseline within 1–2 years. Recent exposure parameters show that corticosteroid use within the past 12 months with treatment duration longer than 90 days was associated with decreased femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) and increased major fractures (5.4% vs 7.7%, RR, 1.25, 95% CI 1.07–1.45; P = 0.004) and hip fractures (1.1% vs 1.8% RR, 1.61, 95% CI 1.18–2.20; P = 0.003) independent of BMD values.

Case Presentation

A 73-year-old man with fever and fatigue presented to his doctor. He had a history of smoking (52 pack-years) and COPD on home oxygen therapy. The patient had no significant family medical history, illicit drug-use history, or recent alcohol use. Chest CT scan showed a slight infiltrative shadow of the left lower lobe on a background of emphysema. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered for community-acquired pneumonia without any clinical or radiologic improvement after 2 weeks of therapy. Additional tests showed rapid deterioration of renal function (creatinine level, which was 0.68 mg/dL 2 years earlier, had worsened to 2.08 mg/dL), BUN level of 49.8 mg/dL (reference range, 8- to 20 mg/dL), myeloperoxidase-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies 484.0 units/mL (range, 0.0 to 3.4 units/mL), C-reactive protein level of 11.1 mg/dL (range, 0.0 to 0.14 mg/dL), hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL (range, 13.7 to 16.8 g/dL), and urinalysis protein 1+ and occult blood 3+. On physical examination, multiple lesions of purpura were observed on the body surface, and hemoptysis was present. No sputum, urine, or blood cultures were done. Based on the examination, the previous doctors suspected microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) rather than an atypical/resistant infectious disease. The patient was treated with high-dose methylprednisolone (500 mg for 2 days and 125 mg for 13 days), but hemoptysis reappeared, and the patient was subsequently transported to our hospital.

Treatment

Information on treatment was available for 23 of the 25 patients. We could not locate treatment records in two cases. The most common drugs used were oral prednisone (100%), methotrexate (74%), intravenous methylprednisolone (39%) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 39%). Prednisone alone was used in five patients, prednisone and methotrexate without another agent in nine patients and various other drugs were added as second line drugs to the main treatment modality (prednisone and methotrexate) in poor responders as summarized in Fig. 3 below. All the patients received corticosteroids during the course of their treatment. Biologics were used in 6 patients (rituximab in 5 and infliximab in 1). Oral steroids were given at a dose of 2 mg/kg, though there was no uniformity on when to start to taper the dose and over what duration of time. The patient who received infliximab had defaulted from follow up after one dose and was yet to return for evaluation and further doses by the time of completing data collection and analysis.

An intramuscular option has been studied: In one randomized controlled trial, 120 mg methylprednisolone intramuscular (i.m.) injection was used every 3 weeks as a starting dose. As an adjunct, Methotrexate (MTX) has been used at doses of 7.5–10 mg/week in clinical trials, and the algorithm advises, Consider MTX if at high risk for side effects/ relapse and/or prolonged therapy. Following improvement, the algorithm specifies Gradual tapering of glucocorticoids and ultimately to Taper prednisone until discontinuation. Baseline factors associated with higher risk of relapse/prolonged therapy include high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour) and peripheral inflammatory arthritis.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^5db0774c]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — definitions and dose thresholds — are specified as follows: physiologic daily dose equivalent is defined as daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production with 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, and 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone, and endogenous cortisol production is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration, while long-term glucocorticoid therapy is glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Exposure thresholds considered to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency include duration of glucocorticoid therapy 3–4 weeks, or greater, and any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalence of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably, and doses vary by agent and are defined as physiologic within lower and upper ranges to reflect inter-individual differences.

Adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy include higher event rates in exposed rheumatoid arthritis cohorts and risks even at low doses; a British cohort study involving 9387 patients with rheumatoid arthritis observed over a median of 8 years with an average prednisolone dose of 5.8 mg/day for approximately 9.5 months exhibited elevated rates of diabetes, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension, thrombotic events, gastrointestinal complications, and increased mortality compared to those not treated with glucocorticoids, and studies have linked even low dose use (prednisone 2.5–7.5 mg/day) to increased risks.

### The cumulative burden of oral corticosteroid side effects and the economic implications of steroid use [^868c40f0]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Oral corticosteroids (OCS) are a key part of therapy regimens for a diverse variety of conditions. Despite their efficacy, they are associated with a wide variety of adverse events. The purpose of this review was to identify the range of adverse events that have been reported to be related to oral corticosteroids, examine the factors that influence their incidence and estimate the economic burden caused by these adverse events. In 61 identified studies, 21 different categories of OCS related adverse events were reported with increased fracture risk being the category most frequently described. Most studies that examined factors linked to the incidence of OCS related adverse events found that dose, age, gender, duration of use, treatment history, smoking habits or cholesterol level were influential in determining risk. Additionally, a cumulative economic analysis of selected adverse events found the annual cost of treating these events in the UK to be at least 165 pounds per patient taking OCS. The clinical and economic burden of OCS related adverse events highlights the need for OCS sparing therapies to be developed.

### Prednisone (predniSONE tablets, USP, 20 mg) [^eec34213]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

### Clinical question: what is the best approach to managing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis? [^25ecae18]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is common, and the resulting fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. Rapid bone loss and increased fracture risk occur soon after the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and are dose dependent. The increase in fracture risk is partly independent of bone mineral density, probably as a result of changes in bone material properties and increased risk of falling. Fracture risk can be assessed using the FRAX algorithm, although risk may be underestimated in patients taking higher doses of glucocorticoids. Because of the rapidity of bone loss and increase in fracture risk after the start of glucocorticoid therapy, primary prevention should be advised in high-risk individuals, for example older women and men, individuals with a previous fracture history and those with low bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates are the front-line choice for the prevention of fracture in the majority of glucocorticoid-treated patients, with teriparatide as a second-line option. Calcium and vitamin D supplements should be co-prescribed unless there is evidence of an adequate dietary calcium intake and vitamin D status.

### Corticosteroid injections and risk of fracture [^c8de001f]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

A key strategy in management of musculoskeletal pain, especially in elderly patients, involves joint and bursae corticosteroid injections (CSIs). Typically, a water-insoluble crystalline corticosteroid is used to prolong presence within the injected site and to limit absorption. However, some systemic absorption of injected corticosteroids occurs, potentially placing patients at risk for adverse effects of corticosteroids. Unlike oral corticosteroids, the extent and clinical significance of the systemic effects of CSIs are largely unknown, and there is no established dose or frequency threshold for safety of CSIs. Specific dose information has been difficult to determine because a patient may receive CSIs in multiple clinical settings (eg, primary care, orthopedics, rheumatology, radiology, sports medicine), and there is no prescription associated with the medication.

Osteoporosis affects approximately 10 million Americans, and 1 in 2 women and 1 in 5 men older than 50 years will have an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. In the case of oral corticosteroids, large retrospective cohort studies and meta-analyses have established that dosages greater than 7.5 mg/d may be associated with increased fracture risk, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether bone density in inflammatory rheumatic diseases is affected at even lower oral doses. Van Staa et alshowed that increased fracture risk began within 3 months of commencing oral corticosteroid therapy and was related to higher daily and cumulative dose. Patients taking a long-term dosage of prednisolone of at least 7.5 mg/d were significantly more likely to sustain a fracture compared with those receiving a low daily dosage (< 2.5 mg/d). In a meta-analysis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lower dosage use (≤ 7.5 mg/d) was associated with few adverse events. Studies assessing fracture risk associated with epidural CSIs to treat low back pain have been conflicting, with 1 large retrospective study showing an associationand other smaller studies showing none.

To better understand the fracture risk associated with CSIs, we conducted a cohort study of patients receiving any CSI in all possible clinical settings over a 4-year span beginning in 2018. Our primary outcome was risk of fracture by total number of injected triamcinolone equivalents received. Secondary outcomes were risks of fracture by total triamcinolone equivalents in subgroups of patients not at high risk for fracture and in patients with osteoporosis. We hypothesized that higher fracture risk would be associated with increasing cumulative injected triamcinolone equivalent doses.

### Bisphosphonates for steroid-induced osteoporosis [^b2df5a89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1999. Corticosteroids are widely used in inflammatory conditions as an immunosuppressive agent. Bone loss is a serious side effect of this therapy. Several studies have examined the use of bisphosphonates in the prevention and treatment of glucocorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and have reported varying magnitudes of effect.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of GIOP in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase up to April 2016 and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) via OVID up to January 2012 for relevant articles and conference proceedings with no language restrictions. We searched two clinical trial registries for ongoing and recently completed studies (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal). We also reviewed reference lists of relevant review articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) satisfying the following criteria: 1) prevention or treatment of GIOP; 2) adults taking a mean steroid dose of 5.0 mg/day or more; 3) active treatment including bisphosphonates of any type alone or in combination with calcium or vitamin D; 4) comparator treatment including a control of calcium or vitamin D, or both, alone or with placebo; and 4) reporting relevant outcomes. We excluded trials that included people with transplant-associated steroid use.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, performed 'risk of bias' assessment and evaluated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Major outcomes of interest were the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures after 12 to 24 months; the change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck after 12 months; serious adverse events; withdrawals due to adverse events; and quality of life. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included a total of 27 RCTs with 3075 participants in the review. Pooled analysis for incident vertebral fractures included 12 trials (1343 participants) with high-certainty evidence and low risk of bias. In this analysis 46/597 (or 77 per 1000) people experienced new vertebral fractures in the control group compared with 31/746 (or 44 per 1000; range 27 to 70) in the bisphosphonate group; relative improvement of 43% (9% to 65% better) with bisphosphonates; absolute increased benefit of 2% fewer people sustaining fractures with bisphosphonates (5% fewer to 1% more); number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 31 (20 to 145) meaning that approximately 31 people would need to be treated with bisphosphonates to prevent new vertebral fractures in one person. Pooled analysis for incident nonvertebral fractures included nine trials with 1245 participants with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and serious risk of bias as a patient-reported outcome). In this analysis 30/546 (or 55 per 1000) people experienced new nonvertebral fracture in the control group compared with 29/699 (or 42 per 1000; range 25 to 69) in the bisphosphonate group; relative improvement of 21% with bisphosphonates (33% worse to 53% better); absolute increased benefit of 1% fewer people with fractures with bisphosphonates (4% fewer to 1% more). Pooled analysis on BMD change at the lumbar spine after 12 months included 23 trials with 2042 patients. Eighteen trials with 1665 participants were included in the pooled analysis on BMD at the femoral neck after 12 months. Evidence for both outcomes was moderate-certainty (downgraded for indirectness as a surrogate marker for osteoporosis) with low risk of bias. Overall, the bisphosphonate groups reported stabilisation or increase in BMD, while the control groups showed decreased BMD over the study period. At the lumbar spine, there was an absolute increase in BMD of 3.5% with bisphosphonates (2.90% to 4.10% higher) with a relative improvement of 1.10% with bisphosphonates (0.91% to 1.29%); NNTB 3 (2 to 3). At the femoral neck, the absolute difference in BMD was 2.06% higher in the bisphosphonate group compared to the control group (1.45% to 2.68% higher) with a relative improvement of 1.29% (0.91% to 1.69%); NNTB 5 (4 to 7). Pooled analysis on serious adverse events included 15 trials (1703 participants) with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). In this analysis 131/811 (or 162 per 1000) people experienced serious adverse events in the control group compared to 136/892 (or 147 per 1000; range 120 to 181) in the bisphosphonate group; absolute increased harm of 0% more serious adverse events (2% fewer to 2% more); a relative per cent change with 9% improvement (12% worse to 26% better). Pooled analysis for withdrawals due to adverse events included 15 trials (1790 patients) with low-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). In this analysis 63/866 (or 73 per 1000) people withdrew in the control group compared to 76/924 (or 77 per 1000; range 56 to 107) in the bisphosphonate group; an absolute increased harm of 1% more withdrawals with bisphosphonates (95% CI 1% fewer to 3% more); a relative per cent change 6% worse (95% CI 47% worse to 23% better). Quality of life was not assessed in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

There was high-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in reducing the risk of vertebral fractures with data extending to 24 months of use. There was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in preventing nonvertebral fractures. There was moderate-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates are beneficial in preventing and treating corticosteroid-induced bone loss at both the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Regarding harm, there was low-certainty evidence that bisphosphonates may make little or no difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. We are cautious in interpreting these data as markers for harm and tolerability due to the potential for bias. Overall, our review supports the use of bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and the prevention and treatment of steroid-induced bone loss.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (Pediapred) [^51dde180]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of PEDIAPRED®did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience with prednisolone sodium phosphate has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the incidence of corticosteroid-induced side effects may be increased in geriatric patients and appear to be dose-related. Osteoporosis is the most frequently encountered complication, which occurs at a higher incidence rate in corticosteroid-treated geriatric patients as compared to younger populations and in age-matched controls. Losses of bone mineral density appear to be greatest early on in the course of treatment and may recover over time after steroid withdrawal or use of lower doses (i.e., ≤ 5 mg/day). Prednisolone doses of 7.5 mg/day or higher have been associated with an increased relative risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, even in the presence of higher bone density compared to patients with involutional osteoporosis.

Routine screening of geriatric patients, including regular assessments of bone mineral density and institution of fracture prevention strategies, along with regular review of prednisolone indication should be undertaken to minimize complications and keep the prednisolone dose at the lowest acceptable level. Co-administration of bisphosphonates has been shown to retard the rate of bone loss in corticosteroid-treated males and postmenopausal females, and these agents are recommended in the prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

It has been reported that equivalent weight-based doses yield higher total and unbound prednisolone plasma concentrations and reduced renal and non-renal clearance in elderly patients compared to younger populations. However, it is not clear whether dosing reductions would be necessary in elderly patients, since these pharmacokinetic alterations may be offset by age-related differences in responsiveness of target organs and/or less pronounced suppression of adrenal release of cortisol. Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitantt disease or other drug therapy.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to management of treatment failure, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to consider switching to another class of osteoporosis medication in adult patients continuing corticosteroid treatment and having a history of an osteoporotic fracture ≥ 12 months after initiating osteoporosis therapy or having a significant loss of bone mineral density (greater than the least significant change per DEXA) after 1–2 years of osteoporosis therapy.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

Table 8 — minor stress during illness or outpatient antibiotics in patients at risk of or with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency states that if the patient is already taking hydrocortisone ≥ 40 mg daily, prednisone ≥ 10 mg daily, or dexamethasone ≥ 1 mg daily, there is typically no need to increase the dose unless there are signs of hemodynamic instability, and otherwise suggests for those not on daily glucocorticoids to give hydrocortisone 40 mg total daily dose in three divided doses (eg, 20 mg on rising, 10 mg 12 midday, 10 mg 5pm) and to continue for 2–5 days until well (or for the duration of antibiotic treatment), with adjustments for current therapy such that if on hydrocortisone < 40 mg total daily dose increase to 40 mg total daily dose with the same schedule and if on prednisone < 10 mg total daily dose increase to 10 mg total daily dose in one or two divided doses and continue for 2–5 days until well.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^baacdf99]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Lupus nephritis induction corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide route: Intravenous methylprednisolone ("pulse steroids") is often given initially in a dose of 500–1,000 mg/d for 3 days or 7 mg/kg/d for 3 days (though the dosing is not evidence based), followed by a tapering course of oral steroids. Monitoring for neutropenia is needed less frequently with intravenous cyclophosphamide (monthly) as compared with oral cyclophosphamide (weekly), and bladder protection is facilitated with intravenous cyclophosphamide by coadministration with mesna. We therefore suggest that when cyclophosphamide is prescribed, intravenous dosing using the NIH or Euro-Lupus regimen is preferable over oral dosing unless there is a compelling indication for the latter.

### Acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a case series [^59016d47]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

An acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an acute deterioration that can occur at any time and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. We herein report three patients with ILD who experienced acute respiratory failure after SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccination. All the patients were male; the mean age was 77 years. They had a smoking history that ranged from 10 to 30 pack-years. Duration from the vaccination to the onset of respiratory failure was 1 day in two patients and 9 days in one patient. In an autopsied case, lung pathologic evidence indicated diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on usual interstitial pneumonia. In the other two cases, CT scans showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and subpleural reticulation, which suggests acute exacerbation of ILD. Two patients were treated successfully with high-dose methylprednisolone. Although benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks associated with uncommon adverse events, patients with chronic lung diseases should be observed carefully after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
