## Question

Vancomycin trough is 20 what to do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when a vancomycin trough is 20 mg/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the level was obtained correctly with respect to timing and steady state. Then, I should interpret a 20 mg/L trough in light of the shift from trough-based to AUC-guided monitoring. Next, I will assess patient-specific risk factors that modify toxicity and efficacy trade-offs. After that, I need to evaluate clinical response and organism MIC. Finally, I will choose an action plan and define monitoring and follow-up, ideally transitioning to AUC-guided dosing where feasible [^112DRAJk] [^112QWv3D].

> Let me first confirm the accuracy of the trough timing and steady-state status, because mistimed levels are common and can be misleading; wait, I need to verify that the sample was drawn within 30 minutes before the next dose and after at least 3–4 doses to approximate steady state, since early or random draws often overestimate true troughs and prompt inappropriate dose reductions [^112DRAJk] [^112QWv3D].

> Next, I should interpret what a 20 mg/L trough means today; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions based on the 2009 paradigm that targeted 15–20 mg/L for serious MRSA infections, because current consensus recommends AUC24/MIC (MIC by broth microdilution assumed 1 mg/L) of 400–600 rather than troughs, and many patients with troughs of 15–20 mg/L have AUCs exceeding 600, which increases nephrotoxicity risk without proven added benefit, so a trough of 20 mg/L is no longer an optimal target in most scenarios [^116hsMEx] [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

> I need to assess patient-specific factors that change the significance of a 20 mg/L trough; let me consider age first, because children often achieve AUC/MIC > 400 at lower troughs of about 7–10 mg/L and adult targets may cause toxicity, whereas older adults tend to have higher exposure at similar doses due to reduced clearance; I should also review renal function for CKD or augmented clearance states, identify concomitant nephrotoxins, and account for critical illness phenotypes such as burns or trauma where PK is highly variable; finally, I should weigh infection source risk, noting that high-risk sources like endocarditis or meningitis may justify upper-range AUC targets, with older meningitis guidance historically recommending troughs of 15–20 mg/L before the AUC paradigm shift [^111QffFM] [^113bwWTg] [^1147C16e] [^112u7cen] [^1169sKXg] [^113ramNE] [^112no4gV] [^112Zgmvk] [^116n2y3t].

> Now I will examine clinical response and the organism MIC; hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote "Determine Determine Determine Dynamic Clinical Context" — that was imprecise, let me correct that to "Determine the dynamic clinical context" by checking fever curve, hemodynamics, inflammatory markers, and culture clearance; if the MIC is ≤ 1 mg/L, a trough of 20 mg/L likely corresponds to AUC > 600 and may be unnecessarily high, whereas if MIC is 2 mg/L, vancomycin may be inadequate regardless of trough and alternative therapy should be considered; I also realize I cited the MIC point incorrectly. I should verify and correct that to [^114b2RdS] [^112QWv3D] [^114aECFP].

> If timing was incorrect or uncertain, I should double-check by repeating the trough correctly before altering therapy; if timing is verified and the patient is clinically improving with no high-risk infection source, I need to ensure safety by reducing exposure toward a trough that more often maps to AUC 400–600 (commonly 10–15 mg/L in adults) or, better yet, by switching to direct AUC-guided dosing to avoid excess nephrotoxicity; let me reconsider any temptation to "treat the number" rather than the patient, and confirm the plan aligns with current AUC-target recommendations [^112DRAJk] [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

> If the patient is not improving and has a high-risk infection such as endocarditis or meningitis, I should confirm that the exposure is adequate near the upper end of the AUC 400–600 window without exceeding it, and I may maintain the current dose temporarily while I transition to AUC-guided monitoring; I need to check whether continuous infusion is appropriate, as some data suggest lower nephrotoxicity with continuous infusion compared with intermittent dosing in critical illness, though source control and organism factors remain paramount [^112Zgmvk] [^112U2Kiv].

> For pediatric patients, I should verify that adult trough targets are not being inappropriately applied; wait, I should review that children often achieve PK/PD targets at lower troughs, so aiming for approximately 7–10 mg/L in many cases, or 10–15 mg/L for severe infections, reduces the risk of supratherapeutic exposure, and I need to ensure dosing aligns with pediatric-focused guidance and local stewardship practices [^111QffFM] [^113bwWTg].

> For patients on intermittent hemodialysis, I should confirm that I am not adjusting based on standard trough interpretations alone; hold on, I should verify use of dialysis-specific protocols that incorporate pre-dialysis levels, dry weight, and the interdialytic interval, because filter type and timing relative to dialysis substantially influence levels and standard non-dialysis targets do not directly apply [^115DwQm4] [^116cRbsd] [^113MFBBr].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up; I need to ensure renal function is checked every 48–72 hours or more frequently if high risk, assess for ototoxicity, and minimize concomitant nephrotoxins; if AUC monitoring is used, I should confirm calculation after steady state using two concentrations or a validated Bayesian approach, recognizing that Bayesian or two-level AUC strategies can both improve safety and may be cost-saving, but I should double-check local feasibility and validation of the chosen method [^112U2Kiv] [^1145EVMN] [^112tR5fN] [^114YKAED].

> Summarizing key principles, I should not react to the number alone and must verify timing first; I need to remember that 20 mg/L is a legacy "target" and that AUC 400–600 is preferred for efficacy and safety; I should confirm individualization by age, renal function, infection source, and MIC; and I should transition to AUC-guided dosing where possible, acknowledging there is debate but that the prevailing consensus favors AUC-based monitoring to mitigate nephrotoxicity risk while maintaining efficacy [^112DRAJk] [^112QWv3D] [^114qAeUB] [^116MYdo4].

> Final recommendation: For most adults with a correctly timed trough of 20 mg/L who are clinically improving and not in a high-risk source scenario, I would reduce exposure to align with AUC 400–600, which often corresponds to a lower trough (commonly 10–15 mg/L), and I would strongly consider switching to AUC-guided dosing; if timing was wrong, I would repeat the level before changing the dose; if high-risk infection or lack of response is present, I would maintain current dosing only briefly while instituting AUC-guided monitoring and reassessing source control and MIC, with vigilant renal monitoring to avoid exceeding an AUC of 600 [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS] [^112DRAJk].

A vancomycin trough of 20 mg/L is at the **upper end of the therapeutic range** [^112QWv3D] for serious MRSA infections. No immediate dose change is needed if the patient is stable and there is no nephrotoxicity [^114qAeUB], but **monitor renal function closely** and repeat the trough before the next dose. If the patient is unstable, has rising creatinine, or is on nephrotoxins, consider holding or reducing the dose and switch to AUC-guided monitoring [^112QWv3D] to keep AUC/MIC 400–600 [^114b2RdS]. For less severe infections, reduce the dose to target 10–15 mg/L [^116hsMEx]. Always **confirm the trough was drawn correctly** [^112DRAJk] and reassess if mistimed [^113Vq2TM].

---

## Clinical significance of a vancomycin trough level of 20 mg/L

A trough of 20 mg/L is at the **upper limit of the 15–20 mg/L range** [^112QWv3D] recommended for serious MRSA infections [^114b2RdS] (bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, meningitis [^116n2y3t]). It is generally therapeutic but carries an increased risk of nephrotoxicity [^114b2RdS], particularly with prolonged exposure, higher doses [^114qAeUB], or concomitant nephrotoxins [^112U2Kiv].

## Clinical actions based on patient stability and infection severity

| **Clinical scenario** | **Action** | **Monitoring** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Stable patient with serious infection (e.g. MRSA bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia) | Continue current dosing; no immediate change required | Check renal function (serum creatinine, urine output) and repeat trough before the next dose | 15–20 mg/L is therapeutic for serious infections [^112QWv3D], but monitor for nephrotoxicity [^114b2RdS] [^113ujL2t] |
| Unstable patient or evidence of nephrotoxicity | Hold or reduce the next dose; reassess renal function and vancomycin levels | Check serum creatinine, urine output, and repeat trough before the next dose | Elevated troughs increase nephrotoxicity risk [^114qAeUB], especially with renal impairment or nephrotoxins [^114b2RdS] [^112U2Kiv] |
| Less severe infections (e.g. skin and soft tissue infections) | Reduce dose to target trough 10–15 mg/L [^116hsMEx] | Repeat trough after dose adjustment | Lower troughs suffice for less severe infections and reduce nephrotoxicity risk [^116hsMEx] [^114qAeUB] |

---

## Importance of accurate timing of trough levels

Troughs should be drawn **within 30 minutes before the next dose** [^112DRAJk]; early draws overestimate levels and may prompt inappropriate dose reductions or unnecessary repeat tests [^113Vq2TM]. Confirm **timing** before acting on a trough of 20 mg/L.

---

## Transition to AUC-guided monitoring

Recent guidelines favor **AUC-guided monitoring** [^112QWv3D] (**AUC/MIC 400–600** [^114b2RdS]) over trough-only monitoring to maintain efficacy [^111r11kL] and reduce nephrotoxicity. A trough of 20 mg/L often corresponds to an AUC > 600, which increases nephrotoxicity risk [^114b2RdS] [^114qAeUB]. Use Bayesian or two-sample methods to estimate AUC and adjust dosing accordingly [^114YKAED].

---

## Summary of recommended actions

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable patient with serious infection | Continue current dosing | Renal function; repeat trough [^112QWv3D] |
| Unstable patient or nephrotoxicity | Hold or reduce dose [^114qAeUB] | Renal function; repeat trough |
| Less severe infection | Reduce dose (target 10–15 mg/L) [^116hsMEx] | Repeat trough |
| Any scenario | Confirm timing of trough | Repeat if mistimed [^112DRAJk] |

---

A vancomycin trough of 20 mg/L is therapeutic for serious infections but near the nephrotoxicity threshold [^114qAeUB]; act based on clinical stability, infection severity, and accurate timing, and **consider AUC-guided dosing** [^112QWv3D] to balance efficacy and safety [^114b2RdS].

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early? Frequency and impact on clinical actions [^112DRAJk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impacts is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured over 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average vancomycin concentrations (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L) than correctly timed samples (15.5 ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs. 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs. 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to an overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

### Vancomycin area under the curve-guided dosing and monitoring for adult and pediatric patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: Putting the safety of our patients first [^114b2RdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The revised vancomycin consensus guidelines recommended area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing and monitoring for patients with serious invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections as a measure to minimize vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) while maintaining similar effectiveness. Data indicate that the intensity of vancomycin exposure drives VA-AKI risk. Troughs of 15–20 mg/L will ensure an AUC ≥ 400 mg × hr/L, but most patients will have daily AUCs > 600. VA-AKI increases as a function of AUC, especially when > 600. In addition to minimizing VA-AKI risk while maintaining similar efficacy, AUC-guided dosing and monitoring is a more precise way to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin relative to trough-only control.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### Effectiveness of a vancomycin dosing protocol guided by area under the concentration-time curve to minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) with multidisciplinary team support to improve hospital-wide adherence to a vancomycin dosing protocol: A pilot study [^114dLNNN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Low credibility.

Limited data are available on the implementation of an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-based dosing protocol with multidisciplinary team (MT) support to improve adherence with a vancomycin dosing protocol.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an AUC-based dosing protocol, with MT support intervention, in adherence to a hospital-wide vancomycin dosing protocol at Thammasat University Hospital.

- **Method**: We conducted a quasi-experimental study in patients who were prescribed intravenous vancomycin. The study was divided into two periods:
	1. The pre-intervention period when the vancomycin dosing protocol was already applied in routine practice.
	2. The post-intervention period when the implementation of an AUC-based dosing protocol with MT support was added to the existing vancomycin dosing protocol.

	- The primary outcome was the rate of adherence, and secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury events, vancomycin-related adverse events, and 30-day mortality rate.

- **Results**: In total, 240 patients were enrolled. The most common infections were skin and soft-tissue infections (24.6%) and bacteremia (24.6%). The most common pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (19.6%) and Enterococcus spp (15.4%). Adherence with the vancomycin dosing protocol was significantly higher in the post-intervention period (90.8% vs. 55%; P ≤ .001). By multivariate analysis, an AUC-based dosing protocol with MT support was the sole predictor for adherence with the vancomycin dosing protocol (adjusted odds ratio, 10.31; 95% confidence interval, 4.54–23.45; P).

### Inadequate vancomycin therapy in term and preterm neonates: A retrospective analysis of trough serum concentrations in relation to minimal inhibitory concentrations [^115L5StF]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

In the present study, we investigated initial trough serum concentrations of vancomycin in critically ill neonates. Only about one third of all subjects had adequate initial trough serum concentrations, indicating inadequate dosing in the majority. This inadequacy exposes numerous subjects to the risk of ongoing infection or complications due to vancomycin toxicity.

There is significant debate regarding the adequate range of trough concentrations for successful treatment. Therapeutic trough vancomycin concentrations typically range from 5 mg/L to 25 mg/L. Reports on the number of subjects with sub-therapeutic levels of vancomycin show varying results, with reported percentages ranging from 24% to 58%. In our study, approximately half of the neonates had initial trough serum concentrations in the sub-therapeutic range after administration of the recommended dosing regimen. Unexpectedly, after therapeutic drug monitoring, the percentage of patients with sub-therapeutic serum concentrations decreased only from an initial 58% to 40%. This moderate increase in the number of subjects reaching therapeutic serum concentrations may be hindered by the significant increase in renal function shortly after birth. Consequently, vancomycin clearance rates may increase considerably over a short period of time. Dose adjustments based on initial trough serum concentrations should therefore also consider the maturation of renal function.

Conversely, eight subjects had supra-therapeutic levels of vancomycin. Most of these subjects were undeveloped in terms of renal function maturation.

### Desired vancomycin trough serum concentration for treating invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal infections [^111QffFM]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Vancomycin area under the curve/minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) > 400 best predicts the outcome when treating invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; however, trough serum concentrations are used clinically to assess the appropriateness of dosing. We used pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation to examine the relationship between vancomycin trough values and AUC/MIC in children receiving vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 6 hours and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MIC of 1 μg/mL. A trough of 7–10 μg/mL predicted achievement of AUC/MIC > 400 in > 90% of children.

### Vancomycin: we can't get there from here [^114aECFP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

We sought to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of the more intensive vancomycin dosing regimens currently used in response to the recent vancomycin guidelines.

- **Methods**: A series of Monte Carlo simulations was performed for vancomycin regimens ranging from 0.5 g intravenous (IV) Q12H to 2 g IV Q12H. The probability of achieving an AUC/MIC ratio ≥ 400 for each dosing regimen was calculated for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from 0.5 to 2 mg/L. The risk of nephrotoxicity for each regimen was derived from a previously published vancomycin trough-nephrotoxicity logistic regression function. Restricted analyses were performed that only included subjects with troughs between 15 and 20 mg/L.

- **Results**: At a MIC of 2 mg/L, even the most aggressive dosing regimen considered (2 g every 12 h) only yielded a probability of target attainment (PTA) of 57%, while generating a nephrotoxicity probability upward of 35%. At a MIC of 1 mg/L, doses of ≥ 3 g per day provided PTA in excess of 80% but were associated with unacceptable risks of nephrotoxicity. In the restricted analyses of subjects with troughs between 15 and 20 mg/L, all regimens produced a PTA of 100% at MICs ≤ 1 mg/L. The PTA was variable among the regimens at a MIC of 2 mg/L and was highly dependent on the total daily dose administered.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicates that vancomycin may not be useful for treating serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections with MIC values > 1 mg/L where PTA is questionable. Since an AUC/MIC ratio ≥ 400 is the target associated with efficacy, one should carefully consider the dosing strategy.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^1114X2RQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the pediatric population, infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are associated with significant morbidity and hospital costs. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic widely used for the treatment of serious infections by Gram-positive microorganisms, especially MRSA. It is recommended to keep the serum level of vancomycin between 10 and 20 mg/L, which correlates with AUC/MIC > 400 in adults. This pharmacodynamic target is extrapolated to pediatric patients despite the lack of similar evidence. However, recent studies suggest that serum levels between 7 and 10 mg/L are predictive of reaching the pharmacodynamic target in this population. Despite widespread use, ideal information about dosage for the pediatric population remains limited.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted in patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit during the period between January 01, 2008, to December 31, 2014. We investigated variables such as age, positive fluid balance, and use of vasoactive drugs on the ability of these patients to achieve the proposed recommended serum level target and the vancomycin serum levels.

- **Results**: Our study showed that only 26% of children reached the 10–20 mg/L serum level, whereas the 7–20 mg/L serum level was reached by 51% of patients.

- **Conclusions**: We observed no evidence of a significant association between the inadequacy of serum level and age. The positive fluid balance also had no influence on the vancomycin serum level, but patients using vasoactive drugs had a greater serum level adequacy than patients not using these drugs.

### Attention to age: Similar dosing regimens lead to different vancomycin levels among older and younger patients [^1147C16e]. Age and Ageing (2019). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical implications of vancomycin trough levels among older patients. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the association between vancomycin levels and outcomes among older versus younger patients.

- **Subjects**: Patients aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years were treated with vancomycin for documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We compared the effectiveness and toxicity of vancomycin according to trough levels in older versus younger patients. A subgroup analysis of patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m² was performed.

- **Results**: We included 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 104 younger patients. The mean age in the older group was 76.9 ± 8 years versus 50.9 ± 12.4 in the younger group. Vancomycin trough levels and 24-hour area under the curve to minimal inhibitory concentrations (AUC/MIC) were significantly higher in older patients, who were also significantly more likely to achieve trough levels of ≥ 15 mg/l within 4 days (98/181 [54.1%] vs. 38/104 [36.5%] in younger patients, P = 0.004). Results were similar among patients with GFR > 60. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in older patients (74/181, 40.9% vs. 13/104, 12.5%, respectively, P < 0.001). There was no association between vancomycin trough levels and mortality among older patients. No significant differences were demonstrated in clinical or microbiological success or nephrotoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Applying uniform dosing recommendations across age groups among adults with MRSA infections results in higher vancomycin levels and differential outcomes.

### Individualized empiric vancomycin dosing in neonates using a model-based approach [^115Pwf1J]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Low credibility.

Vancomycin dosing in neonates is challenging due to the large variation in pharmacokinetics. Existing empiric dosing recommendations often utilize table-based formats, categorizing neonates based on underlying characteristics. However, the ability to individualize dosing is limited by the small number of "dose categories", making it difficult to achieve narrow exposure targets. Our objective was to evaluate a model-based dosing approach, designated as Neo-Vanco, to individualize empiric vancomycin dosing in neonates.

- **Methods**: Neo-Vanco was developed using a published, externally validated population pharmacokinetic model. Through a simulation-based methodology, individualized empiric doses that maximize the probability of attaining a 24-hour area under the curve/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC24/MIC) of > 400 while minimizing troughs > 20 mg/L are calculated. To evaluate the Neo-Vanco strategy, retrospective data from neonates treated with vancomycin at two healthcare systems were used. Empiric dose recommendations from Neo-Vanco, Neofax, Red Book, and Lexicomp were examined. Predicted AUC24 and troughs were calculated and compared.

- **Results**: A total of 492 neonates were evaluated, with a median postmenstrual age of 36 weeks (90% range: 25–47 weeks) and a median weight of 2.4 kg (90% range: 0.6–4.8 kg). The percentage of neonates predicted to achieve an AUC24/MIC of > 400 was significantly higher with Neo-Vanco at 94%, compared to 18% with Neofax, 23% with Red Book, and 55% with Lexicomp (all P < .0001 vs Neo-Vanco).

### Trough concentrations of vancomycin: Adult therapeutic targets are not appropriate for children [^113bwWTg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the need for effective vancomycin therapy, there are few data guiding vancomycin monitoring in children. We retrospectively reviewed vancomycin use in children aged 1 month to 12 years. Initial and adjusted target trough vancomycin concentrations in serum were infrequently achieved regardless of the dosing schedule. Currently recommended trough concentrations need to be re-examined with a more detailed pharmacokinetic study in children.

### A multicenter, retrospective outcome analysis of vancomycin area under the curve versus trough-based dosing strategies in patients with burn or inhalational injuries (MONITOR) [^112no4gV]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that requires close therapeutic monitoring. Prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations increases the risk for serious adverse effects such as nephrotoxicity. However, subtherapeutic concentrations may lead to bacterial resistance and clinical failure or death. The most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America publication regarding therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin recommends using area under the curve (AUC)-based monitoring to maximize clinical success. Despite the guideline recommendation for AUC-guided dosing, many institutions still use trough-only monitoring in their practices, including those caring for patients with acute burn injuries.

Following burn injury, patients are at a higher risk for infections, multiorgan failure, and pharmacokinetic alterations. The primary objective of this multicenter retrospective study is to determine optimal therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin by comparing clinical success between AUC and trough-based monitoring in patients with burns. MONITOR was a multicenter, retrospective study of patients with thermal or inhalation injury admitted to one of 13 burn centers from January 1, 2017, to August 31, 2022, who received vancomycin. Demographic and clinical course data, including acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence and clinical success, were obtained. Patients were evaluated for clinical success and grouped according to the method of monitoring and adjusting doses: AUC vs. trough-based monitoring. Clinical success was a composite definition and lack of meeting any one of five criteria.

### Impact of vancomycin exposure on outcomes in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: Support for consensus guidelines suggested targets [^116ZQseF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

High rates of vancomycin failure in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have been increasingly reported over time. The primary objective of our study was to determine the impact of vancomycin exposure and outcomes in patients with MRSA bacteremia initially treated with vancomycin.

- **Methods**: This was a single-center retrospective analysis of 320 patients with documented MRSA bacteremia initially treated with vancomycin from January 2005 through April 2010. Two methods of susceptibility, Etest and broth microdilution, were performed for all isolates to determine the correlation of susceptibility testing to patient outcomes.

- **Results**: Among a cohort of 320 patients, more than half (52.5%) experienced vancomycin failure. Independent predictors of vancomycin failure in logistic regression included infective endocarditis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.26–9.15), nosocomial-acquired infection (AOR 2.19; 95% CI, 1.21–3.97), and initial vancomycin trough 1 mg/L by Etest (AOR 1.52; 95% CI, 1.09–2.49). With use of Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis, patients with vancomycin area under the curve at 24 hours (AUC(24h)) to MIC ratios ≤ 421 (61.2% vs 48.6%; p = 0.038).

- **Conclusions**: In light of the high failure rates associated with this antimicrobial, optimizing the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin is critical.

### Neonatal vancomycin continuous infusion: Still a confusion [^115FzLz5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Continuous infusions of vancomycin over 24 hours have been shown in adults to reduce drug toxicity, lower treatment costs, and require fewer blood samples for therapeutic drug monitoring. They may also improve clinical outcomes through earlier attainment of target drug concentrations. In neonates, there is no consensus on vancomycin dosing. We reviewed the literature to assess the evidence for vancomycin dosing regimens for continuous infusion in neonates.

- **Methods**: Medline and Embase were searched for studies about continuous vancomycin dosing regimens in neonates that reported serum drug concentrations. The search identified 469 articles, of which 5 were relevant.

- **Results**: Five prospective studies were included; two studies used non-linear mixed effects modeling. Vancomycin was administered with parenteral nutrition or 5% dextrose. Target serum concentrations varied (range: 10–30 mg/L). Four studies used loading doses before continuous infusion; only one documented achievement of therapeutic concentrations after the load. The time to a therapeutic concentration was not reported for the other studies. Attainment of target concentrations ranged from 56% to 89% of measurements. Only one study compared intermittent to continuous infusions, reporting higher attainment of target concentrations with continuous dosing (82% vs. 46%). No adverse effects were reported, although three neonates developed a reversible raised serum creatinine in the setting of septicemia.

- **Conclusion**: Continuous infusions of vancomycin in neonates are well tolerated, require less blood sampling and may improve clinical outcomes.

### Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity: Grave concern or death by character assassination [^113ramNE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity was reported in 0% to 5% of patients in the 1980s. This has been confirmed by numerous clinical trials comparing novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents with vancomycin at the Food and Drug Administration-approved dosage of 1 g every 12 hours. Treatment failures of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections have been reported despite in vitro susceptibility. These failures have led to the use of vancomycin doses higher than those approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Higher doses are being administered to achieve goal vancomycin trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL recommended by several clinical practice guidelines endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Recent studies suggest that increased rates of nephrotoxicity are associated with aggressive vancomycin dosing. These increased rates are confounded by concomitant nephrotoxins, renal insufficiency, or changing hemodynamics. These studies also have demonstrated that vancomycin's nephrotoxicity risk is minimal in patients without risk factors for nephrotoxicity. Clinicians unwilling to dose vancomycin in accordance with clinical practice guidelines should use an alternative agent because inadequate dosing increases the likelihood of selecting heteroresistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.

### Vancomycin administration: the impact of multidisciplinary interventions [^1159j9Bt]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical microbiology team observed that patients were not receiving all prescribed doses of vancomycin, and ward staff was confused about ordering and interpreting vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) levels.

- **Aim**: To audit the incidence of vancomycin dose omission, implement a series of interventions to improve vancomycin dose administration, and repeat the audit process to assess these interventions.

- **Methods**: Three prospective audits were conducted to assess the impact of vancomycin TDM on the administration of vancomycin. After the first audit, several changes in the TDM process were undertaken. Following the second audit, a senior pharmacist coordinated ward-based pharmacists to assist staff in interpreting levels, and TDM interpretative charts were designed for drug charts. After the third audit, feedback to hospital management and a plan for ongoing education were implemented.

- **Results**: There was a significant reduction in the number of vancomycin doses held inappropriately in the third audit (10% (78/782) of prescribed doses) when compared to the first audit (16% (161/1007) of doses) (p < 0.01). Of the doses that were held inappropriately, there was a significant decrease in doses held for no apparent reason in audit 3 (16% (27/170) of prescribed doses) compared to audit 1 (25% (69/282) of doses) (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: The interventions resulted in a 37.5% reduction in inappropriately held vancomycin doses over a one-year period; however, 10% of doses are still being held inappropriately. This study highlights the difficulties in identifying barriers to proper dosage administration.

### Intravenous vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring in children: Evaluation of a pharmacy-driven protocol and collaborative practice agreement [^1145EVMN]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2020). Low credibility.

Vancomycin optimization is challenging, requiring careful therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to avoid toxicity and ensure an efficacious concentration. Most prescriptions are empiric and often discontinued within 72 hours, making early TDM unnecessary. Although TDM using trough levels is common, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) is the preferred pharmacodynamic target. We studied the effect of a pharmacy-driven vancomycin collaborative practice agreement (CPA) at a children's hospital that delayed TDM up to 72 hours and targeted a 2-point 24-hour AUC of ≥ 400 mg × h/L.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed vancomycin courses in patients aged ≥ 30 days who received vancomycin between April 1, 2011, and August 30, 2017. We implemented the CPA on June 1, 2014. Outcomes included CPA use, use of TDM, dosage adjustments, and development of acute kidney injury; we compared courses given while monitoring only trough levels (TO-TDM) with those given while using the CPA (AUC-TDM). We performed interrupted time series analyses to account for preintervention trends.

- **Results**: We included 2379 courses in the TO-TDM period and 2155 in the AUC-TDM period. During AUC-TDM, 87% of the courses were managed by the CPA. In adjusted interrupted time series analyses, CPA implementation was associated with an initial change in level of -0.265 (95% confidence interval, -0.336 to -0.189) TDM and an initial change in level of -0.332 (95% CI, -0.506 to -0.163) dosage adjustments. The 1-year risk of acute kidney injury decreased after CPA implementation.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^112nsVkV]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Patients receiving a dose of ≤ 40 mg/kg/day presented a serum level < 10 mg/L in 71.3% of the collections. With this same dosage, the serum level between 10 and 14 mg/L was reached in only 18.6% of the collections.

Of all vancomycin serum level collections performed (n = 217), only 211 were identified to determine if patients used vasoactive drugs at the time of collection. A total of 89.6% (n = 189) did not use vasoactive drugs, while 10.4% (n = 22) did use vasoactive drugs.

- **Mixed logistical models of serum level inadequacy**: Table 5 shows the results of the mixed logistic models analyzing factors associated with inadequate serum levels of vancomycin. No variable was found to be related to inadequate vancomycin levels. On the contrary, it was found that patients using vasoactive drugs had the odds of inadequate serum levels reduced by 73% compared to patients who did not use vasoactive drugs.

- **Note**: CI 95% refers to the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratios; WB represents water balance, and VAD denotes vasoactive drugs.

### Cystatin c-guided vancomycin dosing in critically ill patients: A quality improvement project [^113WsdxT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). High credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine whether a vancomycin dosing algorithm based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate from creatinine and cystatin C levels (eGFR cr-cys) improves target trough concentration achievement compared to an algorithm based on estimated creatinine clearance (eCL cr) in critically ill patients.

- **Study design**: This prospective quality improvement project evaluated intensive care unit (ICU) patients started on intravenous vancomycin using one of two different strategies. Dosing regimens were selected and implemented after an individualized goal trough range was established (10–15 or 15–20 mg/L). Steady-state goal trough achievement was compared between treatment arms with and without adjustment for potential confounders.

- **Setting & participants**: Three medical and surgical ICUs at a single tertiary medical center.

- **Quality improvement plan**: During January 2012 to October 2013, vancomycin was dosed according to eCL cr using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (control arm). During December 2013 to May 2015, a multidisciplinary quality improvement team implemented a novel vancomycin dosing algorithm according to eGFR cr-cys using the CKD-EPI equation (intervention arm).

- **Outcome**: Steady-state initial goal vancomycin trough concentration achievement.

- **Measurements & results**: More patients in the intervention arm (67 of 135 [50%]) achieved therapeutic trough vancomycin levels than in the control arm (74 of 264 [28%]; OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.65–3.90; P < 0.001). Improved trough achievement was maintained even after adjustment for age, sex, and APACHE score.

### Implementation of a dose calculator for vancomycin to achieve target trough levels of 15–20 microg/mL in persons undergoing hemodialysis [^116cRbsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. It has a narrow therapeutic range; overdosing risks nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, whereas underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Optimal trough levels have been identified as between 15–20 μg/mL.

A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to achieve accurate vancomycin dosing in individuals undergoing hemodialysis. The model identified three simple parameters responsible for 94.6% of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and the period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing accuracy was achieved in 77.9% of patients, avoiding major over- and underdosing in the remainder. The mean measured trough level of 16.5 μg/mL was 5.6% lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17.5 μg/mL. A fixed loading dose of 20 mg/kg resulted in subtherapeutic trough levels in half of the patients.

The VDC allows for accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis trough level, dry body weight, and the period to the next dialysis session for the majority of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Higher loading doses accounting for the period to the next dialysis may be more appropriate than the fixed loading doses used in this study.

### Vancomycin dosing in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [^115DwQm4]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a cornerstone antibiotic for the treatment of severe gram-positive infections in dialysis patients for decades. Subtherapeutic vancomycin levels convey a risk of treatment failure and the further emergence of resistance in staphylococci. In contrast, supratherapeutic vancomycin levels are associated with a dose-related incremental risk for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Consequently, a narrow therapeutic range with a trough-level target between 15 and 20 μg/ml is recommended.

- **Dosing considerations**: Vancomycin dosing in hemodialysis patients is mainly influenced by the timing of administration (during or after dialysis), the type of filter used, and the duration of dialysis. Actual body weight, the interdialytic interval, and residual renal function are also considerations. As in patients with normal kidney function, a weight-based loading dose of 20–25 mg/kg should be used in dialysis patients.

While most fixed-dose maintenance regimens fail to reach target levels in the majority of hemodialysis patients, straightforward evidence on optimal maintenance dosing is lacking.

### Serum vancomycin levels resulting from continuous or intermittent infusion in critically ill burn patients with or without continuous renal replacement therapy [^1169sKXg]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

We evaluated vancomycin levels as recent guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin (not available at the time these data were collected) recommend trough levels of 15 to 20 μg/mL; however, this may be more difficult to achieve in patients with accelerated vancomycin clearance, such as burn patients or recipients of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) therapy.

We retrospectively studied 2110 serum vancomycin levels of 171 patients admitted to the burn intensive care unit for more than 4 years and who received vancomycin by continuous infusion (CI) or intermittent infusion (II), with or without simultaneous CVVH. In-hospital mortality, 14- and 28-day mortality following vancomycin therapy were not different between dosing methods, although increased mortality was observed in the subgroup of patients receiving CI vancomycin empirically for clinical sepsis with negative blood cultures.

More vancomycin was delivered to patients daily by CI than II, and therapeutic drug monitoring costs were similar. After controlling for differences in vancomycin dose by case matching with propensity scores, mean vancomycin levels were 20.0 ± 3.8 μg/mL for CI, vs. 14.8 ± 4.4 μg/mL for II (P < .001). CI dosing resulted in similar levels with or without CVVH, whereas in II dosing, CVVH appeared to significantly decrease vancomycin levels. Although CI dosing was associated with higher vancomycin levels in general and fewer levels of < 10 μg/mL, significant nephrotoxicity or neutropenia was not observed. Fifty-seven patients (33.3%) developed bacteremia, and 106 Gram-positive bacteri

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^116D6mcb]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the sample studied, 48.2% (n = 53) of the patients had a positive microbiologic culture, with the patients having between one and five agents identified. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent agent followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis.

The number of samples taken for evaluation of vancomycin trough serum levels varied between 0 and 11, being undertaken in 87.3% of the 110 patients evaluated.

The average duration of vancomycin treatment was 8.7 days (first quartile: 4.3 days and third quartile: 13.0 days). Seven patients died during hospitalization, representing 6.4% of the sample of 110 patients. The trough levels related to this mortality rate ranged from < 5 to 17.3 mg/L.

- **Initial treatment interval data**: The information about the interval between dose administration and vancomycin serum collection, time between the collection and the next dose, and time of collection are crucial for understanding treatment effectiveness.
- **Dosage information**: The median of the initial dose was 40 mg/kg/day, ranging from 30 to 84 mg/kg/day. For all doses administered during treatment with vancomycin, the total daily dose varied from 24 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day, with a median of 40 mg/kg/day.

### The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin [^114ZGFNy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is one of only a few antibiotics available to treat patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Therefore, understanding the clinical implications of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin is a necessity for clinicians. Vancomycin is a concentration-independent antibiotic (also referred to as a "time-dependent" antibiotic), and there are factors that affect its clinical activity, including variable tissue distribution, inoculum size, and emerging resistance. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data related to vancomycin and discusses such clinical issues as toxicities and serum concentration monitoring.

### Impact of source of infection and vancomycin AUC0–24/MICBMD targets on treatment failure in patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^112Zgmvk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Despite recent controversies about toxicity and reduced efficacy, vancomycin remains the treatment of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. The parameter associated with treatment success is the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve to MIC ratio (AUC0–24/MIC). We aimed to determine the utility of calculated AUCs and explore the optimal AUC0–24/MIC targets associated with treatment success.

In this single-centre retrospective observational cohort study of 127 patients with MRSA bacteraemia, forty-five (35.4%) did not respond to vancomycin treatment. Patient characteristics were essentially the same between those who did not respond to vancomycin treatment and those with treatment success. Independent predictors of treatment failure included the source of bacteraemia (odds ratio (OR), 4.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.50–12.26; p 0.007) and not achieving an AUC0–24/MICBMD (using broth microdilution) target of ≥ 398 (OR, 11.4; 95% CI, 4.57–28.46; p < 0.001).

Bacteraemic source-specific thresholds were observed, with a higher AUC0–24/MICBMD target of 440 required for high-risk sources (e.g. infective endocarditis) compared with 330 for low-risk sources (e.g. line-related bacteraemia). Overall, treatment success in patients with MRSA bacteraemia was associated with a vancomycin AUC0–24/MICBMD target of ≥ 398, with source-specific targets observed. Future vancomycin practice guidelines will need to take into account MIC methodology, the source of bacteraemia, and patient populations prior to setting targets and monitoring recommendations.

### Continuous learning in model-informed precision dosing: A case study in pediatric dosing of vancomycin [^111hRoi2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Vancomycin dosing guidelines emphasize the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) over 24 hours to the minimum inhibitory concentration as the primary pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic predictor of vancomycin activity. For optimal AUC‐guided model-informed precision dosing (MIPD), consideration must be given not only to the ability of a model to predict a trough level but also to its ability to describe the full shape of a PK curve.

Because the data available in this study were collected during routine clinical care and peak samples are not routinely collected at this institution, we were concerned that the continuous learning models, especially those implementing one‐compartment kinetics, would not be able to capture the full PK curve. Misspecification of the PK curve would result in erroneous and/or biased AUC estimates.

The gold standard for estimating AUC is noncompartmental analysis; however, this approach requires densely sampled serum concentrations. Instead, simulated "true" AUC estimates were compared with AUC estimates produced by each of the literature models and the continuous learning models. The Kloprogge model was selected for creating the simulated data set and simulated "true" AUC values because it was:

- A two‐compartment model, and vancomycin PK is most commonly found to be described by two compartments.
- Developed in a more densely sampled data set than the other models under consideration (6.7 samples per patient).
- Described the patients in this population well.

For clarity, the models developed in 50 patients have been excluded.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^1162rFdd]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

- **Trough concentrations**: Trough concentrations of vancomycin required for an AUC of 400 in neonates are lower than those reported for adults.

- **MIC distribution**: Based on the actual MIC distribution of neonatal invasive CoNS strains, the vancomycin dosing AUC/MIC of 400 is achieved in less than half of neonates. Vancomycin doses required for an 80% probability of reaching this target are associated with potentially toxic trough levels.

- **Treatment failure**: With vancomycin dosing, treatment failure occurs in about a quarter of cases.

### An intervention to improve the timing of vancomycin levels [^113Vq2TM]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Blood samples for vancomycin levels are often drawn too early, leading to potential misinterpretation of results. However, only a few studies describe interventions to reduce mistimed vancomycin levels.

- **Methods**: We implemented an information technology (IT)-based intervention that provided educational instructions to nurses and determined the percentage of levels drawn too early for 27 months before (n = 6,291) and 14 months after (n = 3,608) the intervention. We also conducted nurse interviews (n = 40) and dataset analysis to assess the root causes of mistimed levels.

- **Results**: The percentage of vancomycin timing errors decreased from 39% (2,438/6,291) to 32% (1,137/3,608), though in a time series analysis this decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.64). Four common causes of mistimed levels were identified:
	- Unclear provider orders.
	- Scheduling levels to be drawn with morning laboratory tests.
	- Lack of communication between providers.
	- Failure to adjust the blood draw in relation to the previous dose.

- **Conclusions**: A real-time, IT-based intervention that links the timing of levels with medication administration might have a more substantial impact.

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113MFBBr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

- **Methods**: We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol. This protocol involved a 1000-mg load followed by a 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis. A new protocol was developed and prospectively validated for patients weighing 100 kg, to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

- **Results**: MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases, including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed postload trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L, with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L, with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (i.e. 10–22 mg/L).

- **Conclusions**: In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^111HD99q]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the pediatric population, infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are associated with significant morbidity and hospital costs. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is widely used for the treatment of serious infections by Gram-positive microorganisms, especially MRSA. It is recommended to maintain the serum level of vancomycin between 10 and 20 mg/L, correlating to AUC/MIC > 400 in adults. This pharmacodynamic target is extrapolated to pediatric patients despite the lack of similar evidence. However, recent studies suggest that serum levels between 7 and 10 mg/L are predictive of reaching the pharmacodynamic target in this population. Despite widespread use, ideal dosage information for the pediatric population remains limited.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit between January 01, 2008, and December 31, 2014. We investigated variables such as age, positive fluid balance, and the use of vasoactive drugs on the ability of these patients to achieve the proposed recommended serum level target and the vancomycin serum levels.

- **Results**: Our study showed that only 26% of children reached the 10–20 mg/L serum level, whereas the 7–20 mg/L serum level was reached by 51% of patients.

- **Conclusions**: We observed no evidence of a significant association between the inadequacy of serum level and age. The positive fluid balance also had no influence on the vancomycin serum level, but patients using vasoactive drugs had a greater serum level adequacy than patients not using them.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^111YJmAW]? BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

We assumed that, compared to S. aureus infection in adults, a lower AUC/MIC ratio is needed for the treatment of neonatal CoNS sepsis because CoNS are less invasive and rarely cause infections other than bloodstream infections (BSI). In addition, higher free drug concentration can be assumed in neonates due to lower protein levels, the drug protein binding capability of neonatal plasma, and elevated bilirubin, which competes with drugs for binding sites to albumin. Finally, in our study, we used MIC values of CoNS causing neonatal sepsis rather than fixed MIC values from databases.

We aimed, first, to identify neonatal vancomycin doses needed for 80% and 90% probability of target attainment (PTA) of AUC/MIC > 400 and AUC/MIC > 300 using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution of invasive neonatal CoNS isolates from our hospital. Second, to characterize the PTA for these targets with currently recommended TDM-guided dosing. Third, to correlate individual AUC/MIC ratios with clinical outcomes.

### Practice guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis [^116n2y3t]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute bacterial meningitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2004 guidelines recommend maintaining serum vancomycin trough concentrations of approximately 15–20 mg/mL in patients receiving vancomycin for the treatment of meningitis.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^112C8zs6]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Two important factors that can hinder the serum concentration of antimicrobials are related to the increased volume of distribution and increased renal clearance caused by the intravenous administration of fluids and vasoactive drugs. Often, multiple conditions that can influence the pharmacokinetics are present at the same time, excessively complicating the prediction of adequate serum concentrations. In general, the conditions that lead to a suboptimal dosage are prevalent. The volume of distribution describes the relationship between the dose and the resulting serum concentration, but in conditions where the volume of distribution is increased, a reduction in the drug's serum level concentration is expected.

In our study, the positive fluid balance did not show any influence on vancomycin serum levels. In critically ill patients, alterations in physiopathologic conditions that lead to increased capillary permeability, formation of edema, vasodilation, and hypotension may result in pharmacokinetic alterations in many antibiotics. Additionally, the measures taken to reverse this situation, such as the administration of large amounts of fluids, make it difficult to interpret the concentrations of vancomycin, the volume of distribution, and, subsequently, the degree of distribution throughout the tissue. As vancomycin is an antibiotic with hydrophilic qualities, the volume of distribution of vancomycin may be high, while plasma concentrations may be reduced. Katip et al. evaluated pharmacokinetic aspects of vancomycin in patients in the early stage of septic shock and verified that the clearance of vancomycin is influenced by these factors.

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^112tR5fN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Improvements to vancomycin exposure may be achieved through model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) based on patient characteristics and measured blood samples. The sampling strategy for traditional vancomycin dose adaptations relies on the interpretation of trough concentrations. However, for accurate estimation of the area under the curve (AUC) 24h, it is advised to obtain at least one postdistributional peak and one trough vancomycin concentration at the end of a dosing interval. The ability to accurately determine a trough-based AUC 24h without a peak concentration offers advantages such as improved clinical feasibility and reduced patient burden. In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the accuracy and precision of trough-based AUC 24h estimation using existing population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models for vancomycin and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) blood samples for pediatric patients.

### Cost-benefit analysis comparing trough, two-level auc and bayesian auc dosing for vancomycin [^114YKAED]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Low credibility.

Area under the time-concentration curve (AUC)-guided dosing provides better estimates of exposure than vancomycin trough concentrations. Though clinical benefits have been reported, the costs of AUC-guided dosing are uncertain. The objective of this study was to quantify the costs of single-sample Bayesian or two-sample AUC strategies versus trough-guided dosing.

- **Methods**: A cost-benefit analysis from the institutional perspective was conducted using a decision tree to model the probabilities and costs of acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with vancomycin administered over 48 hours up to 21+ days. Costs included vancomycin concentrations, Bayesian software, and AKI hospitalization costs, with probabilities obtained from primary literature. Robustness was assessed via both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: In the base-case model, two-sample AUC versus trough dosing saved an average of US$ 846 per patient encounter, and single-sample Bayesian AUC versus trough dosing saved an average of US$ 2,065 per patient encounter. This translates into annual cost-savings of US$ 846,810 and US$ 2,065,720 for two-sample and single-sample Bayesian methods versus trough dosing, respectively, assuming 1,000 vancomycin-treated patients per year. Assuming a budget of US$ 100,000 per year for Bayesian software, an institution would need to treat ≥ 41 patients with vancomycin for at least 48 hours to break even.

- **Conclusions**: There are significant institutional cost benefits using two-sample AUC or single-sample Bayesian methods over trough dosing, even after accounting for associated costs.

### Vancomycin dosing in critically ill trauma patients: The VANCTIC study [^112u7cen]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommend vancomycin troughs of 15 mg/L to 20 mg/L for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin are altered in critically ill patients, leading to inadequate serum levels. Rates of initial therapeutic vancomycin troughs have ranged from 17.6% to 33% using intermittent infusions (i.e. 15–20 mg/L) and approximately 60% using continuous infusions (i.e. 15–25 mg/L) in critically ill trauma patients [1–4]. We hypothesized that our dosing protocol would achieve higher rates of initial therapeutic troughs compared with previously published reports due to more aggressive loading doses than those seen in previously published reports.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of all critically ill trauma patients admitted to a Level I trauma intensive care unit over a 39-month period, who had a suspected serious infection, were treated with empiric vancomycin per the "pharmacy to dose" protocol, and had an appropriately drawn steady state trough level. The primary outcome was the rate of initial therapeutic troughs, which was defined as 14.5 mg/L to 20.5 mg/L.

- **Results**: One hundred ninety-seven patients were screened. Seventy patients met inclusion criteria. The study cohort had a median age of 47.5 years and a median Injury Severity Score of 28. Augmented renal clearances were observed, with a median creatinine clearance of 159.1 mL/min and a median augmented renal clearance in trauma.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^116Wh82J]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Simulations of target attainment with dosing were carried out using the above-described models. First, Anderson's popPK model was used with collected subjects' covariate information for retrieval of individual PK parameters. Individual AUC values were evaluated from: AUC = (24×D)/(CL×τ), where τ equals the interval between infusions (hours). Second, the TDM population model based on individual Bayesian posterior predictions was used, and fitted concentration curves were constructed for each subject. Twenty-four-hour individual AUCs at steady state were calculated using the trapezoidal approximation method of fitted concentration curves.

1,000 virtual MIC values were generated by bootstrapping vancomycin MICs of CoNS isolates in our database. A discrete distribution of variables was assumed. AUC values obtained by both methods were bootstrapped to 1,000 virtual subjects along with MIC values, and 500 such data sets were simulated for AUC/MIC targets. PTA values of 80% and 90% were found over target levels of AUC/MIC > 400 and AUC/MIC > 300. The higher target was chosen as being associated with clinical efficacy in adult MRSA pneumonia, and it is the most frequently quoted in neonatal PKPD simulation studies in recent years. A lower target was also tested, as different pathogen structure and disease (bloodstream vs. lung tissue penetration) as well as lower protein binding suggest lower optimal exposure for neonates. Empirical confidence intervals were identified from the performed simulations.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^114qAeUB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

As noted above, various guidelines recommend trough levels of ≥ 15 mg/L to 20 mg/L, although minimal evidence supporting efficacy exists. In contrast, numerous studies have assessed the safety of this recommendation by comparing nephrotoxicity rates above and below 15 mg/L. At least two meta-analyses analyzed these studies. Van Hal et al. identified 15 studies and found an OR of 2.67 (95% CI 1.95–3.65) for nephrotoxicity with troughs ≥ 15 mg/L. This finding persisted if restricted to studies evaluating only initial troughs. More recently, Tongsai and Koomanachai analyzed 10 studies involving only patients with MRSA infection and found an OR of 2.14 (95% CI 1.42–3.23) for nephrotoxicity with troughs ≥ 15 mg/L and an adjusted OR of 3.33 (95% CI 1.91–5.79) in three studies providing sufficient data for combining adjusted ORs. Hence, the evidence for potential harm with attaining troughs ≥ 15 mg/L is more compelling than the evidence for potential benefit.

### Vancomycin area under the curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio predicting clinical outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis with pooled sensitivity and specificity [^111r11kL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a first-line antibiotic for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections or other Gram-positive infections. The area under the curve (AUC) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio is proposed as a therapeutic drug-monitoring parameter. How well clinical efficacy is predicted by this measure has not been established.

- **Objective**: Determine the test performance characteristics (TPC) of AUC:MIC of vancomycin for prediction of positive outcome.

- **Data sources**: PubMed and Ovid Medline (1946 to 2018) and EMBASE (1974 to 2018).
	- **Study eligibility criteria and participants**: Studies of patients treated with vancomycin for any type of infection in peer-reviewed publications. All patient populations were included.

- **Interventions**: Vancomycin AUC:MIC or AUC was related to patient clinical outcome.

- **Methods**: Searches of medical databases using relevant terms were performed. Screening, study reviewing, data extracting, and assessing data quality were performed independently by two reviewers. Studies were stratified by type of primary outcome for calculation of pooled sensitivity, specificity, and construction of hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves.

- **Results**: Nineteen studies including 1699 patients were meta-analyzed. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.77 (95% CI 0.67–0.84) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.53–0.71), respectively, for the seven studies with a primary outcome of mortality; and 0.65 (95% CI 0.53–0.75), 0.58 (95% CI 0.48–0.67) for studies with composite or clinical cure outcome (n = 12). HSROC curves suggested considerable variances in the efficacy of predictions based on AUC:MIC ratios.

### Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity in the critically ill: A retrospective multivariate regression analysis [^112U2Kiv]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the influence of vancomycin dose, serum trough concentration, and dosing strategy on the evolution of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients, a retrospective, single-center, observational study was conducted. This research took place at the University Hospital ICU in Birmingham, UK, involving all critically ill patients receiving vancomycin from December 1, 2004, to August 31, 2009. No interventions were applied during the study.

The study identified the prevalence of new-onset nephrotoxicity using Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease criteria, and determined independent factors predictive of nephrotoxicity through logistic regression analysis. Data from 1,430 patients were comprehensively analyzed. Significant predictors of nephrotoxicity included concomitant vasoactive therapy (odds ratio = 1.633; p < 0.001), median serum vancomycin levels (odds ratio = 1.112; p < 0.001), and duration of therapy (odds ratio = 1.041; p ≤ 0.001). It was observed that intermittent infusion posed a significantly greater risk of nephrotoxicity than continuous infusion (odds ratio = 8.204; p ≤ 0.001).

In conclusion, higher serum vancomycin concentrations and extended duration of therapy significantly increase the odds of nephrotoxicity. However, continuous infusion of vancomycin is associated with a decreased likelihood of nephrotoxicity compared to intermittent infusion. This large dataset supports the use of continuous infusion of vancomycin in critically ill patients.

### Vancomycin therapeutic guidelines: A summary of consensus recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^116hsMEx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection in adult patients were reviewed by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. A literature review of existing evidence regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations, in addition to patient outcomes combined with expert opinion regarding the drug's pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety record, resulted in new recommendations for targeting and adjustment of vancomycin therapy.

### The impact of pediatric-specific vancomycin dosing guidelines: A quality improvement initiative [^113BtJyx]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

There are limited data guiding vancomycin dosing practices in the pediatric population to target the goal troughs recommended by national vancomycin guidelines. In this study, we sought to improve adherence to guideline trough targets through a quality improvement intervention.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was first conducted to assess baseline performance. A multidisciplinary team then developed and implemented a standardized dosing algorithm recommending 15 mg/kg per dose for mild and moderate infections (goal trough: 10–15 µg/mL) and 20 mg/kg per dose for severe infections (goal trough: 15–20 µg/mL), both delivered every 6 hours (maximum single dose: 750 mg). The impact of the intervention was evaluated prospectively using standard statistics and quality improvement methodology. The outcome measures included the percentage of patients with an initial therapeutic trough and the time to therapeutic trough.

- **Results**: A total of 116 patients (49 preintervention, 67 postintervention) were included. Postintervention, there was a significant increase in the percentage of patients with an initial therapeutic trough (6.1% to 20.9%, P = 0.03) and in the percentage of patients with initial troughs between 10 and 20 µg/mL (8.2% to 40.3%, P < .001). The time to therapeutic trough decreased from 2.78 to 1.56 days (P = 0.001), with the process control chart showing improved control postintervention. Vancomycin-related toxicity was unchanged by the intervention (6.1% versus 4.5%; p = 0.70).

- **Conclusions**: Using quality improvement methodology with standardized dosing resulted in increased adherence to target trough goals without increasing toxicity.

### Association of vancomycin serum concentrations with efficacy in patients with MRSA infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ujL2t]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections recommend maintaining vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L for serious infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies assessing the impact of low (< 15 mg/L) versus high (≥ 15 mg/L) vancomycin trough levels on the efficacy of MRSA infection treatment. Four prospective and 12 retrospective studies were included, encompassing 2003 participants.

No significant difference was demonstrated between low and high vancomycin trough levels for the outcome of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–1.46, I² = 28%). In studies evaluating mainly MRSA pneumonia, there was significantly higher mortality with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.11–2.84).

No significant difference was demonstrated in treatment failure rates (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.88–1.78, I² = 51%). However, excluding one outlier study from the analysis, treatment failure became significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin trough levels (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12–1.91, I² = 16%). Microbiologic failure rates were significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.26, I² = 0%).

Nephrotoxicity was significantly higher with vancomycin levels of ≥ 15 mg/L. However, no cases of irreversible renal damage were reported. Data on the effectiveness of higher vancomycin trough levels in the treatment of MRSA infections are limited to a few prospective and mainly retrospective studies.

### An evaluation of the incidence of nephrotoxicity following a loading dose of vancomycin in patients with severe renal impairment [^117SkzPr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Loading doses of vancomycin assist in the rapid achievement of target trough concentrations. Patients with renal dysfunction have been excluded from studies evaluating loading doses.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to investigate nephrotoxicity related to the initial vancomycin dose in patients with severe renal dysfunction.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of a large academic health system. Adults were included if they received intravenous vancomycin in the emergency department and presented with creatinine clearance 20 mg/kg) vs. low (≤ 20 mg/kg) dose of vancomycin. Secondary outcomes included dialysis, vancomycin concentrations, length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and a composite outcome of nephrotoxicity or dialysis.

- **Results**: Of the 927 patients included in the analysis, nephrotoxicity occurred in 7.2% and 13.8% of patients in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively (p < 0.01). Patients in the high-dose group had a reduced risk of nephrotoxicity (relative risk 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.35–0.78). The reduction in risk remained after fitting a generalized linear model adjusting for weight, age, sex, initial serum creatinine, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (relative risk 0.61; 95% confidence interval 0.39–0.93). Limitations of this study include its retrospective design and single-center population.

### Achievement of therapeutic vancomycin trough serum concentrations with empiric dosing in neonatal intensive care unit patients [^114PhfZ1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The recommended goal serum trough concentration for vancomycin has been increased to 10 to 20 mcg/mL, with a higher range of 15 to 20 mcg/mL advised for serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in children and adults. Although neonatal references also recommend these higher target concentrations, dosing recommendations have remained unchanged. This study aimed to assess the percentage of neonates and young infants achieving a serum trough concentration between 10 and 20 mcg/mL with empiric vancomycin dosing based on Neofax® in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) population.

- **Methods**: A multi-institutional retrospective chart review was conducted to identify NICU patients who received a minimum of three doses of intravenous vancomycin and had at least one appropriately drawn trough. Additional outcomes included the duration of vancomycin therapy, the number of dose adjustments required to achieve goal trough concentrations, time to goal trough, and incidence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.

- **Results**: Of the 171 vancomycin serum trough concentrations included in the primary outcome, only 25.1% achieved a goal trough of 10 to 20 mcg/mL with empiric dosing. Furthermore, only 44.6% of patients achieved the goal trough of 10 to 20 mcg/mL at any time during their vancomycin therapy. The average gestational age was 28.2 ± 4.1 weeks, average postnatal age at the start of vancomycin administration was 34.1 ± 34.6 days, and average weight of the patients at the initiation of vancomycin therapy was 1602 ± 1014.5 g. The average and median total daily dose in those patients who achieved an in…

### Limitations of vancomycin in the management of resistant staphylococcal infections [^116wLKhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and has been widely used in the past few years. However, several recent reports have highlighted the limitations of vancomycin, and its role in the management of serious infections is now being reconsidered. Vancomycin treatment failure rates are associated with an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration as well as a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing.

- **Intrinsic limitations**: The intrinsic limitations of vancomycin include poor tissue penetration, particularly in the lung; relatively slow bacterial killing; and the potential for toxicity.
- **Emergence of resistance**: Intermediate-level vancomycin resistance has emerged among staphylococci, as have rare cases of fully resistant strains.

Because of these problems, when using vancomycin, it is probably prudent to carefully establish the diagnosis, test for antimicrobial susceptibility, and monitor serum trough concentrations to ensure adequate dosing.

### Pediatric antibiotic stewardship: Optimization of vancomycin therapy based on individual pharmacokinetics [^1134KxW8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a first-line treatment for Gram-positive infections for decades. However, strategies for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and dose optimization in pediatrics remain controversial. In this study, we analyzed the impact of specific antibiotic stewardship interventions on the efficacy and safety of vancomycin therapy.

- **Methods**: From September 2014 to May 2017, we conducted a prospective study to compare a control and a TDM intervention group in our tertiary care center. As part of an antibiotic stewardship program, we implemented internal guidelines on correct vancomycin dosing, TDM timing, targeted trough level range, and installed a pharmacokinetic (PK) consultation service to adapt vancomycin dosing to individually calculated PK parameters. Primary clinical outcomes included the percentage of patients with sustained therapeutic vancomycin trough levels and treatment days with therapeutic vancomycin trough levels, specifically 10–15 mg/L. Secondary outcomes involved nephrotoxicity, readmission rate, and mortality. The median daily dose required to achieve therapeutic trough levels was examined.

- **Results**: Clinical outcomes for 90 control patients were compared with outcomes for 19 patients guided by a PK consultation service. The percentage of patients with sustained therapeutic vancomycin trough levels increased from 17.8% to 94.7% (P < 0.001), and the percentage of treatment days with therapeutic vancomycin trough levels increased from 18.4% (117/637) to 66.5% (155/233, P < 0.001). The readmission rate decreased from 24.4% to 5.3% (P = 0.07).

### What's new in therapeutic drug monitoring of antimicrobials [^116K57T3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

There are several areas of uncertainty in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antimicrobials.

- **Target concentrations**: One primary concern is determining the concentrations that should be targeted and the appropriate sites for these measurements. There is significant heterogeneity in TDM studies regarding the definition of target concentrations. The probability of target attainment (PTA) for empirical dosing depends on whether "high" or "low" targets are established. For example, while there is consensus that ß-lactam concentrations should exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of pathogens for most of a dosing interval, it is debated whether target concentrations up to 4–6 × MIC offer additional benefits.

- **Microbial resistance**: Individual MICs are often unavailable; therefore, empirical MICs are typically used, generally at the higher end of "sensitive". The use of high MICs alongside high target attainment aims to avoid underdosing. However, the necessity of such high targets is questionable, as they might increase the risk of reaching potentially toxic levels.

- **Local resistance epidemiology**: It remains unclear whether target concentrations should be adjusted based on local resistance epidemiology and if TDM is particularly valuable in settings with high resistance rates.

- **Measurement sites**: Antimicrobial concentrations are usually measured in plasma samples, which may not accurately reflect concentrations at the site of infection and thus serve as surrogate markers.

### Correlation of a vancomycin pharmacokinetic model and trough serum concentrations in pediatric patients [^112zxvAT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough concentrations specific to pediatric patients have yet to be validated to achieve an area under the curve (AUC) over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 400. The primary objective of this study was to validate a pharmacokinetic model in a pediatric hospital and determine the correlation between a calculated AUC/MIC ratio and measured trough vancomycin concentrations.

- **Methods**: A retrospective evaluation was conducted on patients aged 3 months to 18 years prescribed vancomycin at a pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2013. The correlation between patient-specific AUC/MIC and measured vancomycin trough concentration was assessed.

- **Results**: Forty pediatric patients with 40 vancomycin trough concentrations and documented Staphylococcus aureus cultures were included in the study. The median age was 8.5 years (interquartile range, 2–14.3 years), with a median weight of 28.7 kg (range, 14–50.2 kg) and a mean baseline serum creatinine of 0.51 ± 0.3 mg/dL. The mean daily dose of vancomycin prescribed was 58 ± 13.8 mg/kg/d. The mean vancomycin trough concentration was 11 ± 5.5 mcg/mL, and the mean AUC/MIC was 534 ± 373. No correlation was found between trough concentration and AUC/MIC (r = 0.082, p = 0.07).

- **Conclusions**: This study validates the clinical applicability of a pharmacokinetic model for calculating vancomycin clearance to determine patient-specific AUC over 24 hours in pediatrics. Trough concentrations associated with proposed therapeutic AUC/MIC ratios were lower than reported in the adult population. Further research is needed to determine if improved correlations can be achieved.

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^116MYdo4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In this counterpoint, we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising alternative solutions.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^113zXtF6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

The guidelines define nephrotoxicity as a rise in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL or 50% above baseline on two consecutive measurements after several days of vancomycin and with no other apparent cause. This is the definition used most frequently, although other studies use the more sensitive risk-injury-failure-loss-ESRD (RIFLE) or AKI network (AKIN) criteria for AKI. Herein, VANT refers to the guideline-based definition of nephrotoxicity, and AKI refers to either the RIFLE or AKIN criteria.

Studies using these latter criteria have found most cases to be of lower stages based on creatinine criteria. In one study using AKIN criteria, 92% reached stage 1, whereas in two studies using RIFLE criteria, 50% and 71% reached only stage R. No study has specified VANT or AKI stage based purely on urine output criteria.

Older studies showed mean increases of serum creatinine from baseline of approximately 1–1.5 mg/dL.

### Healthcare-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Evidence for reverse vancomycin creep and impact of vancomycin trough values on outcome [^111br42G]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in Staphylococcus aureus have been associated with worse clinical outcomes in adults. For invasive meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections in adults, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends targeting vancomycin serum trough concentrations between 15 and 20 μg/mL. We evaluated trends in vancomycin MICs from healthcare-associated (HCA) S. aureus bacteremia isolates in children, in addition to correlating vancomycin serum trough levels with clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients and isolates were identified from a prospective S. aureus surveillance study at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH). HCA S. aureus bacteremia isolates from 2003 to 2013 were selected. Vancomycin MICs by E-test were determined, and medical records were reviewed. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined as doubling of the baseline serum creatinine.

- **Results**: Three hundred forty-one isolates met the inclusion criteria. We observed a reverse vancomycin creep among MRSA isolates in the study period, with a decline in the proportion of isolates with vancomycin MIC ≥ 2 μg/mL (from 32.7% to 5.6%). The presence of vancomycin trough levels > 15 μg/mL was an independent risk factor for AKI.

- **Conclusions**: Vancomycin MICs are shifting among HCA S. aureus bacteremia isolates, indicating a need for ongoing surveillance and reassessment of vancomycin dosing strategies.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^115rZ3cp]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Infections in intensive care units (ICU) are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In the United States, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) account for 8% of all hospital-acquired infections, with MRSA infections causing an estimated 18,650 deaths annually. In the pediatric population, MRSA infections are also linked to significant morbidity and hospital expenses.

The appropriate treatment for severe infections caused by S. aureus presents a significant challenge as therapeutic failure can lead to death. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is widely used for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms, especially MRSA. It is currently considered the first choice for empirical therapy of these infections.

According to the consensus recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, maintaining the area under the curve (AUC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 400 is a suitable target for achieving a successful outcome in MRSA infection treatment. This pharmacodynamic target is regarded as the best predictor of microbiological and clinical outcomes when treating MRSA infections. However, calculating the AUC is clinically impractical. Trough serum concentration measured shortly before the fourth dose, i.e. at steady state, with a value of 15–20 mg/L, is correlated with an AUC/MIC > 400 in adult patients with MRSA MIC < 1 mcg/mL.

### Recent changes in vancomycin use in renal failure [^116Edsz1]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key tool in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. A progressive increase in vancomycin resistance, with consequent treatment failure, has been observed in staphylococci. Therefore, new dosing guidelines advocating much higher vancomycin doses have been issued. Target trough levels of 15–20 microg/ml are proposed. Whether and how these targets can be achieved in patients with chronic kidney disease or those on dialysis are still under evaluation. The higher vancomycin doses needed to achieve these treatment targets carry a substantial risk for nephrotoxicity. This risk is incremental with higher trough levels and longer duration of vancomycin use. Critically ill patients, those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents, and patients with already compromised renal function are particularly at risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity.

### Prescribing habits of vancomycin in the emergency department: Are we dosing appropriately [^11297qj9]? The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To prevent the development of bacterial resistance, guidelines recommend vancomycin dosages of 15–20 mg/kg based on actual body weight.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to determine if two community teaching emergency departments followed the new recommendations for a weight-based dosing regimen for vancomycin.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the prescribing habits of vancomycin in the emergency department. During a 6-month time period, 1,734 doses of vancomycin were dispensed, and a subsequent random sample of 240 doses was reviewed. Data collection included age, gender, weight, creatinine clearance, vancomycin dose, and the indication for vancomycin therapy. Mean values, standard deviations, and ranges were computed to illustrate prescribing practices.

- **Results**: The mean vancomycin dose was 1,117 ± 325 mg. Based on actual body weight, the calculated mean dose was 14.6 ± 5.7 mg/kg. Only 19.6% (47 of 240) of all patients received an appropriate dose based on the recommended 15–20 mg/kg vancomycin dose.

- **Conclusions**: Our emergency department is inappropriately dosing vancomycin in the majority of patients. Educating clinicians regarding appropriate vancomycin dosing is recommended to achieve compliance with the latest consensus guidelines.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^1118k2Ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An initial dose ranging between 40 and 60 mg/kg/day divided q6–8 h is usually sufficient and safe for most pediatric patients. The serum blood level, obtained at a steady state just before the fourth dose, is used as a robust pharmacodynamic marker to ensure drug safety and efficacy. A trough level ranging between 10 and 15 mg/L is often required for general indications, while a higher level ranging between 15 and 20 mg/L is recommended for more complicated infections.

Due to the emergence of bacterial tolerance and resistance, higher doses are currently prescribed to achieve the target vancomycin trough concentration (7–10 mg/L), a level desired for the majority of mild-moderate infections precipitated by MRSA. Major organizations, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, endorse a total daily dose (TDD) of 60–80 mg/kg for children younger than 12 years old, and 60–70 mg/kg for children older than 12 years for MRSA strains with a MIC ≤ 1 mg/L.
