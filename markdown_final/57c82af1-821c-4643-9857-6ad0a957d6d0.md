## Question

Does inflammatory bowel disease always have elevated ESR or CRP markers?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether inflammatory bowel disease always shows elevated ESR or CRP, and how to interpret normal or discordant results in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ESR and CRP and why they might be normal despite active gut inflammation. Then, I should verify disease-specific differences between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Next, I will review guideline statements and high-quality evidence on false negatives and misclassification. After that, I should examine discordance between ESR and CRP and its clinical implications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and conclude with a clear answer to the question, making sure I double-check any numeric claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the biology and limitations of ESR and CRP. ESR is an indirect, slow-to-change marker influenced by fibrinogen and other acute-phase proteins, whereas CRP is a direct acute-phase reactant with a short half-life that rises and falls quickly with IL-6–driven hepatic synthesis. Neither is organ-specific, and both can be normal in the presence of localized mucosal inflammation, especially when the systemic inflammatory signal is modest or absent, which is not rare in IBD [^11687Evt] [^116gxDMn] [^114bVbYi].

> Now, I need to check disease-specific behavior. In Crohn's disease, CRP generally correlates better with activity than in ulcerative colitis, but even in CD, up to roughly a quarter of patients with active disease may have normal CRP, and the correlation weakens with isolated small-bowel disease or mild activity. In UC, the CRP response is characteristically blunted, and normal CRP is common even with endoscopic activity, particularly in limited or distal disease, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret a normal CRP as absence of inflammation [^11687Evt] [^116gxDMn] [^116BZDCh] [^1171usb2].

> Next, I should review the quantitative evidence on false negatives. Wait, let me verify the pediatric data first: in a cohort of 135 children, normal ESR/CRP were seen in up to 28% with CD and up to 42% with UC at diagnosis, which is substantial. In adults, guidelines note that up to 40% of patients with mild IBD inflammation can have normal CRP and ESR, reinforcing that normal markers do not exclude disease activity. And AGA evidence profiles show high false-negative rates for CRP when trying to rule out endoscopic activity, with FN rates around 21–26% depending on pretest probability, which is clinically important [^117ADqUB] [^114khZJE] [^1141vbqR] [^1154nECL].

> Hold on, I should verify discordance between ESR and CRP because clinicians often order both. In a large hospital series, ESR and CRP disagreed in about one-third of patients, with elevated ESR/normal CRP far more common than the reverse; mechanisms include noninflammatory drivers of ESR (age, anemia, renal disease, paraproteins) and the faster kinetics of CRP, so discordance alone should prompt me to interpret results in clinical context rather than assume inflammation or its absence [^114Zimnf].

> I will now examine special contexts that blunt CRP responses. Genetic polymorphisms affecting hepatic CRP synthesis can yield low CRP despite inflammation. Thiopurine therapy has been associated with persistent ESR elevation alongside normal CRP in clinically quiescent disease. And limited disease extent, especially distal UC or isolated ileal CD, may not generate a robust systemic acute-phase response, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on a normal CRP in these scenarios [^11687Evt] [^11572Hpx] [^1171usb2] [^116BZDCh].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to avoid overstatement. The AGA recommends against using ESR or CRP to screen for IBD in patients with chronic diarrhea because of limited diagnostic accuracy, and it emphasizes that normal CRP cannot reliably exclude moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation. ECCO/UC guidance integrates CRP and ESR into severity indices but treats them as adjuncts, not stand-alone arbiters of activity. And ACG notes that up to 40% with mild inflammation can have normal CRP/ESR, so I should not use normal values to dismiss active disease when suspicion is high [^112URHZp] [^112Ftipr] [^1171usb2] [^114khZJE].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and a practical approach. If symptoms and risk are high, I should not be reassured by normal CRP or ESR; instead, I should escalate to objective gut inflammation testing with fecal calprotectin, which outperforms serum markers for mucosal inflammation, and proceed to endoscopic or radiologic assessment when indicated; conversely, in low-risk settings, a very low CRP (for example ≤ 0.5 mg/dL) can reduce the probability of IBD, but it does not eliminate it, so shared decision-making and follow-up remain key [^113T3Wtr] [^115vQZeL] [^1157sTqz].

> But wait, what if the patient has UC with normal CRP — does that mean no inflammation? I should double-check that assumption. Multiple studies and reviews confirm that UC frequently shows a muted systemic acute-phase response, and even AGA UC guidance documents high false-negative rates for CRP in ruling out moderate to severe endoscopic activity, so normal CRP in UC is particularly unreliable and should not replace endoscopic or fecal marker assessment when clinical suspicion persists [^112Ftipr] [^114GazuU] [^115oZRct].

> Synthesis and answer: No, inflammatory bowel disease does not always have elevated ESR or CRP. Normal values are common enough to be clinically meaningful, with up to roughly 28–42% of children with IBD showing normal ESR/CRP at diagnosis and up to about 40% of adults with mild inflammation having normal markers, and false-negative CRP rates around 21–26% when trying to exclude endoscopic activity, so a normal ESR or CRP cannot rule out active IBD and must be interpreted alongside symptoms, disease phenotype, extent, and, when appropriate, fecal calprotectin and endoscopy [^117ADqUB] [^114khZJE] [^1141vbqR] [^1154nECL].

---

No, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) **does not always** show elevated ESR or CRP. Up to 28% of patients with Crohn's disease and 42% with ulcerative colitis may have normal ESR/CRP at diagnosis [^117ADqUB], especially with mild or localized disease [^114khZJE] [^116BZDCh]. ESR and CRP are **nonspecific markers** [^115oZRct] and can be normal in active disease, particularly in ulcerative colitis [^115XjKdv] or isolated small-bowel Crohn's disease [^116BZDCh]. Normal ESR/CRP does not exclude IBD [^112URHZp]; fecal calprotectin is more sensitive for intestinal inflammation [^113T3Wtr] and should be used when IBD is suspected [^113T3Wtr].

---

## Frequency of normal ESR and CRP in IBD

Studies show that normal ESR/CRP are **not rare** in IBD:

- **Pediatric IBD**: Normal ESR/CRP in 28% with Crohn's and 42% with ulcerative colitis at diagnosis [^117ADqUB].
- **Adult IBD**: Up to 40% with mild inflammation have normal ESR/CRP [^114khZJE].
- **UC**: CRP is less reliable; normal CRP is common even with active disease [^116gxDMn] [^115oZRct].

---

## Factors influencing ESR and CRP levels in IBD

Several factors explain **normal ESR/CRP** in active IBD:

| **Factor** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| Disease severity | Mild or localized disease may not raise ESR/CRP [^114khZJE] |
| Disease location | Small-bowel Crohn's often has normal CRP [^116BZDCh] |
| Individual variability | Genetic differences affect CRP production [^11687Evt] |
| Medications | Immunomodulators can normalize ESR/CRP despite activity [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and anemia can confound ESR/CRP [^115Z16b8] |

---

## Clinical implications of normal ESR and CRP in IBD

Normal ESR/CRP **do not exclude IBD** [^114khZJE] and may reflect mild or localized inflammation [^114khZJE]. Clinicians should **not rely on ESR/CRP alone** [^115oZRct]; fecal calprotectin is more sensitive for intestinal inflammation [^115nzM2s] and should be used when IBD is suspected [^113T3Wtr].

---

## Alternative biomarkers and clinical assessments

Given the limitations of ESR/CRP, **additional biomarkers and clinical assessments** are recommended:

- **Fecal calprotectin**: Highly sensitive for intestinal inflammation; preferred when IBD is suspected [^113T3Wtr] [^115vQZeL].
- **Fecal lactoferrin**: Useful for detecting intestinal inflammation [^113T3Wtr] [^115LxpMm].
- **Endoscopy**: Gold standard for diagnosing and assessing IBD activity [^113Dgew4] [^1161cRYP].
- **Clinical assessment**: Symptoms, endoscopic findings, and histology remain essential [^117NmNr4] [^111BCzpz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize the **limited utility of ESR/CRP** in IBD:

- **AGA**: Do not use ESR/CRP alone to screen for IBD [^112URHZp]; use fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin when available [^112URHZp].
- **ACG**: ESR/CRP can be normal in up to 40% with mild inflammation; interpret cautiously [^114khZJE].
- **WSES-AAST**: Use CRP and ESR with other labs and clinical assessment in acute settings [^111HHMop] [^1176HT4Q].

---

## Conclusion

IBD **does not always** show elevated ESR or CRP; normal values occur in a significant minority, especially with mild or localized disease [^117ADqUB] [^114khZJE]. ESR/CRP are adjuncts, not replacements, for clinical, endoscopic, and histologic assessment; fecal calprotectin is more sensitive for intestinal inflammation and should be used when IBD is suspected [^113T3Wtr] [^11687Evt].

Ulcerative colitis — serum C-reactive protein (CRP) performance indicates that using an elevated CRP cutoff (generally > 5 mg/L) in a high pretest probability scenario yields an FP rate of approximately 3.4% and normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) has an FN rate of 31.4%, whereas in an intermediate pretest scenario the FP rate of elevated CRP is 11.5% and the FN rate of normal CRP is 18.5%; certainty ratings report moderate certainty of evidence supporting the use of elevated CRP to rule in moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation in a high pretest probability scenario, low certainty to rule in at intermediate probability, and very low certainty to use normal CRP to rule out due to unacceptably high FN and very serious inconsistency.

Evaluation for gastrointestinal blood loss and anemia uses hemoglobin/hematocrit, and mean cell volume (MCV) distinguishes chronic disease (low MCV) from acute processes (normal MCV). Serum albumin is often low in newly diagnosed or flaring IBD, and liver function tests — alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) — can be elevated.

### A novel inflammatory biomarker in assessing disease activity in ulcerative colitis: gasdermin D [^115oUvEq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the rectum and varying segments of colon. The worldwide prevalance is estimated to be around 5 million patients as of 2023, with increasing incidence. Assessment of disease activity is crucial in management of UC patients. While colonoscopy is the mainstay modality for both diagnosis and follow-up of the disease, several biomarkers are used in daily practice to determine disease activity non-invasively such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), c-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) count.

Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a protein which belongs to the gasdermin protein family and plays a role in inflammatory cell death, pyroptosis. GSDMD activation has been shown to be related to inflammatory states in a variety of disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases.

Given the role of GSDMD in inflammation, we hypothesized that serum GSDMD levels of UC patients may be linked to disease activity; thereby revealing a potential new inflammatory serum marker for assessing disease activity and severity in UC patients in a non-invasive manner.

### Platelet / albumin ratio and plateletcrit levels are potential new biomarkers for assessing endoscopic inflammatory bowel disease severity [^113Dgew4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is characterized by recurrent or persistent inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract which may cause digestive disability and result from genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. IBD symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloody stools. Frequent disease activity monitoring is crucial for patients with IBD, as it ensures prompt therapeutic strategies and improves prognosis and quality of life.

Endoscopy is widely considered the gold standard for diagnosing UC and CD, prognosticating disease severity, and more recently, evaluating mucosal response to therapy. Several endoscopy scoring systems have been established to classify IBD activity, including Mayo endoscopic subscores for UC and Simple Endoscopic Score for CD (SES-CD). Although costly and limited by its invasiveness, endoscopy remains the most reliable approach for monitoring patient progress over time. Non-endoscopic indices, including the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) for UC and the Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) for CD, are responsive scores with clear definitions indicating clinical responses and remission information. However, they do not correlate well with intestinal inflammation. Therefore, ideal noninvasive markers must be identified to reflect endoscopic IBD activity.

Different studies have suggested that some noninvasive and low cost biomarkers can accurately monitor IBD activity. Faecal calprotectin (FCP) is a reliable biomarker for evaluating endoscopic disease activity in IBD. However, FCP has not routinely been used in some countries and regions. Some patients may forget or be reluctant to perform this test. High sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels are commonly used to assess clinical disease activity in IBD, however, their roles determining mucosal inflammation levels remain controversial. A recent study reported that fibrinogen (FIB) was a valuable biomarker identifying active stage IBD. Platelets (PLT) have essential roles in UC and CD pathogenesis and may be better predictive markers for endoscopic IBD activity when compared with CRP and ESR. For serum albumin (ALB), apart from its traditional role in nutrition, it is widely recognized as a negative acute phase protein, with ALB levels directly affected by acute infection severity. A recent study reported that ALB levels had high sensitivity and specificity for potential CD.

### Peripheral blood T-lymphocyte subsets are potential biomarkers of disease severity and clinical outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis: a retrospective study [^113WppGj]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic recurrent inflammation of colon and rectum. UC is considered a progressive disease and approximately 20% UC patients may require hospitalization because of severe disease activity and 10%-15% are at risk of colectomy during the disease course. The long-standing intestinal inflammation increases the risk of dysplasia and colonic carcinogenesis of UC patients. Therefore, maintaining long-term remission and avoiding disease recurrence is of great importance in reducing complications and improving prognosis in UC patients. These goals emphasize the need to monitor the disease severity and predict upcoming exacerbations of disease for UC patients timely and accurately in order to choose the optimal treatment regimen. Colonoscopy combined with pathological biopsy is considered the crucial standard for evaluating the severity of UC. However, the invasive procedure of endoscopy may cause painful experience and is associated with a risk of perforation, especially in severely active UC patients, limiting its application in frequent disease activity monitoring. Therefore, non-invasive biomarkers are needed for serially assessing disease severity and detecting an imminent flare. There have been several studies explored the value of serum and fecal inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fecal calprotectin, for assessing disease activity and prognosis in UC patients. But the sensitivities and specificities of these markers still remain highly controversial, as well as the high cost and lack of standard quality control of fecal calprotectin also limit their use in clinic. Therefore, practical and accurate biomarkers for disease severity and prognostic assessment are urgently needed in UC patients.

CRP in assessing treatment response

As above, a significant proportion of patients with CD will not mount an elevated CRP despite endoscopically and clinically active disease, and CRP is therefore not a useful monitoring tool in these patients. Overall, a persistently elevated CRP is associated with therapy failure, whereas a fall in CRP is correlated with clinical response. For patients in remission, a prospective 2010 study found that CRP can predict relapse but it was less sensitive and specific compared to FCP in this role. It has also been demonstrated that even in asymptomatic individuals, persistently elevated CRP is associated with a higher rate of hospitalization. A persisting CRP can therefore be an indicator that further assessment and consideration of treatment modification may be required in CD.

In patients with moderate to severe UC, data suggest that CRP correlates with response to therapy. A 3-year follow-up study of 72 patients with a partial Mayo score (PMS) of 4–9 who were initiated on infliximab found that responders, defined as a PMS ≤ 2 at week 14, had a significantly lower CRP at week 2 compared to partial and non-responders.CRP appears to be less effective in predicting relapse, with a study of 74 patients with clinically and endoscopically inactive UC demonstrating that remission CRP was not predictive of those who would flare.

CRP in the prediction of post-operative recurrence

There is conflicting data with regard to the ability of CRP to predict post-operative recurrence in CD. A 2010 study found that persistently elevated CRP was associated with post-operative recurrence in a small cohort of 12 patients. However, as discussed earlier, this persistent CRP may simply reflect a more aggressive and severe disease which is known to be a risk factor for post-operative recurrence. Conversely, a 2011 study of 24 patients with CD who were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo post-operatively found that whilst there was a general trend between elevated CRP and relapse, there was no statistical correlation between CRP and endoscopically disease recurrence as assessed by the Rutgeerts score. Given this conflicting data and small study cohorts, clinical, endoscopic and radiological investigation assessment remains essential in this patient group.

### The utility of biomarkers in the diagnosis and therapy of inflammatory bowel disease [^111BCzpz]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Fecal and serologic biomarkers can be used in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal markers such as calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied for their ability to identify patients with IBD, assess disease activity, and predict relapse. Antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic proteins have been used in diagnosis of IBD, to distinguish Crohn's disease (CD) from ulcerative colitis, and to predict the risk of complications of CD. Tests for C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate have been used to assess inflammatory processes and predict the course of IBD progression. Levels of drug metabolites and antibodies against therapeutic agents might be measured to determine why patients do not respond to therapy and to select alternative treatments. This review addresses the potential for biomarker assays to improve treatment strategies and challenges to their use and development.

### Clinical impacts of immunomodulator withdrawal from anti-tumor necrosis factor combination therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^111cE57y]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Combination therapy consists of both anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and an immunomodulator (IMM) and has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study assesses the impacts of IMM withdrawal from combination therapy to anti-TNF monotherapy in children with IBD.

Methods

This single-center retrospective cohort study included children with IBD initiated on combination therapy between 2014 and 2019 who discontinued the IMM. We evaluated whether IMM withdrawal impacts laboratory values and disease activity. Linear mixed effects models with random intercepts were used to compare differences between groups. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for comparisons between patients who did and did not require subsequent escalation of therapy.

Results

One hundred and fifty-two patients discontinued the IMM which did not significantly affect disease activity. However, 18% of patients escalated therapy after IMM withdrawal, primarily due to low anti-TNF levels. Lower anti-TNF and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels before IMM withdrawal were associated with subsequent escalation of therapy. Overall, there was no statistically significant effect on anti-TNF drug levels. Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) on infliximab (IFX) and methotrexate (MTX) who discontinued the IMM had an increase in mean ESR and CRP (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

IMM withdrawal from anti-TNF combination therapy may be considered safe in the setting of higher anti-TNF levels and normal serum inflammatory markers. Clinicians should consider assessing anti-TNF levels and inflammatory markers after IMM withdrawal, especially in patients with CD receiving IFX who discontinued MTX.

### Correlation of C-reactive protein with clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and radiographic activity in inflammatory bowel disease [^111oLFyq]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

We sought to examine the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and radiographic activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Methods

All IBD patients at our institution between January 2002 and August 2003 who had a CRP, colonoscopy, and either small bowel follow-through (SBFT) or CT enterography (CTE) performed within 14 days were identified. Clinical activity was assessed retrospectively through review of the medical record. Logistic regression was used in Crohn's disease (CD) patients to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals for an elevated CRP. Associations were assessed using Fisher exact test in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients due to small sample size.

Results

One-hundred four CD patients (46% males) and 43 UC and indeterminate colitis patients (44% males) were identified. In CD patients, moderate-severe clinical activity (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.1–18.3), active disease at colonoscopy (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4–8.9), and histologically severe inflammation (OR, 10.6; 95% CI; 1.1–104) were all significantly associated with CRP elevation. Abnormal small bowel radiographic imaging was not significantly associated with CRP elevation. In UC patients, CRP elevation was significantly associated with severe clinical activity, elevation in sedimentation rate, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and active disease at ileocolonoscopy, but not with histologic inflammation.

Conclusions

CRP elevation in IBD patients is associated with clinical disease activity, endoscopic inflammation, severely active histologic inflammation (in CD patients), and several other biomarkers of inflammation, but not with radiographic activity.

5.2.7.2 Stopping anti-TNF therapy

Statement 96. We suggest that anti-TNF therapy may be withdrawn in patients with prolonged corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing. Retreatment in the event of relapse is usually successful, but there is insufficient evidence about which clinical factors predict relapse after withdrawal and decisions should be individualised (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.2%).

From studies assessing outcomes of stopping therapy after at least 12 months of anti-TNF therapy, the estimated relapse rate at 1 year was 39% for Crohn's and 35% for UC/IBD-U. The estimated relapse rates at 2 years were 54% for Crohn's disease and 42% for UC/IBD-U. Among patients relapsing and retreated with anti-TNF, the estimated chances of success were 88% for Crohn's disease and 76% for UC/IBD-U. Various models to predict chance of relapse have been proposed. The clinical factors associated with relapse, however, vary between studies. Younger age, smoking, longer disease duration, fistulising perianal Crohn's disease, anaemia, raised CRP and raised faecal calprotectin are linked with increased risk of relapse. Mucosal healing (and in some studies low serum drug levels) are associated with a lower risk of relapse. Patients receiving escalated dosages of anti-TNFs or for the indication of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease had a > 75% risk of relapse on drug withdrawal. Persistent abnormalities on MRE in Crohn's disease patients in endoscopic remission also makes relapse more likely. Decisions regarding withdrawal should be taken in the context of the individual patient, their disease history and the consequences of relapse. Patient profiles favouring treatment withdrawal include: older patients without previous complications, surgery and with no evidence of active inflammation, those with comorbidities increasing their infection risk, those with undetectable trough drug levels and other practical reasons mitigating against continuing injections or infusions. There is no safe minimum period of corticosteroid-free remission, but at least 1–2 years seems reasonable. The concept of cyclical biologics use (stopping when deep remission is established and restarting in the event of pre-clinical relapse) has been introduced, but there is no evidence as yet that this is safe or cost-effective. All the published data so far come from prospective and retrospective cohort studies such as the STORI study. Data on outcomes after withdrawal of newer biologics are awaited.

### C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammatory bowel disease [^112tsF9V]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The production of CRP occurs almost exclusively in the liver by the hepatocytes as part of the acute phase response upon stimulation by IL-6, TNF-alphaand IL-1-betaoriginating at the site of inflammation. Its short half-life makes CRP a valuable marker to detect and follow up disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). In contrast, ulcerative colitis has only a modest to absent CRP response despite active inflammation, and the reason for this is unknown. In CD, serum levels of CRP correlate well with disease activity and with other markers of inflammation as the CDAI, serum amyloid, IL-6 and faecal calprotectin. CRP is a valuable marker for predicting the outcome of certain diseases as coronary heart disease and haematological malignancies. An increased CRP (> 45 mg/L) in patients with IBD predicts with a high certainty the need for colectomy and this by reflecting severe ongoing and uncontrollable inflammation in the gut. Finally, trials with anti-TNF and anti-adhesion molecules have shown that a high CRP predicts better response to these drugs. However, whether we need to include CRP as an inclusion criterion for future trials with biologicals is still a matter of debate.

### Discordant erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in children with inflammatory bowel disease taking azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine [^11572Hpx]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by periods of relapse and remission. Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms during relapse and prolonging the duration of remissions. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its prodrug azathioprine (AZA) are commonly used to prolong clinical remissions. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are two widely used laboratory markers of inflammation. The authors observed an unexplained discordance between ESR and CRP in children with asymptomatic IBD who were being treated with AZA or 6-MP.

Objective

To characterize children with IBD in remission treated with 6-MP or AZA who have persistently elevated ESR but normal CRP.

Methods

All patients seen in Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2002, with Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis who received AZA or 6-MP continuously for at least 6 months were identified and their medical records reviewed.

Results

One hundred twenty patients met the eligibility criteria. Twelve had an ESR > 18 mm/hour on at least three occasions during at least 12 consecutive months with a simultaneous CRP < 0.8 mg/dL. Eleven of these 12 had no signs or symptoms of active disease and had Pediatric Crohn Disease Activity Index scores < 10 for at least 12 consecutive months while the ESR was elevated. Disease duration was similar in the 11 children with asymptomatic disease and with discordant ESR and CRP and in 108 children with concordant ESR and CRP (69.2 + 22.5 months v 54.3 ± 40.1 months, P = 0.0709). Duration of AZA or 6-MP therapy was greater in the 11 children with asymptomatic disease and discordant ESR and CRP than in those with or without symptoms and with concordant ESR and CRP (58.1 ± 16.4 months v 36.6 ± 24.1 months, P = 0.0043). There were no differences between the groups with respect to diagnosis, location of disease, or age at onset of symptoms. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was somewhat larger in the children with discordant ESR and CRP than in the children with concordant ESR and CRP (91.4 ± 6.97 fL v 87.0 ± 7.07 fL, respectively, P = 0.0373); however, in both groups, the MCV was in the normal range. There were no significant differences in hematocrit, white blood cell count, serum albumin, total serum protein, or estimated serum globulin between the groups.

Conclusions

The results suggest that among children treated with AZA or 6-MP, CRP may be a more reliable indirect indicator of inflammation than ESR. This report alerts clinicians that some children taking AZA or 6-MP may have persistent elevation of the ESR with a normal CRP and have no clinical evidence of active disease.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory condition that affects the gastrointestinal tract. While the etiology of IBD remains unclear, it is thought to involve a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, gut microbiota composition and dysregulated immune responses. In IBD, the gut mucosa is heavily infiltrated by cytokine‐producing effector T cells 1 and immunoglobulin‐producing plasma cells 2. The invading T cells have an activated phenotype that is associated with the production of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th17 cytokines 1, 3, 4. Immunoglobulin (Ig)‐producing cells of all isotypes are increased in density, especially the IgG‐producing plasma cells. Among the IgA‐producing cells, those that produce IgA1 and monomeric IgA are selectively increased in density 5. Systemic markers of inflammation may also be present, exemplified by acute‐phase reactants such as C‐reactive protein (CRP), orosomucoid and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 6. The numbers of blood leukocytes and thrombocytes may be increased in patients with IBD due to cytokine‐driven acceleration of bone marrow synthesis 6, 7. Conversely, the levels of serum albumin and blood hemoglobin may decrease as a function of the acute‐phase reaction 8 and/or due to the loss of blood and proteins across the inflamed gut wall.

IBD encompasses two major subcategories: ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis the intestinal inflammatory infiltrate is restricted to the colonic mucosa, while in Crohn's disease it may occur at any site along the gastrointestinal tract and often involves the entire gut wall 9. Granulomas, i.e. aggregates of activated macrophages some of which coalesce into multi‐nucleate giant cells, are a hallmark of Crohn's disease, but they are not found in all patients with the disease 10.

Numerous studies have investigated the potential differences in immune effector mechanisms between the two subcategories of IBD. Although IgG‐producing plasma cells are markedly increased in the inflamed gut mucosa in both diseases, IgG1‐producing cells appear to be particularly increased in ulcerative colitis, whereas IgG2‐producing plasma cells are present in increased proportions in Crohn's disease 11, 12. Regarding T cell phenotypes, global gene expression studies of inflamed mucosa have shown very similar patterns in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, characterized by Th1/Th17 differentiation and a low level of Th2 differentiation 4.

### The utility of apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages as a possible diagnostic marker in patients with Crohn's disease [^111MXhQe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic intestinal disorders of unclear etiology. The incidence of both conditions is increasing globally, and it is suggested that disease risk correlates with environmental changes. Although the etiology of IBD remains unknown, it is thought to be strongly associated with the microbiome and the environmental factors that influence the microbiome. Intestinal macrophages influence local homeostasis and help maintain a balance between commensal microbiota and the host. Additionally, intestinal macrophages play essential roles in intestinal inflammation. As a result, disorders of intestinal macrophages may cause unbalanced immune responses to commensal bacteria and lead to the development of chronic intestinal inflammation. These macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of IBDs such as CD.

The diagnosis of IBD is based on endoscopic, histologic and radiologic criteria. Disease activity in IBD is determined using both direct and non-invasive laboratory markers. However, endoscopy is still the gold standard diagnostic test, even though it is invasive. Several serological markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and platelet count or fecal calprotectin have been reported to be useful for diagnosing IBD and assessing disease activity and response to therapy. An ideal marker for IBD would have high disease specificity, predictive ability for relapse of disease activity, and is cheap and noninvasive. Currently, several serologic markers have been suggested as useful for the diagnosis, differentiation, and better comprehension of the pathogenesis of IBD. Among them, anti- Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies have been reported to be useful serum biomarkers for CD and UC, respectively. ASCA has a low positivity rate of between 38.3 and 45.6% in CD patients, but there is low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CD. A definite diagnosis is necessary for properly choosing clinical follow-up and suitable therapies. However, some IBD cases share several endoscopic and histologic features with both CD and UC; these are defined as indeterminate colitis. Therefore there is still a need in clinical settings for IBD markers with high sensitivity and specificity.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^11182Eee]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Risk factors and clinical relevance of anemia in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease include markers of inflammation, nutritional status, disease extent, and sex, and anemia may reflect disease activity. Low albumin, high C reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values, low body mass index (BMI), acute onset with severe disease at presentation, and extensive colitis in children were most significant, and severe anemia was more common in girls while gender differences were not seen with mild anemia. Additional risk factors included diagnosis of CD versus UC, extensive disease in UC, or colonic CD at diagnosis. Anemia and iron deficiency can serve as objective measures of underlying disease activity in IBD and may be the only signs of ongoing active disease, and persistent or recurrent anemia may also be associated with a more severe phenotype.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^113T3Wtr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome — exclusion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in suspected IBS with diarrhea uses serologic and fecal inflammatory markers. We suggest that either fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin and C-reactive protein be checked in patients without alarm features and with suspected IBS and diarrhea symptoms to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are most commonly used to exclude IBD in IBS-D but are nonspecific; a comprehensive meta-analysis of serologic markers in 2,145 subjects found that a CRP ≤ 0.5 mg/dL yielded a low probability of IBD with good accuracy. At all cutoffs for fecal calprotectin (fCal), the negative predictive value as a screening tool is superior to CRP and ESR; a meta-analysis comparing fCal with endoscopy showed sensitivity 93% (CI 85%–97%) and specificity 96% (79%–99%). Fecal lactoferrin (FL) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay shows sensitivity 67%–86%, specificity 96%–100%, positive predictive value 92%–100%, and negative predictive value 80%–87% for active IBD vs IBS. The pretest probability of IBD is reported to be 0.5%–1.2%, and in the absence of alarm symptoms the prevalence of IBD in IBS is low; however, after 5 years of symptoms, the incidence is 2.6–5 times higher than in controls.

### Correlation between levels of C-reactive protein and clinical activity in Crohn's disease [^113zq5i9]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the factors associated with an increased C-reactive protein level in Crohn's disease patients and to seek a correlation between the C-reactive protein value and the Crohn's disease activity index.

Methods

We prospectively studied 103 Crohn's disease patients, 76% of whose disease was active at the time of inclusion. C-reactive protein measurement was carried out on all patients. An increased C-reactive protein level was defined as ≥ 10mg/L.

Results

The median C-reactive protein rate was 53.9mg/L (ranging from 1 to 228mg/L). An increased C-reactive protein was found in 77 patients (75%). By univariate analysis, ileocolic localization, severity of the flare, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocyte and platelet count, fibrinogen, albumin, serum calcium and Crohn's disease activity index were found to be associated to elevated C-reactive protein values. By multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with an increased C-reactive protein level were: ileocolic localization (p = 0.02; OR [95% CI]: 2.84 [1.25–9.52]) and moderate or severe disease activity (p = 0.001; OR [95% CI]: 4.20 [1.92–8.64]). A statistically significant association between the Crohn's disease activity index score and the C-reactive protein level was found in our study (r = 0.302; p = 0.001). The optimal C-reactive protein threshold value that separates patients with moderate to severe disease (Crohn's disease activity index > 220) from the others was calculated to be 19mg/L with a sensitivity of 76.4% and a specificity of 56.2%.

Conclusion

The C-reactive protein level is correlated to disease activity in Crohn's disease. Its role seems to be essential in predicting moderate and severe disease activity.

### Serum serotonin differentiates between disease activity States in Crohn's patients [^112aHgwN]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Currently, monitoring disease states and response to medications in IBDs consists mainly of invasive methods such as endoscopy, colonoscopy, and tissue biopsy. Although noninvasive markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and fecal calprotectin may be useful, they are nonspecific to inflammation in the gut and may be elevated in other disease processes. Serum markers such as CRP and ESR are sensitive markers for inflammation, but conditions such as bacterial infections, viral infections, and even anemia can make their interpretation vexing. This is consistent with our inability to show a difference in CRP levels among both UC and CD patients in different disease states. Furthermore, CRP has been noted to have different responses in IBDs with higher concentration being noted in CD patients when compared with UC. Fecal calprotectin is more sensitive than serum markers for detection of gut inflammation, but increased levels have also been noted in gastrointestinal infections, neoplasia, and polyps, further reaffirming the need to explore novel markers of disease activity in IBDs. The data presented in the current study demonstrate elevated serum levels of 5-HT in active CD and provide evidence that 5-HT can discriminate between disease activity states in CD better than CRP. Interestingly, UC patients did not show this augmentation in 5-HT levels compared with remission or refractory disease. Our studies further provide a potential mechanism linking elevated 5-HT levels with a decrease in epithelial SERT protein in the ileum and colon of patients with active CD.

As mentioned previously, only few studies have measured circulating 5-HT in IBD patients. Our finding of increased plasma 5-HT in active CD is consistent with the results of Shajib et al who showed an overall elevated plasma 5-HT in CD patients when compared with levels in healthy controls, and an elevation in 5-HT in CD patients experiencing symptoms when compared with CD patients not experiencing symptoms. Interestingly, they also found that circulating 5-HT levels were similar in CD patients without symptoms and healthy subjects, which supports our utilization of patients in remission as a control group for comparison. Our findings were also similar to those of Sikander et al, showing no difference in serum 5-HT between active UC and remission. However, it is important to note that they showed slightly elevated 5-HT in active UC when compared with a healthy control.

### Evaluation of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio as potential markers for ulcerative colitis: a retrospective study [^115XjKdv]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease affecting the large intestine. It is characterized by relapsing mucosal inflammation. The aim of treatment is to induce and maintain disease remission. Assessing disease activity may help in optimizing the management of UC patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and fecal calprotectin (FC) are frequently used for activity assessment of UC. These markers are nonspecific and may be influenced by other causes of inflammation. Some patients with severely active UC may have a normal CRP or ESR.

Recently, hematological parameters neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been reported as inflammation indicators. They are helpful in assessing severity of many chronic diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic echinococcosis, rheumatoid arthritis and many inflammatory diseases. Growing evidence also suggested that increased NLR or PLR indicates poor prognosis and/or survival for multiple cancers. It is reported that elevated pre-treatment NLR is related to shorter overall survival and progression free survival. Several studies have indicated that the level of NLR and PLR was elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

NLR and PLR can be easily derived from the complete blood count, which is simple and cheap. Several studies indicated NLR and PLR could be used to evaluate UC severity. However, these results are mainly based on a relatively small number of patients. These studies did not explore the correlation between NLR, PLR and FC. FC can be used as a non-invasive stool biomarker, we estimate the association between PLR or NLR with FC in this study. We aimed to compare the NLR and PLR of patients with UC during remission and active phase. Furthermore, the correlation of PLR or NLR with other clinical indicators was examined.

American College of Gastroenterology Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index — disease activity strata use stool frequency, bleeding, urgency, hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (μg/g), and endoscopic scores (Mayo Endoscopic Subscore [MES], Ulcerative colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity [UCEIS]). Stools per day are Formed stools in remission, < 4 in mild, > 6 in moderate–severe, and > 10 in fulminant; blood in stools is None in remission, Intermittent in mild, Frequent in moderate–severe, and Continuous in fulminant; and urgency is None in remission, Mild, occasional in mild, Often in moderate–severe, and Continuous in fulminant. Hemoglobin is Normal in remission and mild, < 75% of normal in moderate–severe, and Transfusion required in fulminant. ESR is < 30 in remission and mild and > 30 in moderate–severe and fulminant. CRP (mg/L) is Normal in remission and Elevated in mild, moderate–severe, and fulminant disease. Fecal calprotectin is < 150–200 in remission and > 150–200 in mild, moderate–severe, and fulminant. Endoscopy thresholds are MES 0–1, 1, 2–3, and 3; and UCEIS 0–1, 2–4, 5–8, and 7–8 for remission, mild, moderate–severe, and fulminant, respectively.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^115qTVdr]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic accuracy and pretest probability impact: Across 15 studies evaluating serum CRP for detecting moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, reported single-cutoff performance spanned 1.2–73 mg/L with summary sensitivity 63% (95% CI, 50%–75%) and specificity 77% (95% CI, 67%–84%). In a low pretest probability setting (rectal bleeding score 0 and stool frequency score 0 or 1, 15% prevalence), using elevated CRP (generally > 5 mg/L) yields approximately 5.5% false negatives with normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) and false positives of 19.5%. In an intermediate pretest probability setting (e.g., stool frequency score 2 or 3, 50% prevalence), elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L) has false positives of 11.5%.

### The role of C-reactive protein as an inflammatory marker in gastrointestinal diseases [^116gxDMn]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that is produced in large amounts by hepatocytes, upon stimulation by the cytokines interleukin-6, tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, during an acute-phase response. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and, in gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease and acute pancreatitis, its levels correlate well with clinical disease activity. In contrast to its use as a marker in Crohn's disease, however, CRP is a less reliable marker of inflammation and disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis, except perhaps for severe, extensive colitis. The increased production of CRP after an acute-phase stimulus, such as active gut inflammation, might explain why strong anti-inflammatory agents, such as anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha antibodies and other biologic agents, work particularly well in patients with increased levels of CRP. CRP is also useful as a laboratory marker to predict prognosis and relapse in patients with Crohn's disease and acute pancreatitis. Elevated CRP levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and are a marker of poor prognosis, indicating more advanced disease and, possibly, reduced survival. An important question that remains is how often CRP levels should be measured. Until there are more data, the use of CRP and of other biomarkers should be seen as an additional tool that aids clinical observation and physical examination, but that cannot replace it.

### Monitoring inflammatory bowel disease activity: when, how, and why [^11363h6j]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Unstructured Abstract

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are disorders caused by inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract leading to a wide variety of symptoms. The presence of symptoms may not always correlate with active intestinal inflammation and the lack of symptoms does not always indicate control of inflammation. Due to the variable correlation between clinical symptoms and active intestinal inflammation, the targets for IBD management have been updated to include objective measures of inflammation to complement clinical endpoints. In addition to clinical remission, these targets include improvements in biochemical markers and endoscopic measures to objectively measure and monitor disease remission. In this review, we will discuss the different strategies for assessing disease activity and the timing of evaluation for each treatment target for outpatient IBD care. We will also highlight the role of radiographic assessment with a focus on intestinal ultrasound for monitoring these treatment endpoints.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and thromboembolic events: a C' lot to learn [^114gkPut]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a variety of extraintestinal manifestations including arterial and venous thromboembolism. Research evidences that IBD patients have about a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism when compared with the general population.

Objectives

We intended to evaluate the coagulation parameters and the prevalence of thromboembolic events (TE) in IBD patients. It was also our aim to investigate the correlation between coagulation parameters and disease phenotype and activity in this population.

Methods

This single center prospective observational study was performed between November 2016 and April 2020. The cohort included patients with 18years of age or older, diagnosed with IBD and followed at a gastroenterology consultation, during a follow-up period of 36months. Patients were evaluated in terms of IBD type, extent and disease behavior, clinical scores of IBD activity, medication, smoking history, family and personal history of TE, coagulation parameters, fecal calprotectin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hospitalization due to TE, IBD-related hospitalization or surgery, pregnancy, or diagnosis of malignancy.

Results

The study included 149 IBD patients (67 males and 82 females). Coagulation parameters were similar in CD and UC patients and only plasminogen was increased in CD patients [97.4 (17.0) versus 91.6 (13.3), p = 0.035], when comparing with UC patients. The determined values were in the range of the reference values described in literature for the standard population. During the follow-up period, none of the patients experienced a TE that demanded hospitalization.

Conclusion

In our study, acquired and inherited risk factors for TE and changes in coagulation parameters did not show to influence prothrombotic predisposition in IBD patients. As such, the clinical relevance of measuring coagulation parameters in this population is questionable.

### Favorable impact of long-term exercise on disease symptoms in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^112jU9Fr]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Evidence is growing that both short- and long-term physical exercise have the potential to positively impact on the physiological system related to inflammatory indices, though, such patterns are unknown for pediatric patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The aim of the present intervention study was to investigate the influence of a single bout and chronic moderate-intensity exercise on IBD-related inflammatory indices and exercise capacity among pediatric individuals with IBD and healthy controls.

Method

Twenty-one pediatric patients with IBD, split into a "remission-group" (IBD-RE; n = 14) and an "active disease group" (IBD-AD; n = 7), were compared to 23 age matched healthy controls (HC). All participants completed a single bout of exercise at baseline and an 8-week exercise intervention. Before and after the single bout of exercise IBD-related inflammatory indices (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, hemoglobin, hematocrit, thrombocytes and leukocytes) were assessed.

Results

At baseline, after a single bout of exercise, inflammation (albumin, hemoglobin, erythrocytes, hematocrit and leukocytes) increased in all three groups IBD-AD, IBD-RE and HC. CRP and thrombocytes were only elevated in IBD-AD and IBD-RE, compared to HC. After a longer-term exercise intervention, ESR, CRP and thrombocytes significantly decreased in all groups. The longer-term exercise intervention did not decrease acute immunopathologic responses after a single bout of exercise, compared to baseline.

Conclusion

Whereas a single bout of exercise increases albumin, erythrocytes and leukocytes, longer-term moderate-intensity exercise reduced inflammatory markers in pediatric patients with IBD. Children and teenagers with IBD should be encouraged to engage in regular moderate-intensity exercise activities, as such activities may contribute to inflammation suppression and improved disease management.

### Laboratory markers in IBD: useful, magic, or unnecessary toys? [^115oZRct]. Gut (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory markers have been investigated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) for diagnostic and differential diagnostic purposes, for assessment of disease activity and risk of complications, for prediction of relapse, and for monitoring the effect of therapy. The introduction of biological therapies in IBD has renewed interest in inflammatory markers (especially C reactive protein (CRP)), given their potential to select responders to these treatments. Of all the laboratory markers, CRP is the most studied and has been shown to have the best overall performance. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and correlates well with disease activity in Crohn's disease (CD). Increased CRP levels are associated with better response rates and normal CRP levels predict high placebo response rates in clinical trials with biologicals. However, despite the advantages of CRP over other markers, it is still far from ideal. Furthermore, CRP correlates less well with disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) as compared with CD. Other laboratory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leucocyte and platelet count, albumin, and 1 acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), have been studied either less extensively in IBD or have proven to be less useful than CRP. Faecal markers seem promising and may be more specific in detecting gut inflammation in patients with established IBD. Promising results have been reported with the use of faecal calprotectin in CD as well as in UC. Recent data however suggest that the performance of the faecal calprotectin test is superior for UC than for CD. Taken together, laboratory markers are useful and should be part of the global management of our IBD patients. They are however not magic and until more data become available, the use of CRP and other laboratory markers should be seen as an additive tool to clinical observation and physical examination rather than a replacement.

### Predictive accuracy of fecal calprotectin in assessing clinical activity and disease severity in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease [^1161cRYP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease is a disorder characterized by repeated relapses and remissions. According to an IBD burden estimate, there are 0.27 million cases in India in 2019, almost double the number in 1990–0.13 million. In resource constrained settings, there are still challenges in diagnosis, evaluating disease activity and severity, prognostication, and treatment.

The most common method for monitoring patients is with IBD is endoscopy. multiple grading systems are available to monitor endoscopic activity in IBD. The most often utilized are the basic endoscopic grading in Crohn's disease and the Ulcerative Colitis endoscopic index of severity. Endoscopy is a time consuming, expensive, and invasive procedure. Moreover, intestinal lavage prior to endoscopic procedure is uncomfortable for patients. Given these facts, non-invasive markers for measuring disease activity in IBD patients would be an invaluable.

The measurement of disease activity is critical for monitoring response and guiding treatment. While invasive and expensive, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy and histology of tissue biopsy samples is the gold standard both for diagnosing IBD and for follow up of the disease. Despite this, researchers have been attempting to identify a non-invasive test (NIT) for IBD for several reasons. Firstly, as symptoms do not always accurately reflect disease activity an objective measure of disease activity is required. Secondly, an accurate NIT would spare the patient the stress and discomfort of an invasive procedure. The ideal marker would be easy to administer, quick to complete, affordable, and would have results which are consistent across patients and laboratories. It would also bespecific to the disease in question and would perhaps be able to identify people at risk for the illness as well. It would be able to identify signs of disease activity and determine the effectiveness of treatment. It would add diagnostic information too. So far, the commonly used NIT tests - CRP and ESR - are sensitive or specific enough. Calprotectin, a faecal marker that is secreted by myelomonocytic cells, has antibacterial and anti-proliferative properties, and regulates the inflammatory process. Calprotectin is secreted into the GIT during mucosal inflammation and is a useful marker for detecting intestinal inflammation. It has been proposed that fecal calprotectin could as a non-invasive test monitoring patients with IBD.

Published literature from India about the utility of fecal calprotectin as an NIT to monitor IBD is scanty. Hence in this study we aimed to determine the utility of faecal calprotectin to measure the clinical and endoscopic disease severity in IBD.

### A simple biological score for predicting low risk of short-term relapse in Crohn's disease [^116DEzBe]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In Crohn's disease, studies have evaluated the ability of biological markers to predict relapse in the next 12 to 18 months, without differentiating early from late relapses. The aim of this study was to look for biological markers of short-term relapse.

Materials and Methods

In a previous therapeutic trial, patients with a medically induced clinical remission had biological markers evaluated and updated every 6 weeks. A Cox model with time-dependent covariates was used for analysis.

Results

Among the 71 patients, 38 had a relapse. Multivariate analysis selected 2 markers predictive of relapse: C-reactive protein > 20 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate > 15 mm. A binary biological predictive score was derived: "negative" when both were lower than their limits, "positive" when otherwise. The relative risk of short-term relapse for patients with a positive score compared to those with a negative score was 8.0 (95% confidence interval 2.8–22.9). Sensitivity of the score was 89% and specificity was 43%. Assuming a 10% relapse rate every 6 weeks, negative and positive predictive values were 97% and 15%, respectively.

Conclusions

This simple biological score can predict short-term maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease and may help physicians in the follow-up of patients in clinical remission.

### Cross-sectional analysis of patient phone calls to an inflammatory bowel disease clinic [^1143WB1Z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

In conclusion, many patient-initiated calls resulted in a change in medical management. Repeat calling by the same patient and the new onset of GI and non-GI symptoms were important factors predicting the order of diagnostic modalities or therapeutic changes in care. Triaging of calls to IBD healthcare providers for those patients more likely to require a change in management may improve health outcomes, patient satisfaction and should be considered as a quality improvement measure for GI practices.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease tend to have higher medical care utilization compared to those with other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases
Frequent callers are also high utilizers of in-office visits, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions
Few studies have described frequent callers and studies analyzing what type of phone calls lead to a change in disease management have been missing

What the new findings are:

Frequent callers were more commonly female, with psychological co-morbidities, had Crohn's disease, and elevated markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate)
Frequent callers were more commonly female, with psychological co-morbidities, had Crohn's disease, and elevated markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate)

### A meta-analysis of the utility of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin to exclude inflammatory bowel disease in adults with IBS [^115vQZeL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is viewed as a diagnosis of exclusion by most providers. The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the utility of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin to distinguish between patients with IBS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

A systematic online database search was performed. Included studies were prospective, adult, diagnostic cohort studies with any of the four tests. The means and s.d. values of biomarker logarithms were estimated based on studies that gave medians and either confidence intervals for the median, interquartile ranges, or ranges. We used a Naive Bayes approach to estimate the probability of being a HC, having IBS, or having IBD based on the biomarker values.

Results

Systematic review identified 1,252 citations. After cross-referencing medical subject headings, detailed evaluation identified 140 potentially relevant journal articles/abstracts for CRP, ESR, calprotectin, and lactoferrin of which 4, 4, 8, and 2 fulfilled our inclusion criteria, respectively. None of the biomarkers reliably distinguished between IBS and healthy controls. At a CRP level of ≤ 0.5 or calprotectin level of ≤ 40μg/g, there was a ≤ 1% probability of having IBD. Individual analysis of ESR and lactoferrin had little clinical utility.

Conclusion

CRP and calprotectin of ≤ 0.5 or 40, respectively, essentially excludes IBD in patients with IBS symptoms. The addition of CRP and calprotectin to symptom-based criteria may improve the confident diagnosis of IBS.

### Bloody diarrhea: how inflammatory bowel disease can easily Be confused with a simple infection of entamoeba histolytica… [^114htqeo]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this report is to raise awareness about the importance of proper screening for infectious causes of bloody diarrhea before labeling a patient with IBD. Case Description: A 9-year-old African American female presented with history of multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea and non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting for 3 days, associated with cramping and tenesmus, and a recent weight loss of 10 pounds within a week. She recalled eating crab legs and playing with reptiles prior to the start of her symptoms. She presented in severe dehydration and had diffuse abdominal tenderness, but no distension, guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness, and normoactive bowel sounds on exam. On investigations, CBC showed mild microcytic hypochromic anemia, leukocytosis with left shift, elevated CRP, ESR, and calprotectin. Initial infectious work up including Hepatitis panel, stool culture, Giardia and Cryptosporidium antigen, and stool viral PCR panel were negative.

Entamoeba histolytica antigen was pending. She underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy to rule out IBD. Biopsies revealed gastritis and colitis with ulcerative changes scattered throughout the gastrointestinal tract concerning for Crohn's disease. The plan was to start systemic steroids but Entamoeba histolytica antigen came back positive, hence the patient was started on Metronidazole and Paromomycin. The symptoms improved and patient continued to do well on follow-up outpatient visits with Pediatric Infectious Disease. Discussion: Intestinal amebiasis is more common in tropical and sub-tropical areas with poor hygiene and poor sanitary conditions. Hence, antigen test or stool PCR for enteropathogens should be completed in the evaluation of such cases.

Great care must be taken to avoid mislabeling a patient suffering from amebic colitis with IBD and starting corticosteroids, as can lead to serious complications including fulminant colitis, perforation, and peritonitis.

### Abnormal platelet parameters in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112H3rvF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

For MPV, our meta-analysis found that the changes in MPV among IBD patients were significantly lower compared to those in the control group, irrespective of whether they belonged to the UC or CD groups or the active and inactive groups. A previous meta-analysis has reported a decrease in MPV in IBD patients, which was consistent with our findings. The reduced MPV levels were frequently reported and exhibited a correlation with endoscopic findings and disease activity indexes, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Platelet volume decreases in the presence of an inflammatory process, primarily due to abnormalities in thrombopoiesis and increased platelet consumption. Inflammatory mediators stimulate bone marrow precursors to enhance platelet generation at the cost of maturation time, delivering smaller platelet in circulation, while at the same time larger and more active platelet are consumed at inflammatory sites Several studies have indicated that MPV could serve as a potential inflammatory marker for IBD. In a diagnostic study, MPV demonstrated a sensitivity of 60.0% and specificity of 77.5% for detecting active CD, while for active UC, the sensitivity and specificity were 56.3% and 77.5%, respectively. The AUROC was 0.718 for CD and 0.691 for UC. However, Saler T. et al.'s studies contradicted these findings, suggesting that MPV lacked differential value in distinguishing between active and inactive IBD. Further research is needed to determine whether MPV can reliably differentiate IBD activity.

### Creation of an inflammatory bowel disease referral pathway for identifying patients who would benefit from inflammatory bowel disease specialist consultation [^113vWGtB]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Rating of factors for inclusion in consult care pathway through surveys to expert panel. Factors derived from the scoping review were assessed through surveys in expert elicitation and assigned a score of 1 through 9. Mean scores > 7 were included, while those < 5 were excluded. BMI, body mass index; GI, gastrointestinal; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; IBS, irritable bowel syndrome.

Several factors for which there was no clear consensus were discussed individually among the panel to determine whether they should be included as individual criteria, including symptoms of chronic abdominal pain; joint-related symptoms, such as arthritis, joint pain, or back pain, dyspepsia, constipation, and nausea or vomiting; laboratory factors including elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thrombocytosis, elevated liver function tests, or hypoalbuminemia; and disease-related factors including disease duration or history of Clostridioides difficile infection. However, upon review during our initial panel elicitation, clinical factors including abdominal pain, arthritis, dyspepsia, constipation, nausea or vomiting, disease duration, and history of C. difficile infection were considered inappropriate for inclusion as isolated criteria for referral to a specialist for consultation.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: expert commentary [^117DYF93]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the COVID-19 pandemic — active IBD with concern for relapse is managed by sequential steps that include "Consider IBD relapse unrelated to COVID-19", "Confirm inflammation by non-endoscopic approach (CRP, Fecal calprotectin, other)", assessment of drug exposure and adherence ("Is there sufficient drug present? (Consider thiopurine metabolites or serum concentration of biologics)" and "Is the patient adherent?"), "Restart prior therapy" when appropriate, and therapy selection by "Activity of the IBD?" with symptom-directed options such as "Consider topical (rectal) therapies, oral budesonide, symptomatic therapies" or standard escalation where "Treat as you would normally do with existing therapy (benefits outweigh risks). Consider avoiding thiopurines, methotrexate, tofacitinib".

### Inflammatory bowel disease is not associated with increased intimal media thickening [^116M7GPA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Several studies have suggested that chronic inflammatory diseases might be associated with an acceleration of the atherosclerotic process. There is little information on the effect of chronic inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on the presence of increased intimal media thickening (IMT), a surrogate marker for atherosclerotic diseases. In this work our aim was to determine whether IBD is a risk factor for increased IMT.

Methods

IMT was measured by ultrasound of the carotid arteries; a computer software program was used to analyze 80–100 independent IMT samples from each carotid artery segment in 61 patients with IBD (45 with Crohn's disease and 16 with ulcerative colitis) and in 61 controls matched for age (± 2 yr), sex, body mass index (BMI, ± 2 kg/m(2)), and smoking status.

Results

Inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fibrinogen, high-sensitive C-reactive protein) were significantly (P < 0.001) elevated in IBD patients compared with controls. Even though there was a disease duration of 8.7 ± 8.5 yr, the mean IMT of IBD patients was similar to that of the control group (0.66 ± 0.09 vs 0.64 ± 0.07 mm; P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Despite chronic inflammation, IBD patients had IMT values similar to those of the controls. Thus, unlike other inflammatory diseases, IBD appears not to be a risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis.

### Correlation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein with pediatric inflammatory bowel disease activity [^117ADqUB]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to examine correlation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and with clinical, endoscopic, histological, and radiographic disease activity during follow-up. We reviewed charts of 135 children with inflammatory bowel disease and correlated their ESR and CRP values with disease activity in various encounters during 5 years. Normal ESR and CRP values were observed in up to 28% of children with Crohn disease and 42% of children with ulcerative colitis at diagnosis, respectively. Correlation of ESR and CRP with Crohn disease clinical, endoscopic, and histologic activity during follow-up depended on their value at diagnosis and mode of analysis (continuous or dichotomous). Both markers were not useful in predicting clinical, endoscopic, or histologic ulcerative colitis disease activity and radiographic small bowel Crohn disease during follow-up.

C-reactive protein

CRP and the inflammatory response

First discovered in the 1930s, CRP is a pentameric acute-phase protein that is primarily synthesized in the liver but also by smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, adipocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells. In response to infectious stimuli or tissue damage, cytokines including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β are produced leading to the secretion, primarily by hepatocytes, of CRP into the plasma. CRP binds to C1q molecules to activate the complement pathway, as well as binding via Fc receptors to IgG resulting in the release of further pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also plays a role in innate immunity by binding to phosphocholine expressed on the surface of bacterial cells, activating complement-induced phagocytosis and apoptosis. Studies have also shown that circulating CRP breaks down into monomeric subunits which can exert pro-inflammatory effects through activation of monocytes, endothelial cells, platelets and neutrophils.CRP serum concentrations can increase by up to 1000-fold within 24–72 h of some bacterial infections, but once the stimulus ends levels rapidly decrease over 18–20 h. As well as infection and tissue damage, CRP is found to be elevated in a multitude of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, some cardiovascular disease and IBD.

CRP testing is widely available in primary and secondary care, with results available within minutes to hours, acceptable to patients and cost-effective for assessing inflammation. However, CRP is limited as a biomarker in IBD by its lack of specificity, with its expression upregulated in numerous infective and inflammatory pathologies, thus limiting its usefulness in distinguishing between IBD and other differential diagnoses. Its utility in IBD is largely as an adjunct to clinical and endoscopic findings.

CRP in the diagnosis of IBD

CRP is often used in primary care to screen for underlying inflammatory pathology, and with regard to gastrointestinal symptoms, it is effective at distinguishing between inflammatory and functional disease. However, a review identified that up to 25% of patients with active CD did not mount a CRP response and early work from St Mark's Hospital (UK) found CRP to be elevated in only 50% of patients with UC. Genetic polymorphism has also been described as a source of inter-patient variability in CRP. Exclusion of IBD, therefore, should not be made based solely on a normal CRP but in combination with clinical assessment and other markers with better sensitivity.

### Combination of serological biomarkers and clinical features to predict mucosal healing in Crohn's disease: a multicenter cohort study [^1142U6s1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a life-long and progressive inflammatory disease with symptoms evolving in a remitting and relapsing manner. Most patients develop bowel damage and disability including strictures, fistulas, abscesses and so on in several years after diagnosis, resulting in surgery. Current therapeutic strategies in CD aim for deep and prolonged remission, with the goal of preventing complications and therefore improve prognosis as well as quality of life. Treatment strategies aimed solely at resolution of clinical symptoms does not eliminate long-term bowel damage in patients with CD.

Mucosal healing (MH) is confirmed lead to a lower rate of relapse, hospitalization and surgical resection. In recent years, MH is preferred over clinical remission as straightforward goal of clinical treatment in CD. Endoscopy is still the golden standard for evaluation of disease activity. However, frequently endoscopy for disease monitoring in long-term follow-up is limited by considerations of invasiveness, high cost and patient acceptance. Alternative noninvasive methods are necessary for assessment of CD-related mucosal inflammation.

It is reported that clinical characteristics such as mild clinical manifestation and early introduction of biologicals associated with MH in patients with CD. In addition, some systemic inflammatory markers obtained from the serological examination including neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), C-reactive protein to Albumin ratio (CAR), combination of fecal calprotectin (FC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and Albumin (ALB) have been explored as diagnostic and predictive indicators of CD. Clinically, there is still lack of accurate instrument with high sensitivity and specificity using serological parameters and clinical characteristics to predict MH in CD.

In this study, we aimed to address the predictive role of serum inflammatory index and clinical features in patients with CD who diagnosed and treated in two tertiary hospitals in China. We analyzed the pre-treatment and post-treatment data individually and explored their relationship with MH after treatment including Corticosteroids, Immunomodulators or Infliximab in patients with CD. Subsequently, we used hematological data with or without clinical features to construct assessment models for MH prediction. Model with superior performance is recommended for clinical use.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^116WRy88]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Biochemical inflammatory markers included high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We evaluated annual dichotomous patterns (any elevated value vs. all normal values during a calendar year) of biochemical inflammatory markers (CRP ≥ 0.74 mg/dL; ESR > 20 mm/h per UPMC laboratory standards). Index visit laboratory data were eligible for inclusion if obtained within 1 month of the index visit.

Healthcare utilization measures included the total number of outpatient clinic visits, total count of telephone encounters, number of radiographic studies, and number of endoscopic procedures. As for emergency department (ED) use, IBD-related hospital admissions, and IBD-related surgery, these were treated as binary (yes/no) variables.

IBD medication exposure was determined by annual prescriptions in the electronic medical record. We collected data on exposures to immunomodulators, biologics, steroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds. Immunomodulator agents included azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Steroid prescriptions included systemic prednisone and excluded other systemic glucocorticoids, to avoid prescriptions indicated for adrenal insufficiency. We also included enteric steroids (oral budesonide and per rectum corticosteroid preparations). Biologics included anti-tumor necrosis factor medications (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol). Finally, 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds included sulfasalazine, mesalamine, balsalazide, either oral or topical. Use of oral vancomycin was also collected as a proxy for Clostridioides difficile.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^114bVbYi]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

CRP and fecal calprotectin (FC) are the most widely used biomarkers for IBD evaluation. CRP is the inflammatory marker of choice as it is more sensitive than erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in patients with IBD, and correlates better with endoscopic disease activity in CD rather than in UC. It should be noted that a normal CRP does not rule out CD disease activity; therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution given the low sensitivity of this test.

The sensitivity of CRP ranges from 70 to 100% in the differential diagnosis between CD versus irritable bowel syndrome and ranges from 50 to 60% in UC. Levels of CRP are higher in active CD than in UC.

ESR determination monitors satisfactorily the acute-phase response of IBD after the first 24 h. In contrast, during the first 24 h, the CRP is a better indicator of the acute phase. The ESR, compared with CRP, reaches the highest point less quickly, and it decreases more slowly and has a lesser degree of change.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^115LxpMm]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

What are the uses of faecal biomarkers in IBD?

There are three broad areas within which faecal biomarkers in IBD have been studied: diagnostic exclusion of active IBD, longitudinal monitoring of IBD and predicting the clinical course of IBD.

Diagnostic exclusion of active IBD

Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are common presenting symptoms to gastroenterology clinics. Without 'red flag' or specific localising symptoms the diagnostic spectrum is wide, from IBD and colonic cancer to functional diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients are often subjected to colonoscopy or radiological imaging. Consequently, faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied with an aim of separating those patients with inflammatory organic pathology from those with non-inflammatory functional pathology, thereby potentially avoiding the need for more invasive tests.

Faecal biomarkers are a measure of local gut inflammation rather than systemic inflammation which is not always apparent in IBD. It is not surprising therefore, that calprotectin and lactoferrin have been demonstrated as more effective in identifying disease activity than serum measurements of C-reactive peptide, leucocyte count or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

It has been demonstrated that both calprotectin and lactoferrin levels are significantly higher in patients with active IBD than in healthy controls and those with IBS. In this setting the overall sensitivity and specificity for calprotectin may be as high as 78–100% and 76–100%, respectively, with a similar sensitivity and specificity for lactoferrin of 67–91% and 90–100%, respectively. A meta-analysis of facecal calprotectin studies revealed that at a cut off point of 50 μg/g (ie, above the normal range) calprotectin has a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 81% in discriminating IBD from non-IBD diagnoses. The same paper shows that at a threshold of 100 μg/g (twice upper limit of normal) the sensitivity and specificity improve to 98% and 91%, respectively. A normal biomarker result in a patient with active symptoms is therefore very reassuring and may be enough, in the correct context where the clinical risk of malignancy is low, to avoid further colonic investigation such as radiology or colonoscopy and allow a positive diagnosis of functional diarrhoea or IBS at first clinic visit.

Inflammation indicators prompting bone health assessment in pediatric IBD: In the absence of this information, we recommend that elevations in indices of disease severity/clinical course, albumin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and persistence of active disease on histological examination, for at least 3 months are used as evidence of ongoing inflammation that should prompt examination of bone health status.

### Multiyear patterns of serum inflammatory biomarkers and risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis [^116A19G4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) presumably because of chronic inflammation. Data on the relationship between long-term serum inflammatory biomarkers and the development of CRN in UC are limited.

Methods

We performed a 5-year study (2009–2013) of demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data of patients with UC from an inflammatory bowel disease registry in relation to the development of CRN. Disease activity was evaluated by UC activity index and by serum biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin levels. A score based on the combination of median CRP and median albumin levels (0: both normal, 1: one of them abnormal, 2: both abnormal) was also evaluated.

Results

A total of 773 patients with UC (median age 46 yr, 46.4% women) were included. Fifty-five patients (7.1%) developed CRN. Patients with UC and CRN had significantly higher median CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and platelets and lower hemoglobin and albumin levels compared with those without CRN. The prevalence of a CRP-albumin score (1 or 2) was significantly higher in the CRN group (40.0% or 30.9% versus 14.2% or 6.0%, respectively, P < 0.0001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, CRN was associated with male gender (P = 0.01), disease duration (P = 0.04), extensive colitis (P = 0.03), concomitant primary sclerosing cholangitis (P = 0.0003), median albumin levels (P = 0.03), and an increased CRP-albumin score (score 1 or 2) (P = 0.0002).

Conclusions

Long-term serum inflammatory markers including the CRP-albumin score are associated with increased risk of CRN in patients with UC.

### Faecal markers of gastrointestinal inflammation [^114jLUxo]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea are a relatively common reason for consulting a physician. They may be due to inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis), malignancy (colorectal cancer), infectious colitis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Differentiation between these involves the use of clinical, radiological, endoscopic and serological techniques, which are invasive or involve exposure to radiation. Serological markers include C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antibodies (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody). Faecal markers that can aid in distinguishing inflammatory disorders from non-inflammatory conditions are non-invasive and generally acceptable to the patient. As IBS accounts for up to 50% of cases presenting to the GI clinic and is a diagnosis of exclusion (Rome III criteria), any test that can reliably distinguish IBS from organic disease could speed diagnosis and reduce endoscopy waiting times. Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, M2-PK and S100A12 will be reviewed.

### Association between the immune-inflammation index and the severity and clinical outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163tKWE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In comparison to colonoscopy and pathology, serological biomarkers are widely accepted, and they are low-cost, convenient, and non-invasive. They have garnered widespread attention for their potential to forecast the activity and severity of IBD. The inflammatory indices typically include the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR), C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CRP/ALB), eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (ELR), and eosinophil*neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (ENLR). These indicators can be readily obtained through routine blood tests, which are economical.

PLR and NLR have emerged as novel, non-invasive systemic inflammatory biomarkers. These ratios are associated with prognosis across various disease states. They have garnered widespread attention in the fields of malignancies, inflammatory conditions, coronary heart disease, thrombosis, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Acarturk et al. collected data from 44 UC patients as the observation group and 41 healthy people as the control group. They assessed the NLR, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell count (WBC), and found that it was notably higher in the active phase group than that in the remission and control groups. Yao et al. studied 67 patients with CD, categorizing them into active and remission groups. Their findings proved NLR as an independent predictor of activity and severity in CD. Furthermore, significant differences are noted in NLR across the mild, moderate, and severe subgroups of the active phase, which proved its role in assessing disease severity.

Anas Elgenidy et al. published a meta-analysis in 2024 that examined the correlation between the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) and disease activity in patients with UC. The objective of our current study is to synthesize the existing clinical data through a meta-analysis and systematic review and update the previous meta-analysis to provide the latest and most comprehensive evidence-based medical data. This will help confirm whether such immune-inflammatory indices can effectively predict the severity, activity, and prognosis of IBD.

### Biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: a practical guide [^1171usb2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CRP also has utility in acute presentations of CD, when a significantly elevated CRP can be indicative of a complication such as perforation, abscess formation or peri-anal collection and may guide the need for subsequent radiological or endoscopic investigation.

The performance of CRP in assessing disease activity in UC is inferior to FCP when correlating with endoscopic appearances. A 2019 study found that CRP did not correlate well with low-grade mucosal disease activity, defined as Mayo endoscopic sub-score (MES) of 0 or 1. An elevated CRP was associated with MES 2–3 disease but only in left-sided or pan-colonic disease. The investigators also examined other serum biomarkers – albumin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count and platelet count – but none were found to have any statistically significant correlation with MES. Therefore, whilst CRP may be useful in identifying those with moderate to severe and extensive disease, it does not have a role in proctitis or mild disease, and assessment for these patients should be based upon clinical assessment and other biomarkers such as FCP.

CRP does have a crucial role, however, in the assessment of acute severe UC (ASUC), together with clinical, radiographic and endoscopic evaluation. European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines state that patients with a significantly elevated CRP > 30 mg/L in association with bloody diarrhoea with a stool frequency of > 6/day have developed ASUC and require admission for intensive treatment with either intravenous steroids, infliximab or ciclosporin. The ECCO guidelines, based upon work by Truelove and Witts and the Oxford criteria, state that non-responders or patients with a worsening clinical picture at day 3, including a static or worsening CRP, have an 85% chance of requiring colectomy during admission. Whilst more recent data have suggested the rate of colectomy may not be this high, a recent study found a clear correlation between CRP and deep ulceration seen at endoscopywhich itself represents a higher colectomy risk. The CRP:albumin ratio (CAR) has also been identified as a useful biomarker in ASUC, with a CAR > 0.85 at day 3 of admission predictive of steroid-refractory ASUC and the need for rescue therapy. Furthermore, in patients who had responded to medical management, a CAR of > 0.37 at discharge was predictive of the need for colectomy within 12 months.CRP therefore remains a key part of overall clinical assessment and decision-making regarding treatment escalation and the need for surgery in ASUC.

CRP in disease monitoring

In patients with a known diagnosis of IBD, CRP is commonly used in clinical practice to provide a non-invasive marker of disease activity. However, its accuracy varies based on many clinical factors including whether the patient suffers from UC or CD, and the extent of their disease. The correlation between disease activity in CD and CRP is stronger in CD than in UC; however, this is dependent upon the disease severity and location. A Korean study of 435 patients found that an elevated CRP was more likely to be seen in ileocolonic or colonic CD compared to patients with isolated ileal disease.

Even in the setting of a normal CRP, many patients with CD have active disease. One study identified that 92.9% of patients with an elevated Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and a normal CRP had active mucosal disease at endoscopy, although these lesions were deemed to correspond only to mildly active disease [Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) ≤ 6]. It has been demonstrated that a normal CRP is negatively associated with hospitalization and the need for surgery, indicating that a normal CRP is suggestive of the absence of severely active CD. Conversely, asymptomatic patients with an elevated CRP (so-called 'silent IBD') are at a seven-fold higher risk of having worse disease trajectoriesand a two-fold higher risk of hospitalization. Whilst escalating CD therapy based upon a single biomarker is not an advisable strategy, it should prompt physicians to consider other modalities of disease assessment.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^115JZ9hx]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Crohn's disease endoscopic activity detection — serum C‑reactive protein (CRP) performance: Most studies used a cutoff of > 5 mg/L; the sensitivity of elevated CRP to detect endoscopically active disease was 67% (95% CI, 54%–77%) with a specificity of 73% (95% CI, 65%–80%). In patients with known recent endoscopic remission within preceding 3 years (20% prevalence of endoscopic activity), applying elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L) yields approximately 6.6% false negatives and a 21.6% false‑positive rate.

### Quantitative proteomic studies of the intestinal mucosa provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of ulcerative colitis [^112wGyWe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IBD is characterized by changes in the levels of acute-phase response markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin (FC), which can be detected in the serum or stool, and an altered erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). CRP and ESR have been reported to be able to distinguish IBD from normal persons, but the difference between CD and UC is heterogenic. Several antibodies including perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) are characteristically present in patients with IBD; however, poor sensitivity limits their clinical use in differentiating UC from CD. Therefore, there is a need for novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prediction of prognosis of IBD.

The pathogenesis of UC is complex and not completely understood, and typical findings are alterations in the gut microbiota and the activation of different immune cell types. In recent years, proteomics has been used to identify accurate biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD by analyzing and characterizing large amounts of data, and many studies have focused on proteomic changes in IBD. In this study label-free LC-MS/MS proteomics was used to identify DEPs in patients with UC in order to find novel candidate biomarkers.

### Serum inflammatory markers and risk of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^115JyYQL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are at increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Persistent inflammation is hypothesized to increase risk of CRC in patients with IBD; however, the few studies in this area have been restricted to cross-sectional assessments of histologic severity. No prior studies have examined association between C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevation and risk of CRC in an IBD cohort.

Methods

From a multi-institutional validated IBD cohort, we identified all patients with at least one measured CRP or ESR value. Patients were stratified into quartiles of severity of inflammation on the basis of their median CRP or ESR value, and subsequent diagnosis of CRC was ascertained. Logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent association between CRP or ESR elevation and risk of CRC.

Results

Our study included 3145 patients with at least 1 CRP value (CRP cohort) and 4008 with at least 1 ESR value (ESR cohort). Thirty-three patients in the CRP cohort and 102 patients in the ESR cohort developed CRC during a median follow-up of 5 years at a median age of 55 years. On multivariate analysis, there was a significant increase in risk of CRC across quartiles of CRP elevation (P(trend) = .017; odds ratio for quartile 4 vs quartile 1, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–7.76). Similarly higher median ESR was also independently associated with risk of CRC across the quartiles (odds ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–3.74) (P(trend) = .007).

Conclusions

An elevated CRP or ESR is associated with increased risk of CRC in patients with IBD.

### Association of vitamin D level with clinical status in inflammatory bowel disease: a 5-year longitudinal study [^116stGKL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Emerging data suggest that vitamin D has a significant role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prospective data evaluating the association of vitamin D serum status and disease course are lacking. We sought to determine the relationship between vitamin D status and clinical course of IBD over a multiyear time period.

Methods

IBD patients with up to 5-year follow-up from a longitudinal IBD natural history registry were included. Patients were categorized according to their mean serum 25-OH vitamin D level. IBD clinical status was approximated with patterns of medication use, health-care utilization, biochemical markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), pain and clinical disease activity scores, and health-related quality of life.

Results

A total of 965 IBD patients (61.9% Crohn's disease, 38.1% ulcerative colitis) formed the study population (mean age 44 years, 52.3% female). Among them, 29.9% had low mean vitamin D levels. Over the 5-year study period, subjects with low mean vitamin D required significantly more steroids, biologics, narcotics, computed tomography scans, emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and surgery compared with subjects with normal mean vitamin D levels (P < 0.05). Moreover, subjects with low vitamin D levels had worse pain, disease activity scores, and quality of life (P < 0.05). Finally, subjects who received vitamin D supplements had a significant reduction in their health-care utilization.

Conclusions

Low vitamin D levels are common in IBD patients and are associated with higher morbidity and disease severity, signifying the potential importance of vitamin D monitoring and treatment.

### Novel potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with ulcerative colitis [^115hEZUX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Unambiguously, great progress has been achieved in the unraveling of more pathological pathways implicated in the development and progression of ulcerative colitis during the last decades. Novel effective drugs that have augmented the management armamentarium have been developed alongside this growing comprehension of the disease, rendering mucosal healing not only a feasible but the optimal goal of every therapy. Clinical evaluation, colonoscopy and biomarkers are the tools used by practitioners for the diagnosis and assessment of the status of the disease in order to achieve clinical remission and mucosal healing for their patients. Among these tools, colonoscopy is the gold method for the cause but is still an invasive, high-cost procedure with possible adverse events such as perforation. While clinical evaluation entails much subjectivity, biomarkers are objective, easily reproducible, non-invasive, cheap and potent surrogate tools of mucosal inflammation. Unfortunately, the well-established, currently in use serum biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and others, do not display sufficiently acceptable sensitivity and specificity rates for the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and, most importantly, do not represent precisely the mucosal inflammation status of the disease. Therefore, the discovery of new serum biomarkers has been the cause of several studies attempting to discover an "optimal" serum biomarker during the recent years. After thorough research, collection and examination of current data, this review focuses on and selectively presents promising, potential, novel serum biomarkers of ulcerative colitis as they are indicated by studies on the patient over the last years.

### Limitations of fecal calprotectin at diagnosis in untreated pediatric Crohn's disease [^113FP6Vp]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal Calprotectin (FC) is a validated screening test for intestinal inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD). The objective of the study was to prospectively evaluate the limitations of FC for identifying CD in newly diagnosed untreated pediatric patients and to assess the association of FC levels with disease location and serum inflammatory markers.

Methods

Consecutive children with new onset untreated CD participating in the ongoing ESPGHAN GROWTH CD study were evaluated at diagnosis for disease activity, extent, C-reactive protein (CRP), and FC.

Results

In all, 60 children met the inclusion criteria (mean age 12.6 ± 4.6 years,), 25 (42%) with mild disease, 17 (28%) moderate disease, and 18 (30%) severe disease. Twenty-seven (45%) had small bowel disease only. Median FC levels did not differ between children with small bowel only (2198 μg/g interquartile range [IQR] 696–2400) and those with colonic involvement (with or without small bowel disease; 2400 μg/g (IQR 475–2400) (P = 0.76). FC was elevated in 95% of patients, in comparison to CRP (86%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (83%). Three children (5%) who had normal calprotectin levels also had low or normal CRP and/or ESR. There was no correlation between calprotectin levels and either the pediatric CD activity index (r = -0.11; P = 0.94) or physicians global assessment.

Conclusions

FC levels in active disease confined to the small bowel were elevated in the vast majority of children and site of disease was not a confounding factor in this setting. Patients with low FC had a trend toward low levels of inflammatory markers as well. We did not find a significant correlation between FC and clinical indices of activity.

### Use of serologic markers as a screening tool in inflammatory bowel disease compared with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and anemia… [^116JiWkJ]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the use of serologic testing as a screening test for inflammatory bowel disease compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hemoglobin in a referred patient population with suspected inflammatory bowel disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS. A retrospective study was performed, reviewing medical charts of patients who had inflammatory bowel disease serology performed at Prometheus Laboratories from September 2002 to September 2004. Patients were divided into 4 categories: ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, indeterminate colitis, and noninflammatory bowel disease groups. Patients were categorized based on clinical evaluation by board-certified pediatric gastroenterologists. RESULTS. A total of 227 patients seen at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Gastroenterology Clinic had inflammatory bowel disease serology performed at or before the time of diagnosis. Seventeen charts were excluded secondary to inadequate information.

Forty children were found to have inflammatory bowel disease, a prevalence of 19%. Overall, serologic testing for inflammatory bowel disease had 60% sensitivity and 92% specificity. A positive laboratory test for anemia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate had 83% sensitivity, whereas the combination of anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate had 96% specificity. The positive predictive value of serologic testing was 60% compared with 79% in patients with anemia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The positive predictive value of serologic testing in the subgroup of subjects without rectal bleeding was only 35% compared with 60% using routine tests. Almost one third of all positive serologic tests were in patients with no demonstrable inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS.

As a pediatric inflammatory bowel disease screening strategy for the general pediatrician or gastroenterologist, the measurement of the combination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hemoglobin has a higher positive predictive value and is more sensitive, more specific, and less costly than commercial serologic testing.

### Common laboratory blood test immune panel markers are useful for grading ulcerative colitis endoscopic severity [^111cXSoJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Blood parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell count (WBC), and albumin (ALB) are markers that are commonly used to judge disease activity. However, UC inflammation is limited to the intestinal mucosa and has a low correlation with systemic disease activity, so its quantification is not particularly helpful in the diagnosis of UC, especially as a correlate of endoscopic activity (EA). Fecal calprotectin has high accuracy in measuring intestinal inflammation. However, due to high cost, long time requirement, and the influence of intestinal movement, it is still not commonly used in clinical practice in most areas. In addition, it requires the collection of fecal sample which is cumbersome and has poor patient acceptability. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has attracted interest in UC in recent years due to its high sensitivity and accuracy, and its relationship with the clinical and even EA of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has been found that hs-CRP can better reflect the inflammation of the colonic mucosa than fecal calprotectin, and can reliably identify pancolitis. In addition, CRP also shows good diagnostic efficacy in evaluating acute severe UC, and can replace ESR as a classic indicator in the Truelove and Witts criteria. C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR), as a CRP-derived indicator, has shown good diagnostic efficacy in judging disease activity. A correlation was reported between CAR and Crohn's disease activity. Gibson et al. reported that CAR on day 3 in UC is more accurate than CRP on day 3 or ALB on day 3 in reflecting the hormone response, which is an early predictor of acute hormone -refractory UC. The above research indicates that CRP, a commonly and easily obtained indicator, can be exploited to predict and quantify the development of UC-related inflammation. In recent years, some markers of systemic inflammation that are obtained from the complete blood count (CBC), such as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) have been reported as diagnostic and predictive indicators of IBD.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^112URHZp]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA guideline — screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C‑reactive protein (CRP): "Recommendation 2: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA suggests against the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C‑reactive protein to screen for IBD. Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence". Evidence summary shows that for CRP, "using a value of 5–6 mg/L as a threshold", pooled sensitivity was "0.73 (95% CI, 0.64–0.80)" and pooled specificity was "0.78 (95% CI, 0.58–0.91)", whereas ESR thresholds "10–15 mm/h… resulted in lower estimates of diagnostic accuracy for IBD". A pragmatic note states that "if testing for fecal lactoferrin or calprotectin are either not available or not covered by insurance, the use of CRP might be considered to be a reasonable option to screen for IBD".

### NASPGHAN clinical report on postoperative recurrence in pediatric Crohn disease [^112CgVxs]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical disease activity scores and routine laboratory studies — In adults, the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is less effective for predicting postoperative recurrence, with the largest study identifying disease only 65% of the time at the standard cut-off of 150 (specificity 89%, sensitivity 30%), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C‑reactive protein (CRP) correlating poorly with endoscopic findings; one study suggested CDAI ≥ 148 predicted recurrence better (sensitivity 70%, specificity 68%). The low sensitivity highlights the role of endoscopy, with fecal markers as adjuncts rather than relying on CDAI or CRP or erythrocyte sedimentation rate alone.

### Assessing seasonal variations of biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease [^111daXN7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Inflammatory bowel diseases are chronic pathologies characterized by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, as well as aberrant immune responses. This study aimed to investigate inflammation markers' seasonality and association with disease exacerbation episodes in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

Methods

284 patients were classified based on clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological criteria. Systemic inflammation was evaluated using C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and chitotriosidase, while fecal calprotectin was measured to assess intestinal inflammation. Serum vitamin D levels and the seasonality of an activity score that combines several clinical and biological parameters were also evaluated.

Results

The peak number of patients reporting endoscopic activity occurred in autumn for Crohn's disease (82%) and spring for ulcerative colitis (95%). Regarding histological activity, spring saw the highest number of patients for both diseases (72% for Crohn's disease; 87% for ulcerative colitis). Most of the inflammatory markers exhibited lower values during winter. Systemic inflammatory markers follow a slightly different trend than fecal calprotectin and differ in the two pathologies. The maximum values of intestinal inflammation were observed in autumn for Crohn's disease (784µg/g) and in spring for ulcerative colitis (1269µg/g). Serum vitamin D concentrations were consistently low throughout the year. Statistical analysis revealed differences between the seasons for CRP and ESR (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

The evolution of flares and inflammatory markers in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis displayed distinct seasonal patterns. Systemic inflammation did not consistently parallel intestinal inflammation.

Table 7 — Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in asymptomatic Crohn's disease (CD) models Normal CRP at two prevalences: known endoscopic remission (prevalence 20%) and unknown endoscopic remission status (prevalence 45%). Numbers of results per 1000 patients tested show, respectively, true positives 134 (108–154) vs 302 (243–347), false negatives 66 (46–92) vs 148 (103–207), false positives 216 (160–280) vs 148 (110–192), and true negatives 584 (520–640) vs 402 (358–440). Comments state that true positives "would be eligible to undergo treatment adjustment", false negatives "would be falsely reassured, and may be at higher risk of disease complications/flare due to undertreatment", false positives "may receive unnecessary testing (endoscopy) and/or treatment adjustment, and have avoidable anxiety, potential testing- or treatment-related complications and excessive resource utilization", and true negatives "would be reassured and obviate the need for invasive testing with endoscopy" though they may need serial biomarker assessment. Pooled performance for CRP < 5 mg/L across 20 studies is sensitivity 66.7% (95% CI, 54.4–77.1) and specificity 73.1% (95% CI, 64.7–80.1). In the 45% prevalence scenario, 14.8% would have a false-negative result and 14.8% would have a false-positive result.

### Inflammation and aortic stiffness: an individual participant data meta-analysis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^115uvKBG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Another important finding of this study was that chronic inflammation increased aortic stiffness at any given age. This suggests that arterial stiffening provided by IBD could be additive to that of normal aging.

Finally, we did not find any association between aPWV and C‐reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 2 markers of active inflammation. These results were confirmed even in subgroup analyses performed separately in patients with UC and in those with CD. As IBD are characterized by chronic inflammation and episodes of reactivation of the disease, our lack of a finding could suggest that a single measurement of markers of active inflammation may not be sufficient to provide information on the amount of chronic inflammation over time. However, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

### Agreement between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein in hospital practice [^114Zimnf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are frequently prescribed jointly. The usefulness of this practice is uncertain.

Methods

All patients with ESR and CRP measured at the same time in an academic tertiary hospital during a 1-year period were included. Concomitant measures of serum creatinine, hematocrit, and anti-Xa activity were recorded to study noninflammatory cause of increased ESR. Level of agreement between ESR and CRP was assessed with kappa coefficient, and their accuracy was determined in a medical chart review of 99 randomly selected patients with disagreement between both markers.

Results

Among 5777 patients, 35% and 58% had an elevated CRP and ESR, respectively. ESR and CRP were in agreement in 67% of patients (both elevated in 30%, both normal in 37%). A disagreement was observed in 33% (elevated ESR/normal CRP in 28%, normal ESR/elevated CRP in 5%). The kappa coefficient showed poor agreement (k = 0.38) between both markers. Review of medical chart showed that 25 patients with elevated CRP and normal ESR had an active inflammatory disease (false-negative ESR). Conversely, 74 patients had elevated ESR and normal CRP-32% had resolving inflammatory disorders, 28% disclosed a variable interfering with the ESR measure (false-positive ESR), 32% had unexplained discrepancies, and 8% had an active inflammatory disease (false-negative CRP).

Conclusion

In hospital practice, joint measurement of ESR and CRP is unwarranted. Because of slow variation and frequent confounding, ESR is frequently misleading in unselected patients. When an inflammatory disorder is suspected, priority should be given to CRP.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^113ykYfu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

### Thiols as a marker of inflammatory bowel disease activity: a systematic review [^114zndBx]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Thiol expression and relationship with oxidative stress in inflammatory bowel disease

Baskol et al. detected increased total thiol levels in subjects with UC compared to controls. Akinci et al. when conducting the study with the largest number of individuals with IBD, included in this review, of both phenotypes, at different stages of the disease, found total thiol levels positively associated only with active CD. Yuksel et al. identified a negative association between the reduction of total and native thiols in active CD and between native thiols in active UC, supported by a negative correlation between native thiol and EAI, CDAI, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (TSE) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in individuals with active CD and UC, when compared with healthy controls. Neselioglu et al. found: I. negative association between: a: the levels of native and total thiols in individuals with active UC; b: native thiol and CRP; c: native thiol and TSE; d: thiol homeostasis and UC activity/severity; II. positive correlation between native thiol and albumin; III. lower total thiol levels in subjects with UC compared to healthy controls and IV. higher total and native thiol levels in subjects with UC in remission than subjects with active UC or healthy controls. From these results, these researchers related disease activity to thiol oxidation, and suggested of using thiol as a serum marker to assess activity and predict the severity of the disease course.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^113c4cpJ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive stool markers (fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin) correlate with clinical and endoscopic indices and elevated levels have been shown near clinical relapse, suggesting a potential to "predict" relapse; however, there are no sufficient data to recommend collection of "surveillance" stool markers during routine office visits.

### Biomarkers in inflammatory bowel disease: a practical guide [^116FGVCy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

FCP in disease monitoring

FCP correlates well with endoscopic IBD activity, particularly in the setting of colonic inflammation, with low levels seen in patients with endoscopic and histological remission. It has shown superiority over CRP in predicting endoscopic disease activity, and is increasingly used for patients in clinical remission to predict disease relapse, and to monitor response to therapy in active disease. The Effect of Tight Control Management on Crohn's disease study demonstrated that a treat-to-target approach based on FCP results was superior to treatment escalation based on symptoms alone, and the International Organisation for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease has published recommendations as part of the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in IBD consensus advising a target FCP of < 150 µg/g as a goal of treatment.

A challenge in devising treat-to-target strategies in IBD is the lack of evidence exploring the effect of targeting various FCP thresholds on long-term clinical outcomes, with different expert groups proposing different thresholds. Although the use of different thresholds for UC and CD cohorts offers a more nuanced approach, studies suggest that a target of < 250 µg/g for both groups is a reasonable long-term strategy, which may be more achievable for clinicians managing patients with IBD outside of specialist centres.

### Impaired erythrocyte antioxidant defense in active inflammatory bowel disease: impact of anemia and treatment [^111eViiN]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Oxidative stress contributes to the propagation and exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but the status of erythrocyte antioxidant defense remains unknown.

Methods

Erythrocyte activities of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) were determined in 174 IBD patients and 105 controls and referred to IBD activity, inflammation severity, nutritional status, systemic oxidative stress, anemia, and treatment.

Results

Catalase and GPx1 activities were decreased in active IBD, whereas SOD1 became upregulated by IBD-related oxidative stress. In Crohn's disease (CD) corticosteroids decreased SOD1 activity. SOD1 correlated indirectly with CD activity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and directly with transferrin. In ulcerative colitis (UC) anemia downregulated SOD1. Decreases in GPx activity corresponded with IBD activity, anemia, inflammation, and malnutrition. Oxidative stress in UC and corticosteroids in CD also downregulated GPx. Catalase activity was decreased by CD-related anemia, correlating directly with hemoglobin, and indirectly with CD activity, inflammatory and protein oxidative stress markers. When co-analyzed, anemia but not CD activity significantly contributed to catalase downregulation. In UC, catalase activity corresponded indirectly with UC endoscopic activity and inflammation and directly with hemoglobin. UC activity, anemia, and treatment with azathioprine negatively affected catalase. As indicators of active IBD, GPx1 showed a diagnostic accuracy of 73%, whereas catalase showed 63% as compared to 74% of C-reactive protein and ESR.

Conclusions

Erythrocyte antioxidant defense is impaired in active IBD. SOD1, GPx1, and CAT activities are differently affected by the disease type, activity, anemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and treatment. As an active IBD indicator, GPx1 was comparable to C-reactive protein and ESR.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: towards a personalized medicine [^113r6pT6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Considering the characteristics of the patient and the disease

The last few decades have been marked by major therapeutic advances for the management of IBD. These advances are due to an enhancement of the panel of treatments available and in addition to a better knowledge of the therapeutic strategies for the most active IBD cases or those with some characteristics of aggressive disease that could lead to irreversible damage. The course of the disease is variable, with some patients having much more aggressive disease than others. However, the main difficulty in managing IBD is the early detection of patients with potentially severe disease. It is likely that disease outcome is variable between patients and, although some criteria have been defined as predictors of disabling disease (Table 1), sufficient data are not yet available to allow an accurate prediction of disease severity for a specific patient at the stage of disease diagnosis. Thus, some patients with criteria considered as potentially severe could in fact have a favorable outcome, while the converse is also possible. Some risk factors of complicated Crohn's disease (CD) have been demonstrated to be associated with a poor prognosis, including younger age at diagnosis, extensive disease, upper gastrointestinal involvement, smoking, fistulizing or stricturing phenotype, perianal disease, and the need for corticosteroids. – For ulcerative colitis (UC), a post hoc analysis of the pivotal Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials (ACTs) for the efficacy of IFX demonstrated that the risk of colectomy was associated with a C-reactive protein (CRP) level above 20 mg/liter, the need for corticosteroids at inclusion, the presence of a Mayo score greater than 10, and a recent diagnosis (< 3 years). Similarly, in the inflammatory bowel South-Eastern Norway (IBSEN) cohort, four factors were associated with a higher risk of colectomy: extent of disease, age (< 40 years), need for systemic steroids, and CRP (⩾30 mg/liter) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (⩾30 mm/h) at diagnosis. Endoscopic findings can also help to predict disease behavior. In particular, the presence of deep ulcerations in CD has been demonstrated to be predictive of more aggressive disease, with a higher risk of developing penetrating disease. Conversely, in UC, with the arrival of TNF antagonists, the severity of inflammation at initial colonoscopy did not seem to markedly affect the outcome. Biomarkers might also be helpful to identify patients who are at risk of a complicated disease course. In particular, numerous studies have indicated that anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) positivity and newly discovered antibodies such as CBir1, Anti-OmpC antibody or anti-I2 in CD are correlated with a higher risk of stricturing, penetrating disease and small bowel resection. – Similarly, antichitobioside carbohydrate antibody (ACCA), antilaminaribioside carbohydrate antibodies (ALCA), antimannobioside carbohydrate antibodies (AMCA) and gASCA have also been associated with complicated disease and surgery. However, although these biological markers are recognized as indicating a risk of a complicated disease course, they are not routinely assessed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to emergency laboratory workup, AAST/WSES 2021 guidelines recommend to obtain the following laboratory tests for the assessment of acute abdomen in patients with IBD:

- CBC

- electrolytes

- liver enzymes

- inflammatory markers, such as ESR and CRP

- serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation).

### A novel inflammatory marker for extensive ulcerative colitis; endocan [^112MyLmW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In a study by Voiosu et al. in 33 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, endocan levels were significantly higher in the IBD group when compared with both the healthy control group and cancer patients. The coexistence of both Crohn's patients and ulcerative colitis patients in the study indicates that our study may be more valuable. Considering that the endocan level is high in patients with IBD, the fact that this elevation mostly indicates patients with pancolitis adds value to our study. Considering that the endocan level is high in patients with IBD, the fact that this elevation mostly indicates patients with pancolitis adds value to our study.

As the extent and severity of ulcerative colitis increase, inflammatory markers in serum and stool increase. In important diseases such as acute pancreatitis with similar inflammation, studies have shown that the level of endocan increases as the severity of the disease increases. In particular, the study of Çakır et al. in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis showed that the endocan increased significantly in showing the severity of the disease, opening a new window. The most important finding in the study of Sakuraba et al. in 133 patients with ulcerative colitis was that the extent of the disease may affect the correlation between fecal biomarker values. Especially in patients with proctitis, the low correlation between stool biomarkers and endoscopic findings, just as in our study, shows that both endocan and fecal calprotectin are more valuable in cases of extensive disease.

In the study of Kyle et al. the fecal marker was used instead of the serum marker to determine the extent of the disease. They found that fecal calprotectin was significantly elevated in a concentration-dependent manner, which correlated with the number of sites of active inflammation reported in colon biopsies from inflammatory bowel patients. As in our study, a comparison was made with CRP. Although CRP and leukocyte measurements showed an upward trend in line with inflammation reported from biopsy, results were highly variable, underscoring the poor reliability of these biomarkers in demonstrating IBD inflammation. In addition, CRP may be elevated due to many factors unrelated to IBD, such as infection, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases. Current blood and serological laboratory tests such as total leukocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), provide indirect, objective but non-specific markers for UC. Few studies have shown relatively poor sensitivity and specificity for the use of these biomarkers in diagnosing IBD and monitoring treatment.

Results

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

### Circulatory resistin levels in inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hEh66]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA), anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), Leucine-Rich α2 Glycoprotein, and fecal calprotectin are commonly-used biomarkers as indicators of disease activity in patients with autoimmune diseases like IBD. The utilization of biomarkers as diagnostic and prognostic tools in IBD offers a cost-effective, less time-consuming, and minimally invasive alternative to endoscopic procedures. Among currently used biomarkers, fecal calprotectin has been considered the gold standard for IBD diagnosis in adults, however, its sensitivity and specificity depend on the location of the inflammation. Also, several studies have reported lower specificity of fecal calprotectin in CD patients, rather than UC cases, and higher specificity in individuals with large bowel disease involvement, compared to small bowel disease. As a result, many studies are focused on the identification and validation of the novel most reliable biomarkers. Accordingly, previous studies have suggested that resistin may serve as a potential biomarker with high sensitivity to disease activity. Additionally, recent studies revealed that resistin levels have a positive correlation with leukocyte count and CRP. In the present systematic review, we observed a notable elevation in resistin levels among IBD patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, resistin levels remained significantly higher in patients experiencing active disease compared to those in remission. Similar results were also recognized between quiescent patients and healthy controls. These observations could be attributed to proinflammatory properties of resistin as mentioned above. Compared to more commonly used markers (e.g. ESR and CRP), resistin has been found to be more valuable in monitoring and better understanding the disease activity. This is primarily due to its ability to differentiate patients in recovery from healthy individuals, providing more accurate information about the disease progression. Although the majority of published scholars are in line with our findings, few articles have reported controversial findings reporting a lack of significant association between resistin and IBD disease. These studies are limited due to their patient selection and sample size. It is also important to note that obesity significantly influences circulating resistin levels due to its increased secretion by enlarged adipose tissue, although our meta-regression based on BMI did not show any association between resistin difference and BMI. However, it is highly suggested that the laboratory reference ranges for resistin level be standardized according to body fat mass. In addition to BMI, several other factors have been shown to be associated with serum resistin levels, such as insulin resistance. In the study by Norata et al. a positive correlation was found between triglycerides, waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, and systolic blood pressure, many of which are present in metabolic syndrome. The association and mediator effect of these factors have not been assessed in IBD studies and hence, there is a need for further studies aiming at investigating these factors' impact on the observed relation. They could also be the source of high heterogeneity found among the studies.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^112Ftipr]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Serum C-reactive protein — certainty of evidence for rule-out and rule-in: There was very low certainty of evidence supporting normal serum CRP to rule out moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation in a low pretest probability setting, downgraded for inconsistency and very serious imprecision because the point estimate is higher than the maximal tolerable false negative rate. Similarly, in intermediate pretest probability settings, there was very low certainty for normal CRP to rule out due to unacceptably high false negatives and inconsistency, and very low certainty for elevated CRP to rule in in low and intermediate settings due to unacceptably high false positives and inconsistency.

Other guidelines on biomarkers in Crohn's disease — The American College of Gastroenterology Society guidelines published in 2018 suggested fecal calprotectin and serum CRP may have an adjunctive role in assessing inflammation in CD but did not provide specific cutoffs or recommendations; European societies recognized that, in asymptomatic patients, elevated fecal calprotectin and CRP may suggest imminent flare and recommended endoscopic or radiologic evaluation.

### Gastrointestinal hypoalgesia in inflammatory bowel disease [^114w8Spm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Additionally, when comparing active and inactive IBD cohorts reporting little to no pain, we found that several inflammatory markers (including WBC, platelet count, ESR and CRP) may be elevated in hypoalgesic IBD, supporting the findings of previous studies. However, a quarter or more of these patients will demonstrate normal inflammatory markers, demonstrating the potential limitation of this type of testing. Interestingly, when we compared the presence of EIMs between these cohorts, we found a potential trend but no significant difference in their incidence, suggesting that these clinical features may not be particularly sensitive for screening hypoalgesic IBD. Finally, when comparing the presence of other major gastrointestinal symptoms between these cohorts, there were no significant differences. Clearly endoscopy, radiological testing, laboratory testing and patient symptom history are critically important aspects of monitoring IBD disease activity. They all have limitations, however, in regard to cost, time, and/or efficacy. Our study highlights some of these potential deficiencies and reinforces the need to develop alternative approaches for identifying individuals at risk for this condition. To this end, our group has identified a genetic marker that could help risk-stratify patients for hypoalgesic IBD. However, further investigation is required in this regard to clarify the potential utility of this approach for screening out hypoalgesic IBD patients.

### C-reactive protein versus erythrocyte sedimentation rate: implications among patients with No known inflammatory conditions [^115Z16b8]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are frequently ordered jointly in clinical practice.

Aim

To investigate the factors associated with discordances between CRP concentration and ESR in adults.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1472 adults with no known inflammatory disorders (44.5% male; median age, 52 years; range, 18–91 years), randomly selected from a municipality in Spain. The participants underwent simultaneous measurements of ESR, serum CRP, and interleukin-6 concentrations. Alcohol consumption, smoking, and physical activity were evaluated by questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) measurement and metabolic syndrome criteria were available for all participants.

Results

Most (n = 1123, 74.9%) of the participants showed normal CRP and ESR values. Sixty-nine (4.6%) participants showed high CRP and ESR values. Seventy-two (4.8%) participants showed a discordant pattern of high ESR and normal CRP values, which was associated with age after adjusting for sex, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, and the presence of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 1.052; 95% CI, 1.034–1.071; P < .001). A total of 208 (13.8%) participants showed a discordant pattern of high CRP and normal ESR values, which was associated with BMI after adjusting for covariates (OR, 1.099; 95% CI, 1.064–1.136; P < .001). BMI appeared to be the main determinant of serum CRP concentrations in this population. Serum interleukin-6 concentrations were positively associated with the discordant pattern of high CRP and normal ESR values.

Conclusion

In this general adult population with no overt inflammatory disease, the discordant pattern of high ESR and normal CRP was associated with greater age, whereas the pattern of high CRP and normal ESR was associated with higher BMI.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic performance in a high pretest probability scenario (patients with moderate to severe symptoms suggestive of CD flare [PRO2 > 13 or PRO3 > 21], with 80% prevalence of inflammation) shows that with the cutoff of elevated CRP, generally > 5 mg/L, only approximately 5.4% patients (FP rate) may be misclassified as having endoscopic activity while in endoscopic remission, whereas normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) had FN rates of 26.4%.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114khZJE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — laboratory markers in suspected disease: Anemia and an elevated platelet count are the most common changes seen in the complete blood count; C-reactive protein is elevated in a subset of patients with a short half-life of 19 hours, making CRP a useful marker to detect and monitor inflammation; erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be useful in an individual patient, but it is not predictive of IBD and does not discriminate patients with IBD from those with IBS in healthy controls; up to 40% of patients with IBD with mild inflammation may have a normal CRP and ESR, limiting the usefulness of these markers in monitoring some patients.

### Utility of faecal calprotectin in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): what cut-offs should we apply? [^115nzM2s]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are laboratory investigations which are often employed by clinicians in their determination of probability of patients having an underlying organic bowel disease as opposed to a functional disorder. Using a low CRP cut-off is reported to have improved sensitivity, but poorer specificity, which would lead clinicians to unnecessarily investigate, if used in isolation.ESR has been shown, in other studies, to offer little benefit to the evaluation process for those subjects fulfilling clinical criteria suggestive of IBS. Tibble et al reported that abnormal FC had a significantly greater OR using FC to identify IBD (p < 0.0001) compared with an elevation in CRP and ESR. Our findings support this earlier result by showing greater sensitivity and predictive ability with FC than with ESR and/or CRP to distinguish between functional and organic disorders. This in turn, aids in monitoring of active exacerbations and remission of IBD.

FC is more cost-effective than non-FC strategies in a diagnostic pathway based on a recent systematic evaluation by the Centre for Economic Based Practice 2010 data. Although any quality-adjusted life-year gains were likely to be small due to of the low prevalence of IBD and the high sensitivities of all of the tests, considerable savings could still accrue. Additionally, a recent study of 3639 patients has suggested that the estimated demand for colonoscopies is reduced by 50% with the 50 μg/g cut-off and by 67% with the 100 μg/g cut-off, equating to €1.57 million and €2.13 million, respectively.

Overall our data affirms that the use of FC is beneficial in distinguishing between functional GI conditions (IBS) and organic disease (IBD). In those with IBD, a 250 μg/g cut-off aids in determining clinical disease activity. FC testing like β natriuretic polypeptide used in the diagnosis of cardiac failure, is a useful, relatively economical test benefiting primary and secondary care. It helps to sift out those with organic pathology requiring further investigations, and in those with IBD, aids in disease monitoring, avoidance of invasive procedures and reduction of time off work. The study population was carefully chosen to allow us to validate symptoms and assess all subjects with endoscopy. Further studies are now needed to assess the use in a primary care population.

3.2 Practice points

1 Clinical remission is defined as PUCAI < 10 points, mild disease as 10–34 points, moderate disease as 35–64 points, and severe disease as ≥ 65 points (Supporting Information S5: Table S3) (Agreement 100%).
2 PUCAI at diagnosis can help predict the prognosis of children with UC. A PUCAI < 35 predicts a milder course and a lower rate of endoscopic disease extension, while a PUCAI ≥ 65 is associated with a higher risk of colectomy. Early clinical response to induction therapy predicts longer‐term corticosteroid‐free remission and avoids biologic escalation (Agreement 100%).
3 There is no clear cut‐off value of faecal calprotectin to reflect mucosal inflammation and predict disease outcomes. Values differ substantially in different studies using different reference standards. A cut‐off value < 150 mcg/g is a surrogate marker of remission, while > 250 mcg/g usually reflects mucosal inflammation. Values consistently above 250 mcg/g should prompt consideration of endoscopic evaluation or a therapeutic adjustment on an individual basis, especially when values increase over time and in the presence of clinical symptoms (Agreement 100%).
4 Given the high intraindividual (within‐day and within‐stool) and interindividual variability of faecal calprotectin values, uncertain results (e.g. between 150 and 250 mcg/g or unexpected results based on the clinical symptoms), should prompt repeat measurements (at least 2–4 weeks apart) before considering endoscopic evaluation or therapy change in an asymptomatic patient (Agreement 100%).
5 Blood tests (complete blood count [CBC], albumin, transaminases, gamma‐glutamyl transferase [GGT], C‐reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) should be performed regularly, depending on symptoms and therapy and at least every 3 months while on immunosuppressive/biologic medications or at least every 6 months otherwise. Iron and vitamin D status should be monitored every 6–12 months and following a treatment course. In patients taking mesalamine, it is recommended to include testing for renal function/creatinine after 2–3 months of treatment, and annually thereafter, given the possible risk of mesalamine‐induced acute interstitial nephritis (Agreement 100%).
6 Colonic ultrasound with the measurement of bowel wall thickness (BWT) and blood flow can be added to PUCAI and faecal calprotectin to monitor disease activity based on local availability and expertise. Although data are limited, a BWT < 2 mm is likely indicative of mild or no colonic inflammation (Agreement 100%).
7 In symptomatic patients, it is essential to rule out other potential causes, such as medical non‐adherence, irritable bowel syndrome, medication‐related adverse events, and infections (especially Clostridioides difficile, that is more frequent in active UC and cytomegalovirus [CMV] in patients treated with corticosteroids or other immune‐suppressing agents) before treatment modification (Agreement 100%).
8 A standardised endoscopic activity index, including the Mayo endoscopic sub‐score or Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS), should be used during colonoscopy (Agreement 100%).
9 Histological activity scores (Nancy Index, Robarts Histopathology Index or Geboes Score) do not appear to predict disease course in the first 12 months. However, residual histological activity in otherwise healed mucosa (Mayo endoscopic score 0 and 1) might predict short‐term disease relapse (Agreement 100%).
10 Quality of life (QoL) scores (e.g. IMPACT‐III) and patient‐reported outcome (PRO) measures (such as TUMMY‐UC; Supporting Information S5: Table S4) correlate well with physician‐based measures and are encouraged as part of disease assessment. They are also important for communication between patients and clinicians and can assist in patient engagement and empowerment (Agreement 100%).
