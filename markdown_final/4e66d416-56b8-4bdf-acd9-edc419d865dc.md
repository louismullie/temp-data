## Question

Vit D1

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "vitamin D1" refers to and how to interpret it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "D1" is a standard nomenclature or a mislabel. Then, I should verify the correct vitamin D forms and their nomenclature. Next, I will review how vitamin D status is measured and defined. After that, I should check current guideline positions on screening, thresholds, and supplementation. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable answer and note any exceptions or special populations where interpretation might differ.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we are not conflating labels. "Vitamin D1" is not a standard biochemical designation in contemporary clinical practice. The recognized forms are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), with D3 produced cutaneously and both D2 and D3 available from diet or supplements, so "D1" likely reflects a misnomer or typographical error rather than a distinct compound [^1167Q1RY] [^113XdRxM].

> Wait, let me verify the correct forms and their clinical relevance. Vitamin D3 is the predominant endogenous form synthesized in skin from UV-B exposure, while vitamin D2 is plant-derived and commonly used in some supplements; both are prohormones that require hepatic 25-hydroxylation to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the principal circulating biomarker of status, and then renal 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active hormone, so neither D2 nor D3 is "active" until metabolized in vivo [^1167Q1RY] [^112zzYJM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thresholds; I should confirm how deficiency is defined. Historically, many guidelines defined deficiency as 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) and insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL, but the most recent Endocrine Society prevention guideline explicitly no longer endorses fixed 25(OH)D cut points for disease prevention because randomized trials have not established outcome-linked thresholds, so clinicians should avoid overinterpreting single numeric targets outside of specific bone-health contexts [^115TEChd] [^11535HZz].

> I need to check screening recommendations next. The USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic community-dwelling adults, and the 2024 Endocrine Society guideline similarly recommends against routine 25(OH)D testing in the general population, including adults younger than 50, people with obesity, and those with darker skin tones, absent established indications such as hypocalcemia or specific risk factors [^111UJRQk] [^115QqUNi] [^11535HZz].

> Let me consider supplementation guidance, and I should double-check the populations where empiric use is suggested. The 2024 Endocrine Society suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation beyond the DRI for children and adolescents 1–18 years to prevent rickets and potentially reduce respiratory infections, for adults aged 75 years and older due to potential mortality benefit, for pregnancy due to potential reductions in preeclampsia and some adverse pregnancy outcomes, and for high-risk prediabetes to slow progression to diabetes, while recommending against empiric supplementation above the DRI for generally healthy adults aged 19–74 years. Optimal doses remain uncertain because trial regimens varied and many participants were already vitamin D replete [^113Q5M89] [^116sT4h1].

> But wait, what if the original query truly meant "D1" as a local lab code or a historical artifact; I should confirm that possibility. Some older literature or nonstandard naming systems occasionally used numbered designations, but modern clinical chemistry and endocrine references uniformly use D2 and D3, and any residual ambiguity should be resolved by verifying the exact analyte name and CAS number with the reporting laboratory to ensure we are discussing 25(OH)D rather than a different metabolite or an inactive precursor [^1167Q1RY] [^111CcFYg].

> Next, I should review practical clinical interpretation so I don't overgeneralize. If a 25(OH)D result is clearly low, for example below 20 ng/mL, it is reasonable to treat deficiency with cholecalciferol, typically 50,000 IU weekly for about 8 weeks followed by maintenance dosing, while monitoring calcium if high-dose regimens are used or if risk of hypercalcemia exists. Conversely, if the level is borderline or the patient is asymptomatic without risk factors, empiric low-dose daily supplementation and correction of modifiable risks may suffice without repeat testing in many cases [^114Lxtxc] [^113zRN7e] [^1156xH9f].

> I should confirm safety and toxicity considerations so I don't miss harm. Chronic 25(OH)D concentrations above about 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) raise concern for potential adverse effects, and hypercalcemia is a particular risk at very high levels, so routine use of very large intermittent bolus doses should be avoided outside specific protocols, and daily dosing within the tolerable upper intake level of 4,000 IU/day is generally safe for most adults, with individualized adjustments for adiposity, absorption, and comorbidities [^1128upyg] [^1136hzEY] [^1156xH9f].

> Putting this together, I should state the bottom line clearly. "Vitamin D1" is not a standard clinical term. The user likely means vitamin D2 or D3, and the clinically relevant measure is serum 25(OH)D, interpreted in context of current guidance that de-emphasizes rigid thresholds for extraskeletal outcomes, discourages routine screening in low-risk adults, and supports targeted, population-specific supplementation strategies where evidence suggests potential benefit, with cholecalciferol generally preferred for repletion and maintenance [^1167Q1RY] [^11535HZz] [^113XdRxM].

---

Vitamin D1 is a historical misnomer; **there is no recognized vitamin D1** in current scientific literature or clinical practice. The known forms are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which are the physiologically active compounds used in supplementation and clinical care [^114L9QtN]. If you meant one of these, I can provide a **clarified, clinically focused summary** of their definitions, metabolism, deficiency thresholds, screening, supplementation, and safety, aligned with current guidelines [^114L9QtN].

---

## Clarification of vitamin D nomenclature

Vitamin D1 is not a recognized chemical entity; **the known forms are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)** from plants and fungi and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) from animal sources and skin synthesis. Both require hepatic 25-hydroxylation to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and renal 1α-hydroxylation to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], the active hormone [^1167Q1RY].

---

## Physiological roles of vitamin D

Vitamin D **primarily regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis**, promoting intestinal absorption and bone mineralization. It also has pleiotropic effects on immune function, muscle strength, and cellular proliferation and differentiation [^1167SsYH].

---

## Definition of vitamin D deficiency

Deficiency is defined by serum 25(OH)D levels: **deficiency < 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)** and insufficiency 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/L) [^115TEChd]. Some guidelines previously targeted ≥ 30 ng/mL for optimal health, but recent evidence does not support routine targeting of specific thresholds for extraskeletal outcomes [^11535HZz].

---

## Prevalence and risk factors

Vitamin D deficiency is **common globally**, with prevalence varying by geography, age, skin tone, and lifestyle. Risk factors include limited sun exposure, dark skin, obesity, malabsorption, chronic liver/kidney disease, and certain medications (e.g. anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids) [^1144Ymwq].

---

## Clinical manifestations of deficiency

- **Skeletal**: Rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, osteoporosis, increased fracture risk [^116wNRwz].
- **Extraskeletal**: Muscle weakness, increased fall risk, immune dysfunction, and associations with chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer) [^115QghEB].

---

## Screening and diagnosis

Routine screening is **not recommended** for the general population [^116sT4h1]. Testing is indicated for individuals at risk or with symptoms suggestive of deficiency. Serum 25(OH)D is the primary biomarker for assessing vitamin D status [^1123HSa4].

---

## Supplementation guidelines

| **Population** | **Recommended intake** | **Supplementation guidance** |
|-|-|-|
| Infants (0–12 months) | 400 IU/day | Routine supplementation [^114gUrCM] |
| Children (1–18 years) | 600 IU/day | Routine supplementation [^116sT4h1] |
| Adults (19–70 years) | 600–800 IU/day | Supplementation based on risk and intake [^114gUrCM] |
| Older adults (> 70 years) | 800 IU/day | Routine supplementation [^114gUrCM] |
| Pregnant/lactating women | 600–800 IU/day | Routine supplementation [^116sT4h1] |

---

Supplementation with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is generally preferred due to its **greater potency and longer half-life** than vitamin D2 [^113XdRxM].

---

## Safety and toxicity

Vitamin D is safe at recommended doses, but **excessive intake can cause hypercalcemia**, hypercalciuria, and renal impairment. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for adults is 4,000 IU/day [^111jHwZu]. Toxicity is rare and typically occurs with intake > 10,000 IU/day or serum 25(OH)D > 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L) [^1136hzEY].

---

## Controversies and ongoing research

Controversies include optimal 25(OH)D targets, the role of vitamin D in extraskeletal outcomes, and the necessity of routine screening. Ongoing research aims to clarify dose–response relationships, identify subgroups benefiting from supplementation, and establish evidence-based thresholds for deficiency and sufficiency [^116sT4h1].

---

Vitamin D1 does not exist; **the relevant forms are vitamin D2 and D3**. Current guidance emphasizes targeted testing, risk-based supplementation, and caution with high-dose regimens, while ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of vitamin D's clinical role [^116sT4h1].

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: variability, knowledge gaps, and the concept of a desirable range [^114rfqdw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide but proportions vary widely between regions, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% in variations in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%. Organizations/societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them, but their applicability across age groups and populations are still debated. This article and the accompanying online Supporting Information highlight sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and analytical problems facing 25OHD assays, while keeping efficacy and safety data as the dominant factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels. We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40ng/mL (50 to 100nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while taking season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation into account. We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards. Most target groups reach desirable target levels by a daily intake of 400 to 600IU for children and 800IU for adults. A total daily allowance of vitamin D of up to 1000IU in the pediatric age groups, and up to 2000IU in adults, tailored to an individual patient risk profile, is probably safe over long durations. Additional data are needed to validate the proposed range and vitamin D doses, especially in children, pregnant women, and non-white populations.

Conclusions

In the future, a better definition of the normal ranges of pVitD that also considers the interaction with other mechanisms of CVR, such as PTH, might help to depict a more detailed scenario and more precise impact on CVR. This definition is needed to help us identify those populations for which vitamin D supplementation would indeed be a beneficial therapeutic intervention.

### Contemporary diagnosis and treatment of vitamin D-related disorders [^116eSfsw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Plasma 25(OH)D has emerged as a valuable biomarker for the many varied health-related effects of vitamin D in the clinic mainly because of the recognition of the importance of the enzyme, CYP27B1, or the 25(OH)D-alpha-hydroxylase in the extrarenal, target cell production of calcitriol. This review briefly assesses current methodology for plasma 25(OH)D assay focusing mainly on currrent controversies surrounding the definition of the normal range and performance characteristics of the assay, separate measurement of both 25(OH)D(2) and 25(OH)D(3), and quality assurance tesing of laboratories offering the test. Clinicians have two main types of 25(OH)D assay based on either high-performance liquid chromatography with UV or mass detection or higher throughput kits based on protein (competitive protein binding assay or radioimmunoassay) binding. Based on 30 yr of experience with measuring 25(OH)D levels, it is concluded that, in the hands of appropriately trained experts, both types of assay provide reliable and accurate results, but all laboratories providing 25(OH)D data need frequent external quality assurance service to ensure that this performance is maintained.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11535HZz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — screening and thresholds state that the Society no longer endorses the target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and no longer endorses specific 25(OH)D levels to define vitamin D sufficiency, insufficiency, and deficiency; the panel did not find clinical trial evidence supporting distinct 25(OH)D thresholds tied to outcome-specific benefits. The guideline also suggests against routine 25(OH)D screening (in the absence of well-established indications), including in adults and children with obesity, in adults and children with dark complexions, and during pregnancy.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116uJcoA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider advising intake of at least 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D in adults aged 50–70 and > 70 years, respectively. Insufficient evidence whether 600 and 800 IU/day of vitamin D are enough to provide all of the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D. Recognize that at least 1,500–2,000 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D may be required to raise the blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 30 ng/mL.

Vitamin D Supplementation

Dosing Regimens

The term " dose " in relation to vitamin D is typically used to signify the measured quantity of vitamin D (usually cholecalciferol, but other formulations such as ergocalciferol, eldecalcitol, calcifediol, etc are also available) in a pill. It is expressed as µg or IU (where 10 µg is 400 IU). The dose of cholecalciferol is considered an important measure as it correlates with the change in blood 25(OH)D level, which is commonly used to define vitamin D status and correlates with important clinical outcomes. Doses can be considered as "loading" or "maintenance". The most common use of a loading dose is to rapidly improve a low blood 25(OH)D; however, the clinical wisdom of this approach is questionable, especially given studies that demonstrate adverse effects with very high doses given infrequently, as discussed next. Intermittent administration of large doses is also used to optimize adherence. Daily doses are generally preferred when vitamin D replacement is considered necessary. The effect of a given dose on changing blood 25(OH)D varies considerably from person to person due to many factors, such as body weight, absorption, diet, degree of adiposity, CYP2R1 activity, DBP. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D by the National Academy of Medicine is set at 400 to 800 IU per day, and the tolerable upper intake level at 4000 IU per day; however, the "optimal" dose of vitamin D varies by the desired outcome, and other authors suggest that the upper limit of safety may be lower than 4000 IU per day. For example, 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day may be adequate to avoid clinical vitamin D deficiency and maintain calcium homeostasis in healthy individuals. Doses of vitamin D higher than the recommended upper limit may be associated with toxicity; nonetheless, daily doses up to 10 000 IU have been used without safety concerns. Careful and judicious use of vitamin D will permit the realization of potential benefits and achieving optimal outcomes.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a 2019 evidence analysis center evidence-based practice guideline [^114dXeob]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) vitamin D guidance — recommendation strength and evidence scope are outlined as follows: "Conclusion statements supporting both recommendations are Grade II, Fair". For the COPD exacerbation assessment recommendation, "synthesis of the results was challenging due to lack of consistency in vitamin D dosing, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and baseline serum 25(OH)D levels". The supporting evidence was developed from specified questions: "What associations exist between serum 25(OH)D levels and mortality, lung function and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD?" and "Does vitamin D supplementation improve lung function and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD?"

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^1136hzEY]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In healthy individuals, hypervitaminosis D is usually defined as "exogenous" as it develops after uncontrolled use of megadoses of vitamin D or its metabolites or analogues, as in case of high dose of calcifediol leading to a faster increase in 25(OH)D serum levels compared with cholecalciferol but easier to manage than cholecalciferol in case of toxicity for its hydrophilicity and lesser sequestration in adipose tissue. On the other hand, excessive production of calcitriol in granulomatous disorders, lymphomas, primary hyperparathyroidism, and idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia results in "endogenous" hypervitaminosis D.

VDT is defined by a biochemical phenotype with markedly elevated calcifediol concentrations (> 150 ng/mL or > 375 nmol/L), along with dihydroxylated metabolites (24,25(OH)₂D₃; 25,26(OH)₂D₃, 25(OH)D₃–26,23-lactone), unless the causal agents are vitamin D analogues, such as paricalcitol. Calcitriol levels may be in the normal reference range or even reduced in exogenous VDT while elevated in endogenous VDT. PTH levels can be very low or undetectable. VDT thus results in severe hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Pathogenetically, hypercalcemia is a consequence of high calcifediol levels in exogenous VDT (with calcifediol at pharmacological concentrations overcoming VDR affinity disadvantages and/or displacing 1,25(OH)D 2 from DBP), while high calcitriol levels cause endogenous VDT. Exogenous factors that interact with VDT risk include dosage, calcium in the diet or as a supplement, vitamin D intake with the diet, social status (ie, neglected patients), artificial UV light treatment sessions, quantity of supplement use, and time of exposure. Endogenous risk factors comprise age, sex, vitamin D status, hypersensitivity syndromes, and the pharmacogenetics of the vitamin D response and metabolism. This is why there is no clear cutoff above which VDT occurs and below which it does not.

### Association of vitamin D levels, race / ethnicity, and clinical characteristics with COVID-19 test results [^113D6uQP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D has diverse physiological effects, including on calcium regulation, bone density, and immune function. Deficient levels, typically defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (also known as calcifediol) level less than 20 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496), are common, especially in Black individuals, and some expert opinions define sufficient levels as 30 ng/mL or greater or 40 ng/mL or greater. Definitions of vitamin D deficiency and supplementation guidelines have been largely informed by effects on bone health from mostly White populations, and Black individuals have been reported to preserve bone health even with lower vitamin D levels, calling into question the notion that functional vitamin D deficiency is more common in Black individuals than White individuals. However, vitamin D is also important for immune function, and a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials using daily or weekly dosinghas found vitamin D supplementation was associated with substantially decreased viral respiratory infections, especially in individuals who were deficient in vitamin D, but also individuals without a deficient level. There is no evidence that immune function is better preserved with low vitamin D levels in Black individuals than in White individuals. This is especially important currently because deficient vitamin D levels have been associated with increased COVID-19 incidence and worse outcomes, especially in Black, Hispanic, and other non-White populations, who have also borne a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. Evidence on whether vitamin D levels above the deficient range are associated with COVID-19 risk, and whether such associations differ between White individuals and individuals of other races, could inform the design of randomized clinical trials to test whether vitamin D supplementation reduces COVID-19 riskand clinical decision-making before completion of such trials.

We used data from the electronic health record at the University of Chicago Medicine (UCM) in Chicago, Illinois, to examine whether the likelihood of a positive COVID-19 test was associated a person's most recent vitamin D level within 365 days before COVID-19 testing, and whether such associations were present for White individuals and for Black individuals. Because more distant level may be less informative of level at the time of COVID-19 testing, analyses controlled for the timing of the most recent measurement and changes in vitamin D treatment after that level and before COVID-19 testing.

### Vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117Dv1th]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to prevention of fractures, USPSTF 2018 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of vitamin D (> 400 IU/day) and calcium (> 1,000 mg/day) supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal females.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^114ggUfB]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D status classification — Table 5 links 25(OH)-D levels to categories as follows: severe deficiency ≤ 12.5 nmol/L (5 ng/mL), deficiency ≤ 37.5 nmol/L (15 ng/mL), insufficiency 37.5–50 nmol/L (15–20 ng/mL), sufficiency 50–250 nmol/L (20–100 ng/mL), excess > 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL), and intoxication ≥ 375 nmol/L (150 ng/mL); adult data indicate that a level of > 80 nmol/L (> 32 ng/mL) is desirable, and excess is noted as an admittedly arbitrary designation.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111cYEcX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider keeping the maintenance tolerable upper limits of vitamin D, and advise not to exceed without medical supervision, at 4,000 IU/day in adults. Recognize that higher levels of 10,000 IU/day may be required to correct vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114yJPbG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — trial design and measurement limitations: Expected greater benefit at lower baseline 25(OH)D contrasted with few randomized controlled trials in low-baseline populations, and many large trials had adequate baseline levels (eg, 25(OH)D 31 ng/mL [78 nmol/L]). Control groups were routinely exposed to vitamin D via sun and diet and many trials allowed continued supplements reflecting the DRI (eg, 600–800 IU [15–20 μg] daily for adults), which the panel notes may bias results toward the null. Most trials lacked a specific 25(OH)D eligibility threshold and were not designed or powered for subgroup analyses by baseline or achieved 25(OH)D; accordingly, the commissioned review does not include subgroup analyses by average baseline 25(OH)D. Additional constraints included insufficient duration to assess long-latency chronic disease outcomes and heterogeneity of doses and schedules, precluding specific dose recommendations (with doses summarized in technical remarks).

Ranges for normal and abnormal blood vitamin D concentrations — The page states that 25(OH)-D is the major circulating form of vitamin D and the best available indicator of total body vitamin D status; it notes the half-life of 25(OH)-D is 2 to 3 weeks, whereas 1,25(OH)2-D has a half-life of only 4 hours, and emphasizes that the latter is not a good indicator of vitamin D stores.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — population and generalizability limitations: Most study participants were largely of European ancestry or identified as non-Hispanic White, with few trials enrolling large numbers from other races or ethnicities. Age-grouping used for clinical questions (< 50 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older) was somewhat arbitrary and many trials spanned categories, making it challenging to apply results narrowly. Many trials among those older than 50 years combined vitamin D with calcium, complicating isolation of vitamin D's effects, and resource limitations meant not all outcomes were addressed in all populations.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

Screening for low vitamin D status with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) testing — definitions and utilization: Vitamin D deficiency is traditionally defined clinically as having symptoms and signs of rickets or osteomalacia, but prevalence estimates vary by laboratory threshold; if defined as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (50.0 nmol/L), 24% of US adults meet the criterion, whereas if defined as < 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L), 6% of US adults would be considered vitamin D–deficient. Test utilization has risen, with 25(OH)D testing increasing from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 0.27–0.31) in 2008 to 1.61 per 1000 person-years at risk (95% CI, 1.59–1.62) in 2015; the panel prioritized 3 clinical questions related to screening thresholds and whether treatment should be limited to individuals below a threshold.

### Effect of vitamin D on falls: a meta-analysis [^115hQwiT]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Falls among elderly individuals occur frequently, increase with age, and lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. The role of vitamin D in preventing falls among elderly people has not been well established.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of vitamin D in preventing an older person from falling.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from January 1960 to February 2004, EMBASE from January 1991 to February 2004, clinical experts, bibliographies, and abstracts. Search terms included trial terms: randomized-controlled trial or controlled-clinical trial or random-allocation or double-blind method, or single-blind method or uncontrolled-trials with vitamin D terms: cholecalciferol or hydroxycholecalciferols or calcifediol or dihydroxycholecalciferols or calcitriol or vitamin D/aa[analogs & derivates] or ergocalciferol or vitamin D/bl[blood]; and with accidental falls or falls, and humans.

Study Selection

We included only double-blind randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D in elderly populations (mean age, 60 years) that examined falls resulting from low trauma for which the method of fall ascertainment and definition of falls were defined explicitly. Studies including patients in unstable health states were excluded. Five of 38 identified studies were included in the primary analysis and 5 other studies were included in a sensitivity analysis.

Data Extraction

Independent extraction by 3 authors using predefined data fields including study quality indicators.

Data Synthesis

Based on 5 RCTs involving 1237 participants, vitamin D reduced the corrected odds ratio (OR) of falling by 22% (corrected OR, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.92) compared with patients receiving calcium or placebo. From the pooled risk difference, the number needed to treat (NNT) was 15 (95% CI, 8–53), or equivalently 15 patients would need to be treated with vitamin D to prevent 1 person from falling. The inclusion of 5 additional studies, involving 10 001 participants, in a sensitivity analysis resulted in a smaller but still significant effect size (corrected RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96). Subgroup analyses suggested that the effect size was independent of calcium supplementation, type of vitamin D, duration of therapy, and sex, but reduced sample sizes made the results statistically nonsignificant for calcium supplementation, cholecalciferol, and among men.

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation appears to reduce the risk of falls among ambulatory or institutionalized older individuals with stable health by more than 20%. Further studies examining the effect of alternative types of vitamin D and their doses, the role of calcium supplementation, and effects in men should be considered.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112cezVV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D prevention guideline — scope and evidence methods: The guideline addresses use of vitamin D to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing, assumes the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine dietary reference intakes (DRIs) as a baseline standard, and focuses on adults ages 19 to 49 years, 50 to 74 years, and 75 years and older; populations examined include pregnant individuals and those with prediabetes, dark complexion, and obesity, and questions include daily versus intermittent dosing and whether to limit supplementation to those below a circulating 25(OH)D threshold. Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prioritized; large (≥ 1000 participants) longitudinal cohort studies with appropriate comparators were considered when RCTs were insufficient, while trials of vitamin D analogs or metabolites and Mendelian randomization studies were excluded. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and the Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, including stakeholder values, costs, acceptability, feasibility, and equity, were used to assess certainty and inform recommendations.

### Standardizing vitamin D assays: the way forward [^1172k3oe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

For a number of years it has been widely assumed that measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the best approach to assessing an individual's vitamin D status. However, it has also been recognized that there is substantial within-assay variation in 25(OH)D measurement and even greater between-assay variability. Such assay variation clearly confounds attempts to define what constitutes the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Importantly, assay variability makes pooling of 25(OH)D results from different studies in systematic reviews for the specific purpose of determining dose-response and/or clinical cut points at best problematic. Therefore, to develop and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, it is essential that 25(OH)D measurement be standardized in both clinical and research laboratories. In this Perspective we outline a way forward toward achieving this goal-the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).

### Vitamin D and child health part 1 (skeletal aspects) [^1174bRGV]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable clinical and academic interest in vitamin D as a consequence of a number of developments over the past decade. This was initially related to a recognised resurgence of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in children in the UK and other countries. The potential importance of maternal vitamin D status on bone mass in early childhood and the effect of vitamin D supplementation on peak bone mass has been the subject of much research. An additional development has been the recognition that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and what level should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review consists of two parts, the first focuses on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D, while the second will review some of the potential extraskeletal aspects, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

Uncertainties and Future Research Needs

The Committee identified a large number of uncertainties surrounding the DRI values, as well as extensive research needs. A particular priority is rigorous, large-scale, randomized clinical trials to test the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal outcomes, as well as to identify threshold effects and possible adverse effects where present. Elucidating the biology of the diverse effects of vitamin D, as well as effects of sun exposure, adiposity, body composition, race/ethnicity, and genetic factors on these associations, is also of great importance.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

### The role of vitamin D in reducing cancer risk and progression [^111W9PYo]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2014). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is not really a vitamin but the precursor to the potent steroid hormone calcitriol, which has widespread actions throughout the body. Calcitriol regulates numerous cellular pathways that could have a role in determining cancer risk and prognosis. Although epidemiological and early clinical trials are inconsistent, and randomized control trials in humans do not yet exist to conclusively support a beneficial role for vitamin D, accumulating results from preclinical and some clinical studies strongly suggest that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of developing cancer and that avoiding deficiency and adding vitamin D supplements might be an economical and safe way to reduce cancer incidence and improve cancer prognosis and outcome.

### Optimal vitamin D status: a critical analysis on the basis of evidence-based medicine [^114aveQL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Public health authorities around the world recommend widely variable supplementation strategies for adults, whereas several professional organizations, including The Endocrine Society, recommend higher supplementation.

Methods

We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health.

Conclusions

The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies. However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The greatest risk for cancer, infections, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels below 20 ng/mL. There is ample evidence from RCTs that calcium and bone homeostasis, estimated from serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH, calcium absorption, or bone mass, can be normalized by 25OHD levels above 20 ng/mL. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation (800 IU/d) in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20%. Such a dose will bring serum levels of 25OHD above 20 ng/mL in nearly all postmenopausal women. Based on calculations of the metabolic clearance of 25OHD, a daily intake of 500–700 IU of vitamin D3 is sufficient to maintain serum 25OHD levels of 20 ng/mL. Therefore, the recommendations for a daily intake of 1500–2000 IU/d or serum 25OHD levels of 30 ng or higher for all adults or elderly subjects, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Task Force, are premature. Fortunately, ongoing RCTs will help to guide us to solve this important public health question.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

### From vitamin D to hormone D: fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system essential for good health [^111Mq8q3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

New knowledge of the biological and clinical importance of the steroid hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1α,25(OH)₂D₃] and its receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has resulted in significant contributions to good bone health. However, worldwide reports have highlighted a variety of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency diseases. Despite many publications and scientific meetings reporting advances in vitamin D science, a disturbing realization is growing that the newer scientific and clinical knowledge is not being translated into better human health. Over the past several decades, the biological sphere of influence of vitamin D(3), as defined by the tissue distribution of the VDR, has broadened at least 9-fold from the target organs required for calcium homeostasis (intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid). Now, research has shown that the pluripotent steroid hormone 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) initiates the physiologic responses of ≥ 36 cell types that possess the VDR. In addition to the kidney's endocrine production of circulating 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3,) researchers have found a paracrine production of this steroid hormone in ≥ 10 extrarenal organs. This article identifies the fundamentals of the vitamin D endocrine system, including its potential for contributions to good health in 5 physiologic arenas in which investigators have clearly documented new biological actions of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) through the VDR. As a consequence, the nutritional guidelines for vitamin D(3) intake (defined by serum hydroxyvitamin D(3) concentrations) should be reevaluated, taking into account the contributions to good health that all 36 VDR target organs can provide.

### Vitamin D requirements: current and future [^1122fbxx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

The requirements for vitamin D were last set in 1997 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Intakes were assumed to come from diet, and values were based on achievement of adequate vitamin D status and on observed values to prevent seasonal variations in parathyroid hormone concentrations. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were considered the best indicator of vitamin D adequacy, because the production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is not regulated. Normal ranges were obtained from reference populations, but the values varied widely with age and geographic region. Revised recommendations should take into consideration appropriate functional measures for multiple tissues and disease risks. Vitamin D-calcium interdependencies must be taken into account. Higher intakes of both vitamin D and calcium can reduce bone resorption, and higher concentrations of one nutrient might compensate for insufficiency in the other. Better ways to assess vitamin D (and calcium) inputs are needed. Food composition databases are incomplete for both vitamin D and calcium, especially in this era of food fortification, and are complicated by the poor quality control for vitamin D fortification. Upper levels of vitamin D intake were set at 50 microg/d (2000 IU/d) for all ages. Some individuals would require higher levels than these to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations for optimal calcium absorption. So much new information on vitamin D and health has been collected since the requirements were set in 1997 that this nutrient is likely the most in need of revised requirements.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^1128upyg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Serum 25OHD Levels and Screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care. For upper levels of serum 25OHD, sparse data are available, particularly regarding long-term effects of chronically high concentrations, and a margin of safety for public health recommendations is prudent. Thus, serum 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter) should raise concerns among clinicians about potential adverse effects.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^111jHwZu]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 5: Micronutrients — vitamin D in chronic kidney disease (CKD) outlines threshold definitions, testing, supplementation, and safety. Some, but not all, guidelines have defined insufficiency of vitamin D by serum 25(OH)D level between 20 and 29 ng/mL, deficiency as 25(OH)D level < 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency as serum 25(OH)D level ≥ 30 ng/mL. Both the KDOQI and KDIGO reports recommend checking and supplementing low serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with CKD and dialysis patients. In the most recent update of the KDIGO guideline on MBD, it is suggested based on low-quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 1–5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be individualized according to baseline values and interventions; however, there was no clear suggestion on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed. Current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1–5D and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population, and it has been recommended for 1,000 to 2,000 IU/d of cholecalciferol for vitamin D repletion for the general population, although KDOQI acknowledges that patients with CKD may require a more aggressive therapeutic plan. Because in CKD there is no clear evidence about the superiority of cholecalciferol, clinicians should use the form commercially available in the context of their clinical practice. The tolerable upper intake level proposed by the IOM for the general population is 4,000 IU/d, there is no recommendation of a safe dose of cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol supplementation to prevent toxicity or adverse effects such as hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia in CKD, and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered, especially for patients who are using calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or vitamin D active analogues.

### Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and association with metabolic syndrome in a Qatari population [^112rru11]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent worldwide and is associated with many adverse health outcomes. Vitamin D is acquired in three ways; from sun exposure, diet and supplements; however, the greatest proportion is obtained from sun exposure. For example, exposure to 0.5 minimal erythemal dose is equivalent to supplementing ~3000 IU of vitamin D 3. One of the main physiological functions of vitamin D is to maintain calcium and phosphorous levels in the body to sustain various metabolic functions, including bone metabolism. The most abundant circulating biomarker of vitamin D status is 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which also has a longer half-life (25 days) compared to the active metabolite; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (7 h). However, the threshold used to define vitamin D deficiency often varies according to the population and outcome of interest. The most common definition for optimal 25(OH)D levels is the concentration at which it supresses the parathyroid hormone to its minimum, however, using this definition results in a wide range of minimal optimal values from 12 ng mL −1 to 40 ng mL −1.

### Vitamin D-update for the pediatric rheumatologists [^112Dux9s]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

One century after its discovery and three Nobel prizes awarded for discoveries in this topic, we have clear evidences that the so-called vitamin D is in fact a pleiotropic steroid hormone similar to other steroid hormones. Unfortunately, its primary classification into the vitamins still deeply influences our professional perception about 1,25(OH)2D biological function and impact on the occurrence and outcome of the some rheumatic diseases. It is necessary to distinguish cholecaliferol (commonly called vitamin D), a nutritional precursor compound, from the 1,25(OH)2D-vitamin D hormonal form. This hormonal form is synthetized after a complex, endocrine-regulated biochemical process. This 1,25(OH)2D D hormone has its own endocrine, paracrine and autocrine control. As hormone is defined as a chemical substance produced in one part of the body that stimulates functional activity in another part, it is clear that what we call vitamin D does not fulfill the vitamin definition criteria but rather those for a hormone. We will discuss the biologic roles of vitamin D in this review as that of the D hormone.

When prescribing medication for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, most of pediatric rheumatologists do not recommend vitamins as mandatory, including vitamin D. Yet newer scientific studies may soon change that approach. Beside regulation of calcium homeostasis and bone turnover, the D hormone has proven antiproliferative, pro-differentiation, anti-bacterial, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties within the body in various cells and tissues. This effects can be achieved only if the D hormone (1,25(OH)2D) itself, or its agonist, is bound to vitamin D receptor (VDR). The discovery that vitamin D receptor agonists possess immunomodulatory and anti-tumor properties prompted research to investigate the possibility that these agonists might be used as a therapeutic agent for different autoimmune and malignant diseases.

### Treatment failure of active vitamin D therapy in chronic kidney disease: predictive factors [^117TRGvZ]. American Journal of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), impaired renal function leads to decreased vitamin D levels, which causes an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) production and contributes to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). This may result in adverse clinical effects such as bone disorders, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality. Current treatment practices and associated outcomes with active vitamin D treatment in patients with CKD were reviewed with the objective to assess parameters (such as PTH and serum calcium levels) that may be used to define the failure of vitamin D treatment.

Summary

Reports based on observational data have noted improved outcomes with active vitamin D treatment (calcitriol, paricalcitol, alfacalcidol, or doxercalciferol) in patients with CKD. Criteria for the identification of active vitamin D treatment failure are unclear from current guidelines, although up to 50% of patients may experience treatment failure eventually because of development of hypercalcemia or resistant SHPT, characterized by an elevated intact PTH (iPTH) level despite treatment. We propose a definition of vitamin D treatment failure as iPTH > 600 pg/ml after 6 months of intravenous active vitamin D treatment and corrected total calcium serum levels > 10.2 mg/dl, and review factors that may predict the response to vitamin D treatment. Key Message: Active vitamin D treatment failure is an important challenge in clinical practice. The aim of the proposed definition is to suggest a possible framework for hypothesis generation and to encourage further research into this common problem.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Q5M89]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Vitamin D for the prevention of disease lists population-specific empiric supplementation as follows: Ages 1–18 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" "To prevent nutritional rickets and because of the potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections", Ages 19–49 state "No empiric vitamin D supplementation" with "Follow the Institute of Medicine Recommended Daily Allowance", Ages 50–74 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation", Ages ≥ 75 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of mortality", Pregnancy indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age birth and neonatal mortality", and Prediabetes indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of progression to diabetes". Empiric vitamin D supplementation* is defined on-page as vitamin D (D3 or D2) intake that exceeds the DRI and is implemented without testing for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and doses in trials varied so optimal doses remain unclear.

### Vitamin D insufficiency and epistemic humility: an endocrine society guideline communication [^1113S3oR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

A long-held precept is that vitamin D supplementation primarily, if not exclusively, benefits individuals with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at baseline. However, the most appropriate 25(OH)D threshold to distinguish unacceptably low vs reliably adequate concentrations remains controversial. Such threshold proposals have largely been based on observational studies, which provide less robust evidence compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Since the Endocrine Society's first vitamin D-related guideline was published in 2011, several large vitamin D-related RCTs have been published, and a newly commissioned guideline development panel (GDP) prioritized 4 clinical questions related to the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in generally healthy individuals with 25(OH)D levels below a threshold. The GDP determined that available clinical trial evidence does not permit the establishment of 25(OH)D thresholds that specifically predict meaningful benefit with vitamin D supplementation. The panel noted important limitations in the available evidence, and the panel's overall certainty in the available evidence was very low. Nonetheless, based on the GDP's analyses and judgments, the Endocrine Society no longer endorses its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "sufficiency" (ie, at least 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]) or its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "insufficiency" (ie, greater than 20ng/mL [50nmol/L] but lower than 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]). The Endocrine Society's rationale for such is the subject of this Guideline Communication.

### Screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111UJRQk]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that performs an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism and also affects many other cellular regulatory functions outside the skeletal system. Vitamin D requirements may vary by individual; thus, no one serum vitamin D level cutpoint defines deficiency, and no consensus exists regarding the precise serum levels of vitamin D that represent optimal health or sufficiency.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening for vitamin D deficiency, including the benefits and harms of screening and early treatment.

Population

Community-dwelling, nonpregnant adults who have no signs or symptoms of vitamin D deficiency or conditions for which vitamin D treatment is recommended.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the overall evidence on the benefits of screening for vitamin D deficiency is lacking. Therefore, the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults. (I statement).

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^111HyF5g]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Skeletal and extraskeletal actions of vitamin D: current evidence and outstanding questions [^111AQbcu]. Endocrine Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

"There is at present no consensus regarding the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on muscle function, balance, and risks of falls".

In contrast, Bolland et al. concluded from their meta-analysis that the effect estimated for vitamin D on falls lies within the futility boundary, which they defined as not altering relative risk by 15% or more. A recent post hoc analysis of falls in a large New Zealand (VIDA) study revealed that supplementation with 100,000 IU monthly for 3.4 years had no effect on risk of falling or fractures. The mean baseline serum 25OHD level of these subjects was 63 nmol/L, and less than one-third of all participants started with serum 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L.

High-dose vitamin D supplementation, however, may increase the risk of falling. This was first observed by Sanders et al. in elderly subjects treated with a single oral dose of 500,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or placebo once a year. The vitamin D–treated group had significantly more falls and fractures during the first 3 months after each loading dose during the 4-year treatment period compared with the placebo group. Smith et al. found that supplementation with 300,000 IU of vitamin D 2 annually by intramuscular injection had no effect on fall risk but increased fracture risk. In elderly women with baseline vitamin D deficiency, monthly doses of vitamin D greater than the equivalent of 800 IU/d for 1 year increased the risk of falls from 48% in the group treated with 24,000 IU monthly (equivalent to 800 IU/d) to 67% in the group treated with 60,000 IU/mo (equivalent to 2000 IU/d) and 66% in the group treated with 24,000 IU of vitamin D 3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol per month. The authors concluded from a post hoc analysis that serum 25OHD concentrations higher than 112.5 nmol/L may be associated with an increased risk of falls. Ginde et al. treated 107 long-term care seniors with 100,000 IU of vitamin D 3 per month or placebo for 12 months. The monthly vitamin D decreased the rate of acute infections by 40% (primary endpoint) but doubled the rate of falls (secondary endpoint). Smith et al. examined fall rates in 146 elderly white women (mean baseline serum 25OHD level of 38 nmol/L) treated with a full range of daily vitamin D 3 doses (from 400 to 4800 IU) or placebo for 1 year. Falls were assessed by daily calendar and phone calls every three months. They found a U-shaped association with falls, the nadir of which occurred in the dose range of 1600 to 3200 IU/d. Fall rates in the higher doses, 4000 and 4800 IU/d, were significantly higher than those in the nadir. In contrast, among 91 African American women in the same study, there was no U-shaped association. Rather there was a progressive decline in percentage of fallers with increasing vitamin D dose, with the lowest rate occurring in the women taking 4000 to 4800 IU/d. This study had a small sample size for the number of dose groups but high-quality fall assessment.

### Vitamin D: effects on childhood health and disease [^111J2DAH]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is a key nutrient for both healthy children and those with chronic illnesses. Understanding its roles in health and disease has become one of the most important issues in the nutritional management of children. Formal guidelines related to nutrient requirements for vitamin D in healthy children, recommending dietary intakes of 400 IU per day for infants and 600 IU per day for children over 1 year of age, were released by the Institute of Medicine in November 2010. However, application of these guidelines to children with acute and chronic illnesses is less clear. In this Review, we consider major illness categories and specific examples of conditions in children that might be affected by vitamin D. This information can be used in developing both model systems of investigation and clinical trials of vitamin D in children with acute and chronic illnesses.

### Vitamin D receptor signaling and cancer [^111Vdsqd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS AND SUMMARY

Enthusiasm remains for exploiting vitamin D signaling in cancer systems. This partly reflects that the biology is now very well-understood, that the toxicities associated with vitamin D compounds are easily monitored and managed and that in an era of high dimensional biological data it is possible to measure and dissect the actions of VDR signaling in very great detail. It seems likely that efforts will continue to exploit vitamin D compounds in the clinical setting, and it may well be that by exploiting tools to very accurately measure tumor type and burden will allow vitamin D-centered therapies to be applied with great precision. It seems likely that among the actions of VDR, the immunomodulatory capacity may ultimately be the ones that are most advantageous in cancer therapies.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114gUrCM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines to clinicians for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency with an emphasis on the care of patients who are at risk for deficiency.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a Chair, six additional experts, and a methodologist. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during several conference calls and e-mail communications. The draft prepared by the Task Force was reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Core Committee, and cosponsoring associations, and it was posted on The Endocrine Society web site for member review. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

Considering that vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups and that few foods contain vitamin D, the Task Force recommended supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable upper limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances. The Task Force also suggested the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test in patients at risk for deficiency. Treatment with either vitamin D(2) or vitamin D(3) was recommended for deficient patients. At the present time, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk for deficiency or to prescribe vitamin D to attain the noncalcemic benefit for cardiovascular protection.

### Chronic kidney disease and vitamin D: how much is adequate? [^112NCWjg]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Mehrotra et al. demonstrate that there still is hypovitaminosis D in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the United States, and this defect is associated with increased risk for death. Definition of the adequate amount of vitamin D, however, is still uncertain; polymorphisms of the gene encoding the vitamin D receptor might be responsible for this uncertainty. People carrying less efficient variants of the receptor might need higher amounts of vitamin D.

### Official recommendations for vitamin D through the life stages in developed countries [^113yNH2n]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Inadequate vitamin D nutritional status is prevalent worldwide and has been associated with autoimmune disorders, heart disease, deadly cancers, insulin resistance, inflammation, neurological disorders, adverse outcomes in pregnancy, and increased risk for mortality. Expert recommendations for vitamin D intake differ between governmental agencies and practice guidelines from medical societies due to differences in the definition of vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency based on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. In addition, separate health promotion bodies also provide targeted recommendations for the prevention of specific disorders such as reducing risk for developing some cancers and autoimmune diseases. We review and provide perspectives regarding various recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (IOM, United States) and Health Canada, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN; United Kingdom), the World Health Organization, the Endocrine Society and other expert groups by life stage as a guide intended for clinician use.

CKD: Implementation considerations for vitamin D include commonly used laboratory thresholds and monitoring guidance: For most experts, vitamin D insufficiency is defined as a serum 25(OH)D level between 20â€" 29 ng/mL, deficiency is considered as 25(OH)D levels of less than 20 ng/mL, and sufficiency serum 25(OH)D equal or greater than 30 ng/mL; it is suggested based on low quality evidence that patients with CKD stages 3â€"5D have 25(OH)D levels measured, and repeated testing should be based on baseline values and therapeutic interventions, with no consensus on how frequently 25(OH)D levels should be reviewed; current guidelines suggest that patients with CKD stages 1â€"5D and vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency should receive supplementation using the same strategies recommended for the general population; the tolerable upper intake levels (UL) proposed by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for the general population is 4,000 IU/day; and periodic measurement of serum calcium and phosphorus should be considered especially for patients who are on calcium-containing phosphate binders and/or on vitamin D active analogs.

### Vitamin D supplementation: cholecalciferol, calcifediol, and calcitriol [^113XdRxM]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

The specific compound that is meant for use in the context of vitamin D supplementation is often ambiguous. The term "supplementation" has been used in the context of cholecalciferol, ergocalciferol, calcidiol, and calcitriol. In nature, by far the major form of vitamin D that nurtures the body is cholecalciferol. In contrast, ergocalciferol is primarily a synthetic and less stable product which is less potent per microgram dose than is cholecalciferol. Calcidol is the major circulating metabolite of cholecalciferol, while calcitriol is the hormone that upregulates the active transport of calcium from the gut, and which suppresses parathyroid hormone secretion. Nutrition policy papers and guidelines leave unstated the obvious fact that calcidiol and calcitriol are not nutrients, and that those metabolites are not pertinent to food fortification or dietary supplementation. Recent evidence shows that ergocalciferol is not stable with storage, and it is far more susceptible to breakdown with cooking and baking than is cholecalciferol. Therefore, it must be concluded that cholecalciferol is the only form of vitamin D that should be considered in the context of the nutritional functions of fortification and supplementation.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^111rZo4X]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D excess and intoxication — definitions and thresholds are outlined with specific serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)-D] levels. Individuals with 25(OH)-D levels of ≥ 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) are described as having vitamin D excess and as being at risk for intoxication, while some laboratories set an upper limit of normal at 200 nmol/L (80 ng/mL). Observational contexts note that sunbathers and lifeguards can have 25(OH)-D levels of > 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) without evidence of intoxication, and supplementation leading to 25(OH)-D levels of 250 nmol/L (100 ng/mL) is not associated with harmful effects. Conversely, hypercalcemia is definitely associated with 25(OH)-D levels of > 325 nmol/L (150 ng/mL).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

Table 1.
Populations at risk of vitamin D deficiency according to a clinical approach

Screening and testing vitamin D status — conclusions

Screening the general population for vitamin D deficiency is very expensive and does not result in practical clinical benefits. 25(OH)D measurements have primarily been indicated in patients with musculoskeletal disorders, but the increased awareness of potential pleiotropic effects has widened the interest in screening, although without any definitive evidence.

The most important risk factors in the general population, as identified by recent studies, include low ambient UV radiation, low vitamin D intake, and gene polymorphisms. Their inclusion as primary risk factors in risk stratification approaches to assess vitamin D status will help effectively target 25(OH)D assessment in those most in need and at risk. Finally, further studies — including those with health economic measures — are warranted to best identify all the situations in which the assessment of vitamin D status is actually needed — or not.

Methods: Assays, Thresholds, and Standardization

Accuracy and precision of vitamin D measurements are crucial to properly use the values obtained in biological fluids. The laboratory methods should be detailed in clinical trials, scientific papers, and even in the reports released to physicians and patients. The measurements could be obtained by either antibody-based methods (chemiluminescent or immunoenzymatic) or by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS or LC-MS/MS), with the latter giving more consistent and accurate results; regardless, the reference material should also be indicated in the report. The laboratory should define the reference values considering the method used for analyzing the molecule(s). The unit of measure (molar or mass) should be clearly indicated. The mol/L unit should be preferred as the SI standard unit; alternatively, both mol/L and ng/mL should be reported. Moreover, the critical difference (or least significance change), or reference change values, that is, the value (percentage) testifying to a real modification of the molecule(s) concentration between 2 consecutive measurements, assayed with the same method, in the same patient, and, on the contrary, that the modification is not only dependent from analytical and biological variability (natural oscillation of values in individuals), should be known and properly considered.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Understanding vitamin D deficiency [^1163Tpwm]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

National guidance on the management of vitamin D

Unsurprisingly, this has led to controversy and confusion in the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK. We therefore welcome, in this edition, an authoritative practical clinical guideline by the National Osteoporosis Society UK on the management of vitamin D deficiency. The guideline has been designed to help will clinicians, including doctors, nurses, dieticians and other practising clinicians containing key recommendations around
best way of estimating vitamin D status;
recommendations for vitamin D testing;
threshold definitions for vitamin D deficiency;
treatment of choice for vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency;
guidance on maintenance therapy;
guidance on monitoring blood tests.

In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is a major health problem, with a plethora of conflicting guidance, and inconsistent clinical management across the UK. We welcome this authoritative guidance, which will help towards better care and management of their patients.

Key points

The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high world-wide, particularly in the elderly.
25OHD is the best marker of vitamin D status and is defined as a 25OHD < 30 nmol/l.
The primary role of vitamin D is the maintenance of extracellular fluid calcium concentrations, but more recently it has been associated with many other conditions.
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with muscle weakness predominantly of the proximal muscle groups through both genomic and non-genomic pathways.
Muscle weakness due to vitamin deficiency is reversible with vitamin D supplementation.
Recent National guidance has been published on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease in the UK.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^111XQeK2]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

Vitamin D Metabolism and Mechanism of Action

Metabolism

Vitamin D₃ is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), while both vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) can be present in the diet. Vitamin D₂ and D₃ are hydroxylated first in the liver (and other tissues) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and then in the kidney (and other tissues) to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D). Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)₂D are subsequently metabolized to their 24 (and for D₃ 23) hydroxy forms 24,25(OH)₂D₂/₃, 23,25(OH)₂D₃, and 1,24,25(OH)₃D₂/₃ (or 1,23,25(OH)₃D₃). Like other steroid hormones, vitamin D is highly lipophilic and bound to protein carriers that help maintain stable serum levels. The half-life of serum 25(OH)D is 2 to 3 weeks, and that of the more water-soluble 1,25(OH)₂D is approximately 5 to 8 hours. The majority of circulating 25(OH)D, including its metabolites, are bound tightly by vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and more loosely bound by albumin.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a 2019 evidence analysis center evidence-based practice guideline [^111Ns9SM]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2021). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) shows variable effects across studies, and "severe" vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25(OH)D levels under 10 ng per ml. Across included trials, supplementation resulted in a decrease in acute exacerbations (AE) in a sub-group with "severe deficiency", while other trials resulted in reduced AEs, no impact in lung function (LF) outcomes, or improvement in LF outcomes and a reduction in AEs. Conclusion statements supporting the recommendations are Fair. Synthesis of the results was challenging due to lack of consistency in vitamin D status definitions, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and baseline serum 25(OH)D levels.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^116pPHVn]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Low vitamin D status is extremely common worldwide due to low dietary intake and low skin production. Suboptimal vitamin D status contributes to many conditions, including osteomalacia/rickets, osteoporosis, falls, and fractures. It is possible or even likely that low vitamin D status increases risk for a multitude of other conditions. Although consensus does not exist, it appears that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations greater than 30 to 32 ng/mL are needed for optimal health. To achieve this, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU of D3 daily are required, and it is probable that substantially higher amounts are required to achieve such values on a population basis. It seems premature to recommend widespread screening for 25(OH)D measurement. Targeted measurement in those at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency and those most likely to have a prompt positive response to supplementation is appropriate. Widespread optimization of vitamin D status likely will lead to prevention of many diseases with attendant reduction of morbidity, mortality, and expense.

### Vitamin D and cancer-NCI… [^1167SsYH]. NCI (2023). Medium credibility.

What is vitamin D. Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble hormones and prohormones that help the body use calcium and phosphorus to make strong bones and teeth. These nutrients also perform many other important functions in the body, including reducing inflammation and controlling cell growth, as well as influencing neuromuscular and immune function and glucose metabolism. Both cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are converted in the body to calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D. It works by binding to the vitamin D receptor that is found in many tissues and cell types in the body. Most people get at least some vitamin D through sunlight exposure, but they also obtain it from their diet and from supplements.

Most of the vitamin D that people obtain from their diet comes from foods fortified with vitamin D, such as milk, juices, and breakfast cereals, and by eating the few foods that are rich in it.
- For those between 1 and 70 years of age, including women who are pregnant or lactating, the recommended dietary allowance is 15 micrograms per day. Because 1 μg is equivalent to 40 International Units, this RDA can also be expressed as 600 IU per day. In experimental studies of cancer cells and of tumors in rodents, vitamin D has been found to have several biological activities that might slow or prevent the development of cancer, including promoting cellular differentiation, decreasing cancer cell growth, stimulating cell death, reducing tumor blood vessel formation, and decreasing tumor progression and metastasis.

Vitamin D was also found to suppress a type of immune cell that normally prevents the immune system from responding strongly to cancer. Evidence from observational studies Cancer risk. Observational studies have examined a number of individual cancer sites for possible associations of risk with vitamin D level. Higher vitamin D levels have been consistently associated with reduced risks of colorectal cancer and, to a lesser extent, bladder cancer. Studies have consistently shown no association between vitamin D levels and risk of breast, lung, and several other, less common cancers. By contrast, opposite associations of risk with higher blood vitamin D levels have been suggested for prostate cancer and possibly pancreatic cancer.

Vitamin D and obesity — research priorities emphasize definitive trials to define benefit thresholds, targets, and dosing. The guideline notes that "Large RCTs in participants with obesity will be required to determine if vitamin D lowers the risk of disease, whether benefit is limited to those with low baseline levels (and defining what these levels are), what target levels are required for optimal disease prevention, and what dosages are required to achieve these target levels/desired outcomes". It adds that "inclusion of several daily dosages and targeting several levels of 25(OH)D would inform the dosages and target levels required for disease prevention", and that "Clinical trials must be designed to be of sufficient duration to address the outcomes being examined", considering disease natural history and pathophysiology.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

### The nonskeletal effects of vitamin D: an endocrine society scientific statement [^115QghEB]. Endocrine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Significant controversy has emerged over the last decade concerning the effects of vitamin D on skeletal and nonskeletal tissues. The demonstration that the vitamin D receptor is expressed in virtually all cells of the body and the growing body of observational data supporting a relationship of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to chronic metabolic, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases have led to widespread utilization of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention and treatment of numerous disorders. In this paper, we review both the basic and clinical aspects of vitamin D in relation to nonskeletal organ systems. We begin by focusing on the molecular aspects of vitamin D, primarily by examining the structure and function of the vitamin D receptor. This is followed by a systematic review according to tissue type of the inherent biological plausibility, the strength of the observational data, and the levels of evidence that support or refute an association between vitamin D levels or supplementation and maternal/child health as well as various disease states. Although observational studies support a strong case for an association between vitamin D and musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neoplastic, and metabolic disorders, there remains a paucity of large-scale and long-term randomized clinical trials. Thus, at this time, more studies are needed to definitively conclude that vitamin D can offer preventive and therapeutic benefits across a wide range of physiological states and chronic nonskeletal disorders.

### Vitamin D testing: advantages and limits of the current assays [^111CcFYg]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has become a pandemic health problem with a consequent increase of requests for determining circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. However, the analytical performance of these immunoassays, including radioimmunoassay and ELISA, is highly variable, and even mass spectrometric methods, which nowadays serves as the gold standard for the quantitatively determination of 25(OH)D, do not necessarily produce comparable results, creating limitations for the definition of normal vitamin D status ranges. To solve this problem, great efforts have been made to promote standardization of laboratory assays, which is important to achieve comparable results across different methods and manufacturers. In this review, we performed a systematic analysis evaluating critically the advantages and limits of the current assays available for the measure of vitamin D status, i.e., circulating 25(OH)D and its metabolites, making suggestions that could be used in the clinical practice. Moreover, we also suggest the use of alternatives to blood test, including standardized surveys that may be of value in alerting health-care professionals about the vitamin D status of their patients.

Conclusions

The metabolism, mechanisms of action, and pathophysiology of vitamin D and its multifaceted implications in human health have been extensively investigated for more than a century. However, the role of vitamin D status assessment and the detailed outcomes of vitamin D deficiency and its supplementation are still not completely understood. Thus, we extensively reviewed the literature on controversial vitamin D topics to better clarify and summarize the "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation in generally healthy populations and clinical conditions.

Vitamin D metabolism involves a different extensive panel of enzymes, resulting in various hormonal metabolites. Moreover, the VDR has been demonstrated to act as a key role transcription factor in most cells and can regulate a plethora of genes. New insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated potential links between several metabolic disorders and vitamin D effects. In this perspective, assessing a distinctive pattern of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites may allow us to better characterize different pathological conditions related to vitamin D metabolism that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or vitamin D diet intake.

Besides the potential utility of the evaluation of noncanonical vitamin D metabolites, 25(OH)D is nowadays the most widely accepted biomarker to evaluate vitamin D status; however, its optimal levels are still debated. Recommendations on optimal 25(OH)D levels deriving from international societies and guidelines can differ due to the different approaches used, including clinical perspectives (level of cutoff at which no individual has an undesirable outcome) or public health perspectives (level of cutoff at which 97.5% of individuals do not have an undesirable outcome). Another critical issue is the lack of an accepted laboratory test assay standardization, and this prevents a proper interpretation of data reported by different studies, resulting in enabling rational data pooling and implementation of meta-analyses focused on vitamin D influence in various clinical outcomes of interest. Thus, 25(OH)D laboratory assays should be monitored in their performance through external quality assessment plans providing target reference values from standardized measurement procedures.

### IOM committee members respond to endocrine society vitamin D guideline [^113736uM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In early 2011, a committee convened by the Institute of Medicine issued a report on the Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium and vitamin D. The Endocrine Society Task Force in July 2011 published a guideline for the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Although these reports are intended for different purposes, the disagreements concerning the nature of the available data and the resulting conclusions have caused confusion for clinicians, researchers, and the public. In this commentary, members of the Institute of Medicine committee respond to aspects of The Endocrine Society guideline that are not well supported and in need of reconsideration. These concerns focus on target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, the definition of vitamin D deficiency, and the question of who constitutes a population at risk vs. the general population.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### The role of vitamin D in cancer prevention and treatment [^115cPni9]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Considerable data described in the first part of this review suggest that there is a role for vitamin D in cancer therapy and prevention. Although the preclinical data are persuasive and the epidemiologic data intriguing, no well-designed clinical trial of optimal administration of vitamin D as a cancer therapy has ever been conducted. Had there been the opportunity and insight to develop calcitriol as any other cancer drug, the following studies would have been completed: 1. Definition of the MTD. 2. Definition of a phase II dose, as a single agent and in combination with cytotoxic agents. 3. Studies to define a biologically optimal dose. 4. Phase II (probably randomized phase II) studies of calcitriol alone and chemotherapy ± calcitriol. 5. Then, randomized phase III trials would be conducted and designed such that the only variable was the administration of calcitriol. Prerequisites 1 to 5 have not been completed for calcitriol. Preclinical data provide considerable rationale for continued development of vitamin D analogue-based cancer therapies. However, design of future studies should be informed by good clinical trials design principles and the mistakes of the past not repeated. Such studies may finally provide compelling data to prove whether or not there is a role for vitamin D analogues in cancer therapy.

### Low vitamin D status: definition, prevalence, consequences, and correction [^115dbSJP]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D is obtained from cutaneous production when 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D(3) (cholecalciferol) by ultraviolet B radiation or by oral intake of vitamin D(2) (ergocalciferol) and D(3). An individual's vitamin D status is best evaluated by measuring the circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration. Although controversy surrounds the definition of low vitamin D status, there is increasing agreement that the optimal circulating 25(OH)D level should be approximately 30 to 32 ng/mL or above. Using this definition, it has been estimated that approximately three-quarters of all adults in the United States have low levels. Low vitamin D status classically has skeletal consequences such as osteomalacia/rickets. More recently, associations between low vitamin D status and increased risk for various nonskeletal morbidities have been recognized; whether all of these associations are causally related to low vitamin D status remains to be determined. To achieve optimal vitamin D status, daily intakes of at least 1000 IU or more of vitamin D are required. The risk of toxicity with "high" amounts of vitamin D intake is low. Substantial between-individual variability exists in response to the same administered vitamin D dose. When to monitor 25(OH)D levels has received little attention. Supplementation with vitamin D(3) may be preferable to vitamin D(2).

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^113pqMPU]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Because the numerous epidemiological and experimental data indicate the beneficial role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancers, clinical use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs has been investigated. However, hypercalcemia, the major toxic effect of vitamin D, has strongly limited its clinical applications. Moreover, accumulating data suggest that cancer cells employ several mechanisms that reduce cellular calcitriol levels, as well as diminish its function to protect themselves from the antitumorigenic effects of vitamin D. Thus, understanding how vitamin D metabolism and signaling are dysregulated in cancer will help develop efficient therapeutic strategies to overcome such limitations of using vitamin D or its analogs for clinical purpose.

In this review, we provide an overview of vitamin D metabolic pathways and summarize antitumorigenic functions and mechanisms of vitamin D. In addition, we discuss how vitamin D metabolism and function are dysregulated in cancer to promote resistance to the antitumorigenic effect of vitamin D. Finally, we discuss future directions to overcome the limitations of and improve vitamin D-based cancer therapy.

### Estimation of optimal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D for multiple health outcomes [^116iKPJH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that vitamin D intakes above current recommendations may be associated with better health outcomes. However, optimal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have not been defined. This review summarizes evidence from studies that evaluated thresholds for serum 25(OH)D concentrations in relation to bone mineral density (BMD), lower-extremity function, dental health, and risk of falls, fractures, and colorectal cancer. For all endpoints, the most advantageous serum concentrations of 25(OH)D begin at 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), and the best are between 90 and 100 nmol/L (36–40 ng/mL). In most persons, these concentrations could not be reached with the currently recommended intakes of 200 and 600 IU vitamin D/d for younger and older adults, respectively. A comparison of vitamin D intakes with achieved serum concentrations of 25(OH)D for the purpose of estimating optimal intakes led us to suggest that, for bone health in younger adults and all studied outcomes in older adults, an increase in the currently recommended intake of vitamin D is warranted. An intake for all adults of ≥ 1000 IU (25 microg) [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] vitamin D (cholecalciferol)/d is needed to bring vitamin D concentrations in no less than 50% of the population up to 75 nmol/L. The implications of higher doses for the entire adult population should be addressed in future studies.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with mortality in the medical intensive care unit [^114SbwCE]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Definition of Vitamin D deficiency

There is no firm consensus regarding optimal levels of 25(OH)D. According to the workshop consensus conference for vitamin D nutritional guidelines and a study that investigated the potential beneficial effects of vitamin D for multiple health outcomes, the minimum desirable serum level of 25(OH)D is suggested to be 20 to 30 ng/dL. Studies examining 25(OH)D deficiency in intensive care units have no agreement on the cutoff levels for critically ill patients, with deficiency being defined as 25(OH)D levels of less than 15 ng/dL to less than 29 ng/dL. In our study, we used a 25(OH)D cutoff level of less than 19.9 ng/dL to define 25(OH)D deficiency. 25(OH)D insufficiency was defined as 20 to 29.9 ng/dL.

Definition of renal failure

There is no consensus on the amount of dysfunction that defines acute kidney injury, with more than 30 definitions in use today. Acute renal failure was defined as a serum creatinine × > 1.5 and acute or chronic renal failure as a worsening of renal function in a patient with chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine × 3). End-stage renal disease (ESRD) was defined as any patient with chronic kidney disease on long term hemodialysis.

### Fall prevention with supplemental and active forms of vitamin D: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116jCotP]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Each year one in three people aged 65 years or older experiences at least one fall, with 9% of falls leading to an emergency room visit and 5–6% resulting in a fracture. Fall prevention has, therefore, become a public health goal, especially as the older proportion of the population grows.

Vitamin D has direct effects on muscle strength modulated by specific vitamin D receptors present in human muscle tissue. Myopathy from severe vitamin D deficiency presents as muscle weakness and pain, but is reversible with vitamin D supplementation. In several trials of older individuals at risk for vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation improved strength, function, and balance in a dose-related pattern. Most importantly, these benefits translated into a reduction in falls.

Overall, however, results have been mixed for fall prevention with vitamin D; for example, several trials of vitamin D have had non-significant results. This may be explained in part by the use of low doses of vitamin D, as suggested by a 2004 meta-analysis of limited data from three trials on supplemental vitamin D. Other potential explanations include the availability of vitamin D over the counter for the control group; the use of an open trial design, which biases trial results towards the null; and incomplete assessment, inadequate definition, or incomplete ascertainment of falls during the entire observation period, again introducing a bias towards the null.

Several trials on vitamin D have been performed since 2004; thus, the importance of vitamin D dose for the prevention of falls should be reassessed. Specifically, we need to establish the optimum threshold of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25(OH)D; calcidiol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol)) required to prevent falls in older individuals. Notably, two epidemiology studies among older individuals have found a dose-response relationship between lower extremity function and serum 25(OH)D concentrations, with one study identifying a threshold of 50 nmol/l for optimal function. The other larger study found that function continued to improve with increasing concentration, without any plateau.

Both active forms of vitamin D and standard supplemental vitamin D have been suggested to prevent falls among older individuals, but no direct comparison of these two groups is available. Active forms of vitamin D do not need hydroxylation in the kidney, so their effect on falls should be influenced less by age related decline in kidney function than the effect of supplemental vitamin D. However, active forms of vitamin D cost more and are associated with a higher risk for hypercalcaemia than standard supplemental vitamin D.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1144Ymwq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on vitamin D deficiency:

- **Definition**: Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 ng/mL and 21–29 ng/mL is considered insufficiency.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of vitamin D deficiency primarily involves inadequate cutaneous synthesis due to decreased exposure to sunlight, leading to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in increased bone turnover and defective mineralization of the collagenous matrix. Other mechanisms of deficiency include inadequate dietary intake, reduced gastrointestinal absorption in gastrointestinal disorders, impaired hepatic 25-hydroxylation due to certain medications or liver disease, increased metabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in cancer, granulomatous diseases, or primary hyperparathyroidism, and rarely, loss of vitamin D-binding protein due to nephrotic syndrome or peritoneal dialysis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by geographic region, population group, and age. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the US is estimated at 24.6%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption syndromes, bariatric procedures, renal or hepatic disease, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications such as anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids. People with dark skin, residing at higher latitudes (> 33° north or south), older adults, pregnant individuals, and patients with obesity are at higher risk.
- **Disease course**: The clinical course of vitamin D deficiency can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the extent of the deficiency and the presence of comorbid conditions. Symptoms can include diffuse musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, and muscle weakness. In severe cases, it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteopenia, osteomalacia, and bone fractures in adults and rickets in children. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with an increased risk of CVDs, T2DM, preeclampsia, infections, and cognitive impairment.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of vitamin D deficiency is generally good with appropriate treatment, which typically involves supplementation with vitamin D3. However, untreated deficiency can result in long-term skeletal and extra-skeletal consequences and has been linked to an increased risk of mortality.

### Vitamin D deficiency 2.0: an update on the current status worldwide [^116Q4h2v]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D testing and the use of vitamin D supplements have increased substantially in recent years. Currently, the role of vitamin D supplementation, and the optimal vitamin D dose and status, is a subject of debate, because large interventional studies have been unable to show a clear benefit (in mostly vitamin D replete populations). This may be attributed to limitations in trial design, as most studies did not meet the basic requirements of a nutrient intervention study, including vitamin D-replete populations, too small sample sizes, and inconsistent intervention methods regarding dose and metabolites. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] < 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml) is associated with unfavorable skeletal outcomes, including fractures and bone loss. A 25(OH)D level of > 50nmol/L or 20ng/ml is, therefore, the primary treatment goal, although some data suggest a benefit for a higher threshold. Severe vitamin D deficiency with a 25(OH)D concentration below < 30nmol/L (or 12ng/ml) dramatically increases the risk of excess mortality, infections, and many other diseases, and should be avoided whenever possible. The data on a benefit for mortality and prevention of infections, at least in severely deficient individuals, appear convincing. Vitamin D is clearly not a panacea, and is most likely efficient only in deficiency. Given its rare side effects and its relatively wide safety margin, it may be an important, inexpensive, and safe adjuvant therapy for many diseases, but future large and well-designed studies should evaluate this further. A worldwide public health intervention that includes vitamin D supplementation in certain risk groups, and systematic vitamin D food fortification to avoid severe vitamin D deficiency, would appear to be important. In this narrative review, the current international literature on vitamin D deficiency, its relevance, and therapeutic options is discussed.

### Toward clarity in clinical vitamin D status assessment: 25 (OH) D assay standardization [^111hjMCj]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Widespread variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) assays continues to compromise efforts to develop clinical and public health guidelines regarding vitamin D status. The Vitamin D Standardization Program helps alleviate this problem. Reference measurement procedures and standard reference materials have been developed to allow current, prospective, and retrospective standardization of 25(OH)D results. Despite advances in 25(OH)D measurement, substantial variability in clinical laboratory 25(OH)D measurement persists. Existing guidelines have not used standardized data and, as a result, it seems unlikely that consensus regarding definitions of vitamin D deficiency, inadequacy, sufficiency, and excess will soon be reached. Until evidence-based consensus is reached, a reasonable clinical approach is advocated.

### Vitamin D and diabetic complications: true or false prophet? [^116wAS7B]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1
Significant risk factors for vitamin D deficiency

Vitamin D status is defined by measuring the level of 25(OH)D in the blood owing to its longer half-life in plasma, where it forms a circulating reservoir of vitamin D. A serum concentration of > 30 ng/mL (> 75 nmol/L) is considered as sufficient, 20–30 ng/mL (50–75 nmol/L) as insufficient, 10–20 ng/mL (25–50 nmol/L) as deficient, and < 10 ng/mL (< 25 nmol/l) as severely deficient. The US Institute of Medicine (IoM) released guidance in 2011 in which 25(OH)D equal to 20 ng/mL was considered to be adequate for ≥ 97.5% of the population; however, this has been heavily criticized by the Endocrine Society and they recommend that 25(OH)D concentration should exceed 30 ng/mL, to maximize the effect of vitamin D on calcium, bone, and muscle metabolism. Cutoffs for vitamin D status are detailed in Table 2. Both the IoM and the Endocrine Society have arbitrated respective cutoffs for optimal vitamin D status; however, these are based on bone metabolic data and not on cardiometabolic data. Optimal levels of 25(OH)D for possible prevention of cardiometabolic outcomes remain to be elucidated.

### 25-hydroxyvitamin D: functional outcomes in infants and young children [^112fCBPk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency occurs in the United States in exclusively breastfed infants who have high levels of skin pigmentation, inadequate vitamin D supplementation, and insufficient sunlight exposure. I review serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and functional outcomes of vitamin deficiency in young children and breastfed and nonbreastfed infants. These outcomes include the presence or absence of vitamin D deficiency rickets, bone mineral content, and serum parathyroid hormone concentration. Daily vitamin D supplements of 400 IU/L keep serum 25(OH)D concentrations higher than 50 nmol/L and prevent rickets in infants and young children. The available evidence is not sufficient to support the use of bone mineral content or parathyroid hormone concentrations in infants and young children as functional outcomes to define deficient or sufficient levels of 25(OH)D. I therefore propose a research agenda to establish the functional definitions of vitamin D sufficiency or deficiency in infants and young children.

### Vitamin D deficiency in patients with liver cirrhosis [^117Lmd68]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The role of vitamin D supplementation on the achievement of SVR in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon-based treatment is debatable. This needs to be elucidated as most published studies included patients with well-preserved liver function and minor fibrosis. However, in the era of direct acting antiviral therapy, the interest in vitamin D supplementation for higher SVR rates is expected to decrease together with the declining interferon use.

Current clinical guidelines cover the issue of vitamin D supplementation for bone disease in liver cirrhosis and cholestatic disorders. However, some argue that the established definitions of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency might not apply in patients with cirrhosis. It is of major importance to define betterthe details of vitamin D supplementation, such as the threshold for commencing supplementation, optimal duration, other liver-related extra-skeletal indications, dosage customization (maximized dosages in cirrhotics)/optimal level of supplementation), way of delivery and bioavailability, pre-treatment screening intervals, in-treatment efficacy/monitoring intervals, post-treatment surveillance intervals. Moreover, there are concerns regarding the accuracy of the different 25(OH)D assays that need to be addressed.

In conclusion, the association of vitamin D with liver cirrhosis shows great potential for clinical application. In the near future, we expect a variety of extra-skeletal indications to be explored. The relation between vitamin D deficiency and the degree of liver function, degree of fibrosis and infectious complications could support its use as a prognostic index and diagnostic tool. The role of vitamin D in liver cirrhosis needs to be further evaluated and validated in large prospective cohort studies and randomized trials.

### Global consensus recommendations on prevention and management of nutritional rickets [^116wNRwz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are common worldwide, causing nutritional rickets and osteomalacia, which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication.

Evidence

A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence.

Process

Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus.

Results

This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts.

Conclusion

Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and calcium deficiencies are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required.

### Vitamin D toxicity, policy, and science [^114CAYfG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration that is the threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been established. Hypercalcemia is the hazard criterion for vitamin D. Past policy of the Institute of Medicine has set the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for vitamin D at 50 mug (2000 IU)/d, defining this as "the highest level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risks of adverse health effects to almost all individuals in the general population". However, because sunshine can provide an adult with vitamin D in an amount equivalent to daily oral consumption of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d, this is intuitively a safe dose. The incremental consumption of 1 mug (40 IU)/day of vitamin D(3) raises serum 25(OH)D by approximately 1 nM (0.4 ng/ml). Therefore, if sun-deprived adults are to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nM (30 ng/ml), they will require an intake of more than the UL for vitamin D. The mechanisms that limit vitamin D safety are the capacity of circulating vitamin D-binding protein and the ability to suppress 25(OH)D-1-alpha-hydroxylase. Vitamin D causes hypercalcemia when the "free" concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is inappropriately high. This displacement of 1,25(OH)(2)D becomes excessive as plasma 25(OH)D concentrations become higher than at least 600 nM (240 ng/ml). Plasma concentrations of unmetabolized vitamin D during the first days after an acute, large dose of vitamin D can reach the micromolar range and cause acute symptoms. The clinical trial evidence shows that a prolonged intake of 250 mug (10,000 IU)/d of vitamin D(3) is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects in almost all individuals in the general population; this meets the criteria for a tolerable upper intake level.

Insufficient evidence whether 600 IU/day is enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D.

### The 2011 report on dietary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D from the institute of medicine: what clinicians need to know [^112X488E]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The available scientific evidence supports a key role for calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health, providing a sound basis for DRIs. The evidence, however, is not yet compelling that either nutrient confers benefits for, or is causally related to, extraskeletal health outcomes. Moreover, existing evidence suggests that nearly all individuals meet their needs at intake levels (RDAs) provided in this report and, for vitamin D, at 25OHD levels of at least 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) even under conditions of minimal sun exposure. Furthermore, higher levels have not been shown consistently to confer greater benefits, challenging the concept that "more is better". The Committee finds that the prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy in the North American population has been overestimated by some groups due to the use of inappropriate cut-points that greatly exceed the levels identified in this report. Serum concentrations of 25OHD above 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) are not consistently associated with increased benefit, and risks have been identified for some outcomes at 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter). Additional research, including large-scale, randomized clinical trials, is needed. In the meantime, however, we believe that there is an urgent clinical and public health need for consensus cut-points for serum 25OHD inadequacy to avoid problems of both undertreatment and overtreatment.

### How deficient are vitamin D deficient critically ill patients? [^113KWZgD]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among critically ill patients and may be associated with adverse outcomes. Failure of conventional vitamin D supplementation in correcting deficiency has called for studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a high-dose regime in critically ill patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation that corrects a deficient state effectively and safely allows for intervention studies to be undertaken to determine the impact of vitamin D on morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients.

### Correction of vitamin D deficiency in critically ill patients-VITdAL @ ICU study protocol of a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial [^1169fDRZ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is a key regulator in calcium and phosphorus metabolism and likely confers physiologically relevant pleiotropic functions that include cardioprotective and immunomodulatory effects as well as improvement of antimicrobial action. Profound vitamin D deficiency in humans causes rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults together with vitamin D myopathy, whereas low vitamin D levels may be associated with an increased prevalence of a multitude of other diseases including an increase in mortality.

Moreover, a systematic review concluded that intervention with cholecalciferol significantly reduced mortality in predominantly elderly, institutionalized women. To date, only few large interventional randomized trials have investigated the effect of vitamin D on clinical outcomes. The rationale for pleiotropic effects of this substance is based on the fact that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is almost ubiquitously expressed, and the vast majority of cells respond to 1,25(OH)2D exposure. Hundreds of genes with vitamin D receptor response elements directly or indirectly influence cell cycling, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

Vitamin D in ICU patients

Endogenous synthesis in the presence of UV-B radiation is the main source of vitamin D. Therefore, immobilized and elderly individuals are prone to develop vitamin D deficiency. Low vitamin D levels are highly prevalent in critically ill adults and children. Unfortunately, no uniform definition of vitamin D deficiency exists and tissue levels of the major active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D are currently not measurable. Today most guidelines agree, however, that a "low" vitamin D status is present when serum 25(OH)D levels are below 20 ng/ml. Special concerns in the ICU setting relate to the issue as to whether the definition of vitamin D deficiency should be the same as in the general population or whether special metabolites of vitamin D should be considered in this definition as well. Insufficient vitamin D levels could affect this population in various ways. Over the last years, several groups have reported on an inverse association between vitamin D levels in critically ill patients and severity of disease including length of ICU stay and mortality. Moreover, vitamin D levels decline further during ICU stay which is explained by insufficient replacement of vitamin D via enteral or parenteral nutrition in the absence of UV-B exposure. To date, only few and small intervention studies (n = 22–33 patients) that were not designed to demonstrate effects on clinical outcomes have been published.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111vVZHD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D measurement, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to measure serum 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D level only for monitoring certain conditions, such as acquired and inherited disorders of vitamin D and phosphate metabolism.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^11639dQb]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The 6th International Conference, "Controversies in Vitamin D", was convened to discuss controversial topics, such as vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation. Novel insights into vitamin D mechanisms of action suggest links with conditions that do not depend only on reduced solar exposure or diet intake and that can be detected with distinctive noncanonical vitamin D metabolites. Optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remain debated. Varying recommendations from different societies arise from evaluating different clinical or public health approaches. The lack of assay standardization also poses challenges in interpreting data from available studies, hindering rational data pooling and meta-analyses. Beyond the well-known skeletal features, interest in vitamin D's extraskeletal effects has led to clinical trials on cancer, cardiovascular risk, respiratory effects, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and mortality. The initial negative results are likely due to enrollment of vitamin D-replete individuals. Subsequent post hoc analyses have suggested, nevertheless, potential benefits in reducing cancer incidence, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Oral administration of vitamin D is the preferred route. Parenteral administration is reserved for specific clinical situations. Cholecalciferol is favored due to safety and minimal monitoring requirements. Calcifediol may be used in certain conditions, while calcitriol should be limited to specific disorders in which the active metabolite is not readily produced in vivo. Further studies are needed to investigate vitamin D effects in relation to the different recommended 25(OH)D levels and the efficacy of the different supplementary formulations in achieving biochemical and clinical outcomes within the multifaced skeletal and extraskeletal potential effects of vitamin D.

### Controversies in vitamin D: summary statement from an international conference [^113YhX86]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D is classically recognized as a regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Recent advances in the measurement of vitamin D metabolites, diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, and clinical observations have led to an appreciation that along with its role in skeletal metabolism, vitamin D may well have an important role in nonclassical settings. Measurement of the circulating form of vitamin D that best describes total body stores, namely 25-hydroxyvitamin D, can be unreliable despite many sophisticated methodologies that have been proposed and implemented. Likewise, evidence from clinical studies showing a beneficial role of vitamin D in different disease states has been controversial and at times speculative. Moreover, the target concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to address a number of putative links between vitamin D inadequacy and nonskeletal diseases are further areas of uncertainty.

Setting

To address these issues, an international conference on "Controversies in Vitamin D" was held in Pisa, Italy, in June 2017. Three main topics were addressed: (i) vitamin D assays and the definition of hypovitaminosis D; (ii) skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D; (iii) therapeutics of vitamin D.

Results

This report provides a summary of the deliberations of the expert panels of the conference.

Conclusions

Despite great advances in our appreciation of vitamin D metabolism, measurements, biological actions on classical and nonclassical tissues, and therapeutics, all of which this report summarizes, much more work remains to be done so that our knowledge base can become even more secure.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111mfiHt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (daily requirements), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Hypovitaminosis D and morbidity in critical illness: is there proof beyond reasonable doubt? [^113VDAos]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, the study adds to the burgeoning volume of literature on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in critically ill patients and the resulting potential for adverse outcomes. Where do we go from here? There have been calls for universal vitamin D supplementation in critically ill patients. Given the present evidence, this would be premature as a number of caveats still remain.

The criteria for definitions of vitamin D sufficiency are based on bone health; the optimal level for pleiotropy remains unclear. Moreover, little data exist on the bio-active form, 1,25-dihydroxy-D3, in critical illness and association with outcomes. Reports of supra-physiological levels of 1,25-dihydroxy-D3 following inflammatory response in critically ill patients and, more recently, evidence of extra-renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy-D3 have been published. Furthermore, the high degree of protein binding of 25-hydroxy-D3 and consequently the relevance of free levels, particularly in the context of altered pharmacokinetics associated with critical illness, remain to be elucidated.
