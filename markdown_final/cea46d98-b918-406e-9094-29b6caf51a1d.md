## Question

What is the genetic defect responsible for ovalocytosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the genetic defect responsible for ovalocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which entity "ovalocytosis" refers to in the literature. Then, I should verify the exact gene and mutation that cause it. Next, I will review the molecular and cellular consequences of that mutation. After that, I should consider the inheritance pattern and any exceptions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise answer and double-check for any conflicting terminology or mimics that could confuse the conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. In hematology, "ovalocytosis" in this context almost always denotes Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO), a hereditary red cell membrane disorder with characteristic oval or stomatocytic morphology and increased membrane rigidity, distinct from hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary spherocytosis, which have different molecular bases and morphologies [^112bwSrY].

> Now, I need to verify the gene. Multiple independent sources converge on SLC4A1, encoding band 3 (anion exchanger 1, AE1), as the gene responsible for SAO, with a recurrent pathogenic variant driving the phenotype [^112bwSrY].

> Wait, let me verify the exact mutation. The consistent lesion is a 27-base pair in-frame deletion that removes codons 400–408 in SLC4A1, resulting in a 9–amino acid deletion within the band 3 protein; this is often described as the SAO deletion or Δ400–408 and is the same across multiple cohorts and populations [^112bwSrY] [^113DUN91].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the functional consequences. This deletion disrupts folding and trafficking of band 3, yielding an inactive anion exchanger and altering membrane mechanical stability, which explains the rigid, oval RBCs and the characteristic smear findings; it also perturbs the band 3 interactome and membrane protein organization, contributing to the phenotype [^112bwSrY] [^1159fzxp].

> I should confirm the inheritance pattern. SAO is classically autosomal dominant, with heterozygotes typically asymptomatic but with a distinctive blood film, whereas homozygosity for the SAO deletion was historically considered lethal; however, wait, I should double-check that assumption because recent reports document rare live-born homozygotes with severe hemolytic anemia and distal renal tubular acidosis, indicating that while homozygosity is high-risk and often fatal, it is not universally incompatible with life [^112bwSrY] [^116gUe7w].

> But wait, what if someone uses "ovalocytosis" more broadly. I need to ensure I'm not conflating SAO with other ovalocyte-predominant hereditary anemias. Hereditary elliptocytosis, for example, is due to mutations in spectrin genes or EPB41 and produces elliptocytes rather than the macro-ovalocytes and stomatocytes of SAO; distinguishing morphology and the specific SLC4A1 deletion are key to avoiding misclassification [^115G5C3h] [^112bwSrY].

> Let me synthesize the final answer. The genetic defect responsible for ovalocytosis (Southeast Asian ovalocytosis) is a 27-base pair in-frame deletion in SLC4A1 that removes codons 400–408, resulting in a 9–amino acid deletion in band 3 (AE1), which misfolds the protein, abrogates anion transport activity, and increases membrane rigidity, producing the characteristic oval/stomatocytic morphology and membrane phenotype [^112bwSrY] [^113DUN91].

Ovalocytosis is caused by a **27-base pair deletion** in the SLC4A1 gene (band 3 protein), resulting in a 9-amino acid deletion (codons 400–408) [^113DUN91] that creates a **misfolded, inactive anion exchanger** [^112bwSrY]. This mutation increases **membrane rigidity** and confers resistance to malaria, especially Plasmodium falciparum [^115Zz8oF]. The trait is **autosomal dominant** [^112bwSrY]; heterozygotes are typically asymptomatic, whereas homozygosity is rare and can cause severe hemolytic anemia and distal renal tubular acidosis [^116gUe7w] [^116bUiiD].

---

## Genetic mutation and molecular mechanism

- **Gene involved**: SLC4A1 (solute carrier family 4 member 1), encoding the band 3 protein (anion exchanger 1, AE1) [^115G5C3h].
- **Mutation**: A 27-base pair deletion (codons 400–408) [^113DUN91] resulting in a 9-amino acid deletion within the membrane-spanning domain of band 3 [^116meFpE].
- **Protein consequence**: The deletion causes misfolding, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, and production of an inactive anion exchanger [^112bwSrY].
- **Functional impact**: Reduced chloride-bicarbonate exchange, altered membrane stability, and increased membrane rigidity [^112bwSrY].

---

## Inheritance pattern

Ovalocytosis exhibits an **autosomal dominant** pattern [^112bwSrY]. Heterozygotes are typically asymptomatic, whereas homozygosity is rare and associated with severe hemolytic anemia and distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) [^116gUe7w] [^116bUiiD].

---

## Clinical manifestations

- **Heterozygous carriers**: Usually asymptomatic, with mild hemolysis and characteristic ovalocytic RBCs on smear [^112bwSrY].
- **Homozygous individuals**: Rare, with severe hemolytic anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and dRTA [^116gUe7w] [^116bUiiD].
- **Laboratory findings**: Increased RBC rigidity, reduced osmotic fragility, and characteristic ovalocytic morphology [^112bwSrY].

---

## Protective effect against malaria

Ovalocytosis confers significant protection against **Plasmodium falciparum** malaria, particularly severe forms such as cerebral malaria [^115Zz8oF]. The rigid membrane and altered band 3 function impair parasite invasion and growth, likely by disrupting the parasite's ability to remodel the host cell membrane [^notfound].

---

## Geographic distribution

Ovalocytosis is **most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific**, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines [^112bwSrY]. Its distribution aligns with regions historically endemic for malaria, consistent with **evolutionary selection** [^115MVhQC].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Peripheral blood smear**: Identification of ovalocytic RBCs [^112bwSrY].
- **Osmotic fragility test**: Reduced fragility due to increased membrane rigidity [^notfound].
- **Genetic testing**: Detection of the 27-base pair deletion in SLC4A1 [^113DUN91].

---

## Management and treatment

Management is **supportive**, with folic acid supplementation and monitoring for hemolysis. Splenectomy is generally not recommended due to low efficacy and increased infection risk. Severe cases may require blood transfusions and management of complications such as dRTA [^116bUiiD].

---

Ovalocytosis is a hereditary red cell membrane disorder caused by a **27-base pair deletion** in SLC4A1, resulting in a misfolded, inactive band 3 protein [^112bwSrY]. This mutation increases membrane rigidity and confers protection against malaria, with heterozygotes typically asymptomatic and homozygotes experiencing severe hemolytic anemia and dRTA [^115Zz8oF] [^116gUe7w].

### Disorders of red cell membrane [^112zkfEq]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Studies during the last three decades have enabled the development of detailed molecular insights into the structural basis of altered function in various inherited red cell membrane disorders. This review highlights our current understanding of molecular and mechanistic insights into various inherited red cell membrane disorders involving either altered membrane structural organization (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary ovalocytosis) or altered membrane transport function (hereditary stomatocytosis). The molecular basis for the vast majority of cases of hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and ovalocytosis have been fully defined while little progress has been made in defining the molecular basis for hereditary stomatocytosis. Mutations in a number of distinct genes account for hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, while a single genetic defect accounts for all cases of hereditary ovalocytosis. Based on these molecular insights, a comprehensive understanding of the structural basis for altered membrane function has been developed. Loss of vertical linkage between membrane skeleton and lipid bilayer leads to membrane loss in hereditary spherocytosis, while weakening of lateral linkages between skeletal proteins leads to membrane fragmentation and surface area loss in hereditary elliptocytosis. Importantly, the severity of anaemia in both these disorders is directly related to extent of membrane surface area loss. Splenectomy results in amelioration of anaemia.

Primary abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane are characterized by clinical, laboratory, and genetic heterogeneity. Among this group, hereditary spherocytosis patients are more likely to experience symptomatic anemia. Treatment of hereditary spherocytosis with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Growing recognition of the long-term risks of splenectomy has led to re-evaluation of the role of splenectomy. Management guidelines acknowledge these considerations and recommend discussion between health care providers, patient, and family. The hereditary elliptocytosis syndromes are the most common primary disorders of erythrocyte membrane proteins. However, most elliptocytosis patients are asymptomatic and do not require therapy.

### Advances in understanding the pathogenesis of red cell membrane disorders [^116sZRXD]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary erythrocyte membrane disorders are caused by mutations in genes encoding various transmembrane or cytoskeletal proteins of red blood cells. The main consequences of these genetic alterations are decreased cell deformability and shortened erythrocyte survival. Red blood cell membrane defects encompass a heterogeneous group of haemolytic anaemias caused by either (i) altered membrane structural organisation (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis) or (ii) altered membrane transport function (overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis or xerocytosis, familial pseudohyperkalaemia and cryohydrocytosis). Herein we provide a comprehensive review of the recent literature on the molecular genetics of erythrocyte membrane defects and their reported clinical consequences. We also describe the effect of low-expression genetic variants on the high inter- and intra-familial phenotype variability of erythrocyte structural defects.

### Epistasis and the sensitivity of phenotypic screens for beta thalassaemia [^117NiXnX]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Genetic disorders of haemoglobin, particularly the sickle cell diseases and the alpha and beta thalassaemias, are the commonest inherited disorders worldwide. The majority of affected births occur in low-income and lower-middle income countries. Screening programmes are a vital tool to counter these haemoglobinopathies by: (i) identifying individual carriers and allowing them to make informed reproductive choices, and (ii) generating population level gene-frequency estimates, to help ensure the optimal allocation of public health resources. For both of these functions it is vital that the screen performed is suitably sensitive. One popular first-stage screening option to detect carriers of beta thalassaemia in low-income countries is the One Tube Osmotic Fragility Test (OTOFT). Here we introduce a population genetic framework within which to quantify the likely sensitivity and specificity of the OTOFT in different epidemiological contexts. We demonstrate that interactions between the carrier states for beta thalassaemia and alpha thalassaemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis have the potential to reduce the sensitivity of OTOFTs for beta thalassaemia heterozygosity to below 70%. Our results therefore caution against the widespread application of OTOFTs in regions where these erythrocyte variants co-occur.

### Human red blood cell polymorphisms and malaria [^115Zz8oF]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Genetic factors are a major determinant of child survival in malaria endemic countries. Identifying which genes are involved and how they affect the malaria disease risk potentially offers a powerful mechanism through which to learn more about the host-parasite relationship. The past few years have seen significant progress towards achieving this goal for some of the best-known malaria resistance genes that determine the structure or function of red blood cells: Gerbich blood group antigen negativity; polymorphisms of the complement receptor genes (most notably CR1); Southeast Asian ovalocytosis; pyruvate kinase deficiency; haemoglobin E; the sickle cell trait; and alpha-thalassaemia are all examples. The challenge for the future must be to translate such advances into fresh approaches to the prevention and treatment of malaria.

### Hereditary spherocytosis [^111JJubt]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a common inherited disorder that is characterised by anaemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. It is reported worldwide and is the most common inherited anaemia in individuals of northern European ancestry. Clinical severity is variable with most patients having a well-compensated haemolytic anaemia. Some individuals are asymptomatic, whereas others have severe haemolytic anaemia requiring erythrocyte transfusion. The primary lesion in hereditary spherocytosis is loss of membrane surface area, leading to reduced deformability due to defects in the membrane proteins ankyrin, band 3, beta spectrin, alpha spectrin, or protein 4.2. Many isolated mutations have been identified in the genes encoding these membrane proteins; common hereditary spherocytosis-associated mutations have not been identified. Abnormal spherocytes are trapped and destroyed in the spleen and this is the main cause of haemolysis in this disorder. Common complications are cholelithiasis, haemolytic episodes, and aplastic crises. Splenectomy is curative but should be undertaken only after careful assessment of the risks and benefits.

### Hereditary haemolytic anaemias: unexpected sequelae of mutations in the genes for erythroid membrane skeletal proteins [^116oYzHg]. The Journal of Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Although the haemolytic anaemia may be the primary concern for hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis patients, it is clear that their situation can be compromised by primary and secondary defects in erythroid and non-erythroid systems of the body. All seven of the red cell membrane skeletal proteins discussed in this review are also expressed in non-erythroid tissues, and mutations in their genes have the potential to cause non-erythroid defects. In some instances, such as the protein 4.1R and ANK1 neurological deficits, the diagnosis is clear. In other instances, because of the complex expression patterns involved, the non-erythroid effects may be difficult to assess. An example is the large multidomain, multifunctional band 3 protein. In this case, the location of the mutation can cause defects in one functional domain or isoform and not the other. In other cases, such as the beta-adducin null mutation, other isoforms may partially compensate for the primary deficiency. In such cases, it may be that the effects of the deficit are subtle but could increase under stress or with age. To be completely successful, treatment strategies must address both primary and secondary effects of the anaemia. If gene replacement therapy is to be used, the more that is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms producing the multiple isoforms the better we will be able to design the best replacement gene. The various animal models that are now available should be invaluable in this regard. They continue to contribute to our understanding of both the primary and the secondary effects and their treatment.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^113LLKuB]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

What HC is (and what it is not)

Nomenclature and case definition of HC have long been recognized as potential sources of confusion, especially when dealing with the report of genetic tests. Among experts, there was a common feeling that the HC classification needs to be revised in view of the increasing awareness and knowledge of IO disorders. To this end, the BIOIRON Society promoted a 2-step process. The starting point was the preparation of a survey that was sent to working group participants, including both expert clinicians and basic scientists actively involved in the iron metabolism field, and consisting of nearly all who discovered the hemochromatosis genes and hepcidin. The survey questions and the summary of responses are available in the supplemental Material (available on the Blood Web site). This was followed by a critical collegial discussion during a specific session of the most recent biennial meeting of the BIOIRON Society in Heidelberg. The recommendations reported here are the result of such discussion, where the panelists eventually agreed on the novel classification. As an integral part of the process, the panelists agreed on a robust definition of HC, based on clinical presentation and widely available tools, as a prerequisite for genetic testing. The main clinical, biochemical, and imaging studies for the suspicion of HC are reported in Table 1. Rigorously speaking, the term "hemochromatosis" should be reserved for a unique genetic clinical-pathological condition characterized by increased TSAT, IO in the liver (but not in the spleen), prevalent involvement of periportal hepatocytes with iron-spared Kupffer cells, and signs and/or symptoms associated with IO. The panelists also emphasized that the term "hemochromatosis" itself implies an IO of genetic origin, which is why they would recommend avoiding the unnecessary use of qualifiers such as "hereditary", "genetic", or "primary". Indeed, genetic defects in the hepcidin/ferroportin regulatory axis (caused by variants in hepcidin regulators, the hepcidin gene itself, or in ferroportin) are responsible for inadequate production or activity of hepcidin or lack of hepcidin responsiveness of ferroportin.

### Molecular population genetics of SLC4A1 and southeast Asian ovalocytosis [^113DUN91]. Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is an erythrocyte abnormality that protects affected individuals from cerebral malaria. This trait is caused by a 27-bp deletion in the SLC4A1 gene, which is lethal when homozygous. We reseqeunced approximately 5 kb of SLC4A1 in an Indonesian population where SAO is prevalent to better understand the evolution of this clinically important trait. The four SAO chromosomes we resequenced share a single haplotype that differs from a sampled non-SAO haplotype only by the 27-bp deletion. Comparison of Indonesian sequence data to that from two other Asian populations (aboriginal Taiwanese and Japanese) shows Indonesian SLC4A1 to be strongly differentiated from the Taiwanese, but not the Japanese. Indeed, the Taiwanese sample contains only chromosomes that are highly divergent from all sampled SAO chromosomes. Because earlier studies have found an association between Austronesian-speakers (who most likely originated in Taiwan) and SAO, our failure to find SAO-like chromosomes in Taiwan is unexpected. Finally, our data find a strong excess of high-frequency derived alleles in all three populations. These alleles include the non-synonymous 'Memphis' variant, which is known to affect anion transport across the erythrocyte membrane. Our data suggest a role for recent natural selection acting on Memphis or a linked variant.

### South-east Asian ovalocytosis and the cryohydrocytosis form of hereditary stomatocytosis show virtually indistinguishable cation permeability defects [^116oVwHi]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

The hereditary stomatocytoses are a group of dominantly inherited conditions in which the osmotic stability of the red cell is compromised by abnormally high cation permeability. This report demonstrates the very marked similarities between the cryohydrocytosis form of hereditary stomatocytosis and the common tropical condition south-east Asian ovalocytosis (SAO). We report two patients, one showing a novel cryohydrocytosis variant (Ser762Arg in SLC4A1) and a case of SAO. Both cases showed a mild haemolytic state with some stomatocytes on the blood film, abnormal intracellular sodium and potassium levels which were made markedly abnormal by storage of blood at 0°C, increased cation 'leak' fluxes at 37°C and increased Na(+) K(+) pump activity. In both cases, the anion exchange function of the mutant band 3 was destroyed. Extensive electrophysiological studies comparing the cation leak and conductance in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing the two mutant genes showed identical patterns of abnormality. These data are consistent with the cryohydrocytosis form of hereditary stomatocytosis and we conclude that the cation leak in SAO is indistinguishable from that in cryohydrocytosis, and that SAO should be considered to be an example of hereditary stomatocytosis.

### Amechanotoxin-4 (GsMTx4)-sensitive cation channel mediates increased cation permeability in human hereditary spherocytosis of multiple genetic etiologies [^111v7wtC]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia among people of Northern European descent. HS is caused by mutations in genes encoding the erythroid cytoskeleton proteins ankyrin-1 (ANK1), b-spectrin (SPTB), and α-spectrin (SPTA1), the major intrinsic erythroid membrane protein and chloridebicarbonate exchanger, SLC4A1/band 3, and rarely EPB42/protein 4.2. These mutations lead to destabilization and progressive loss of red cell membrane lipids and surface area, and in some cases to destabilization of cytoskeletal-membrane attachment. The resulting red cells often exhibit normochromic or hyperchromic, mildmoderate microcytosis with increased incubated osmotic fragility and reduced deformability. Anemia and chronic hemolysis can be accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia and painful splenic enlargement. Splenectomy often provides symptomatic relief and attenuates anemia and hemolysis.

Increased erythroid cation permeability in HS was first reported by Harris and Prankerd (1953) and Bertles (1957), as subsequently cited by Zarkowsky et al. Later reports of increased red cell cation permeability appeared in the setting of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and cyrohydrocytosis in association with SLC4A1 mutations, in the setting of overhydrated stomatocytosis in association with mutations in RHAG, SLC2A1, and SLC4A1, and in the setting of familial pseudohyperkalemia associated with ABCB6 mutations. Spherocytic mouse red cells genetically lacking EBP41 or EBP42, or haploinsufficient for SLC4A1 exhibited enhanced Gardos channel activity and increased hemolysis in the presence of the Gardos inhibitor, clotrimazole, consistent with enhanced nonspecific cation permeability associated with these mouse HS models. Human HS red cells of diverse genotype were uniformly characterized by increased steady-state concentrations of fluorometrically measured intracellular [Ca 2+]. However, Petkova-Kirova et al.recently reported that HS red cells of the same individuals had a spectrum of decreased, increased, or unchanged cation channel activities as measured by an automated whole cell patch clamp technique.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^117PwUPW]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

The human SLC4A1 encodes the kidney anion exchanger 1 (kAE1) which lacks the first 65 amino acids of AE1. Mutations that cause dRTA seldom affect red cell cation transport, though compound heterozygotes of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) mutations and mutations that cause Southeast Asian ovalocytosis can exhibit dRTA and altered erythrocyte shape. Neither the proband nor his daughter showed hypokalaemic hyperchloraemic acidosis, serum bicarbonate levels and urine pH were within the reference range. Both patients showed an increase in plasma renin activity, suggesting a possible renal involvement secondary to the SLC4A1 variant.

There are a large number of transporters and channels in the RBC membrane which determine RBC volume and normal cell water content of the cell. There are several excellent reviews on this subject.RBC has limited capacity to respond to alterations in monovalent cation content, and, if exceeded, cellular volume will change in parallel with the change in the total content of cations. In both our patients, MCV was increased, despite the presence of spherocytes suggesting an increase in RBC size. The major protein responsible for maintaining the high potassium, low sodium intracellular state is Na + -K + -ATPase which is an ATP-dependent pump that exchanges three sodium ions outwards for two potassium ions inwards. Other membrane ion transporters are Na + -K + -Cl - cotransporters, K + -Cl - cotransporters, PIEZO1 a mechanosensitive cation channel. Cation fluxes are disturbed in a group of inherited disorders, and these disorders show a wide heterogeneity in the severity of cation leaks and accompanying symptoms. Although the RBC membrane has been well studied, new insights have been reported into the proteins present and their role in RBC function. This raises the possibility that further studies into other membrane transport proteins will increase the understanding of this phenotype and segregate it into a distinct genetic background. Quantitation of red cell membrane proteins which include band 3 proteins, using sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and comparison of red cell membrane proteins with individuals with normal FBC or unaffected family members will provide further evidence for the association between red cell membrane abnormality and the presenting phenotype.

### Coexistence of southeast Asian ovalocytosis and β-thalassemia: a molecular and hematological analysis [^1146g67f]. American Journal of Hematology (2007). Low credibility.

We describe hematological and molecular characterization of a Thai female who had Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) associated with beta+-thalassemia trait. The proband had mild microcytosis with Hb 12.9 g/dl, Hct 35.8%, MCV 74.4 fl, MCH 26.8 pg, MCHC 36.0 g/dl, and elevated Hb A2 (5.6%), characteristics of beta-thalassemia trait. Peripheral blood film examination revealed prominent ovalocytosis. However, a one-tube osmotic fragility (OF) test commonly used for thalassemia screening was negative and a normal OF curve was observed. Further polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses identified the beta(-28A-G) mutation in the beta-globin gene and a 27 bp deletion in erythrocyte band 3 protein gene, indicating a genetically compound heterozygote. Hematological data of the proband was comparatively presented with those of eight female and 15 male carriers of pure beta-thalassemia with the same mutation. The finding demonstrates that although the association of the SAO and beta-thalassemia does not produce a more severe clinical picture, this could lead to a mis-screening of beta-thalassemia using an OF test as a primary screening test. Additional blood film examination followed by PCR could help in the detection of this unusual genetic interaction in the region.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary spherocytosis [^114T4r7Z]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders with regard to clinical severity, protein defects and mode of inheritance. It is relatively common in Caucasian populations; most affected individuals have mild or only moderate haemolysis. There is usually a family history, and a typical clinical and laboratory picture so that the diagnosis is often easily made without additional laboratory tests. Atypical cases may require measurement of erythrocyte membrane proteins to clarify the nature of the membrane disorder and in the absence of a family history, occasionally molecular genetic analysis will help to determine whether inheritance is recessive or non-dominant. It is particularly important to rule out stomatocytosis where splenectomy is contraindicated because of the thrombotic risk. Mild HS can be managed without folate supplements and does not require splenectomy. Moderately and severely affected individuals are likely to benefit from splenectomy, which should be performed after the age of 6 years and with appropriate counselling about the infection risk. In all cases careful dialogue between doctor, patient and the family is essential. Laparoscopic surgery, when performed by experienced surgeons, can result in a shorter hospital stay and less pain.

### Red cell membrane disorders [^111rrb5v]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of the erythrocyte membrane, including hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis, comprise an important group of inherited hemolytic anemias. These syndromes are characterized by marked clinical and laboratory heterogeneity. Recent molecular studies have revealed that there is also significant genetic heterogeneity in these disorders. This is particularly true for the spherocytosis syndromes where each kindred has a private mutation in one of the spherocytosis genes. Treatment with splenectomy is curative in most patients. Splenectomy via a laparoscopic approach has become the surgical method of choice. Growing recognition and understanding of the long-term risks and complications of splenectomy, including cardiovascular disease, thrombotic disorders, and pulmonary hypertension, and the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci, a concern for infection in overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, have led to reevaluation of the role of splenectomy. Recent management guidelines acknowledge these important considerations when entertaining splenectomy and recommend detailed discussion between health care providers, patient, and family.

### Homozygous southeast Asian ovalocytosis in five live-born neonates [^112bwSrY]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is an autosomal dominant inherited red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorder caused by the heterozygous deletion of codons 400–408 in SLC4A1/band 3/anion exchanger 1 (AE1). This deletion leads to misfolding of the protein, creating an inactive anion-transporter and altering the mechanical stability of the RBC. Heterozygous SAO is characterized by the presence of stomatocytes, theta cells (RBC with two stomas), macro-ovalocytes and ≥ 25% ovalocytes in the peripheral blood smears. Although heterozygous SAO carriers are generally asymptomatic, homozygous SAO was considered to be lethal. However, one successful birth of a homozygous SAO individual, born to asymptomatic heterozygous SAO Comorian parents, was reported in 2014 showing an association with severe dyserythropoietic anemia. Here, we report the birth of five unrelated homozygous SAO babies in Malaysia showing that homozygous SAO is not as rare as previously thought. These babies belong to an SAO cohort collected from January 2007 to March 2020 at University Sains Malaysia (USM), which includes a total of 68 patients. The study was instigated to further understand the physiological implications of heterozygous SAO within the Malay population. The detection of numerous homozygous SAO births has highlighted the need for the development of good practice to support the survival of these babies.

SAO has a distinctive geographical distribution, occurring mostly in areas of Southeast Asia including neighboring regions of the Malay Peninsula, coastal regions of Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan and even Madagascar in the western Indian Ocean. Investigations into the high incidence of SAO in malarious areas revealed that the SAO mutation confers protection from severe malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum.

AE1 is the most abundant RBC membrane protein and mediates the efficient transport of carbon dioxide in the blood. Heterozygous SAO individuals have only 50% normal RBC anion transport activity and thus less efficient gas transport. The heterozygous expression of the SAO AE1 in the red cell membrane not only affects the folding and structure of AE1 but also affects the structure of other red cell membrane proteins depressing a relatively high number of red cell antigens. Neonatal anemia has also been reported in SAO families.

### Mimicry of inherited red cell disorders: the result of somatic mutations in a clonal myeloid disease [^116KhV7j]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

The hematopathologist and hematological oncologist should consider acquired syndromes described here when alterations of the genes and/or chromosome loci noted in Table 1 occur in association with a chronic myeloid neoplasm or when the red cell morphology has features that are unusual, such as a heightened frequency or dominance of ovalocytes or spherocytes.

Table 1.
Somatic mutations in chronic myeloid neoplasms leading to acquired red cell syndromes simulating germline mutations.

A clonal myeloid disease, especially a myelodysplastic syndrome, may also result in a profound disorder of erythropoiesis that leads to "red cell anarchy". The latter is defined by an exaggerated combination of anisocytosis, anisochromia and poikilocytosis. Red cell anisocytosis (elevated red cell distribution width) predicts for a poor prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemiaand in myelodysplastic syndrome. Elevated red cell distribution width is also a risk factor for progression of age-related clonal hematopoiesis in otherwise healthy persons to acute myelogenous leukemia.

### Homozygous southeast Asian ovalocytosis in five live-born neonates [^116bUiiD]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

A truncated form of AE1 is expressed in the α-intercalated cells of the kidneys and is essential for acid secretion in the urine. Loss of AE1 anion-transport activity in the kidney causes distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) and occurs when AE1 expression is severely reduced as in hereditary spherocytosis (HS), or when kidney AE1 activity is severely reducedor trafficking of kidney AE1 is impeded in the α-intercalated cell. Many dRTA mutations are recessive. When SAO AE1 is inherited in trans to a recessive dRTA AE1 mutation then the compound heterozygote will completely lack AE1 anion transport activity. This phenomenon explains the prevalence of dRTA in South East Asia where there are a number of recessive dRTA AE1 mutations maintained in the population.

Homozygous SAO individuals, with no functioning AE1, and homozygous HS individuals, with no AE1, suffer from hemolytic anemia, dRTA and failure to thrive. An in-depth study of homozygous SAO cells, showed expression of SAO AE1 during erythropoiesis (in vitro) affected trafficking and cytokinesis resulting in numerous multinucleated erythroblasts and reduced proliferation and enucleation. Unexpectedly, even the in vitro cultured heterozygous SAO erythroblasts displayed multinuclearity and reduced enucleation, with an intermediate phenotype part way between the homozygous and control cells, suggesting that heterozygous SAO individuals may have a mild dyserythropoiesis. Mature homozygous SAO RBC show signs of altered membrane composition, oxidative damage, are very large, oval and unstable. AE1 null HS individuals sometimes have a mild dyserythropoiesisand their RBC are unstable. Extensive clinical management of AE1 null individuals, including splenectomy, has improved the survival of these children, some of whom have now reached adolescence. Similarly, the Comorian homozygous SAO child is now 10 years old and quite well, receiving regular transfusions, iron chelation and acidosis treatment. From Malaysia, a live-born homozygous SAO neonate with dRTA was reported in 2015 but the child failed to thrive after 2 years.

### Imaging of the diffusion of single band 3 molecules on normal and mutant erythrocytes [^111HtRxE]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Membrane-spanning proteins may interact with a variety of other integral and peripheral membrane proteins via a diversity of protein-protein interactions. Not surprisingly, defects or mutations in any one of these interacting components can impact the physical and biological properties on the entire complex. Here we use quantum dots to image the diffusion of individual band 3 molecules in the plasma membranes of intact human erythrocytes from healthy volunteers and patients with defects in one of their membrane components, leading to well-known red cell pathologies (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary hydrocytosis, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis). After characterizing the motile properties of the major subpopulations of band 3 in intact normal erythrocytes, we demonstrate that the properties of these subpopulations of band 3 change significantly in diseased cells, as evidenced by changes in the microscopic and macroscopic diffusion coefficients of band 3 and in the compartment sizes in which the different band 3 populations can diffuse. Because the above membrane abnormalities largely arise from defects in other membrane components (eg, spectrin, ankyrin), these data suggest that single particle tracking of band 3 might constitute a useful tool for characterizing the general structural integrity of the human erythrocyte membrane.

### Band 3 mutations, distal renal tubular acidosis, and southeast Asian ovalocytosis [^116meFpE]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Familial distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) may coexist in the same patient. Both can originate in mutations of the anion-exchanger 1 gene (AE1), which codes for band 3, the bicarbonate/chloride exchanger in both the red cell membrane and the basolateral membrane of the collecting tubule alpha-intercalated cell. Dominant dRTA is usually due to a mutation of the AE1 gene, which does not alter red cell morphology. SAO is caused by an AE1 mutation that leads to a nine amino acid deletion of red cell band 3, but by itself does not cause dRTA. Recent gene studies have shown that AE1 mutations are responsible for autosomal recessive dRTA in several countries in Southeast Asia; these patients may be homozygous for the mutation or be compound heterozygotes of two different AE1 mutations, one of which is usually the SAO mutation.

### Placental malaria in women with south-east Asian ovalocytosis [^1122n5WY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2006). Low credibility.

Malaria during pregnancy, which is characterized by the accumulation of infected erythrocytes in the placenta, often has severe consequences for the mother and newborn. We assessed the effect of the genetic trait South-East Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) on placental malaria in women from Papua New Guinea. In children, this trait confers protection against cerebral malaria, but not against mild malaria disease, malaria parasitemia, or severe malaria anemia. Using a case-control approach, we found that SAO women suffer from placental malaria, and SAO-infected erythrocytes can sequester in the placenta, but heavy placental infections tended to be less common in SAO than in control pregnant women. Reduced prevalence and severity of placental infection associated with SAO were observed only for primigravid women, who are the group at highest risk of suffering from severe manifestations of placental malaria. Furthermore, we found that the prevalence of the SAO trait was lower among pregnant women than among non-pregnant controls.

### Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11195ASM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is usually based on a combination of various genetic or phenotypic criteria. Decisions regarding screening are difficult because of the variable penetrance of mutations of the HFE gene and the absence of any definitive trials addressing the benefits and risks of therapeutic phlebotomy in asymptomatic patients or those with only laboratory abnormalities. The purpose of this guideline is to increase physician awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly the variable penetrance of genetic mutations; aid in case finding; and explain the role of genetic testing. This guideline provides recommendations based on a review of evidence in the accompanying background paper by Schmitt and colleagues. The target audience for this guideline is internists and other primary care physicians. The target patient population is all persons who have a probability or susceptibility of developing hereditary hemochromatosis, including the relatives of individuals who already have the disease.

### Genetic mechanisms and modifying factors in hereditary hemochromatosis [^11511LB4]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary iron overload is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide. Several genetic mutations underlie the various forms of the disease, which have similar pathophysiological profiles but distinct clinical presentations. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis absorb too much iron from the diet, which accumulates over time within parenchymal cells. This accumulation leads to eventual organ failure as a consequence of iron-mediated formation of free radicals. The mechanism underlying this excessive absorption of iron is a sensing defect caused by the reduced formation of hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis, as a consequence of mutations in the genes encoding several membrane-bound signaling molecules present on hepatocytes. A considerable number of carriers of these specific genetic mutations, however, do not develop iron overload, indicating that additional genetic and environmental factors modify the severity and clinical penetrance of disease. In affected patients, early initiation of treatment by phlebotomy can prevent organ damage. Genetic screening of first-degree relatives can be also used to identify individuals at risk. Our expanding knowledge of the regulation of iron metabolism and the role of factors that modify the severity of the disease may lead to the design of new and improved treatments.

Case presentation

Clinical phenotype

A 3-year-old Chinese girl was referred to Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University on April 20, 2017, after a diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD) and HS. ASD in this patient was incidentally detected during a physical examination 2 years ago in a local hospital. Subsequent echocardiographic data confirmed this diagnosis, and the girl was suggested to undergo regular check-up. The patient had experienced bouts of weakness and easy fatigability since birth. One month ago, she visited a local hospital for anemia. Based on laboratory findings and the osmotic fragility test, a diagnosis of HS was made. Our hospital was recommended for further treatment.

On admission, the patient's sclerae and skin were icteric, and mucosal membranes were pale. Physical examination revealed a systolic ejection murmur with splitting of the second heart sound at the left second intercostal space, and an enlarged spleen in the left subcostal region. Hematologic assessment revealed hemoglobin levels at 8.2 g/dl (normal range, 11–17 g/dl), hematocrit at 23.8% (normal range, 36–56%), RBC count at 3.15 × 10 12 /L (normal range, 3.50–5.30 × 10 12 /L), and white blood cell count at 6.52 × 10 9 /L (normal range, 4.0–10.0 × 10 9 /L). Total serum bilirubin (89.4 μM; normal range, 2.0–22.0 μM), direct bilirubin (11.8 μM; normal range, 0.0–8.0 μM), and indirect bilirubin (77.6 μM; normal range, 0.0–14.0 μM) levels were significantly increased. Liver enzyme levels were normal. RBC size showed disparity, and the presence of spherocytes (about 12%) was noted on peripheral blood smear (Fig. 1 A). Bone marrow smear analysis showed active proliferation with erythroid preponderance (myeloid cells was 39.5%, and erythroid cell was 48.5%), increase of intermediate and late erythroblast, different size of mature erythrocyte, and the presence of polychromatic and spherical erythrocytes (Fig. 1 B). RBCs showed elevated osmotic fragility. Echocardiography revealed a fossa ovalis ASD with left-to-right shunt, enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, and dilated main pulmonary artery.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115G5C3h]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Background

RBC membrane is composed of a fluid double layer of lipids in which approximately 20 major proteins and 850 minor proteins are embedded. The membrane is attached to the intracellular cytoskeleton by protein–protein and lipid–protein interactions. The structure is required for the RBC to maintain its shape and stability and deformability. Many transmembrane (TM) proteins have a transport function and a structural function when the intracytoplasmic domain interacts with cytoskeletal proteins. For example, band 3 both interacts with cytoskeletal proteins and is the red cell chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger; in the tissues red cells take up CO 2 where it is converted to the bicarbonate ion, which leaves the cell in exchange for the chloride ion via band 3.

Many families with red cell membrane disorders of varying severity have been described. Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a disorder that involves altered membrane structural organisation. In most cases of HS mutations are located in the following genes ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EBP42 and SPTA1 which encode for Ankyrin, spectrin β-chain, band 3 protein (the red cell chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger 1), protein 4.2 and spectrin α-chain. Mutations for other disorders hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) are in the SPTA1 and SPTB gene and in the EPB41 gene. The latter gene encodes protein 4.1.HS, HE and HPP are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous blood cell membrane disorders. The presence of another RBC defect can enhance or reduce the phenotypic effects of HS, HE or HPP.

### Diagnosis and clinical management of red cell membrane disorders [^111z6yPq]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2021). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneous red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders and hydration defects often present with the common clinical findings of hemolytic anemia, but they may require substantially different management, based on their pathophysiology. An accurate and timely diagnosis is essential to avoid inappropriate interventions and prevent complications. Advances in genetic testing availability within the last decade, combined with extensive foundational knowledge on RBC membrane structure and function, now facilitate the correct diagnosis in patients with a variety of hereditary hemolytic anemias (HHAs). Studies in patient cohorts with well-defined genetic diagnoses have revealed complications such as iron overload in hereditary xerocytosis, which is amenable to monitoring, prevention, and treatment, and demonstrated that splenectomy is not always an effective or safe treatment for any patient with HHA. However, a multitude of variants of unknown clinical significance have been discovered by genetic evaluation, requiring interpretation by thorough phenotypic assessment in clinical and/or research laboratories. Here we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations and corresponding clinical management in patients with RBC membranopathies and propose an algorithm for the laboratory workup of patients presenting with symptoms and signs of hemolytic anemia, with a clinical case that exemplifies such a workup.

### The association of the glycophorin C exon 3 deletion with ovalocytosis and malaria susceptibility in the wosera, Papua New Guinea [^114SUja9]. Blood (2001). Low credibility.

Erythrocyte polymorphisms, including ovalocytosis, have been associated with protection against malaria. This study in the Wosera, a malaria holoendemic region of Papua New Guinea, examined the genetic basis of ovalocytosis and its influence on susceptibility to malaria infection. Whereas previous studies showed significant associations between Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (caused by a 27- base pair deletion in the anion exchanger 1 protein gene) and protection from cerebral malaria, this mutation was observed in only 1 of 1019 individuals in the Wosera. Polymerase chain reaction strategies were developed to genotype individuals for the glycophorin C exon 3 deletion associated with Melanesian Gerbich negativity (GPCDeltaex3). This polymorphism was commonly observed in the study population (GPCDeltaex3 frequency = 0.465, n = 742). Although GPCDeltaex3 was significantly associated with increased ovalocytosis, it was not associated with differences in either Plasmodium falciparum or P vivax infection measured over the 7-month study period. Future case-control studies will determine if GPCDeltaex3 reduces susceptibility to malaria morbidity.

### Hereditary elliptocytosis resulting from heterozygosity for β spectrin tandil [^117Rs53c]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 57‐year‐old Spanish woman was referred for investigation of chronic anemia. Her mother and grandmother also had a history of anemia. There was no jaundice and no abdominal pain or tenderness, but abdominal ultrasonography showed homogeneous splenomegaly, the spleen measuring 14.2 cm. She had required a transfusion on one occasion when the hemoglobin concentration (Hb) fell to 71 g/L. Her blood count showed Hb 130 g/L, mean cell volume 76.8 fL, mean cell hemoglobin 25.9 pg, and mean cell hemoglobin concentration 33.7 g/L. The reticulocyte count was 197 × 10 9 /L. Bilirubin was normal at 0.72 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was normal at 229 U/L. Haptoglobin was undetectable. Serum ferritin was increased to 411 ng/mL. Flow cytometry‐based eosin‐5‐maleimide (EMA) binding was low at 0.81 (normal > 0.86). Examination of a blood film showed elliptocytes, but the findings were not typical of hereditary elliptocytosis; in addition to elliptocytes, there were ovalocytes and some spherocytes (images, ×100 objective). Molecular analysis was therefore undertaken. Next‐generation sequencing showed heterogeneity for β spectrin Tandil, a pathogenic genetic variant, NM_001355436.2:c.6124_6130del p.(Asp2042Trpfs*33) in the β spectrin gene (SPTB) with a 7‐nucleotide deletion that causes a frameshift, generating a premature stop codon at position 33 of the new reading frame.

β spectrin Tandil was first described in a South American Indian family in Argentina. The hematologic abnormality resulting from this mutation was designated hereditary elliptocytosis, although blood films showed more ovalocytes than are usual in hereditary elliptocytosis, and ektacytometry indicated a spherocytic component. Similar observations have been made with other truncated β spectrin variants, including β spectrin Rouen, β spectrin Le Puy, and β spectrin Prague. The designation spherocytic elliptocytosis has sometimes been used. Most cases of hereditary elliptocytosis result from mutation of the α spectrin gene (SPTA1) or of EPB41 encoding protein 4.1. A minority result from a β spectrin mutation, including some cases with truncated β spectrin and atypical morphology.

### Epistasis and the sensitivity of phenotypic screens for beta thalassaemia [^112so9vc]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Finally, a recent case report from Thailand (Fucharoen et al,) reveals yet another complication for osmotic fragility-based screens for carriers of beta thalassaemia. Fucharoen et al described a Thai female heterozygous for both beta thalassaemia and Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis (henceforth SAO, caused by heterozygosity for a deletion in the Band 3 gene SLC4A1), whose osmotic fragility profile is entirely normal. It seems that the altered membrane properties of SAO cells counteract the increased osmotic resistance that usually results from heterozygous beta thalassaemia. The authors noted that this masking effect could create a pitfall for osmotic screening in regions where SAO is common (Fucharoen et al).

In this paper, we present an analytical framework to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of OTOFTs as first-stage screens for carriers of beta thalassaemia, in the context of epistasis with alpha thalassaemia, G6PD deficiency and SAO. Our analysis focuses in particular on three unknown factors: (i) the probability of OTOFTs detecting carriers of beta thalassaemia in the simultaneous presence of homozygosity or heterozygosity for a common alpha thalassaemic deletion; (ii) the potential for G6PD deficiency to modify the chances of double heterozygotes for both alpha and beta thalassaemia being detected, and (iii) the probability of heterozygosity for a common alpha thalassaemic deletion causing a false positive OTOFT result.

We demonstrate that high frequencies of alpha thalassaemia combined with G6PD deficiency and SAO have the potential to reduce the sensitivity of OTOFTs to unacceptable levels. Our results underscore the fact that any decision to roll out OTOFT-based beta thalassaemia screening to a new population should take account of that population's pre-existing genetic background. Our framework offers a potential tool for guiding such decisions, but also highlights the need for an improved understanding of the performance of OTOFTs for different genotypes.

### Hereditary anemia caused by multilocus inheritance of, andmutations: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^117C1g1M]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

DHS may also present as a syndromic form with pseudohyperkalemia and/or perinatal edema. Familial pseudohyperkalemia (FP) can also manifest as an isolated autosomal dominant red cell trait characterized by loss of red cell potassium at low temperatures (< 37°C). It is caused by mutations in the ABCB6 gene (2q35) encoding the ABCB6 protein, a member of the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) solute transporters that translocate many types of metabolites across intra- and extracellular membranes. The prevalence of FP is probably underestimated, as reflected in the high frequency of certain ABCB6 missense variants in population databases and in two large cohorts of blood donors.

We describe here a 54-year-old female proband followed for 16 years by our clinical genetics unit for severe anemia and iron overload (Figure 1A). The proband presented at age 24 with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 9–11 g/dL), jaundice, gallstones, hepatomegaly, and severe splenomegaly (> 18 cm craniocaudal length with weight up to 700 g). Hemoglobinopathies and enzymopathies were excluded. Coombs's test was negative. Blood smear revealed the presence of numerous stomatocytes, target cells, and rare ovalocytes and erythroblasts (Figure 1B). Osmotic fragility was decreased at 2 hours (h) and 24 h post-venesection. Pink and acidified glycerol lysis tests (AGLT) were positive, leading to an initial clinical diagnosis of HS treated by total splenectomy. After surgery, the proband experienced portal vein thrombosis treated with heparin. Worsening anemia to Hb values of 6–7 g/dL required multiple transfusions. Complete red cell count showed macrocytic anemia with MCV between 110 and 147 fL (Table 1). Mean red blood cell (RBC) half-life (measured by in vitro calcein fluorescence assay) was 21 days, with probable hepatosplenic destruction of RBC. At the age of 34 years the proband was diagnosed with severe iron overload and hepatosiderosis, and deferoxamine treatment was initiated. At age 38 pulmonary emboli were diagnosed, and she was treated with warfarin. At this time the proband also had hyperkalemia (5.0–6.8 mM). Studies of RBC cation content revealed elevated intracellular [Na] and low intracellular [K], with increased isotopic fluxes at 37°C (Table 2). Temperature-dependence studies performed by flame photometry confirmed the high cation leak flux at 37°C. This cation flux markedly diminished upon cooling of RBC below ~30°C (Figure 1C). The findings were consistent with pseudohyperkalemia. The 38-year-old proband was referred to our unit and underwent initial genetic testing for HS using a gene-bygene approach. Sanger sequencing analysis of the SLC4A1 gene revealed the presence of the heterozygous missense variant NM_000342.4:c.2057C > T (p. Thr686Met) [rs143131877, AF A = 0.000088 (12/135994, GnomAD); HGMD ID: CM204624]. This variant in the first nucleotide of exon 17 is predicted to impair exon 16–17 splicing (https://hsf.genomnis.com/). Accordingly, it was predicted to be a likely pathogenic variant per current guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). In order to determine the effect of this variant on protein expression, we isolated RBC membrane proteins from the peripheral blood of the patient. Band 3 polypeptide expression in patient RBC membranes was reduced compared to that of healthy controls (HC) by western blotting, confirming the pathogenicity of the identified variant and the diagnosis of HS (Figure 1D and E).

### Iron overload in hereditary spherocytosis: are genetic factors the cause? [^113agjke]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-transfusional iron overload (IOL) in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is poorly documented compared with other red blood cell disorders. We studied 13 HS adults with confirmed IOL to identify potential genetic factors. Using a next-generation sequencing panel of 46 genes related to HS, anaemia and iron metabolism, we found no association between IOL and the genes involved in HS nor the HFE:p.(Cys282Tyr) variant responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis. However, potential genetic factors contributing to IOL were identified in some patients, including variants in HJV (haemojuvelin), SLC40A1 (ferroportin), PKLR (pyruvate kinase), ABCG5 and ABCB8, highlighting the need for larger studies.

### Membrane compartmentalization in southeast Asian ovalocytosis red blood cells [^1159fzxp]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Red blood cells (RBCs) from individuals with Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) contain a mutant band 3 protein that causes the formation of unique linear oligomers in the RBC membrane. We used single-particle tracking to measure the lateral diffusion of individual glycophorin C (GPC), band 3, and CD58 proteins in membranes of intact SAO RBCs and normal RBCs (nRBCs). GPC, an integral protein that binds with high affinity to the RBC membrane skeleton, showed oscillatory motion within confinement areas that were smaller in SAO RBCs than in nRBCs. The additional confinement in SAO RBCs could be due to membrane stiffening associated with the SAO phenotype. Band 3 in both SAO RBCs and nRBCs also showed confined motion over short times (ms) and distances (nm), and the area of confinement was smaller in SAO RBCs than in nRBCs. These data presumably reflect the constraints imposed by band 3 oligomerization. Similarly, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein CD58 showed loosely confined diffusion in nRBCs and a substantially higher degree of confinement in SAO RBCs. Restricted protein mobility could contribute to the altered adherence of parasite-infected RBCs to vascular endothelium that is thought to protect individuals with SAO from severe manifestations of malaria.

### A case series of distal renal tubular acidosis, southeast Asian ovalocytosis and metabolic bone disease [^117KfBGC]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by impaired hydrogen ion secretion in distal nephron. This defect leads to an inability to excrete acid load causing hydrogen ion retention and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with an inappropriately alkaline urine. Distal RTA is commonly associated with hypokalemia causing muscle paralysis which could be the first manifestation of the underlying disease.

Mutations in genes encoding renal acid-base transporters have been identified as causes of inherited/primary dRTA. These secretory defects may be observed with autosomal dominant or recessive transmissions. Autosomal dominant dRTA has been found to be associated with mutations in the gene encoding the Cl−−HCO3− exchanger AE1 (SLC4A1 gene product) or band 3 protein. In the kidney the protein is involved in acidification of the urine and in the red cell it functions both as an anion exchanger and as a membrane glycoprotein required for shape and stability. Autosomal recessive dRTA which may be associated with sensorineural deafness present mutations in the gene ATP6B1 encoding the B1-subunit of H + -ATPase. Autosomal recessive dRTA without sensorineural deafness may be caused by mutations in the gene ATP6N1B encoding the 116-kD subunit of H+ ATP-ase. Recent genetic studies has shown that autosomal recessive dRTA associated with AE1 gene mutation in many countries in Southeast Asia. Accordingly both dominant and recessive forms of dRTA can be associated with mutation of the SLC4A1 gene. Several mutations of the red-cell anion exchanger band 3 (AE1, SLC4A 1) gene associated with dRTA are reported worldwide. Three mutations, (G701D), (A858D) and deletion of Val 850 (DV850) described are restricted to South-East Asian populations particularly to Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.

### Hereditary spherocytosis is associated with decreased pyruvate kinase activity due to impaired structural integrity of the red blood cell membrane [^112wkue3]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is characterised by increased osmotic fragility and enhanced membrane loss of red blood cells (RBC) due to defective membrane protein complexes. In our diagnostic laboratory, we observed that pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in HS was merely slightly elevated with respect to the amount of reticulocytosis. In order to evaluate whether impaired PK activity is a feature of HS, we retrospectively analysed laboratory data sets from 172 unrelated patients with HS, hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) or PK deficiency, sickle cell or haemoglobin C disease, or β-thalassaemia minor. Results from linear regression analysis provided proof that PK activity decreases with rising reticulocyte counts in HS (R 2 = 0.15; slope = 9.09) and, less significantly, in HE (R 2 = 0.021; slope = 8.92) when compared with other haemolytic disorders (R 2 ≥ 0.65; slopes ≥ 78.6). Reticulocyte-adjusted erythrocyte PK activity levels were significantly lower in HS and even declined with increasing reticulocytes (R 2 = 0.48; slope = -9.74). In this report, we describe a novel association between HS and decreased PK activity that is apparently caused by loss of membrane-bound PK due to impaired structural integrity of the RBC membrane and may aggravate severity of haemolysis in HS.

### Iron overload: what is the role of public health? [^113c4YGZ]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1, also known as hereditary hemochromatosis classical (HHC), is an iron overload disorder associated, in most cases, with mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. Although suggested algorithms for diagnosing iron overload are available, there are still questions about options for genetic and biochemical screening for hemochromatosis and duration of treatment. This article provides a summary of an expert workgroup meeting convened on September 24–25, 2009, entitled "Iron Overload: What is the Role of Public Health?" The purpose of the meeting was to enable subject matter experts to share their most recent clinical and scientific iron overload information and to facilitate the discussion of future endeavors, with special emphasis on the role of public health in this field. The two main topics were the research priorities of the field, including clinical, genetic, and public health issues, and the concerns about the validity of current screening recommendations for the condition.

### A case series of distal renal tubular acidosis, southeast Asian ovalocytosis and metabolic bone disease [^114RJbjn]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Familial dRTA and an inherited erythrocyte disorder 'Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis' (SAO), both caused by mutations in the solute carrier family 4 membrane − 1 (SLC4A1) gene, may be co-inherited in trans resulting in dRTA. SAO is an inherited erythrocyte disorder characterized by macro-ovalocytes and stomatocytes on blood smear. It results from the band 3 deletion of residues 400–408 (B3 SAO) which is responsible for an unusual erythrocyte stiffness and oval shape of the cells on blood smear. Heterozygous carriers are usually asymptomatic whereas homozygous are usually lethal and appear to be incompatible with life.

Mutations in SLC4A1 gene associated with dominant dRTA do not affect the function of the erythroid isoform band 3 unless the patient has an additional deletion causing SAO. Out of three gene mutations of band 3 mentioned above, G701D and DV850 have autosomal recessive inheritance but segregate as though dominant when the B3 SAO allele is present which is called Pseudo-dominant phenotype. A858D mutation has autosomal dominant inheritance. Patients with dRTA may be homozygous for the mutation or be compound heterozygotes of two different AE1 mutations. Compound heterozygotes with B3 SAO exhibit dRTA co-existing with SAO. Mutations exert different effects on the biosynthesis, structure and function of band 3 that lead to defective acid secretion in the kidney.

We report six patients presenting with hypokalemic paralysis, dRTA and SAO. All patients are from Anuradhapura district in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka, and presented to the Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura within a period of 6 months. Four of them had notable past medical history of hypokalemic periodic paralysis but previously the presence of SAO was not evaluated. Their acid base disturbances were re-evaluated. All belong to ethnic group Sinhala. None of them had evidence of an underlying autoimmune disease or hearing impairment. Except for the 4th patient who had family history of undiagnosed renal disease, none of the patients had family history of similar illness or consanguinity.

### Homozygous southeast Asian ovalocytosis in five live-born neonates [^111gVhRA]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Comparison of five Malaysian live-born homozygous Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) cases with a previously reported Comorian homozygous SAO case.

Figure 1.
Family pedigree charts of five homozygous Southeast Asian ovalocytosis cases. Families of each homozygous Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) cases are represented: (A) GO 003/10, (B) GO 001/14, (C) GO 010/10, (D) GO 012/19, and (E) GO 012/13. Squares and circles denote male and females, respectively, with filled ones (grey or black) showing members affected with SAO. The numbered triangle (C) shows number of spontaneous abortions that occurred in the couple's past pregnancies. Parents of two SAO homozygous children (GO 012/19 and GO 010/10) had multiple unsuccessful pregnancies. The mother of GO 012/19 suffered two intra-uterine deaths (including GO 012/19), while the mother of GO 010/10 suffered three spontaneous abortions. None of these other unsuccessful pregnancies were investigated further. On the other hand, parents of GO 012/13 have two living children among whom one is SAO heterozygous, while parents of GO 012/19 have three living children with unknown SAO status (see the Online Supplementary Table S2). d: died; IUD: intra-uterine death.

Several point mutations in AE1 that result in a wide range of complications have been reported, many of them leading to anemia and dRTA. Hemolytic anemia is recorded in children with homozygous G701D or compound heterozygous G701D/SAO, V850/SAO, A858D/SAO and V850/A858D mutations. Therefore, homozygous SAO and other AE1 null individuals, who show disparity in survival, may be indicating the cumulative result of hemolysis, acidosis and other hematological abnormalities influenced by the co-occurrence of additional mutations.

To our knowledge, this preliminary Malaysian SAO cohort study, for the first-time reports five homozygous SAO live-born cases. Since Malaysia and Southeast Asia have a high prevalence of SAO it would be beneficial to screen for SAO at antenatal clinics, at least for parents with a history of hydropic or stillborn fetuses. It is also essential to investigate the impact of heterozygous mutant SAO AE1 on other pathological conditions and ageing. Development of international and national guidelines for assessing a number of hematological, renal, and hepatic conditions in combination with genetic mutation markers to improve survival of homozygous AE1 null probands is needed.

### High prevalence of southeast Asian ovalocytosis in malays with distal renal tubular acidosis [^117Jin8D]. Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a red blood cell abnormality common in malaria-endemic regions and caused by a 27 nt deletion of the band 3 protein gene. Since band 3 protein, also known as anion exchanger 1, is expressed in renal distal tubules, the incidence of SAO was examined in distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) in Malays in Kelantan, Malaysia. Twenty-two patients with dRTA and 50 healthy volunteers were examined for complication of SAO by both morphological and genetic analyses. SAO was identified in 18 of the 22 dRTA patients (81.8%), but only two of the 50 controls (4%). The incidence of SAO was significantly high in those with dRTA (p < 0.001), indicating a dysfunctional role for band 3 protein/anion exchanger 1 in the development of dRTA.

### Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and southeast Asian ovalocytosis in asymptomatic plasmodium carriers in sumba island, Indonesia [^111bUFJs]. Journal of Human Genetics (2005). Low credibility.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) caused by a 27-bp deletion in the band 3 gene (Band3Delta 27) are well-documented genetic traits resistant to malarial diseases; however, relationships between these traits and asymptomatic malaria infection hitherto had not been investigated. Filter-blotted blood samples were collected from a total of 210 healthy individuals, 100 males and 110 females, aged 6–17 years, in Sumba island, Indonesia, to survey for the presence of Plasmodium parasites, G6PD activity and the Band3Delta 27 mutation. Presence of P. falciparum and/or P. vivax was identified in 25 subjects (11.9%). In all, 24 subjects (11.4%) showed Band3Delta 27 heterozygously. In males and females, eight and nine subjects, respectively, showed G6PD deficiency. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection between individuals with or without these traits (P > 0.05). No alterations in the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection suggest that parasite invasion into erythrocytes is unlikely to be a target phase in which the two polymorphisms demonstrate possible protective effects against malaria.

### Atypical hereditary spherocytosis phenotype associated with pseudohypokalaemia and a new variant in the band 3 protein [^115DNr23]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Normal RBC has very low basal permeability (leak) to cations which is counteracted by Na, K-ATPase. The leak is temperature dependent. Red cell membrane disorders can also be secondary to altered membrane transport function. Hereditary stomatocytosis has several phenotypes associated with distinct genetic changes. The cryohydrosis phenotype which includes South-east Asian Ovalocytes results from mutations in the SLC4A1 and the rare condition; stomatin-deficient cryohydrosis is caused by mutations in SLC2A1. Mutations in RHAG cause the highly leaky condition overhydrated stomatocytosis and mutations in ABCB6 cause familial pseudohyperkalaemia (FP). All of the above are large multispanning membrane proteins. More recently mutations have been found in two RBC cation channels PIEZO1 and KCNN4 which result in dehydrated stomatocytosis. Changes in cation transport are a common factor in these disorders; however, these disorders show a wide heterogeneity in the degree of cation leak, temperature dependence of the leak and presenting symptoms.

Measurement of the temperature dependence of the abnormal cation leak in red cell membrane disorders is a useful means of identifying leaky mutations. The temperature dependence of the abnormal leak differs in the steepness and minimum temperature of the cation leak than normal controls. Bruce et al identified several different phenotypes associated with SLC4A1 mutations, including the cryohydrocytosis form of stomatocytosis, and HS associated with a large cation leak. Red cells from the affected pedigrees showed a deficiency of band 3 anion transport. The mutant RBCs have an increased permeability to cations though no study so far has shown that the cation leak is through the band 3 protein.

Red cells from FP patients exhibit a loss of K+ at low temperatures, < 37°C mostly at 4°C. The temperature dependency of the cation leak is variable.FP has been associated with HS and hereditary stomatocytosis. Other authors describe the haematological abnormalities as negligible or as atypical HS. The gene responsible for FP was identified as ABCB6 which encodes the protein ABCB6, previously identified as a porphyrin transporter, which belongs to the family of ABC transporters with a binding cassette for ATP. The protein plays a role in heme synthesis. It is not clear whether the mutant ABCB6 protein can generate a cation leak pathway or secondarily change conformation of other proteins that dysregulate membrane cation permeability.

### A 58-year-old woman with hypoxia, hypoxaemia, a hole in the heart and a… herring! intracardiac or extracardiac shunt? That is the question! [^112saz8o]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We describe a case of a previously healthy 58-year-old woman who presented with gradual onset shortness of breath on exertion, erythrocytosis, hypoxia and hypoxaemia. Initial investigations revealed a normal chest radiography and pulmonary function test, however, there was an isolated reduction in diffusion capacity. She was subsequently found to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with intermittent shunting. A contrast echocardiography study hinted towards an extracardiac shunt. No shunt was detected in spite of using advanced imaging techniques. A lung biopsy was ultimately performed and histopathology revealed diffuse microvascular pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. This is one of few cases reported of this rare vascular abnormality and highlights its strong genetic association with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. The diagnostic challenges and management of this unique condition are reviewed in detail.

### Austronesian origin of the 27-bp deletion of the erythrocyte band 3 gene in east sepik, Papua New Guinea inferred from mtDNA analysis [^115MVhQC]. Journal of Human Genetics (2006). Low credibility.

The 27-bp deletion in the erythrocyte band 3 gene (B3Delta27) constitutes a genetic basis for Southeast Asian and Melanesian ovalocytosis. The distribution of B3Delta27 has been interpreted to reflect malaria selection or dispersal of the recent expansion of Austronesian-speaking populations. To explore these two hypotheses, we examined eight malarious populations of the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea (PNG) that speak both the Austronesian and Papuan languages. The B3Delta27 allele frequencies within populations were not positively correlated with malaria endemicities. In contrast, statistically significant geographical variations in the B3Delta27 allele distribution were observed. B3Delta27 was high (0.06–0.07) in the islands, intermediate (0.02–0.03) in coastal regions, but was absent or rare (0.00–0.01) in inland populations. Furthermore, the prevalence of the mitochondrial DNA region V 9-bp deletion, associated with the Austronesian expansion, was significantly correlated with that of B3Delta27. These results suggest that B3Delta27 was introduced by Austronesian-speaking people within the past 3,500 years and subsequently expanded to populations along the coasts and islands of PNG. This study highlights the contribution of population origins, patterns of gene flow, disease selection and genetic drift in determining the genetic compositions of present populations.

### Hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis: aberrant protein sorting during erythroblast enucleation [^117LwyX9]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

During erythroblast enucleation, membrane proteins distribute between extruded nuclei and reticulocytes. In hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and hereditary elliptocytosis (HE), deficiencies of membrane proteins, in addition to those encoded by the mutant gene, occur. Elliptocytes, resulting from protein 4.1R gene mutations, lack not only 4.1R but also glycophorin C, which links the cytoskeleton and bilayer. In HS resulting from ankyrin-1 mutations, band 3, Rh-associated antigen, and glycophorin A are deficient. The current study was undertaken to explore whether aberrant protein sorting, during enucleation, creates these membrane-spanning protein deficiencies. We found that although glycophorin C sorts to reticulocytes normally, it distributes to nuclei in 4.1R-deficient HE cells. Further, glycophorin A and Rh-associated antigen, which normally partition predominantly to reticulocytes, distribute to both nuclei and reticulocytes in an ankyrin-1-deficient murine model of HS. We conclude that aberrant protein sorting is one mechanistic basis for protein deficiencies in HE and HS.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

Questions regarding nomenclature and case definition

It became apparent during the BPM that questions regarding the nomenclature and case definition of HH are among the major causes of confusion when dealing with the interpretation of test results and reporting practices. Some participants pointed to the fact that, in face of the increasing awareness and knowledge of the pathogenesis of iron overload disorders, some concepts relating to HH definition should be revised.

The term Hemochromatosis was first coined by von Recklinghausenin 1889 following the description of its iron-related pathology. The clinical characteristics of the disease were later described by John Sheldon159 in 1934 after a systematic review of autopsy cases, and the autosomal recessive mode of transmission was demonstrated by Simon and co-workersin 1977 following the discovery of its association to HLA. Since that time, a typical phenotypic characterization of patients was necessary to define HH, including the demonstration of severe liver iron overload. The selection of HH patients based on a strict phenotypic case definition was fundamental to permit the positional cloning of the HH-associated gene. After the discovery in 1996 of the genetic defect in HFE, which explained over 80% of previously phenotypically characterized cases, a genetic definition of HH became available, and a pre-symptomatic diagnosis in subjects with less severe forms of iron overload became feasible. These advances, however, also brought some confusion among clinicians about what constitutes the case definition of HH. Although a purely genetic definition cannot be accepted, owing to the low penetrance and variable clinical expression of p.C282Y homozygosity in HFE, a purely phenotypic case definition is also not acceptable because it will necessarily combine many different types of iron overload (genetic and acquired) defeating the original purpose of having a case definition, that is, to characterize the natural history, disease prognosis and, most importantly, to guide its treatment and/or prevention. For the purpose of nomenclature harmonization, we refer in this document to HFE-related HH according to the case definition agreed on the 2010 EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines for HFE Hemochromatosis, that is, as the occurrence of increased body iron stores associated with homozygosity for the p.C282Y HFE variant, with or without clinical symptoms. The other rare forms of HH are here classified as non-HFE-related HH in harmonization with the classification agreed in the AASLD Practice Guideline of 2011. They can be generally defined as increased body iron stores not associated with homozygosity for the p.C282Y HFE variant but attributed to pathogenic variants in other iron-related genes, namely hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP) and transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2). For all of these genes, the pathogenesis of HH involves inadequate or ineffective production or hepcidin-mediated downregulation of ferroportin with consequent increase in iron absorption and iron export from macrophages. In the case of ferroportin variants, when they are associated with an excessive ferroportin-mediated iron export (gain-of-function variants, or type B), they cause a phenotype similar to the one observed in the classical HFE-related HH with elevated TS, hyperferritinemia and iron overload mostly affecting hepatocytes, but with normal or elevated (rather than low) hepcidin levels. In this case, ferroportin disease is included in the differential diagnosis of non-HFE-related hemochromatosis. In the case of the most common loss-of-function ferroportin variants (type A), the interaction between hepcidin and ferroportin is altered affecting iron export from cells with consequent accumulation in Kupffer cells and other macrophages, and is expressed by hyperferritinemia with high/normal or low TS. Although originally described as autosomal dominant hemochromatosisand referred to in the OMIM database as type 4 hemochromatosis, strictly speaking, it does not fit into the classical definition of HH which implies an inappropriately high absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal mucosa with consequent increased iron storage.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^115QWr96]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytic anemia is also a characteristic finding in inherited and acquired bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) affecting one or more lineages, such as Diamond‐Blackfan anemia, Schwachman‐Diamond syndrome, Fanconi anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias (CDA), which are caused by pathogenic variants in a variety of genes directly or indirectly affecting cell division and leading to ineffective erythropoiesis, typically present as macrocytic anemia with suboptimal reticulocytosis. It is likely that the macrocytosis in BMFS as well as in CDAs is caused by a decreased average number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis, producing fewer but larger erythrocytes.

PIII‐A had a normal absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) at 52 × 10 9 /L, suboptimal for her level of anemia. Peripheral blood smear revealed mild to moderate anisopoikilocytosis, normochromic macrocytes with occasional hypochromic red cells and notable ovalocytes (Figure S1), with no increase in polychromasia, suggesting inadequate RBC production rather than a purely hemolytic anemia (Figure 1). Vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine levels in serum, RBC folate level, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, copper, and thyroid stimulating hormone levels were normal. OGE was also normal (Figure S1), ruling out HX and OHSt. Similar CBC findings were noted 2 months later, so a bone marrow evaluation was performed. This showed normal marrow cellularity for age, erythroid hyperplasia with a myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio 2:1 (rather than the normal 3:1 ratio) with a mild left shift, that is, increased early erythroid precursors, and signs of dyserythropoiesis including binucleated erythroblasts, occasional cytoplasmic bridges, and karyorrhexis (Figure 1). Ring sideroblasts were not noted. Cytogenetic testing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry did not show evidence of malignancy or MDS. Based on these findings along with the relatively high ferritin, suboptimal reticulocytosis, and family history of macrocytic anemia with iron overload, a possible diagnosis of CDA was considered, leading to next‐generation sequencing (NGS) on a panel of genes associated with HHA/CDA (Table S1), which demonstrated a novel heterozygous variant of unknown significance (VUS) in exon 8 of ALAS2 (c.1066G > A, p. Val356Met) (Figure 2).

The nomenclature of genetic disorders

HC nomenclature suffers from a common problem of classifying genetic diseases. In contrast to genes, diseases lack a standardized way to review official names and symbols by formal committees. Disease nomenclature is often derived from the name(s) of the physician(s) who first described the condition, 1 major sign or symptom, or the biochemical/genetic underlying defect. However, the growing comprehension of the pathophysiological or molecular mechanisms that regulate diseases, as well as the identification of new phenotypes, may require revision of the initial name by experts in order to improve its usefulness in clinical practice.

Proper nomenclature, in fact, is an essential prerequisite for clear and effective communication about a particular condition. Ideally, it should unequivocally evoke disorders sharing the same pathogenesis and treatment, eventually helping clinicians to provide an accurate diagnosis and management.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1135rYa9]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

An agreed set of best practice guidelines has now been updated for diagnostic, predictive and carrier testing for HFE-related HH and for reporting the results of such testing. In addition, some basic guidelines have been developed for testing and reporting rarer forms of non-HFE-related HH. Consensus and consultation processes for this document occurred within the framework of a best practice meeting where, following prior dissemination of related literature, relevant topics were discussed by a group of experts. The resulting recommendations are based on the available published evidence, and the GRADE system for scoring the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations was applied. This process has been translated into guidance when reporting variants associated with iron overload disorders.

### Rapid flow cytometric test for the diagnosis of membrane cytoskeleton-associated haemolytic anaemia [^113bZeNc]. British Journal of Haematology (2000). Low credibility.

The flow cytometric test measures the fluorescence intensity of intact red cells labelled with the dye eosin-5-maleimide, which reacts covalently with Lys-430 on the first extracellular loop of band 3 protein. In this study, red cells from patients with hereditary spherocytosis (HS), congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II, South-east Asian ovalocytosis and cryohydrocytosis have produced a greater degree of reduction of mean channel fluorescence readings than those for other patient groups and normal controls. The predictive value of this test for membrane abnormality was compared with the results obtained from the sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method, which is currently the reference laboratory test for the identification of membrane protein deficiencies in hereditary spherocytosis and for the detection of spectrin variants in hereditary elliptocytosis. The dye method is a reliable, speedy diagnostic test (2 h from sample collection to result) for HS with a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 99.1%. Thus, it will serve well as a first-line screening test for the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis in routine haematology.

### Hereditary anemia caused by multilocus inheritance of, andmutations: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^115SsJEQ]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell (RBC) membrane disorders encompass a vast group of hemolytic anemias that differ widely in their clinical, morphologic, laboratory, and molecular features. Subtypes include (i) RBC disorders caused by altered membrane structural organization and (ii) RBC disorders caused by altered membrane transport function. The most common anemia among the first group is hereditary spherocytosis (HS), with a prevalence from 1:2000 to 1:5000 births. HS manifests clinically as hemolytic anemia with jaundice, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly, and cholelithiasis. Five genes encoding cytoskeleton and transmembrane proteins are most commonly associated with HS: ankyrin-1 (ANK1, 8p11.21), erythrocytic α- and β-spectrin chains (SPTA1, 1q21; SPTB, 14q23.3), band 3 anion transport protein (SLC4A1, 17q21.31), and erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 (EPB42, 15q15-q21).2 Disorders of altered membrane transport function include a wide spectrum of hemolytic disorders in which the erythrocyte membrane cation permeability is altered, with dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) the most frequently encountered. The prevalence of DHS remains uncertain, as this disease is often misdiagnosed.DHS exhibits alterations of RBC membrane permeability to monovalent cations Na + and K +, with consequent alterations of intracellular cation, water content, and cell volume. Patients present with hemolytic anemia, typically macrocytic, with increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), high reticulocyte count, and jaundice. Blood films may show stomatocytes, usually < 10% of total erythrocytes. Splenectomy is contraindicated in patients affected by DHS due to the risk of severe thrombotic events. The two causative genes of DHS are PIEZO1 (16q24.3) for DHS type 1 (DHS1) and KCNN4 (19q13.31) for DHS type 2. DHS is also frequently associated with iron overload, which frequently leads to hepatosiderosis. Indeed, recent findings highlight a role for PIEZO1 in the regulation of iron metabolism.DHS patients can exhibit hyperferritinemia (and even life-threatening hemosiderosis) accompanied by very low values of plasma hepcidin. Overexpression and pharmacological activation of the R2456H and R2488Q PIEZO1 gain-of-function (GoF) mutants in hepatoma cell lines induced decreased expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene, HAMP.PIEZO1 involvement in iron metabolism was further confirmed in constitutive and in macrophage-specific transgenic PIEZO1 GoF mice. By 1 year of age, these mice develop severe hepatic hemosiderosis with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, accompanied by increased erythrophagocytosis, erythropoiesis, and erythroferrone expression.

### How to identify the genetic basis of gastrointestinal and liver diseases? [^114CmqKB]. Gut (2003). Low credibility.

New insights into the genetic basis of disease are being generated at an ever increasing rate. This explosion of information was ignited by technological advances, such as the polymerase chain reaction and automated DNA sequencing. Although its promise is great, the integration of genetics into the everyday practice of medicine remains challenging. This review discusses the application of molecular genetics in general with a specific focus on hereditary diseases of the digestive organs. The application of molecular genetics in everyday clinical routine is hampered by the difficult interpretation of test results. These difficulties include the prediction of disease penetrance, the presence of multiple mutations of a particular gene with varying functional consequences, and the importance of exogenous factors modulating disease expression. To date, the most significant impact of genetics has been to increase our understanding of disease aetiology and pathogenesis and to reliably identify siblings of affected patients with the risk to develop symptomatic disease.

### Understanding iron homeostasis through genetic analysis of hemochromatosis and related disorders [^115grZ2B]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Genetic analysis of hemochromatosis has led to the discovery of a number of genes whose mutations disrupt iron homeostasis and lead to iron overload. The introduction of molecular tests into clinical practice has provided a tool for early diagnosis of these conditions. It has become clear that hemochromatosis includes a spectrum of disorders that range from simple biochemical abnormalities to chronic asymptomatic tissue damage in midlife to serious life-threatening diseases in young subjects. Molecular studies have identified the systemic loop that controls iron homeostasis and is centered on the hepcidin-ferroportin interaction. The complexity of this regulatory pathway accounts for the genetic heterogeneity of hemochromatosis and related disorders and raises the possibility that genes encoding components of the pathway may be modifiers of the main genotype. Molecular diagnosis has improved the classification of the genetic conditions leading to iron overload and identified novel entities, characterized by both iron loading and variable degrees of anemia. Despite the progress in the diagnosis, classification, and mechanisms of iron overload disorders, the treatment of affected patients continues to rely on regular phlebotomy. Understanding the molecular circuitry of iron control may lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets for novel treatment strategies to be used in association with or as an alternative to phlebotomy.

### Homozygous southeast Asian ovalocytosis in five live-born neonates [^116gUe7w]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, a total of six homozygous SAO were found in our cohort, five of whom were live-born (Figure 1, Table 1, Online Supplementary Appendix, and Homozygous SAO case histories). All parents of liveborn homozygous SAO cases, with the exception of one (GO 009/16), were confirmed heterozygous for the SAO AE1 deletion; case GO 012/19 was a homozygous fetus that suffered intra-uterine death at 29 weeks. All the five live-born cases were delivered prematurely, at 30 to 35 weeks of gestation. Similar to previous homozygous SAO live-borns, our five homozygous SAO live-borns suffered a severe phenotype requiring intra-uterine transfusions, post-delivery transfusions and ventilation support. Despite efforts to manage their condition, two of the five patients reported here died, one during the neonatal period and one at 2 months. Even though the other two cases survived during the neonatal period, one of them (GO 012/13) succumbed during infancy due to complications of anemia and the other is not traceable after 2 months. Further details of the obstetric history of these families are provided in Figure 1 and the Online Supplementary Table S2.

Among the five live-born homozygous SAO cases, three of them had severe anemia at birth and two of them developed it at 26 weeks (GO/01/10) and 25 weeks (GO 012/13). All except GO 001/14 had hydrops fetalis and hepatosplenomegaly (Table 1). Physical examination revealed pale appearance, distended abdomen due to hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice in all five cases. One of the five cases was reported to have dRTA diagnosed in the third monthbut the other four were not tested. Despite medical interventions, all five homozygous SAO children failed to thrive. This could be due to hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia or lack of appropriate clinical management. It is difficult to gain more insights into the implications of the SAO homozygous cases as incomplete clinical data of the SAO cohort was collected, lacking data on hemoglobin abnormalities and blood group compatibility. It is also not known whether prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy were offered. These services are not always available, and/or not acceptable to parents. It is now evident that careful clinical management can improve the life of homozygous SAO individuals. The long-standing assumptions that homozygous SAO is lethal, and that heterozygous SAO is asymptomatic should be re-assessed.

### Approach to anaemia in gastrointestinal disease: a position paper by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^1161wz8n]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A reduced erythrocyte mass can be the consequence of haemolytic anaemia, resulting from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Hereditary or acquired diseases can be the cause of intrinsic abnormalities in the structure and membrane of RBSs, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, enzymatic disorders (glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] and pyruvate synthesis), sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia. Regarding extrinsic factors of anaemia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenic purpura or disseminated intravascular coagulation represent mechanical processes with the destruction of RBCs. Furthermore, antibody‐mediated destruction of RBCs can also be considered an extrinsic disorder.

The morphology of anaemia is described by RBC size, shape and colour. Using this classification system, anaemias are classified as hypochromic microcytic anaemia (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] < 80 fL), macrocytic anaemia (MCV > 100 fL) and normocytic normochromic anaemia (MCV: 80–100 fL). Main causes of microcytic anaemia include IDA, thalassaemia, and ACD, with impaired iron absorption due to tissue inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IDA is diagnosed in the presence of ferritin < 30 or < 100 μg/L in the absence/presence of active disease, respectively. Inflammation through cytokine‐mediated mechanisms may trigger an increase in hepcidin and a decrease in circulating iron levels, but not ferritin, hence in the presence of biochemical and/or clinical evidence of inflammation, ACD should be diagnosed if serum ferritin levels are increased and transferrin saturation is decreased.

Finally, anaemia can also be classified according to the form of clinical presentation as acute (usually due to bleeding or haemolysis) or chronic.

### Pathophysiological consequences and benefits ofmutations: 20 years of research [^116v8oRR]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that is hallmarked by excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs. The HFE mutation p. Cys282Tyr is pathologically most relevant and occurs in the Caucasian population with a carrier frequency of up to 1 in 8 in specific European regions. Despite this high prevalence, the mutation causes a clinically relevant phenotype only in a minority of cases. In this review, we summarize historical facts and recent research findings about hereditary hemochromatosis, and outline the pathological consequences of the associated gene defects. In addition, we discuss potential advantages of HFE mutations in asymptomatic carriers.

### Band 3, an essential red blood cell hub of activity [^1154gbew]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Another impressive feature of this manuscript is the depth of characterization of the band 3 N-terminal interactome provided by the authors. Varied proteomic approaches, including chemical crosslinking, characterized site-specific interaction interfaces between GAPDH and band 3, with additional prospective interacting proteins reported including enzymes involved in glutathione synthesis, recycling and lipid peroxidation pathways. However, dissecting the functional relevance of the band 3 interactome is beset with substantial challenges, with its own abundance, existence within at least three (and potentially many more sub-) populations each with genuine direct and additional indirect interactants, all complicating interpretation. It is unlikely and indeed in some cases impossible (where binding sites for multiple proteins overlap) that all of the proteins reported bind to all of the copies of band 3, or even every band 3-containing complex. Efforts such as this, and others to uncover not just the identity but the plasticity and relevance of such interactions under physiologically relevant conditions, be they altered oxygenation, tonicity, mechanical deformationor storage such as the work described here, are key to our evolving understanding of RBC structure-function relationships.

Finally, given the essential role band 3 plays in RBC metabolism, the manuscript also touches on the potential of band 3 polymorphisms to influence storage characteristics, using data from the REDSIII storage study. Here a note of caution needs to be applied as, besides a handful of already known polymorphisms in the band 3 N-terminus (previously shown to be associated with hereditary spherocytosis), it remains unclear what precise impact these mutations have. Any alteration in band 3 abundance has knock-on effects on RBC membrane stability which will impact on the expression of band 3-dependent and -independent proteins alike. Nevertheless, more widely, further determination of the mechanistic basis by which polymorphisms (both pathogenic and non-pathogenic) can influence properties of the RBC beyond those most obviously apparent represents an important continuing endeavor.

G6PDd and genetic disorders, infections or haematological conditions

Seven articles described the dual burden of G6PDd and other infections or genetic disorders. Five articles discussed G6PDd and malaria, three of which were from Thailand, one was from Cambodia and one was from Myanmar. In the article from Myanmar, the double red cell genetic disorders of thalassemia and severe G6PDd were reported to confer a certain degree of protection against falciparum malaria. Two articles from Thailand found that having G6PDd was associated with having typhoid fever and hereditary elliptocytosis, respectively.

Eight articles examined the relationship between G6PDd and other haematological conditions. In a study from Myanmar, G6PDd was found to be a risk factor for acute bilirubin encephalopathy among neonates. A significant increase in mean corpuscular reticulocyte volume was reported among patients with anaemia with G6PDd in a study from Thailand. Another Thai study found that neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia with bilirubin encephalopathy was the major deleterious effect of G6PDd. Two studies from Vietnam reported an association between having G6PDd and developing blackwater fever syndrome. In a study on neonates in Thailand, having G6PDd was found to be associated with developing neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.G6PDd was not reported to have any additional adverse effects on the haematological parameters of homozygous haemoglobin E individuals in Thailand.

### Splenectomy improves erythrocyte functionality in spherocytosis based on septin abundance, but not maturation defects [^1135x9Ax]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The cytoskeleton is one of the main red blood cell (RBC) constituents involved in deformability and functionality. It is composed of a meshwork of spectrin (SPT) tetramers linked to the lipid bilayer by 2 nonredundant anchorage complexes based on 4.1R and ankyrin (ANK1) proteins. The 4.1R anchorage complexes allow for SPT horizontal linkages, whereas the ANK1 anchorage complexes ensure most of the vertical linkages between the SPT meshwork and the lipid bilayer. Upon RBC deformation, a transient rise of intracellular calcium activates Gardos channels, leading to cell dehydration, and favors local uncoupling between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Besides a specific surface-to-volume ratio, a finely regulated cytoplasmic viscosity controlled by the intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and the redox state also contribute to the RBC deformation process. During the RBC's normal lifespan of 120 days, the RBC membrane elasticity is strained ∼12 000 times upon its passage from the splenic cords to the venous sinuses demarcated by a discontinuous endothelium. Defective or old RBCs have difficulty managing this passage and remain blocked in the cords, where they are phagocytosed.

This is the case in hereditary spherocytosis, a disease characterized by a loss of RBC biconcavity in favor of spherocytes, stomatocytes, acanthocytes and echinocytes and by an impairment of RBC deformability. Spherocytosis is the most common cause of chronic hemolytic anemia because of a red cell membrane defect. It is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical severity, from mild (∼20%, nearly asymptomatic) to moderate (∼75%, possible intermittent need for transfusions) to severe (∼5%, life-threatening and transfusion-dependent anemia). In Northern America and Europe, it can affect 1 out of 2000 or 5000 children. Spherocytosis results in ∼75% cases from an autosomal dominant inheritance and in ∼15% from autosomal recessive inheritance. De novo mutations are rare. Mutations affect predominantly the genes encoding for ANK1, Band3, α- and β-SPT (SPTB), and 4.2R. Those mutations cause the weakening of the vertical linkages between the cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer and thereby its destabilization. In consequence, there is a premature clearance of RBCs in the spleen, leading, in the worst cases, to anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and cholelithiasis.

### Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and pregnancy in a malaria-endemic region of Papua New Guinea [^112bEmoL]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2007). Low credibility.

The band 3 deletion for southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) occurs commonly in southeast Asia and the western Pacific. Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is associated with protection against cerebral malaria in children and therefore could reduce sequestration of erythrocytes parasitized by Plasmodium falciparum in the brain microvasculature. Sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes in the placenta accounts for much of the pathology of malaria during pregnancy. Therefore, we investigated the effect of SAO on malaria during pregnancy in the malaria-hyperendemic north coastal region of Papua New Guinea. The frequency of SAO in 927 women attending hospital for delivery was 8.7% (95% confidence interval = 6.9–10.5). Markers of fertility, the frequency of miscarriages and stillbirths, maternal anemia, placental and peripheral malaria at delivery, and birth weight were similar in women with and without SAO. In summary, although we can not exclude an interaction between SAO and malaria during pregnancy, we found no evidence that it provided a clinical benefit in this population.

### Coinheritance of hereditary spherocytosis with haemochromatosis: next-generation sequencing reveals [^115BiTkw]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report the case of a man in his 50s with extravascular haemolysis, fluctuating indirect hyperbilirubinaemia, elevated transferrin saturation with hyperferritinaemia and normal liver enzymes. Spherocytes were detected in a blood smear and a mutation of unknown significance, c.1626+1G > Ap.?, in intron 13 of the SLC4A1 gene, was identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The same mutation was found in his daughter, who presented with similar laboratory changes, confirming the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Abdominal MRI showed hepatosplenomegaly with hepatic iron overload. In this context of haemolysis (without anaemia) and iron overload, a diagnosis of haemochromatosis was presumed. NGS confirmed the presence of the variants p.(His63Asp) and p.(Cys282Tyr) in heterozygosity in the HFE gene. We report this case for the rarity of co-existing two haematological diseases counteracting each other.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON society [^111LWDRs]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 3
Iron homeostasis in normal conditions (A) and mechanisms leading to iron accumulation in HC (B) and in iron-loading anemias that are nontransfusion-dependent (C) and transfusion-dependent (D). In HC, iron hyperabsorption through the portal vein leads to iron accumulation in liver parenchymal cells, initially with a typical portal-central gradient (see histology) and sparing of macrophages (Kupffer cells). In nontransfusion-dependent anemias with ineffective erythropoiesis, hepcidin insufficiency is also central to the pathogenesis of IO, but it is due to suppression by soluble factors (eg, ERFE) produced by ineffective/expanded erythroblasts rather than to a genetic defect in pathways regulating hepcidin synthesis. In transfusion-dependent anemias, regular red blood cells (RBCs) transfusions represent the major contributing factor to IO; in these conditions, hepcidin is relatively upregulated by iron but fluctuates in response to intermittent erythropoiesis suppression by transfusions.

### Classification and molecular biology of polycythemias (erythrocytoses) and thrombocytosis [^115FS2K1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, polycythemic disorders are classified based on the current understanding of biology of erythropoieses and divided into primary and secondary polycythemias. Special emphasis is given to recently uncovered molecular bases of newly described congenital polycythemic disorders. This clarification of the pathophysiology of some of the congenital polycythemic states has obvious utility for more accurate diagnosis and rational prognostic determination. The molecular basis of congenital thrombocytoses is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, the molecular bases of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia remain unknown, thus their diagnostic criteria are imprecise and their treatment remains largely empirical. The central premise of this article is that deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases leads to improved understanding of hematopoiesis, precise diagnosis, and the potential for development of a specific therapy.

### Molecular diagnosis of solute carrier family 4 member 1 (SLC4A1) mutation-related autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis [^116iSZkY]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Two common mutations of the solute carrier family 4 member 1 (SLC4A1) gene, namely, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) and band 3 Bangkok 1 (G701D), cause autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis (AR dRTA) in ethnic Southeast Asian populations. In this study, we applied the high-resolution melting (HRM) method for screening of AR dRTA associated with SLC4A1 mutations in 10 new patients with unknown cause(s) of AR dRTA.

Methods

We analyzed SAO and G701D mutations in the patients and their family members using HRM. The results were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and DNA sequencing techniques.

Results

All patients carried homozygous G701D mutation, whereas their family members had heterozygous G701D or homozygous wild-type.

Conclusions

Homozygous G701D is a common cause of AR dRTA in ethnic Thai pediatric populations. HRM can be used as a rapid screening method for common SLC4A1 mutations that cause AR dRTA in Southeast Asian and other populations.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Haematology and biochemical assays

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100–120 and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV (Wickramasinghe, 1998). There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected (Meznarich et al, 2018). The hallmark of CDA‐I is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis (Heimpel, 2004). Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated 2 weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, e.g. when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is ~75–80%, but in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30% (Lewis, 2001). Recently, a new clinical index, termed the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI), has been developed to discriminate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) to achieve a clinical diagnosis of CDA‐II. This metric is likely to be useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film, as illustrated in Fig 2, is markedly abnormal with anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, irregularly contracted red cells (Heimpel et al, 2010) and occasional nucleated red cells (Tamary & Dgany, 2009), although these are not a typical feature. Red cell distribution width, as a quantitative assessment of the aniosopoikilocytosis seen on films, is elevated in CDA‐I (Wickramasinghe, 1998; Kamiya & Manabe, 2010). Renal and liver function are normal unless perturbed secondary to severe iron overload, but unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase will be elevated from the haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis. Haptoglobin levels are reduced secondary to intra‐ and extra‐vascular haemolysis (Heimpel, 2004).

### Physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of hepcidin regulation: clinical implications for iron disorders [^111yrozb]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

The discovery of hepcidin has provided a solid foundation for understanding the mechanisms of systemic iron homeostasis and the aetiologies of iron disorders. Hepcidin assures the balance of circulating and stored iron levels for multiple physiological processes including oxygen transport and erythropoiesis, while limiting the toxicity of excess iron. The liver is the major site where regulatory signals from iron, erythropoietic drive and inflammation are integrated to control hepcidin production. Pathologically, hepcidin dysregulation by genetic inactivation, ineffective erythropoiesis, or inflammation leads to diseases of iron deficiency or overload such as iron-refractory iron-deficiency anaemia, anaemia of inflammation, iron-loading anaemias and hereditary haemochromatosis. In the present review, we discuss recent insights into the molecular mechanisms governing hepcidin regulation, how these pathways are disrupted in iron disorders, and how this knowledge is being used to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

### De novo variations of ANK1 gene caused hereditary spherocytosis in two Chinese children by affecting pre-mRNA splicing [^111aYFFi]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS, MIM#612641) is a hereditary genetic disease caused by abnormalities in red blood cell membrane proteins resulting from congenital haemolytic anaemia. HS is mainly characterized by anaemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. Additional features comprise increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility and spherical red blood cell (RBC) count in peripheral blood smears. The symptomatology and clinical outcomes of HS are highly variable. Patients with mild HS might have no clinical manifestations related to anaemia due to the compensatory effect of the bone marrow, causing more erythropoiesis than destruction. Meanwhile, patients with severe HS might suffer from hemolytic crisis or even death. The major genetic mode of HS is autosomal dominant manner, accounting for approximately 75% of cases. In addition, approximately one-fourth of HS patients have no family history of the disease, and the inheritance patterns indicate that HS can be inherited as an autosomal recessive single-gene disorder or as a result of de novo mutations. To date, 5 associated genes associated with HS have been reported: ANK1, SLC4A1, SPTA1, SPTB and EPB42, encoding ankyrin protein, band-3 protein, alpha-spectrin protein, beta-spectrin protein and erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2, respectively. In summary, HS shows marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The prevalence of HS patients also exhibits a cosmopolitan distribution. Epidemiological studies have shown that the incidence of HS in Europe is approximately 1/2000–1/5000, whereas in China the estimated incidence is 1.39/100000. Notably, typical symptoms are not present at the same time in most patients with HS, and various factors can easily influence laboratory findings. Thus, diagnosing HS is difficult, and patients are frequently misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed. The incidence of the disease may be much higher than the clinical detection rate. Thus, obtaining a definite diagnosis is challenging, even though HS is not very rare. To the best of our knowledge, unequivocal gene sequencing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of HS. Therefore, the discovery of pathogenic gene variants detected by genetic testing and the detailed and intensive functional analysis associated with these genes might shed further light on HS pathogenesis.

In this article, online prediction tools and minigene constructs were used to further reveal the pathogenicity and characterization of novel variants detected in two Chinese families with HS, more accurately characterizing splicing variants in ANK1. This work further explains the relationship between the genotype and phenotype associated with ANK1 variants in the Chinese population and provides the basis for prenatal diagnostics and genetic counselling.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^113TBNGN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — genetic testing practices and mutation prevalence: In 1996, Feder et al. reported the identification of a hemochromatosis mutation in a novel MHC class I–like gene that was present in 83% of subjects with clinically defined HH, and genotyping for HFE mutations (C282Y) is now standard of care for the evaluation of patients in whom HH is suspected on clinical grounds or based on the finding of elevated iron studies. The H63D mutation is more common than C282Y and is found in most populations worldwide, with the highest prevalence among whites of whom approximately 26% carry at least 1 copy of H63D, whereas the S65C mutation is less common with a heterozygote frequency of about 2% among whites. Neither the homozygous nor the heterozygous H63D or S65C mutation is a cause of pathologic iron overload. We recommend that individuals with the H63D or S65C mutation in the absence of C282Y mutation should be counseled that they are not at increased risk of iron overload (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). PICO question: Should testing for non-HFE genes vs not testing be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in those who are negative for the C282Y or H63D alleles?

### Hereditary ovalocytosis (elliptocytosis) with hypersplenism… [^115vuMQ9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Oval or elliptically shaped erythrocytes normally occur in the camel and llama but are comparatively unusual as a hereditary trait in the human. * While the phenomenon is said to have been observed by Goltz † as early as 1860, it was first reported by Dresbach ‡ and later firmly established as a hereditary anomaly by Bishop4 and by Hunter and Adams 5. A number of interesting presentations are included in the approximately 60 reports which have accumulated in the medical literature since Dresbach's original papers. Of these, the reports and discussions of Lambrecht, 1 Gunther, 6 Leitner, 7 Wyandt and co-workers, 8 and, most recently, Guasch and Raichs 9 are especially informative. The limitations of pure morphology and of morphological description and classification of blood cells make it impossible to evaluate critically all the reported cases, but it appears that between 350 and 400 cases of this anomaly have been reported.

### Genetics of hereditary hematologic malignancies (PDQ ®) [^112XNYK2]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

RUNX1-, ETV6-, ANKRD26-, and MECOM-associated syndromes), leukopenia and monocytopenia, multilineage cytopenia, and B-cell or natural killer cell lymphopenias. The progression from initial hematologic manifestations to an HM is typically gradual, with varying latency periods occurring from birth to leukemia development. Many patients exhibit dysplasia in the bone marrow or clonal genetic/cytogenetic aberrations, which can eventually lead to HMs. In some pathogenic variant carriers of HHM syndromes, initial manifestations may include extra-hematopoietic abnormalities, such as the following:

- Constitutional and congenital defects.
- Increased sensitivity to chemotherapy.
- Atypical systemic infections. Various disease aspects are gene- or variant-specific, including risks to develop HMs and the heterogenous spectrum of acquired events that can occur. However, the natural histories of these syndromes are often unpredictable, with identical pathogenic variants resulting in both indolent or rapidly progressing disease in different individuals. These differences are likely due to unknown disease-modifying factors. Another study of pediatric MDS showed that 8% of patients carried a germline SAMD9/9L pathogenic variant, and 7% carried a germline GATA2 pathogenic variant.

In contrast, many of the genes implicated in inherited HM predisposition may also acquire somatic pathogenic variants, which can be detected in the bone marrow or peripheral blood at varying allele frequencies. RUNX1, ETV6, and ANRKD26 pathogenic variants are associated with lifelong mild- to moderate-thrombocytopenia and qualitative platelet deficits. Other germline pathogenic variants, like those in GATA2, SAMD9, and SAMD9L, are associated with immunodeficiency and frequent infections.
