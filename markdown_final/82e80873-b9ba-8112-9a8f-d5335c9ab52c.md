## Question

54 yo F with history of chronic pain, prescribed methadone for opioid use disorder, presents with cough and fever. Rapid influenza test positive, mild hypoxemia (SaO₂ 93% RA), normal QTc (445 ms). Allergy to penicillins. Hospitalist recommends starting oseltamivir and azithromycin for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia — initiate both?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to start both oseltamivir and azithromycin for a 54-year-old woman with confirmed influenza, mild hypoxemia, and methadone therapy, and how to weigh benefits, risks, and guideline-concordant care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indication and timing for oseltamivir in hospitalized influenza. Then, I should verify the rationale and evidence for empiric azithromycin for bacterial coinfection in influenza. Next, I will assess QTc risk with methadone plus azithromycin and decide whether serial ECG monitoring is feasible. After that, I should review antibiotic stewardship principles and what to do if bacterial pneumonia is not confirmed. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline a monitoring and de-escalation plan with clear stop criteria and alternatives if penicillin allergy limits choices.

> Let me first confirm the indication for oseltamivir. In hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, guidelines recommend initiating a neuraminidase inhibitor as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours of symptom onset, because it reduces complications and may reduce mortality, and this applies irrespective of vaccination status or illness duration at presentation, so I should not delay oseltamivir here [^f35b92c5] [^e912a650] [^73135cf1].

> Wait, let me verify the azithromycin question carefully. The IDSA influenza guidance advises empiric antibacterial therapy when patients present with severe disease or deteriorate after initial improvement, and to consider evaluation if there is no improvement after 3–5 days of antivirals, but it does not recommend routine empiric azithromycin for all hospitalized influenza without evidence of bacterial coinfection, so I should not jump to adding azithromycin just because of influenza and mild hypoxemia [^779d9513] [^c680fb8b]. I should also remember that oseltamivir itself reduces lower respiratory complications and antibiotic use in influenza, which further weakens the case for routine macrolide prophylaxis in this scenario [^05c185e8].

> Hold on, I should verify the QTc risk with methadone plus azithromycin. Methadone is a known QT-prolonging agent and carries explicit cautions about coadministration with other QT-prolonging drugs, and azithromycin has documented QT prolongation risk with signals for torsades and sudden cardiac death in some analyses, so even with a baseline QTc of 445 ms, the combination meaningfully increases risk, particularly in older adults and women, and would require close ECG monitoring if used together, which is often impractical outside the ICU [^66f640e1] [^610ae3d1] [^6d97e5fc]. Given the absence of confirmed bacterial infection here, that risk-benefit balance argues against empiric azithromycin at this time [^c680fb8b].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship is front and center. Stewardship statements emphasize limiting empiric antibiotics in patients with high likelihood of viral infection unless there is clinical evidence of bacterial coinfection, and they support early discontinuation if bacterial infection is not supported by cultures or biomarkers, so I should avoid reflex azithromycin and instead tailor antibiotics to objective findings or deterioration [^a58b05d8] [^c680fb8b]. Let me reconsider: if the patient worsens with new fever, rising procalcitonin, purulent sputum, or new consolidation, then targeted antibacterial therapy per CAP guidelines would be appropriate, but I should not start now without those signals [^f63e1697].

> But wait, what if the penicillin allergy is driving the choice toward azithromycin? Even with a beta-lactam allergy, empiric therapy should still be guided by severity and local resistance patterns, and in many cases non–beta-lactam options like doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone can be reasonable alternatives when bacterial pneumonia is truly suspected, so azithromycin monotherapy is not the only path and should not be the default here without evidence of bacterial disease [^688d8fef] [^f63e1697]. I should double-check that any future antibiotic choice aligns with CAP guidance and the patient's specific risk factors if bacterial infection emerges [^f63e1697].

> Next, I should review a monitoring and de-escalation plan. I will start oseltamivir now, monitor vitals and oxygenation closely, and reassess at 48–72 hours for clinical trajectory. If there is no improvement or if deterioration occurs, I will obtain repeat exam, inflammatory markers, sputum culture, and chest imaging, and if bacterial coinfection is then suspected, I will initiate guideline-concordant CAP therapy with attention to the penicillin allergy and local resistance data, with a plan to stop antibiotics within 48–72 hours if bacterial infection is excluded and the patient is clinically stable [^f35b92c5] [^f63e1697] [^70ecc6b6]. I should confirm that any future macrolide use in this patient on methadone would prompt serial ECGs and electrolyte correction if pursued, given the QT risk, even though I am avoiding that combination today [^66f640e1] [^610ae3d1].

> Final synthesis: I should initiate oseltamivir immediately for confirmed influenza in a hospitalized patient, and I should not start empiric azithromycin at this time because there is no evidence of bacterial coinfection, the benefit of routine macrolide prophylaxis in influenza is unproven, and the combination with methadone adds meaningful QT risk that would require ECG monitoring I cannot reliably provide on the floor, so I will observe, reassess frequently, and add antibiotics only if objective signs of bacterial infection emerge or the patient deteriorates despite antivirals [^f35b92c5] [^779d9513] [^66f640e1] [^610ae3d1].

---

Start **oseltamivir now** for confirmed influenza in a hospitalized patient with hypoxemia, as it reduces complications and mortality when started early [^f35b92c5] [^73135cf1]. Do not start **azithromycin** unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of bacterial coinfection, because routine antibiotics are not indicated for uncomplicated influenza and azithromycin adds QT risk with methadone [^c680fb8b] [^66f640e1]. If bacterial infection is suspected later, use non-penicillin options such as doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and monitor the QTc closely if any QT-prolonging drugs are used [^688d8fef] [^7fa355c5].

---

## Indications for oseltamivir

Oseltamivir is indicated for treatment of influenza A or B in hospitalized patients, and **early initiation** (within 48 hours of symptom onset) reduces complications, including lower respiratory tract infections and mortality [^f35b92c5] [^73135cf1]. Even after 48 hours, treatment is still recommended for severe or progressive disease, such as hypoxemia or radiographic pneumonia [^e912a650].

---

## Indications for azithromycin in influenza

Azithromycin is **not routinely recommended** for influenza without confirmed bacterial coinfection. It may be considered if there is clinical suspicion or evidence of bacterial coinfection, such as:

- Deterioration after initial improvement [^779d9513]
- Persistent or worsening symptoms after 3–5 days of antiviral therapy [^779d9513]
- Clinical signs of bacterial infection (e.g. purulent sputum, leukocytosis, new infiltrates on chest radiograph) [^dc2b2f9e]

Routine empiric azithromycin is not supported by current guidelines and should be avoided unless there is **clear evidence or strong suspicion** of bacterial coinfection [^c680fb8b].

---

## Risks associated with azithromycin and methadone co-administration

Both azithromycin and methadone can prolong the **QT interval**, increasing the risk of torsades de pointes and ventricular arrhythmias. The patient's baseline QTc of 445 ms is within normal limits, but the combination still poses a significant risk, particularly in the setting of hypoxemia, electrolyte disturbances, or other QT-prolonging medications [^66f640e1] [^610ae3d1]. Close ECG monitoring is recommended if azithromycin is used with methadone, and alternative antibiotics should be considered when possible [^7fa355c5].

---

## Alternative antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients

If bacterial coinfection is confirmed or strongly suspected, **alternative antibiotics** for penicillin-allergic patients include:

- **Doxycycline**: 100 mg orally or intravenously twice daily
- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones**: such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, considering local resistance patterns and patient-specific factors

These alternatives provide adequate coverage for common bacterial pathogens associated with influenza coinfection without the added QT prolongation risk of azithromycin [^notfound].

---

## Clinical decision and monitoring plan

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following plan is recommended:

| **Medication** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Oseltamivir | Initiate immediately | - Reduces complications and mortality in hospitalized influenza patients [^73135cf1] <br/> - Recommended by IDSA and WHO [^f35b92c5] [^6e438906] |
| Azithromycin | Do not initiate unless bacterial coinfection is confirmed or strongly suspected | - Not routinely indicated for influenza without bacterial coinfection [^c680fb8b] <br/> - Significant QT prolongation risk with methadone [^66f640e1] [^610ae3d1] |

---

If azithromycin is deemed necessary, **obtain baseline and serial ECGs** to monitor the QTc, correct electrolytes, and monitor for arrhythmias [^3edae5d5]. Otherwise, avoid routine azithromycin and reassess for bacterial coinfection at 48–72 hours.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Start **oseltamivir immediately** for confirmed influenza in a hospitalized patient with hypoxemia. Do not start **azithromycin** unless there is clear evidence or strong suspicion of bacterial coinfection, given the lack of benefit and the significant QT prolongation risk with methadone. If bacterial infection is later confirmed, use non-penicillin alternatives such as doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and monitor the QTc closely if any QT-prolonging drugs are used [^688d8fef] [^7fa355c5].

Overall, the limited and low-quality evidence does not endorse azithromycin's widespread use in the treatment of COVID-19. On the other hand, monotherapy is safe and therefore justifiable in a clinical trial setting. The data at least urges close monitoring when combined with other QT-prolonging drugs like hydroxychloroquine, or when other risk factors for long QT exist. A risk mitigation strategy such as applying strict ECG criteria to initiate (eg, only if QTc < 450) and halt (eg, if QTc exceeds 500 ms or increases > 60 ms since start of treatment) azithromycin may be warranted.

When should antibiotics be considered for patients during respiratory viral pandemics and epidemics?

Recommendations

It is important for HCP to identify patients who require empiric antibiotic treatment, despite low rates of coinfection on admission for the COVID-19 and prior respiratory viral pandemics.
If treated at the time of hospital admission, HCP should prescribe antibiotics recommended in guidelines for CAP for patients presenting from the community with coinfection. Antibiotics for pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, seen more typically in healthcare-associated infection, are not recommended.
HCP may consider coinfection with other viruses, such as influenza. If influenza is diagnosed, addition of therapy, such oseltamivir, may be indicated.
HCP may consider antibiotics, including broad-spectrum coverage, for patients hospitalized for > 48 hours who are at greater risk for HAIs and MDROs, when there are new clinical signs that are consistent with healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection.

COVID-19 treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — QTc/torsade risk overview — reports both drugs as definite torsade de pointes causes, describes occasional case reports of hydroxychloroquine prolonging QT and provoking torsade when used for systemic lupus erythematosus, and notes azithromycin is recognized as a rare cause of QT prolongation, serious arrhythmias, and increased risk for sudden death with advanced age and female sex implicated as risk factors; azithromycin can also provoke non–pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and an FDA perspective supports vulnerability to QTc prolongation and torsade. The page states the combination's effect on QT interval or arrhythmia risk has not been studied, there are very limited data on combination safety with multiple randomized trials being initiated, and seriously ill patients may have comorbidities increasing arrhythmia risk including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, fever, and an inflammatory state.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^88c9b80a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

In conclusion, our findings show that azithromycin should not be used routinely to treat COVID-19 in the community in older adults, in the absence of additional indications. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK. Using antibiotics to treat COVID-19 might also encourage patients to believe that antibiotics are an appropriate treatment for other viral respiratory infections, and our findings guide clinicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics to patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 in the absence of an additional indication. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of randomised controlled trials to assess medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the use of ineffective medications which, in the case of azithromycin, might contribute to other public health problems such as antimicrobial resistance.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^03b219b8]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP guidelines — cardiovascular effects of opioids — note sex-specific thresholds for QTC interval prolongation, with QTC interval in females greater than 470 ms and in males greater than 450 ms, changes that may lead to torsade de pointes (TdP) and potentially ventricular fibrillation. Several drugs lead to QT interval prolongation including antiretroviral protease inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, antifungal azole agents, and methadone, whereas buprenorphine is considered as a safe drug and does not appear to cause clinically significant QT interval prolongation or arrythmia when used at typical doses; methadone has a greater issue with QT-prolonging impact that can result in TdP and hemodynamic effects, morphine has not shown significant effect, and fentanyl has shown QT interval prolongation without reports of arrhythmia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^e912a650]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with CAP who test positive for influenza — antiviral therapy: We recommend that antiinfluenza treatment, such as oseltamivir, be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest that antiinfluenza treatment be prescribed for adults with CAP who test positive for influenza in the outpatient setting, independent of duration of illness before diagnosis (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Timing data indicate that treatment within 2 days of symptom onset or hospitalization may result in the best outcomes, although there may be benefits up to 4 or 5 days after symptoms begin, and in outpatients most benefit if therapy is received within 48 hours after onset of symptoms.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^66f640e1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone — indications, contraindications, cautions, and interactions: Methadone is frequently used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder. Methadone is contraindicated for patients with known hypersensitivity to methadone hydrochloride, those experiencing respiratory depression in the absence of resuscitative equipment or in unmonitored settings, patients with acute bronchial asthma or hypercapnia (also known as hypercarbia), and patients with known or suspected paralytic ileus. Methadone should be used with caution in patients with decompensated liver disease (e.g., jaundice, ascites) due to increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory insufficiency, concomitant substance use disorders — particularly sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders — because interactions may be life-threatening, a current psychiatric diagnosis that may impair their ability to maintain daily attendance at an OTP, and in patients with low levels of physical dependence to opioids who should be started with low doses of methadone. Significant medication interactions include that methadone may prolong the QT interval and should be used in caution with other agents that may also prolong the QT interval, including class I or class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, calcium channel blockers, some antipsychotics, and some antidepressants, and that methadone is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 enzyme pathway with many agents interacting with this pathway including alcohol, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and macrolide antibiotics.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral agent and duration: Clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible with a single neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) (either oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir) and not use a combination of NAIs (A-I), and clinicians should not routinely use higher doses of US Food and Drug Administration–approved NAI drugs for the treatment of seasonal influenza (A-II). Clinicians should treat uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients for 5 days with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir (A-I). Clinicians can consider longer duration of antiviral treatment for patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a review [^f63e1697]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) results in approximately 1.4 million emergency department visits, 740 000 hospitalizations, and 41 000 deaths in the US annually.

Observations

Community-acquired pneumonia can be diagnosed in a patient with 2 or more signs (eg, temperature > 38 °C or ≤ 36 °C; leukocyte count < 4000/μL or > 10 000/μL) or symptoms (eg, new or increased cough or dyspnea) of pneumonia in conjunction with consistent radiographic findings (eg, air space density) without an alternative explanation. Up to 10% of patients with CAP are hospitalized; of those, up to 1 in 5 require intensive care. Older adults (≥ 65 years) and those with underlying lung disease, smoking, or immune suppression are at highest risk for CAP and complications of CAP, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Only 38% of patients hospitalized with CAP have a pathogen identified. Of those patients, up to 40% have viruses identified as the likely cause of CAP, with Streptococcus pneumoniae identified in approximately 15% of patients with an identified etiology of the pneumonia. All patients with CAP should be tested for COVID-19 and influenza when these viruses are common in the community because their diagnosis may affect treatment (eg, antiviral therapy) and infection prevention strategies. If test results for influenza and COVID-19 are negative or when the pathogens are not likely etiologies, patients can be treated empirically to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens. When selecting empirical antibacterial therapy, clinicians should consider disease severity and evaluate the likelihood of a bacterial infection-or resistant infection-and risk of harm from overuse of antibacterial drugs. Hospitalized patients without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days. Systemic corticosteroid administration within 24 hours of development of severe CAP may reduce 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

Community-acquired pneumonia is common and may result in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or death. First-line therapy varies by disease severity and etiology. Hospitalized patients with suspected bacterial CAP and without risk factors for resistant bacteria can be treated with β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, such as ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, for a minimum of 3 days.

### Rationale for azithromycin in COVID-19: an overview of existing evidence [^2c67bcdc]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Prophylaxis against bacterial superinfection

The reported rate of antibiotic prescription in COVID-19 patients, especially in-hospital, is very high. Driving forces are the sometimes-difficult differential diagnosis with atypical pneumonias and fear of bacterial superinfection. Early bacterial coinfection has indeed been a well-known source of morbidity and mortality in historic influenza pandemics. In COVID-19, however, pooled data suggest a much lower risk of bacterial co-infection, and do not support routine administration of antibiotics. Even though azithromycin may improve outcomes in the limited cases of superinfection, antibacterial prophylaxis is no grounded argument for its systematic use, and must be weighed against the risk of bacterial resistance.

In vivo data

Non-COVID-19

Azithromycin is an established treatment modality in several chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases. Different clinical trials have proven its efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, asthma and lung transplantation. While undeniable proof of azithromycin's immunomodulatory potential, it is unsure if this can also be exploited in the acute setting.

Before COVID-19, the anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of azithromycin have been clinically demonstrated in other viral pneumonias and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In a retrospective cohort evaluation of hospitalised patients with moderate or severe ARDS treated with azithromycin or not, azithromycin was associated with a significant improvement in 90-day survival rate and a shorter time to successful discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Also, azithromycin-use was associated with decreased 60-day mortality and shorter time of ventilator dependency in patients with sepsis-associated ARDS. For the treatment of influenza, combination therapy of oseltamivir-azithromycin compared with oseltamivir alone showed improved clinical outcomes in a retrospective cohortand a faster decline of inflammatory parameters in a randomised controlled trial. On the other hand, a tendency towards lower ICU mortality, lower 90-day mortality and shorter hospital stay did not achieve statistical significance in a cohort study on the use of macrolides (of which 71.3% was azithromycin) in critically ill patients with MERS. Possibly, the higher risk of coinfection in influenza, especially with influenza A, may contribute to the larger effect size.

### A 29-year-old woman with flu-like symptoms: review of influenza diagnosis and treatment [^fa84b4f8]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Peaks of seasonal influenza activity occur annually in many countries, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Using the case of Ms R, a 29-year-old woman who presented with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and was evaluated for influenza, considerations regarding symptoms and signs, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of influenza are discussed. Symptoms of influenza can be similar to those of other respiratory viruses, making diagnosis challenging. Laboratory testing should be reserved for patients who are seriously ill or for whom test results may affect management or have public health implications. For most cases of influenza, treatment is supportive and specific antiviral medication is not needed. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Educating patients on practical steps to reduce the spread of influenza in the community is critical.

### Management of influenza [^0355ee94]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Influenza is a contagious airborne viral illness characterized by abrupt onset of symptoms. Fever, myalgia, headache, rhinitis, sore throat, and cough are commonly reported symptoms. The diagnosis should be made clinically, and the decision to begin antiviral therapy should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of influenza. The 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus is expected to continue to circulate during the 2010–2011 season, but it is not certain whether it will replace or cocirculate with seasonal influenza A subtypes that have been circulating since 1977. The 2009 H1N1 virus is largely resistant to adamantanes, but it is sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir. Neuraminidase inhibitors have modest effectiveness in reducing influenza-related symptoms in patients at low risk of complications. Patients at high risk of complications, including pregnant women, should be treated with antiviral agents, preferably within 48 hours of symptom onset. Family physicians should follow guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when treating patients with influenza or influenza-like symptoms.

Clinical studies

Table 3 summarizes available clinical data on the efficacy of AZ alone, or in combination with other drugs, against various viral infections. With some exceptions, the studies in Table 2 have been observational, single‐arm, nonrandomized studies or retrospective evaluations. Many of these studies have reported clinical observations or conducted post hoc analyses. Studies in COVID‐19 patients have mainly focused on viral load as an end point, and detailed evaluation of clinical outcomes has not been reported. Notwithstanding the limitations of these studies, collectively they present preliminary evidence that inclusion of AZ in various treatment regimens can influence the course of viral infection and has the potential to influence clinical outcomes. Confirmatory evidence with randomized controlled trials is essential to understand the role of AZ in the treatment of COVID‐19.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — vaccination status, immunocompromised hosts, and treatment initiation — Annual influenza vaccination can prevent influenza, but influenza vaccine effectiveness has ranged from low to moderate in preventing medically attended outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and may have lower effectiveness in immunocompromised patients, who may also experience prolonged influenza viral replication. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. Therefore, antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in hospitalized patients, high-risk persons, and those with severe or progressive disease if influenza is suspected, irrespective of receipt of influenza vaccine.

SHEA — empiric antibiotics and viral coinfections during respiratory viral pandemics: If treated at the time of hospital admission, HCP should prescribe antibiotics recommended in guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for patients presenting from the community with coinfection, and antibiotics for pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, seen more typically in healthcare-associated infection, are not recommended. HCP may consider coinfection with other viruses, such as influenza, and if influenza is diagnosed, addition of therapy, such as oseltamivir, may be indicated; NIH guidelines suggest HCP initiate empiric oseltamivir pending the exclusion of influenza by nucleic acid detection assay in upper-respiratory-tract specimens for non-intubated patients and in both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens for intubated patients. HCP may consider antibiotics, including broad-spectrum coverage, for patients hospitalized for > 48 hours who are at greater risk for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), when there are new clinical signs that are consistent with healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection; patients who are admitted for > 48 hours are at increased risk for HAI, and it is reasonable to consider antibiotic choices that include activity against healthcare-associated pathogens such as P. aeruginosa, and fungal infection, such as bloodstream infection in patients with prolonged central venous catheters, should also be considered if appropriate.

### Experience with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: implications for QT interval monitoring [^1a45d9b8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Prescribing practices for azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine amid the COVID‐19 pandemic were found to be diverse, but most patients in our study received a combination of the 2 drugs. Among patients prescribed azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both, 12% achieved a critical level of QTc prolongation. QTc values were highest with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, with QTc prolongation many‐fold higher in the combination group than with azithromycin alone. Especially if ongoing clinical trials indicate benefit from use of these medications, these findings could inform clinical therapeutics and ECG monitoring in COVID‐19 patients.

We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

Hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin — QT prolongation risk and monitoring are highlighted with quantitative signals and conditional actions: One randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggests increased risk of QT prolongation with HCQ+AZ vs no HCQ (RR: 8.50; 95% CI: 1.16, 62.31; Low CoE), and two studies reported significant QT prolongation in 10 of 95 HCQ+AZ recipients. A case-control study found higher QTc metrics with HCQ+AZ among COVID-19 cases vs healthy controls, including minimum (415 vs. 376 ms), mean (453 vs. 407 ms) and maximum QTc-interval (533 vs. 452 ms) with cases (n = 22) vs controls (n = 34). Additional reports note risk of prolonged QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia with AZ alone, and a large cohort observed increased sudden cardiac death risk during a five-day AZ course (HR 2.71 [1.58–4.64] vs 0.85 [0.45–1.60] compared to no antibiotic or amoxicillin, respectively). Given cumulative conduction effects with HCQ and AZ, if used together, baseline and follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring would be indicated along with careful surveillance for other QT‑prolonging medications. Although azithromycin has a low risk for cytochrome P450 interactions, gastrointestinal effects and QT prolongation should be carefully considered, particularly in the outpatient setting where frequent ECG monitoring is not feasible.

### Debate regarding oseltamivir use for seasonal and pandemic influenza [^8af16c59]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Secondary analyses from the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis suggested the following: a 63% (95% CI 19%–83%) decreased risk in hospitalization for any cause, based on 9/1,591 (0.6%) oseltamivir treated vs 22/1,302 (1.7%) placebo-treated patients; and a 44% (95% CI 25%–58%) decreased risk of antibiotic prescription for lower respiratory disease in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza, based on 65/1,544 (4.2%) oseltamivir-treated vs 110/1,263 (8.7%) placebo-treated patients. However, hospital admissions were all cause and not confined to those that may have been associated with influenza infection; also, no formal diagnostic criteria existed for lower respiratory tract infection. We consider these secondary analyses less convincing than the analyses of primary endpoints. The latter were largely in agreement with those of the Cochrane group. Yet, despite this agreement and the arm's length funding mechanism, the Roche-sponsored meta-analysis has been criticized as being influenced by the manufacturer.

### Hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for treatment of early SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk outpatient adults: a randomized clinical trial [^c880109e]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Given that most COVID-19 infections occur in the outpatient setting, it is essential to continue to search for interventions that could alter the course of early disease and decrease risk of community transmission. Although we assumed that progression to severe COVID-19 would be a robust endpoint based on initial observations, we found that this was rare. Validated virologic or clinical risk factors for disease progression would greatly facilitate early treatment studies. Symptom resolution outcomes have been used in interventional trials of antivirals for influenza, and could be considered for outpatient COVID-19 trials.

As SARS-CoV-2 continues to disrupt life around the world, we must continue to search for therapies that reduce morbidity and transmission. Early treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains an important goal for pandemic control. Although this study showed that HCQ and HCQ/AZ are not effective in shortening the time to COVID-19 symptom resolution or decreasing viral shedding in a way that would interrupt transmission, important lessons from this trial can be applied to future trials of outpatient treatment for early SARS-CoV-2.

### WHO rapid advice guidelines for pharmacological management of sporadic human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus [^3294469d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Recent spread of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to poultry and wild birds has increased the threat of human infections with H5N1 virus worldwide. Despite international agreement to stockpile antivirals, evidence-based guidelines for their use do not exist. WHO assembled an international multidisciplinary panel to develop rapid advice for the pharmacological management of human H5N1 virus infection in the current pandemic alert period. A transparent methodological guideline process on the basis of the Grading Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to develop evidence-based guidelines. Our development of specific recommendations for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of sporadic H5N1 infection resulted from the benefits, harms, burden, and cost of interventions in several patient and exposure groups. Overall, the quality of the underlying evidence for all recommendations was rated as very low because it was based on small case series of H5N1 patients, on extrapolation from preclinical studies, and high quality studies of seasonal influenza. A strong recommendation to treat H5N1 patients with oseltamivir was made in part because of the severity of the disease. Similarly, strong recommendations were made to use neuraminidase inhibitors as chemoprophylaxis in high-risk exposure populations. Emergence of other novel influenza A viral subtypes with pandemic potential, or changes in the pathogenicity of H5N1 virus strains, will require an update of these guidelines and WHO will be monitoring this closely.

### Oseltamivir treatment vs supportive care for seasonal influenza requiring hospitalization [^73135cf1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, oseltamivir treatment within 2 days of admission was associated with lower mortality risk for adult patients hospitalized for severe influenza. This study adds supporting evidence for the current guidelines that recommend antiviral treatment for patients admitted to hospital with influenza while awaiting RCT results.

### QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes associated with methadone therapy [^ec9a898f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Oral methadone therapy is an effective and increasingly popular treatment for opioid dependency and chronic pain. Although it is not typically considered pro-dysrhythmic, we present the unique case of a 52-year-old HIV-positive woman without underlying cardiac disease who developed QTc prolongation and pulseless Torsades secondary to high dose methadone therapy.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^1b67955c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — adult dosing and duration — standardizes drug dosing for oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, notes that oseltamivir requires dosage adjustment for reduced renal function and that zanamivir is an orally inhaled powder with limited systemic absorption excreted unchanged by the kidneys; duration of therapy for ambulatory adults with uncomplicated influenza is 5 days; in ambulatory adults, peramivir administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose is an alternative but is costlier; in hospitalized adults, oseltamivir is the preferred antiviral drug because data are very limited on inhaled zanamivir in severely ill influenza patients.

### Uncommon presentation of a common disease: influenza A presenting as adult croup [^194ac294]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An 88-year-old woman presented to our emergency room with complaints of fever, coryza, barking cough and generalised fatigue for 2days. Physical examination showed stridor, tachypnoea with use of accessory muscles of respiration on admission. Laboratory tests were unremarkable except for monocytosis with a normal total white cell count. Rapid influenza diagnostic test was positive for influenza A. Chest X-ray showed subglottic narrowing of the trachea suggestive of steeple sign. A diagnosis of influenza A-induced croup was made. She was given humidified oxygen, nebulised racemic epinephrine, intravenous dexamethasone and oseltamivir. Stridor resolved within minutes of giving nebulised epinephrine. Work of breathing improved within 4-6hours. She was discharged 2days later on a tapering dose of steroids.

### SHEA statement on antibiotic stewardship in hospitals during public health emergencies [^dc2b2f9e]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

HCP reasonably may consider empiric antibiotic treatment in instances when a patient has new symptoms (eg, new fever after initial defervescence) and/or changes in lung imaging, signs of production of purulent sputum, dense lobar consolidation on radiograph, or rapid progression to severe COVID-19 requiring intubation and pressor support. Because the bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP often colonize the upper airway and opportunistically infect the lung, it is speculated that these same bacteria should be considered in patients with respiratory virus–related pneumonia including COVID-19 within the first days of hospitalization and guidelines for CAP treatment should be followed. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the pathogen most frequently associated with influenza, followed mainly by S. aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae. Recent studies have identified S. pneumoniae and S. aureus as the main causative agents of community-acquired coinfection at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Data on bacterial coinfections in patients who are immunosuppressed are sparse, but there may be scenarios, such as patients with febrile neutropenia, in which empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of COVID-19 or other respiratory viral diagnosis is justified.

It is important that HCP also consider the possibility of coinfection with viruses other than the pandemic strain. The use of nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, mask use, social distancing) significantly disrupted the transmission of non–SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viruses during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic such that influenza activity decreased in March 2020 and remained at historic lows. As these nonpharmacologic interventions are relaxed, HCP should anticipate rising circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses to include the possibility of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2. In the event of cocirculating influenza and SARS-CoV-2, NIH guidelines suggest HCP initiate empiric oseltamivir pending the exclusion of influenza by nucleic acid detection assay in upper-respiratory-tract specimens for non-intubated patients and in both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract specimens for intubated patients.

Patients who are admitted for > 48 hours are at increased risk for HAI, including those that are multidrug resistant. It is reasonable to consider antibiotic choices that include activity against healthcare-associated pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. Fungal infection, such as bloodstream infection in patients with prolonged central venous catheters, should also be considered if appropriate.

### HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS / ACC / AHA worldwide practice update for telehealth and arrhythmia monitoring during and after a pandemic [^b8640a36]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Therapy for COVID-19 and potential electrical effects — hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin have been used off-label and may exert QT-prolonging effects, and combination therapy may have synergistic QT prolongation. In a retrospective cohort of 1438 hospitalized patients in metropolitan New York, cardiac arrest was more frequent with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin than with neither drug, and adjusted in-hospital mortality hazard ratios were 1.08 for hydroxychloroquine alone, 0.56 for azithromycin alone, and 1.35 for the combination; none of these hazard ratios were statistically significant. In COVID-19 patients receiving prior antiarrhythmic therapy, there should be a thorough consideration of risk vs benefit before initiating any QT-prolonging COVID-19 therapies, and if one of these drugs is judged to be critical, monitoring should be initiated. If life-threatening arrhythmias (VT/VF) occur, the benefit of antiarrhythmic drugs, notably amiodarone, outweighs potential harm and antiarrhythmic drugs should be prioritized and used as deemed necessary. Modifiable predisposing factors for QTc prolongation should be corrected, individuals with congenital long QT syndrome should be identified because QTc-prolonging medications are contraindicated, and caution must be exercised in subclinical or manifest myocarditis that may increase vulnerability to proarrhythmias associated with QT-prolonging drugs.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e3ebb08d]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Context — burden and scope of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for these recommendations: The overall annual incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) ranges from 5 to 11 per 1,000 people, with more cases occurring during the winter season, and in 2006, there were approximately 4.2 million ambulatory care visits for CAP in the United States, and it is estimated that CAP has an annual economic burden that exceeds $17 billion in the United States; these guidelines refer to patients evaluated in the outpatient setting who present with acute cough (ie, < 3 weeks in duration), accompanied by other symptoms for which the physician suspects pneumonia.

### Emerging oseltamivir resistance in seasonal and pandemic influenza A / H1N1 [^25672866]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

The emergence of oseltamivir resistance in seasonal and pandemic influenza A/H1N1 has created challenges for diagnosis and clinical management. This review discusses how clinical virology laboratories have handled diagnosis of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 and what we have learned from clinical studies and case series. Immunocompetent patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 have similar outcomes as patients infected with oseltamivir-susceptible H1N1. However, immunocompromised patients infected with oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 experience potentially more risks of complication and transmissibility with few therapeutic options.
