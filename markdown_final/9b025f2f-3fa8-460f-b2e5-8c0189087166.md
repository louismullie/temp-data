Which one has best data for fracture prevention in femoral neck, spine, and wrist?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alendronate or ibandronate would be best now for a 74-year-old woman after 18 months of abaloparatide, and which has the strongest data for preventing fractures at the femoral neck, spine, and wrist. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's residual fracture risk and guideline thresholds to justify antiresorptive therapy after an anabolic course. Then, I should review sequencing data after abaloparatide to see which agent best preserves gains and reduces fractures. Next, I will appraise head-to-head antifracture evidence for alendronate at hip, spine, and wrist, followed by the corresponding evidence (or lack thereof) for ibandronate. After that, I should integrate guideline recommendations and practical considerations (dosing, adherence, safety). Finally, I will synthesize this into a clear recommendation while double-checking any claims that might overstate the data.

> Let me first confirm the risk framework and the need to transition from an anabolic to an antiresorptive. The patient is 74 years old with a femoral-neck T-score of −2.4 and FRAX 10-year risks of 18% for major osteoporotic fracture and 4.6% for hip; I initially thought both values exceed the typical treatment thresholds, but wait, let me verify the cutpoints: the National Osteoporosis Foundation convention uses hip ≥ 3% or major ≥ 20%, so her hip risk exceeds threshold but her major risk does not, which still justifies pharmacologic therapy despite an osteopenic-range T-score because the hip risk criterion alone is met [^1178FFQu]. I need to ensure we also honor the principle of sequencing: after an anabolic like abaloparatide, an antiresorptive is required to consolidate BMD gains and maintain fracture risk reduction [^113SUafC] [^111wqC79].

> Next, I should review the anabolic-to-antiresorptive transition evidence. The ACTIVE/ACTIVExtend program supports switching to alendronate after abaloparatide to sustain vertebral fracture risk reduction and maintain hip BMD; I initially recalled a "71% additional reduction" during the alendronate phase, but hold on, I should verify what that 71% actually represents: it reflects a post hoc comparison of vertebral fracture rates during 18 months of abaloparatide in ACTIVE versus 18 months of alendronate in ACTIVExtend, not a within-patient incremental reduction, so I need to correct that interpretation while keeping the key message that alendronate effectively maintains antifracture benefits after abaloparatide [^113YZ1fH] [^11672Mk4]. Let me consider whether equivalent transition data exist for ibandronate; I should confirm that they do not, which weakens the case for ibandronate in this specific sequence [^111wqC79].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence for alendronate across the three requested sites. The Cochrane review shows a 45% relative risk reduction for vertebral fractures and a 16% reduction for nonvertebral fractures at commonly used doses, establishing broad antifracture efficacy beyond the spine [^113sLeJg]. Hold on, I should verify hip and wrist specifically: in the Fracture Intervention Trial, alendronate reduced clinical hip fractures by about 53% and wrist fractures by about 31%, with effects consistent in women up to at least age 80, which squarely matches this patient's age and targeted sites [^113edm3R] [^111GVbH3]. Let me double-check whether updates have altered these conclusions; contemporary updates and summaries continue to support alendronate's spine, hip, and nonvertebral fracture reductions, reinforcing its site-spanning efficacy profile [^1117ccbw] [^113WfNAn].

> Now, I need to check the corresponding evidence for ibandronate at hip and wrist. The FDA label for oral ibandronate reports no statistically significant reduction in nonvertebral fractures, including hip and wrist, despite spine BMD gains, which is a crucial limitation for this patient's priorities [^115FWCcx]. Let me confirm if higher-dose or intermittent regimens change this: monthly oral or quarterly IV ibandronate improves BMD and biomechanical surrogates, but pivotal trials were not powered for or did not demonstrate nonvertebral fracture reductions, leaving no proven benefit at hip or wrist in randomized outcomes trials [^114XoLbx] [^115NdYRg] [^113KRQhG]. I should double-check labeling for the injection as well; again, the demonstrated fracture efficacy is at the spine, with nonvertebral benefits not established [^114u7oh6] [^113tpCk6].

> But wait, what if ibandronate's spine-specific efficacy is sufficient because the patient's T-score is near −2.5? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the clinical question explicitly prioritizes sites including the hip and wrist, and the absence of demonstrated hip and wrist fracture reduction with ibandronate is a decisive gap, whereas alendronate has robust site-specific data at all three targeted locations in this age group [^113edm3R] [^113sLeJg]. I should confirm that expert guidelines align with this interpretation; AACE/ACE and the Endocrine Society list alendronate among first-line choices when hip and nonvertebral fracture risk reduction are needed, while they reserve ibandronate for selected patients in whom spine-specific efficacy suffices, which does not match this patient's articulated needs [^111wqC79] [^114wUxoj] [^113SUafC].

> Next, I should integrate practicality, adherence, and safety. Let me think about dosing and administration: alendronate 70 mg orally once weekly taken fasting with water and remaining upright for at least 30 minutes is standard, with well-characterized long-term safety including rare atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw; duration is typically 3–5 years followed by reassessment and consideration of a drug holiday in lower-risk patients, with longer continuation in those at persistently high risk [^112grdfc] [^113WfNAn] [^117FVHyh]. I need to ensure we acknowledge convenience trade-offs: although once-monthly ibandronate may improve adherence, the lack of proven hip and wrist fracture risk reduction means convenience should not trump efficacy for this patient's risk profile [^115FWCcx] [^114XoLbx].

> Bringing this together, I should confirm that both the sequence evidence and site-specific fracture data converge on the same conclusion. After 18 months of abaloparatide, transitioning to alendronate preserves gains and provides robust fracture risk reduction at the hip, spine, and wrist in women of this age, whereas ibandronate's demonstrated fracture efficacy is largely limited to the spine and does not meet the stated site-specific goals, making alendronate the optimal choice here [^113YZ1fH] [^113edm3R] [^113sLeJg] [^115FWCcx] [^111wqC79].

> Recommendation and plan: Start alendronate 70 mg orally once weekly with counseling on proper administration (first thing in the morning with a full glass of water, no other intake for 30 minutes, remain upright), ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, review dental health and rare adverse events, and reassess fracture risk and BMD after 1–2 years to confirm maintenance of gains; consider a drug holiday after 3–5 years if risk falls to lower ranges, but continue therapy if high risk persists or if new fractures occur, which is consistent with major guidelines and the documented site-specific benefits needed in this case [^112grdfc] [^113SUafC] [^111wqC79] [^113WfNAn].

- **Alendronate** is the preferred choice for this 74-year-old woman with femoral neck osteopenia and elevated FRAX because it has **proven hip, vertebral, and wrist fracture reduction** [^113sLeJg] [^113edm3R] [^117FVHyh] in large randomized trials, whereas ibandronate only reduces vertebral fractures and does not reduce hip or wrist fractures [^113tpCk6] [^115FWCcx] [^114u7oh6]. Alendronate is first-line in guidelines for high-risk patients [^114wUxoj] [^113SUafC], and ibandronate is reserved for spine-specific needs [^111wqC79]. Given her femoral neck T-score and FRAX risk, alendronate is the **evidence-based option to reduce overall fracture risk** [^113WfNAn].

## Comparative efficacy of alendronate and ibandronate

### Alendronate

- **Vertebral fractures**: Reduces risk by ~45% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45–0.67) [^1175NWyT] [^113sLeJg].
- **Nonvertebral fractures**: Reduces risk by ~16% (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74–0.96) [^1175NWyT] [^1117ccbw].
- **Hip fractures**: Reduces risk by ~53% (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81) [^113edm3R] [^111GVbH3].
- **Wrist fractures**: Reduces risk by ~31% (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.98) [^113edm3R] [^113sLeJg].

---

### Ibandronate

- **Vertebral fractures**: Reduces risk by ~50% (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34–0.74) [^113tpCk6] [^114u7oh6].
- **Nonvertebral fractures**: No significant reduction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73–1.11) [^113tpCk6] [^115FWCcx].
- **Hip fractures**: No significant reduction (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60–1.38) [^113tpCk6] [^115FWCcx].
- **Wrist fractures**: No significant reduction (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.60–1.38) [^113tpCk6] [^115FWCcx].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines prioritize bisphosphonates with **broad antifracture efficacy** [^113SUafC] [^117FVHyh]. The **AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines** recommend alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate as initial therapy to reduce hip, nonvertebral, and spine fractures in high-risk patients [^114wUxoj] [^112tmFwB], whereas **Ibandronate** is reserved for patients needing spine-specific efficacy [^111wqC79].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Femoral neck T-score**: -2.4 (osteopenia).
- **FRAX major osteoporotic fracture risk**: 18%.
- **FRAX hip fracture risk**: 4.6%.

Given her elevated hip fracture risk and femoral neck osteopenia, a bisphosphonate with **proven hip and nonvertebral fracture reduction** is indicated [^117FVHyh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

**Alendronate** is the preferred therapy because it has **proven efficacy** in reducing hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures [^113sLeJg], whereas ibandronate is limited to vertebral fracture reduction and lacks hip or wrist benefit [^113tpCk6]. This aligns with guidelines and the patient's risk profile, making alendronate the evidence-based choice [^114wUxoj].

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^113sLeJg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which act to inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for relevant randomized controlled trials published between 1966 to 2007.

- **Selection criteria**: Women receiving at least one year of alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis were compared to those receiving placebo and/or calcium/vitamin D. The outcome was fracture incidence.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We undertook study selection and data abstraction in duplicate. We performed meta-analysis of fracture outcomes using relative risks, and a greater than 15% relative change was considered clinically important. We assessed study quality through reporting of allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials representing 12,068 women were included in the review. Relative (RRR) and absolute (ARR) risk reductions for the 10 mg dose were as follows: for vertebral fractures, a significant 45% RRR was found (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.67). This was significant for both primary prevention, with 45% RRR (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.80) and 2% ARR, and secondary prevention with 45% RRR (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.69) and 6% ARR. For non-vertebral fractures, a significant 16% RRR was found (RR 0.84).

### Ibandronate sodium [^115FWCcx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effect of ibandronate sodium tablets, 2.5 mg daily, on nonvertebral fractures was evaluated. Ibandronate did not reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures, which served as a secondary efficacy measure. The number of nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures reported in women treated with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg tablets daily was similar to that in the placebo group, with incidences of 9.1% (95% CI: 7.1%, 11.1%) for ibandronate and 8.2% (95% CI: 6.3%, 10.2%) for placebo. The treatment groups were similar in the number of fractures reported at individual nonvertebral sites, including the pelvis, femur, wrist, forearm, rib, and hip.

The effect on BMD was significant with ibandronate sodium 2.5 mg daily. It significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine and hip compared to the placebo. In the 3-year osteoporosis treatment study, increases in lumbar spine BMD were progressive over the treatment period and statistically significant at 6 months and all later time points. By the end of 3 years, lumbar spine BMD increased by 6.4% with ibandronate sodium tablets compared to 1.4% for the placebo group (p < 0.0001). The study identified significant increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter compared to placebo.

The impact on bone histology was assessed through iliac crest biopsies. These biopsies evaluated the effects after 22 months of treatment in 16 women and required further synthesis.

### Binosto [^111GVbH3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The Fracture Intervention Trial: A four-year study focused on patients with low bone mass but without a baseline radiographic vertebral fracture. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 4,432 patients (alendronate, n = 2214; placebo, n = 2218) and further investigated the reduction in fracture incidence due to alendronate sodium. The intent was to recruit women with osteoporosis, defined as a baseline femoral neck BMD at least two standard deviations below the mean for young adult women. However, due to subsequent revisions to the normative values for femoral neck BMD, 31% of patients were found not to meet this entry criterion. Thus, the study included both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women. The results for patients with osteoporosis are shown in Table 5.

- **Fracture results across studies**: In the three-year study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing at least one new radiographic vertebral fracture from 15.0% to 7.9%, representing a 47% relative risk reduction (p < 0.001). In the four-year study of FIT, the percentage was reduced from 3.8% to 2.1%, accounting for a 44% relative risk reduction (p = 0.001). For the combined U.S./Multinational studies, the reduction was from 6.2% to 3.2%, a 48% relative risk reduction (p = 0.034).

- **Multiple new vertebral fractures**: Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures from 4.2% to 0.6%, an 87% relative risk reduction (p < 0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies, and from 4.9% to 0.5%, a 90% relative risk reduction (p < 0.001) in the three-year study of FIT.

### Effect of alendronate on the age-specific incidence of symptomatic osteoporotic fractures [^113edm3R]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2005). Low credibility.

Analyses of data from 3,658 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis enrolled in the Fracture Intervention Trial showed that alendronate is effective in reducing the risk of symptomatic osteoporotic fractures across a spectrum of ages.

- **Introduction**: Most osteoporosis studies examine the relative risk of fracture based on the entire duration of treatment. Because older patients tend to be at higher risk for osteoporosis-related fractures, this analysis examined the effect of alendronate treatment on the relative risk of fracture in terms of the age that patients attained during the study.

- **Materials and methods**: We studied 3,658 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged 55–80 years at baseline, enrolled in the Fracture Intervention Trial, a large randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were treated with a placebo or with alendronate at a daily dose of 5 mg for 2 years, followed by 10 mg for an additional 1–2.5 years, and monitored for clinical fractures. Age, rather than study time, was the dynamic variable in our analysis.

- **Results**: The relative risk reductions for hip, clinical spine, and wrist fractures were constant across age groups, without evidence of a decline at older ages. Specifically, alendronate reduced the risk of clinical fracture by 53% at the hip (relative risk [RR] = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.27–0.81; p < 0.01), 45% at the spine (RR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.37–0.83; p < 0.01), and 31% at the wrist (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.50–0.98; p = 0.038). In addition, alendronate produced a significant risk reduction of 40% (RR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.47–0.77; p [value missing].

The ACP 2024 guidelines emphasize the importance of individualized medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly concerning antiresorptive and anabolic therapy. Bisphosphonates are recommended to be considered on a case-by-case basis to reduce the risk of fractures in patients over 65 years old with low bone mass (osteopenia).

### The importance of previous fracture site on osteoporosis diagnosis and incident fractures in women [^115ehcNf]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

Previous fractures increase the risk of subsequent fractures, irrespective of the initial fracture site. Fracture risk assessment tools have been developed to guide clinical management; however, they do not differentiate based on the prior fracture site. This study aimed to determine which sites of previous nontraumatic fractures are most strongly associated with a diagnosis of osteoporosis — defined by a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score of ≤ -2.5 at the femoral neck — and an incident major osteoporotic fracture.

Using administrative health databases, a retrospective historical cohort study was conducted on 39,991 women aged 45 years and older who underwent BMD testing with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). **Statistical analysis methods**: Logistic regression and Cox proportional multivariate models tested the association between previous fracture sites, risk of osteoporosis, and incident fractures. Clinical fractures at specific sites were strongly and independently associated with a higher risk of an osteoporotic femoral neck T-score after adjusting for age. **Significant sites**: Hip fractures exhibited an odds ratio (OR) of 3.58 (95% confidence interval, 3.04–4.21), pelvis fractures an OR of 2.23 (95% CI, 1.66–3.0), spine fractures an OR of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.77–2.62), and humerus fractures an OR of 1.74 (95% CI, 1.49–2.02).

Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and femoral neck BMD, revealed the greatest increase in risk for a major osteoporotic fracture among women with previous spine fractures (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% CI, 1.72–2.53), humerus fractures (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44–2.01), and pelvis fractures. The analysis underlines the importance of considering fracture site in osteoporosis diagnosis and risk assessment.

### Effect of abaloparatide vs alendronate on fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^113YZ1fH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The ACTIVE study demonstrated the antifracture efficacy of abaloparatide in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. ACTIVExtend showed sustained fracture risk reduction with alendronate in abaloparatide-treated participants from ACTIVE. A direct comparison of the efficacy of abaloparatide and antiresorptive therapies has not been performed.

- **Objective**: The objective of this analysis is to compare the antifracture efficacy of abaloparatide in ACTIVE with that of alendronate in ACTIVExtend.

- **Design**: In this post hoc analysis, the rate of new vertebral fractures for women in ACTIVExtend (N = 1139) was calculated based on baseline and endpoint radiographs for placebo or abaloparatide in ACTIVE and alendronate in ACTIVExtend. Vertebral fracture rates between abaloparatide and alendronate were compared in a Poisson regression model. Fracture rates for nonvertebral and clinical fractures were compared based on a Poisson model during 18 months of abaloparatide or placebo treatment in ACTIVE and 18 months of alendronate treatment in ACTIVExtend.

- **Results**: The vertebral fracture rate was lower during abaloparatide treatment in ACTIVE (0.47 fractures/100 patient-years) than during alendronate treatment in ACTIVExtend (1.66 fractures/100 patient-years) [relative risk reduction 71%; p = 0.027]. Although the comparisons did not meet statistical significance, after switching from placebo (ACTIVE) to alendronate (ACTIVExtend), the rate of new vertebral fractures decreased from 2.49 to 1.66 fractures per 100 patient-years.

### Once-monthly oral ibandronate improves biomechanical determinants of bone strength in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113KRQhG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). High credibility.

Bone strength and fracture resistance are determined by bone mineral density (BMD) and structural, mechanical, and geometric properties of bone. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study evaluated the effects of once-monthly oral ibandronate on hip and lumbar spine BMD and calculated strength using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) with finite element analysis (FEA) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with hip structural analysis (HSA).

Participants were women aged 55–80 years with BMD T-scores -2.0 or less to -5.0 or greater (n = 93). Oral ibandronate 150 mg/month (n = 47) or placebo (n = 46) was administered for 12 months.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary endpoint was the total hip QCT BMD change from baseline. Secondary endpoints included other QCT BMD sites, FEA, DXA areal BMD, and HSA. All analyses were exploratory, with post hoc P values.

- **Results**: Ibandronate increased integral total hip QCT BMD and DXA areal BMD more than placebo at 12 months (treatment differences: 2.2%, P = 0.005; 2.0%, P = 0.003). The FEA-derived hip strength to density ratio and femoral, peripheral, and trabecular strength increased with ibandronate versus placebo (treatment differences: 4.1%, P < 0.001; 5.9%, P < 0.001; 2.5%, P = 0.011; 3.5%, P = 0.003, respectively). Ibandronate improved vertebral, peripheral, and trabecular strength and anteroposterior bending stiffness versus placebo [7.1% (P < 0.001), 7.8% (P < 0.001), 5.6% (P = 0.023), and 6.3% (P < 0.001), respectively]. HSA-estimated femoral narrow neck strength was truncated.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^113zk8uN]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) affects millions of women worldwide. The prevalence of PMO in women aged ≥ 50 years has been estimated at 15.4% in the US and 22.1% in the EU. Osteoporosis can greatly affect quality of life due to an increased risk of fractures and subsequent effects on mobility, ambulation, and self-care. A recent systematic review, including data from 36 countries, reported a 22.8% median 1-year mortality rate after hip fracture. Osteoporosis represents a significant economic burden due to complications following fractures, with one study reporting an annual facility-related hospital cost of $5.1 billion USD for fracture care in women aged ≥ 55 years in the US, which is a greater annual cost than myocardial infarction, stroke, or breast cancer.

Management of osteoporosis includes non-pharmacological (e.g. diet, exercise, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation) and pharmacological therapies. According to US treatment guidelines, oral bisphosphonates (BP; alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate), IV BP (ibandronate and zoledronic acid), RANK-L inhibitors (denosumab), and anabolics (abaloparatide, romosozumab, and teriparatide) are all appropriate choices for initial therapy among women with PMO at high risk for fracture.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that denosumab is more effective in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) compared with oral and IV BP over 12 months of follow-up. However, the head-to-head efficacy of denosumab vs. BP on fracture outcomes — the clinical endpoint of greatest interest to healthcare providers — has not been conclusively established.

### T-score as an indicator of fracture risk during treatment with romosozumab or alendronate in the ARCH trial [^1118XQgG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Low credibility.

In the Active-Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH) clinical trial (NCT01631214), one year of romosozumab followed by alendronate reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared to alendronate alone in women with prevalent fractures. We performed post hoc analyses of data from patients in ARCH (romosozumab, n = 1739; alendronate, n = 1726) who had a baseline bone mineral density (BMD) measurement and received at least one open-label alendronate dose. We evaluated one-year mean BMD and corresponding T-score changes, the proportions of patients achieving T-scores greater than -2.5 at the total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN), and lumbar spine (LS), and group differences in fracture rates after 12 months, while all participants were on alendronate. Subsequently, we investigated the relationship between T-scores achieved at the TH, FN, and LS at 12 months and subsequent fracture incidence.

At one year, the mean change from baseline in TH BMD was 6.3% (T-score change 0.31) with romosozumab versus 2.9% (T-score change 0.15) with alendronate (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with a TH T-score greater than -2.5 increased from 34% at baseline to 55% after one year of romosozumab, and from 32% at baseline to 44% after one year of alendronate. Compared with patients receiving alendronate in year one, those receiving romosozumab had a 75% reduction in new or worsening vertebral fractures (p < 0.001) in year two, and a 19% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (p = 0.120) and a 40% reduction in hip fractures (p = 0.041) during the open-label period. TH and FN T-scores achieved at month 12 were associated with…

### Guideline no. 422g: Menopause and osteoporosis [^114T8vf9]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly concerning antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of bisphosphonates for ideally up to five years in patients with osteoporosis at intermediate risk of fracture, unless contraindicated. It is advised to re-evaluate fracture risk after three to five years of treatment and consider prescribing a drug holiday.

### T-score as an indicator of fracture risk during treatment with romosozumab or alendronate in the ARCH trial [^113WHDcT]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). High credibility.

Our data show that 1 year of romosozumab leads to larger BMD gains compared with alendronate and results in a greater likelihood of osteoporosis resolution. The T-score achieved with either therapy, as early as 6 months and as late as 24 months, is related to subsequent fracture risk. The findings support the concept of treat-to-target for osteoporosis and are consistent with the results of other studies showing the correlation between T-score achieved with many osteoporosis treatments and reduction in fracture risk. We conclude that T-scores may be a clinically useful target for postmenopausal women treated with romosozumab. The large BMD gains seen with romosozumab suggest it could have an important role in treating patients with osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture.

### Denosumab or zoledronic acid in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis previously treated with oral bisphosphonates [^116DnTSe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic, progressive condition that generally requires long-term management. Oral bisphosphonates are a commonly prescribed treatment for osteoporosis, but inconvenient dosing regimens and side effects can lead to low adherence. Suboptimal adherence to osteoporosis medication can reduce antifracture efficacy and increase healthcare use and costs. Although more extended dosing intervals can improve adherence, efficacy remains an influential determinant of patient preference for and adherence with osteoporosis medications.

Once-yearly intravenous bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid (ZOL) has been shown to reduce the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures. Although parenteral bisphosphonates, such as ZOL, have become a treatment option for osteoporosis, there is no evidence that cycling through bisphosphonate agents offers therapeutic benefit to patients with osteoporosis, whether assessed by bone mineral density (BMD) or bone turnover markers (BTMs). Although patients in one clinical trial expressed a preference for once-yearly ZOL over a weekly bisphosphonate regimen, switching from oral bisphosphonates to ZOL did not further increase BMD.

Denosumab (Prolia; Amgen Inc) is a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL administered subcutaneously every 6 months. In a 3-year, placebo-controlled, pivotal osteoporosis trial, denosumab significantly reduced BTMs, increased BMD, and reduced the risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fractures. Three studies have shown that individuals who received prior bisphosphonate therapy and transitioned to denosumab have experienced positive outcomes.

### Drug insight: Bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vv5cs]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2006).

Bisphosphonates are potent antiresorptive agents that have been extensively used for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis over the past decade. When embedded in the bone matrix, bisphosphonates are taken up by osteoclasts engaged in bone resorption. This process leads, primarily by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase — a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway — to osteoclast apoptosis. As a result, bone resorption decreases, consequently improving the mechanical properties of the bone and reducing fracture risk. Alendronate and risedronate are oral nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Several randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of these bisphosphonates, showing they can halve the risk of vertebral fracture when taken daily for three years. The risk of nonvertebral fractures, including those at the hip, was also significantly decreased.

Weekly regimens have simplified the administration of bisphosphonates, likely enhancing adherence to treatment. A significant reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has also been demonstrated with an intermittent regimen of ibandronate — a new, potent, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate. Ibandronate was recently marketed for use as an oral, once-monthly dose of 150 mg, aiming to improve compliance. Bisphosphonates are usually well tolerated in the long term. The intravenous administration of bisphosphonates for women with osteoporosis is currently under investigation and may provide an intriguing future option for women who cannot tolerate oral regimens, as well as enhance compliance.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: An Endocrine Society guideline update [^113SUafC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The medical management of hip fractures, particularly concerning osteoporosis management, should follow specific regimens. According to the ES 2020 guidelines, initiating bisphosphonates — such as alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or ibandronate — is recommended as the initial therapy. This approach is aimed at reducing fracture risk in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^1117j29x]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

Patients newly treated with denosumab versus alendronate experienced a 39% decrease in the risk of major osteoporotic (MOP) fracture (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.48–0.74), a 36% decrease in the risk of hip fracture (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90), a 43% decrease in the risk of nonvertebral (NV) fracture (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42–0.71), a 50% decrease in the risk of non-hip NV (NHNV) fracture (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35–0.64), and a 30% decrease in the risk of hospitalized vertebral (HV) fracture (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.40–1.01) over the entire follow-up period.

- **Cumulative fracture risk reduction over time**: The magnitude of MOP fracture risk reduction increased over time. Patients experienced a 9% reduction (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85–0.97) after 1 year, 12% (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93) after 2 years, 18% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.77–0.87) after 3 years, and 31% (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62–0.76) after 5 years of follow-up. Similar reductions in risk over time were observed for hip, NV, and NHNV fractures.

- **Cumulative incidence of fracture outcomes**: Figure 1 shows the cumulative incidence of fracture outcomes: (A) major osteoporotic fracture; (B) hip fracture; (C) nonvertebral fracture; (D) non-hip NV fracture; and (E) hospitalized vertebral fracture, comparing patients initiating denosumab versus alendronate. ✱ p < 0.05. CI, confidence interval; RR, risk ratio.

The results comparing denosumab with oral bisphosphonate (BP) users were consistent with the primary analysis. Alendronate comprised a majority (72%) of the oral BP use. The results across subgroups of patients aged 80 years and older, as well as those with and without a history of fracture, were also consistent with the overall findings over a 5-year follow-up period.

### Bone mineral density after transitioning from denosumab to alendronate [^115i5vew]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Limited data are available regarding the optimal post-denosumab bisphosphonate treatment regimen. In a small case series evaluating women followed for up to two years after the FRAME trial, zoledronic acid (n = 11) infusion after denosumab discontinuation showed 73% to 87% preservation of the gains in BMD at the TH or LS after one year, with minimal further BMD loss at any skeletal site in year two. Participants given risedronate (n = 5) showed only partial preservation of BMD (41%–64%).

These findings are somewhat inconsistent with a previous, smaller case series showing only minimal efficacy in preserving BMD after denosumab treatment cessation. This difference in outcome may relate to the inclusion of participants with different ages, previous osteoporosis treatments, and durations of denosumab treatment. It should be noted that intravenous zoledronic acid was administered six or eight months after the last denosumab injection.

In the analysis, which included a larger number of participants, one year of alendronate treatment following one year of denosumab led to maintained or increased BMD at the TH or LS in 84% to 92% of participants. These findings demonstrate the potential for bisphosphonate treatment to prevent reversible bone loss in patients who discontinue denosumab treatment. They may suggest that oral alendronate helps maintain BMD in the period immediately following denosumab discontinuation when the effects of treatment on bone turnover have dissipated. Ongoing randomized clinical trials evaluating bisphosphonate use after denosumab discontinuation should provide further insights.

### Bisphosphonates for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [^111ify9z]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by bone loss, leading to impaired bone strength and an increased risk of fractures. In the United States, two million fractures annually are attributed to osteoporosis, and these fractures are associated with serious morbidity and mortality. Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of fractures by suppressing bone resorption and increasing bone strength, and they have been widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, the use of these drugs for managing osteoporosis remains a clinical challenge, with several important considerations, including appropriate patient selection, pretreatment evaluation, potential adverse effects, patient preferences, and adherence.

This review discusses the evidence informing the clinical strategy for using bisphosphonates in patients with osteoporosis and those at high risk of fracture, focusing on the benefits and risks of treatment. It also considers issues related to the monitoring and duration of treatment.

### Evenity [^115ZKstH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Study 2 (NCT01631214) was a randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study involving postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74 years). These women had a BMD T-score less than or equal to −2.5 at the total hip or femoral neck, accompanied by either one moderate or severe vertebral fracture, or two mild vertebral fractures. Alternatively, they had a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2.0 at the total hip or femoral neck, with either two moderate or severe vertebral fractures or a history of a proximal femur fracture. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either monthly subcutaneous injections of EVENITY (N = 2046) or oral alendronate 70 mg weekly (N = 2047) for 12 months. All participants received 500 to 1000 mg calcium and 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D supplementation daily. After the 12-month treatment period, women in both groups transitioned to open-label alendronate 70 mg weekly, remaining blinded to their initial treatment.

This was an event-driven trial. The two primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of morphometric vertebral fracture at 24 months and the time to the first clinical fracture through the primary analysis period. This analysis period ended when at least 330 subjects had a clinical fracture, and all participants had completed the 24-month visit. Clinical fracture was a composite endpoint of nonvertebral fracture and symptomatic vertebral fracture.

- **Effect on fractures**: EVENITY significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fracture at 24 months. EVENITY also significantly reduced the risk of clinical fracture through the end of the primary analysis period.

The tables referencing the effects on fractures were reportedly included in the original tables (Table 3 and Table 4), but those tables are not provided here in the text. The analysis was truncated, but the available results indicate a significant impact on fracture reduction.

### Ibandronate sodium [^114u7oh6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ibandronate sodium injection is a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

- **Indications and usage**: Ibandronate sodium injection is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Limitations of use**: The safety and effectiveness of ibandronate sodium injection for this treatment are based on clinical data of one year duration. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. Patients on bisphosphonate therapy should undergo periodic re-evaluation for the need for continued therapy. Consider discontinuing the drug after 3 to 5 years in patients at low-risk for fracture, and periodically reassess the risk for fracture in patients who discontinue therapy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of once-monthly oral ibandronate in postmenopausal osteoporosis: 2 year results from the MOBILE study [^114XoLbx]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Reducing bisphosphonate dosing frequency may improve suboptimal adherence to treatment and therefore therapeutic outcomes in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Once-monthly oral ibandronate has been developed to overcome this problem.

- **Objective**: To confirm the 1-year results and provide more extensive safety and tolerability information for once-monthly dosing by a 2-year analysis.

- **Methods**: MOBILE, a randomized, phase III, non-inferiority study, compared the efficacy and safety of once-monthly ibandronate with daily ibandronate, which has previously been shown to reduce vertebral fracture risk in comparison with placebo.

- **Results**: 1609 postmenopausal women were randomized. Substantial increases in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) were seen in all treatment arms: 5.0%, 5.3%, 5.6%, and 6.6% in the daily and once-monthly groups (50 + 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg), respectively. It was confirmed that all once-monthly regimens were at least as effective as daily treatment, and in addition, 150 mg was found to be better (p < 0.001). Substantial increases in proximal femur (total hip, femoral neck, trochanter) BMD were seen; 150 mg produced the most pronounced effect (p < 0.05 versus daily treatment). Independent of the regimen, most participants (70.5–93.5%) achieved increases above baseline in lumbar spine or total hip BMD, or both. Pronounced decreases in the biochemical marker of bone resorption, sCTX, observed in all arms after 3 months, were maintained throughout. The 150 mg regimen consistently produced greater increases in BMD and sCTX suppression than the 100 mg.

### Changes in bone remodelling and antifracture efficacy of intermittent bisphosphonate therapy: Implications from clinical studies with ibandronate [^114pvJtq]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates reduce the rate of bone resorption and bone remodelling. Given daily, they decrease the risk of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. However, when bisphosphonates were administered at extended drug-free intervals, this antifracture efficacy was generally not observed. This may be due to the different pattern of bone remodelling changes.

Data from randomized clinical studies of ibandronate, given orally or intravenously at different doses and for variable time intervals to women with osteoporosis, were examined to explore the relationship between intermittent bisphosphonate therapy, changes in bone resorption, and fracture risk. The magnitude of the reduction in the rate of bone resorption at the end of the drug-free interval, rather than its fluctuation pattern after bisphosphonate administration, determines antifracture efficacy, provided that these fluctuations occur within the premenopausal range. Prolongation of the drug-free interval beyond 2 weeks should be compensated by a dose higher than the cumulative daily dose.

### Intravenous ibandronate injections given every three months: a new treatment option to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women [^112yuiNb]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy, safety, and dose response of three doses of ibandronate, administered intermittently by intravenous (IV) injection every three months, in preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis.

A total of 629 postmenopausal women, categorized according to time since menopause and baseline lumbar spine (L1–4) bone mineral density (BMD), were enrolled into a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were randomly allocated to receive IV ibandronate in doses of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg, or a placebo, every three months. All participants received daily calcium supplementation.

Results indicated that one year's treatment with intermittent IV ibandronate injections produced a dose-dependent gain in mean (SD) lumbar spine BMD from baseline of 2.5 (2.5)%, 1.8 (2.6)%, and 1.0 (2.8)% in the groups receiving 2 mg, 1 mg, and 0.5 mg ibandronate, respectively, compared with a loss of BMD of 0.4 (2.4)% in the placebo group (p = 0.0001 for each ibandronate dose vs. placebo). The highest BMD gains occurred in women with osteopenia receiving 2 mg ibandronate. Similarly, at the hip, all three doses of ibandronate produced significantly better gains in BMD than placebo (p < 0.05), with the greatest gains in women with osteopenia receiving the 2 mg dose. Ibandronate concomitantly and dose-dependently suppressed markers of bone turnover in comparison with placebo, and injections were well-tolerated.

In conclusion, IV ibandronate injections, given every three months, may be an effective alternative to oral bisphosphonates and hormonal therapy in the prevention of bone loss in postmenopausal women.

### Treatment of low bone density or osteoporosis to prevent fractures in men and women: A clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians [^114ivmQr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This guideline updates the 2008 American College of Physicians (ACP) recommendations on treatment of low bone density and osteoporosis to prevent fractures in men and women. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials; systematic reviews; large observational studies (for adverse events); and case reports (for rare events) that were published between 2 January 2005 and 3 June 2011. The review was updated to July 2016 using a machine-learning method, and a limited update to October 2016 was done. Clinical outcomes evaluated were fractures and adverse events. This guideline focuses on the comparative benefits and risks of short- and long-term pharmacologic treatments for low bone density, including pharmaceutical prescriptions, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians. The target patient population includes men and women with low bone density and osteoporosis.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians offer pharmacologic treatment with alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk for hip and vertebral fractures in women who have known osteoporosis (Grade: strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Meta-analyses of therapies for postmenopausal osteoporosis. II. Meta-analysis of alendronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women [^1175NWyT]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

To review the effect of alendronate on bone density and fractures in postmenopausal women, we conducted a comprehensive analysis.

- **Data source**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Contents, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry from 1980 to 1999. We also examined citations of relevant articles and proceedings of international meetings.

- **Study selection**: We included 11 trials that randomized women to alendronate or placebo and measured bone density for at least 1 year.

- **Data extraction**: For each trial, three independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality and abstracted data.

- **Data synthesis**: The pooled relative risk (RR) for vertebral fractures in patients given 5 mg or more of alendronate was 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43–0.65]. The RR of nonvertebral fractures in patients given 10 mg or more of alendronate was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.38–0.69), showing a significantly greater effect than the 5 mg dose. We found a similar reduction in RR across nonvertebral fracture types. In particular, RR reductions for fractures traditionally considered "osteoporotic", such as hip and forearm fractures, were very similar to RR reductions for "nonosteoporotic" fractures. Individual studies showed consistent results, reflected in the P values of the test of heterogeneity (P = 0.99 for vertebral and 0.88 for nonvertebral fractures). Alendronate produced positive effects on the percentage change in bone density, which increased with both dose and time. After 3 years of treatment with 10 mg of alendronate or more, the pooled estimate of the difference in percentage change between alendronate and placebo was 7.48% (95% CI…).

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^111V4GqG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Based on subject-matter expertise, a total of 118 different patient characteristics were selected a priori that represent potential confounders (Tables S2 and S3). Covariates, including demographics, comorbidities, co-medications, and healthcare service utilization, were captured during the baseline period. The history of fractures and prior treatment was assessed using all available data before treatment initiation.

In order to examine the potential imbalance of unmeasured confounders such as BMD between the treatment groups in a similar patient population, we used a separate database linking Medicare claims to a large national electronic health record data system (PCORnet®). This was used to calculate baseline Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) scores, which predict the 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fractures. The study included women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) newly initiating (with no prior history of) denosumab (n = 1088) and oral bisphosphonates (BP) (n = 1662) from 2019 to 2020.

- **Statistical analysis**: We used multivariate logistic regression with treatment as the outcome to calculate propensity scores, estimating the conditional probability of receiving either denosumab or alendronate. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models with censoring events as the outcome were used to estimate the conditional probability of being censored between treatment groups. Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) and inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) were applied to adjust for confounding at treatment initiation and to account for potential bias from informative censoring.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^114ebcG2]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Previous non-interventional studies evaluating the potential fracture reduction benefit of comparing denosumab and oral bisphosphonates (BP) have produced conflicting results, possibly due to residual confounding. A Danish study using national registry data found no meaningful differences in the 3-year risk of hip fracture and any fracture (hazard ratio [HR] ~1.05 and HR ~0.92, respectively), and similar results were observed in a separate Danish study limited to patients with type 2 diabetes. Because denosumab is typically used as second-line treatment in Denmark (following alendronate), patients treated with denosumab are likely to have more advanced disease, making them more prone to fractures. There was no adjustment for bone mineral density (BMD) — an important determinant of fracture risk and prescribing choice — in either of these studies.

In contrast, a smaller Swiss study that adjusted for BMD found meaningful reductions in the risk of any fracture (HR, ~0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.69), vertebral fractures (HR, ~0.51; 95% CI, 0.39–0.68), and non-vertebral (NV) fractures (HR, ~0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.65), but not hip fractures (HR, ~0.85; 95% CI, 0.43–1.67) when using denosumab versus alendronate.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^111qAZXf]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is often not clinically recognized until following a fracture occurs. Individuals who have one fracture are at an increased risk of future fractures. Prompt initiation of osteoporosis treatment following a fracture is critical to reducing the rate of future fractures. Antiresorptives are the most widely used class of medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Many providers are hesitant to initiate antiresorptives in the acute post-fracture period due to concerns about interference with bone remodeling necessary for successful fracture healing. This could lead to increased rates of non-union, malunion, and refracture. While such concerns should not extend to anabolic medications, physicians may also hesitate to initiate anabolic osteoporosis therapies due to high cost and/or lack of familiarity. This article briefly reviews the available data and presents a digestible narrative summary to familiarize practicing orthopaedic surgeons with the essential details of the published research on this topic.

- **Results**: The results of 20 clinical studies and key pre-clinical studies related to the effect of anti-resorptive medications on osteoporosis and fracture healing are summarized in this narrative review.

- **Discussion**: While few level I studies have examined the impact of the timing of initiation of osteoporosis medications in the acute post-fracture period, the few that have been published do not support these concerns. Specifically, data from level I clinical trials indicate that initiating bisphosphonates as early as…

### Bone health in cancer: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^113GuEVE]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for bone metastasis, more specifically with respect to prevention of metastases, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend offering adjuvant bisphosphonates. This includes intravenous zoledronate or daily oral clodronate or ibandronate, for postmenopausal females or premenopausal females treated with GnRH analogs who have early breast cancer deemed at significant risk for recurrence.

### Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women [^1117ccbw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration, leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts (bone cells that break down bone tissue). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2008.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women at lower and higher risk of fracture, respectively.

- **Search methods**: We searched Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (which includes CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two trial registers, drug approval agency websites, and the bibliographies of relevant systematic reviews to identify the studies included in this review. The latest search date was 01 February 2023. We imposed no restrictions on language, date, form of publication, or reported outcomes.

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included only randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of alendronate on postmenopausal women. Targeted participants must have received at least one year of alendronate. We classified a study as secondary prevention if its population met one or more of the following hierarchical criteria: a diagnosis of osteoporosis, a history of vertebral fractures, a low bone mineral density T-score (-2.5 or lower), and 75 years old or older. If a study population met none of those criteria, we classified it as a primary prevention study.

- **Outcomes**: Our major outcomes were clinical vertebral and non-vertebral.

### Short-term and long-term effects of osteoporosis therapies [^114CjqSN]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Progress continues to be made in the development of therapeutics for fracture prevention. Bisphosphonates are now available orally and intravenously, often as inexpensive generics, and remain the most widely used interventions for osteoporosis. The major safety concern associated with the use of bisphosphonates is the development of femoral shaft stress fractures, and although rare, this adverse event affords the principal rationale for restricting bisphosphonate therapy to those individuals with femoral T-scores for more than five years. Newer antiresorptive therapies, in the form of denosumab and cathepsin K inhibitors, might increase efficacy and possibly circumvent some of the safety concerns associated with bisphosphonate use, such as gastrointestinal and renal complications. The combination of teriparatide with antiresorptives markedly increases effects on BMD; new anabolic agents are also very promising in this regard. However, whether or not these changes in BMD translate into improved efficacy of fracture prevention remains to be determined. Vitamin D is important for the prevention of osteomalacia but does not influence BMD or fracture risk in patients not deficient in vitamin D. The balance of risks and benefits of calcium supplementation is contentious, but patients should be encouraged to adhere to a balanced diet aimed at maintaining a healthy body weight. Consideration of a patient's risk of falling and its mitigation is also important.

### T-score as an indicator of fracture risk during treatment with romosozumab or alendronate in the ARCH trial [^112RaUva]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). High credibility.

In the Active‐Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis at High Risk (ARCH) clinical trial (NCT01631214), one year of romosozumab followed by alendronate reduced the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared to alendronate alone in women with prevalent fracture. We performed post hoc analyses of data from patients in ARCH (romosozumab, n = 1,739; alendronate, n = 1,726) who had a baseline BMD measurement and received at least one open‐label alendronate dose. We evaluated one-year mean BMD and corresponding T-score changes; proportions of patients achieving T-scores > -2.5 at the total hip (TH), femoral neck (FN), and lumbar spine (LS); and group differences in fracture rates after 12 months, while all participants were on alendronate. Subsequently, we investigated the relationship between T-scores achieved at the TH, FN, and LS at 12 months and subsequent fracture incidence.

At one year, the mean change from baseline in TH BMD was 6.3% (T-score change 0.31) with romosozumab versus 2.9% (T-score change 0.15) with alendronate, significantly favoring romosozumab (p < .001). Proportions of patients achieving T-scores > -2.5 increased from 34% at baseline to 55% after one year of romosozumab, and from 32% at baseline to 44% after one year of alendronate. Compared with patients receiving alendronate in year one, those receiving romosozumab had a 75% reduction in new or worsening vertebral fractures (p < .001) in year two, a 19% reduction in nonvertebral fractures (p = .120), and a 40% reduction in hip fractures (p = .041) during the open‐label period.

### Impact of UK national guidelines based on FRAX® — comparison with current clinical practice [^112Mxos2]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess whether clinician-determined treatment intervention thresholds align with the fracture risk assessment provided by FRAX® and the treatment recommendations issued by the UK National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG).

This retrospective cohort analysis included 288 patients who were consecutively referred for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning from primary care settings just before the introduction of the FRAX® algorithm. In addition to DXA assessments, patients completed a clinical risk factor questionnaire, which incorporated risk factors utilized in the FRAX® algorithm. Initial risk assessments and treatment decisions took place after DXA results. Retrospectively, FRAX® was applied, using the femoral neck T-score, to estimate fracture risk. The results were then compared to NOGG guidelines for treatment intervention. The outcomes determined by clinicians and those recommended by NOGG were audited to assess concordance.

The results showed a 74.6% concordance rate between clinician and NOGG treatment decisions, corresponding to 215 subjects. However, discordance was observed in 73 subjects (25.3%). Among those with discordant outcomes, seven subjects received lifestyle advice when NOGG recommended treatment, 42 received treatment when only lifestyle advice was recommended by NOGG, and 24 were referred to a metabolic bone clinic for further evaluation. The primary reason for treatment differences — where clinicians recommended treatment but NOGG did not — was predominantly (90.2%) due to the use of lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) measurements.

The conclusion drawn from the study indicates there is a high concordance between clinician decisions and NOGG guidelines, though discrepancies were largely due to additional BMD considerations.

### Efficacy of bisphosphonates in reducing fracture risk in postmenopausal osteoporosis [^111Ru8GU]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates have been available for more than a decade. Currently, four bisphosphonates — alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid — are approved in the United States. Alendronate and risedronate are oral agents, ibandronate is available in oral and intravenous formulations, and zoledronic acid is an intravenous drug.

This review summarizes results from pivotal clinical trials in which these bisphosphonates have been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Also reviewed are results of "bridging" studies designed to demonstrate the comparable efficacy of less frequent dosing regimens to increase bone mineral density and to reduce bone turnover. Compared with placebo controls, all four approved bisphosphonates reduce the relative risk of new vertebral fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid reduce the relative risk of new nonvertebral and hip fractures. Clinical trial extensions of up to 10 years with alendronate and seven years with risedronate have shown that efficacy is maintained during long-term treatment.

### Clinical practice. Postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113WfNAn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk.

Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide also reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment, but these are rare.

The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.

### Alendronate produces greater effects than raloxifene on bone density and bone turnover in postmenopausal women with low bone density: Results of EFFECT (Efficacy of FOSAMAX versus EVISTA Comparison Trial) International [^115Qovub]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Alendronate and raloxifene are antiresorptive agents with different mechanisms of action, each used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of alendronate to raloxifene in postmenopausal women with low-bone density.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-masked, double-dummy multicenter international study.

- **Setting**: Clinical trial centers in Europe, South America, and Asia-Pacific.

- **Subjects**: A total of 487 postmenopausal women with low bone density, based on bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine or hip (T-score ≤ -2.0).

- **Interventions**: Patients received either alendronate 70 mg once weekly and daily placebo identical to raloxifene, or raloxifene 60 mg daily and weekly placebo identical to alendronate for 12 months.

- **Main outcome measures**: Evaluations included BMD of the lumbar spine and hip, and markers of bone turnover at 6 and 12 months, along with adverse event reporting.

Results indicated that alendronate demonstrated substantially greater increases in BMD than raloxifene at both lumbar spine and hip sites at 12 months. Lumbar spine BMD increased 4.8% with alendronate vs. 2.2% with raloxifene (P < 0.001). The increase in total hip BMD was 2.3% with alendronate vs. 0.8% with raloxifene (P < 0.001). Reductions in bone turnover were significantly larger with alendronate than raloxifene. Overall tolerability was similar; however, the proportion of patients reporting vasomotor events was significantly higher with raloxifene (9.5%) than with alendronate (3.7%, P = 0.010).

### Cost-effectiveness of alendronate therapy for osteopenic postmenopausal women [^111ZbSJU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines recommend drug treatment to prevent fractures for some postmenopausal women who have low bone mass (osteopenia) but do not have osteoporosis or a history of clinical fractures.

- **Objective**: To estimate the societal costs and health benefits of alendronate drug treatment to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia.

- **Design**: Markov model with 8 health states: no fracture, post-distal forearm fracture, post-clinical vertebral fracture, post-radiographic (but clinically inapparent) vertebral fracture, post-hip fracture, post-hip and vertebral fractures, post-other fracture, and death.

- **Data sources**: Population-based studies of age-specific fracture rates and costs, prospectively measured estimates of disutility after fractures, and the Fracture Intervention Trial of alendronate versus placebo to prevent fracture.

- **Target population**: Postmenopausal women 55 to 75 years of age with femoral neck T-scores between -1.5 and -2.4.

- **Time horizon**: Lifetime.

- **Perspective**: Societal.

- **Interventions**: Five years of alendronate therapy or no drug treatment.

- **Outcome measures**: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.

- **Results of base-case analysis**: For women with no additional fracture risk factors, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained ranged from $70,000 to $332,000, depending on age and femoral neck bone density.

- **Results of sensitivity analyses**: Results were sensitive to changes in fracture risk reduction attributable to alendronate and alendronate cost.

The findings highlight the economic considerations of alendronate therapy in osteopenic postmenopausal women, but acknowledge that results apply to specific conditions and may vary accordingly.

### Alendronate reduces the risk of multiple symptomatic fractures: Results from the fracture intervention trial [^117AoZJ2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). High credibility.

To evaluate the effect of alendronate on the occurrence rate of multiple symptomatic fractures and on the risk of multiple symptomatic fractures (likelihood of having more than one fracture diagnosed because of the symptoms the fractures caused over the study period) among women with osteoporosis, we conducted a primary analysis of data from a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.

The study was set in eleven community-based clinical research centers and involved a subset of women enrolled in the Fracture Intervention Trial. Participants were aged 55 to 81 and had at least one morphometric vertebral fracture at baseline (n = 2,027) or no vertebral fracture but met the prevailing World Health Organization bone mineral density criteria for osteoporosis (T-score ≤ 2.5 at the femoral neck) (n = 1,631).

All participants reporting calcium intake of 1,000 mg/day or less received a supplement of 500 mg calcium and 250 IU cholecalciferol. Participants were randomly assigned to either a placebo or alendronate sodium (5 mg/day for 2 years and 10 mg/day for the remainder of the study). The average total follow-up was 4.3 years. Symptomatic fractures were diagnosed by personal physicians and confirmed by review of radiological data by an expert committee blinded to treatment assignments.

During the follow-up period, 86 of 1,817 women receiving placebo experienced multiple symptomatic fractures, compared with 51 of 1,841 receiving alendronate. The reduction of risk for multiple symptomatic fractures combined was 42% (relative risk [RR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval).

### Alendronate with calcium and vitamin D supplementation is safe and effective for the treatment of decreased bone mineral density in HIV [^115qva34]. AIDS (2007). High credibility.

Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Bisphosphonates are currently the mainstay of treatment for postmenopausal and male osteoporosis in HIV-uninfected individuals; however, their efficacy and safety in HIV-infected patients remain unclear.

In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, we studied the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with or without alendronate in improving BMD in HIV-infected subjects receiving stable antiretroviral therapy. Subjects with secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. The study was powered to detect differences of 3.5% between arms and to detect a moderate sex effect in percentage change in lumbar spine BMD. All dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were analyzed centrally, blinded by arm.

The 82 subjects enrolled were 71% men and 77% white, with a baseline median age of 48 years, a CD4 cell count of 469 cells/μl, and a lumbar spine t-score of less than 2.1. Additionally, 91% had HIV-RNA levels less than 400 copies/ml, and 99% were taking antiretroviral drugs. Compared with calcium/vitamin D alone, alendronate plus calcium/vitamin D resulted in significant improvements in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and trochanter, but not at the femoral neck, compared with baseline. There were trends towards significant increases in BMD values in the calcium/vitamin D group at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. There were no apparent sex differences in the responses to therapy. Alendronate was well tolerated without significant adverse events.

### Ibandronate sodium [^113tpCk6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Ibandronate Sodium Tablets are a bisphosphonate indicated for the treatment and prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use.

- **Treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis**: Ibandronate Sodium Tablets are indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Ibandronate sodium increases bone mineral density (BMD) and reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures.

- **Important limitations of use**: The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of Ibandronate Sodium Tablets for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of three years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Effect of abaloparatide vs alendronate on fracture risk reduction in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^11672Mk4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study population**: The 18-month, phase 3 ACTIVE study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01343004) enrolled 2463 postmenopausal women aged 49 to 86 years with osteoporosis at 28 study centers. Osteoporosis was defined based on prior radiographic vertebral fracture or recent nonvertebral fracture (within the past 5 years before enrollment) and a BMD T-score less than or equal to −2.5 and greater than −5.0 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck in women aged 65 years or younger. Women older than 65 years were eligible if they met the fracture criteria and had a lumbar spine or femoral neck BMD T-score of less than or equal to −2.0 and greater than −5.0 or had no prior fracture but had a lumbar spine or femoral neck BMD T-score of less than or equal to −3.0 and greater than −5.0.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Key exclusion criteria included the use of bisphosphonates for more than 3 months in the past 5 years or denosumab within the past year. Additional inclusion and exclusion criteria have been previously described.

Women randomly assigned to the abaloparatide or placebo arm in ACTIVE who completed the end-of-treatment visit were eligible for enrollment in the ACTIVExtend extension study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01657162). Additional criteria for inclusion in the extension have been previously described.

### Therapeutic equivalence of alendronate 35 milligrams once weekly and 5 milligrams daily in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [^114vmkcz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of alendronate 35 mg once weekly compared with alendronate 5 mg daily in the prevention of osteoporosis, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: We compared the efficacy and safety of treatment with alendronate 35 mg once weekly (n = 362) and alendronate 5 mg daily (n = 361) in a 1-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women (6 months or greater), aged 40–70 years, with lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density T-scores between -2.5 and 1. The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparability of lumbar spine bone mineral density increases, defined by strict prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: Mean increases in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months were equivalent. The difference between the alendronate 35-mg once-weekly group and the alendronate 5-mg daily group at month 12 was -0.3% [-0.6, 0.1], well within the prespecified bounds of ± 1.0%. Bone mineral density increases at other skeletal sites and effects on bone turnover were also virtually identical for the two dosing regimens. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated, and the larger weekly unit dose was not associated with an increased frequency of upper gastrointestinal events.

Alendronate 35 mg once weekly is therapeutically equivalent to alendronate 5 mg daily and provides patients with greater dosing convenience, in addition to the proven efficacy of alendronate and good tolerability.

### Alendronate for fracture prevention in postmenopause [^116Cnbh6]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is an abnormal reduction in bone mass and bone deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. Alendronate (Fosamax) belongs to the bisphosphonate class of drugs, which act to inhibit bone resorption by interfering with the activity of osteoclasts.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of alendronate in the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women.

- **Search strategy**: The authors searched Central, Medline, and EMBASE for relevant randomized controlled trials published from 1966 to 2007.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The authors undertook study selection and data abstraction in duplicate. They performed a meta-analysis of fracture outcomes using relative risks, considering a relative change greater than 15 percent as clinically important. Study quality was assessed through reporting of allocation concealment, blinding, and withdrawals.

- **Main results**: Eleven trials representing 12,068 women were included in the review. Relative and absolute risk reductions for the 10-mg dose were as follows. For vertebral fractures, a 45 percent relative risk reduction was found (relative risk [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.67); this was significant for primary prevention, with a 45 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.80) and 2 percent absolute risk reduction, and for secondary prevention, with 45 percent relative risk reduction (RR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.69) and 6 percent absolute risk reduction. For nonvertebral fractures, a 16 percent relative risk reduction was noted.

### Drug therapy for osteoporosis in older adults [^117FVHyh]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

The goal of osteoporosis management is to prevent fractures. Several pharmacological agents are available to lower fracture risk, either by reducing bone resorption or by stimulating bone formation.

- **Bisphosphonates**: These are the most widely used anti-resorptives, reducing bone turnover markers to low premenopausal concentrations and reducing fracture rates (vertebral by 50–70%, non-vertebral by 20–30%, and hip by approximately 40%). Bisphosphonates bind avidly to bone mineral and have an offset of effect measured in months to years. Long-term, continuous use of oral bisphosphonates is typically interspersed with drug holidays of 1–2 years, to minimize the risk of atypical femoral fractures.

- **Denosumab**: This is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL that potently inhibits osteoclast development and activity. Denosumab is administered by subcutaneous injection every 6 months. Anti-fracture effects of denosumab are similar to those of bisphosphonates; however, there is a pronounced loss of anti-resorptive effect from 7 months after the last injection, which can result in clusters of rebound vertebral fractures.

- **Anabolic drugs**: Two classes of these drugs are now available to stimulate bone formation. Teriparatide and abaloparatide both target the parathyroid hormone-1 receptor and are given by daily subcutaneous injection for up to 2 years. Romosozumab is an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody that stimulates bone formation and inhibits resorption. It is administered as monthly subcutaneous injections for 1 year. Head-to-head studies suggest that anabolic agents have greater anti-fracture efficacy and produce larger increases in bone density.

### Comparative effectiveness of denosumab vs alendronate among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis [^116HAtUg]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

The present study should be evaluated while considering the following limitations. First, only clinical vertebral fractures were identified in this study, missing out on the vast majority of vertebral fractures that do not come to clinical attention. Without access to successive patient radiographs, it is not possible to pinpoint the time when a new vertebral fracture occurred. As vertebral fractures are often asymptomatic or present as back pain, significant delays between the fracture episode and an eventual diagnosis can result in misclassification, where prevalent fractures occurring prior to treatment initiation are captured as incident events, which is not as relevant for other fracture endpoints. Consequently, we identified vertebral fractures using validated algorithms with inpatient diagnoses only (positive predictive value = 98.4%), identifying clinically severe fracture types and intentionally favoring specificity over sensitivity.

Second, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding due to missing information on BMD, a key confounder. We did, however, calculate FRAX scores and found a higher 10-year probability of fracture in the denosumab cohort prior to treatment initiation. We then used quantitative bias analysis to re-estimate the RR of fracture for denosumab vs. alendronate users and observed results that were consistent with, if not more pronounced than, our primary analysis (suggesting an even greater benefit), indicating that our findings are robust to unmeasured confounding. In a separate study, we utilized negative control outcomes to assess…

### The fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX®): Applications in clinical practice [^1178FFQu]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a serious health concern affecting millions of Americans, with many patients going undiagnosed and untreated. Fractures due to osteoporosis and fracture-related complications are the most clinically relevant and costly consequences of this disorder. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®), released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2008, is a major achievement in helping determine which patients may be candidates for pharmacological therapy for osteoporosis. This web-based algorithm, which has been incorporated into some dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) reporting software, calculates the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (clinical vertebral, hip, forearm, or humerus) and the 10-year probability of hip fracture in men and women based on easily obtained clinical risk factors and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck (optional).

The National Osteoporosis Foundation updated its U.S. guidelines in February 2008 to incorporate FRAX and recommends that all postmenopausal women and men aged ≥ 50 years with a hip or vertebral fracture, a T-score ≤ -2.5 at the femoral neck or spine (excluding secondary causes), or low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) and a 10-year probability of hip fracture ≥ 3% or of major osteoporosis-related fracture ≥ 20% (based on FRAX) should be considered candidates for drug therapy. Despite its demonstrated clinical utility, FRAX has limitations and should not be used in all situations. Acceptance and clinical use of FRAX may help identify men and women at increased risk for osteoporotic fracture.

### Alendronate improves bone mineral density in children and adolescents perinatally infected with human immunodeficiency virus with low bone mineral density for age [^114juBHX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and low bone mineral density (BMD) may be at higher risk of osteoporosis and fractures later in life compared to their uninfected peers. Bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to reduce fractures in adults with osteoporosis but has not been formally studied in youths living with HIV.

- **Methods**: Fifty-two children and adolescents (aged 11–24 years) perinatally infected with HIV with low lumbar spine (LS) BMD (Z score < -2.0) were randomized to alendronate versus placebo, stratified by males (n = 25) and females (n = 27). Vitamin D and calcium were provided in both groups. The endpoint analysis used the truncated normal distribution to impute missing endpoints.

- **Results**: Mean treatment difference at 48 weeks was 13% (95% confidence interval, 8%-18%) in favor of alendronate (P < .001). No serious adverse events were linked to the treatment, and compliance was consistently high (> 99%). No cases of jaw osteonecrosis, atrial fibrillation, or nonhealing fractures were reported. Mean increases (95% confidence interval) in LS BMD over 48 weeks were significantly larger on alendronate (20% [14%-25%]) than placebo (7% [5%-9%]) [P < .001]. Similar improvements were seen for whole body BMD.

- **Conclusions**: In this small study of children and adolescents perinatally infected with HIV with low LS BMD, 48 weeks of alendronate was well-tolerated and showed no safety concerns.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^1166reiW]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is often not clinically recognized until following a fracture occurs. Individuals who have one fracture are at increased risk of future fractures. Prompt initiation of osteoporosis treatment following a fracture is critical to reducing the rate of future fractures. Antiresorptives are the most widely used class of medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Many providers are hesitant to initiate antiresorptives in the acute post-fracture period due to concerns about interference with bone remodeling necessary for successful fracture healing, which could cause increased rates of non-union, malunion, and refracture. While such concerns should not extend to anabolic medications, physicians may also hesitate to initiate anabolic osteoporosis therapies due to high cost and/or lack of familiarity. This article aims to briefly review the available data and present a digestible narrative summary to familiarize practicing orthopaedic surgeons with the essential details of the published research on this topic.

- **Results**: The results of 20 clinical studies and key pre-clinical studies related to the effect of anti-resorptive medications for osteoporosis on fracture healing are summarized in the body of this narrative review.

- **Discussion & conclusions**: While few level I studies have examined the impact of timing of initiation of osteoporosis medications in the acute post-fracture period, the few that have been published do not support these concerns. Specifically, data from level I clinical trials indicate that initiating bisphosphonates as early as two weeks post-fracture is not detrimental to fracture healing.

### Ibandronate sodium [^111b7RU8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The mechanism of action of ibandronate on bone tissue is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.

Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis indicative of vertebral fracture. While osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, it is most common among women following menopause. In healthy humans, bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone. In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture. After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases; approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture during their remaining lifetimes.

Ibandronate sodium produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation, such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked C-telopeptide of type I collagen, in once-monthly doses from 100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women.

### Comparative fracture risk during osteoporosis drug holidays after long-term risedronate versus alendronate therapy: A propensity score-matched cohort study [^115AwEDm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An osteoporosis drug holiday is recommended for most patients after 3 to 5 years of therapy. Risedronate has a shorter half-life than alendronate, and thus the residual length of fracture protection may be shorter.

- **Objective**: To examine the comparative risks of drug holidays after long-term (≥ 3 years) risedronate versus alendronate therapy.

- **Design**: Population-based, matched cohort study.

- **Setting**: Province-wide healthcare administrative databases providing comprehensive coverage to Ontario residents aged 65 years or older between November 2000 and March 2020.

- **Patients**: Persons aged 66 years or older who had long-term risedronate therapy and a drug holiday were matched 1:1 on propensity scores to those who had long-term alendronate therapy and a drug holiday.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was hip fracture within 3 years following a 120-day ascertainment period. Secondary analyses included shorter follow-up and sex-specific estimates. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for fracture risk between groups.

- **Results**: A total of 25,077 propensity score-matched pairs were eligible (mean age, 81 years; 81% women). Hip fracture rates were higher among risedronate than alendronate drug holidays (12.4 and 10.6 events, respectively, per 1000 patient-years; HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.04 to 1.34]; 915 total hip fractures). The association was attenuated when any fracture was included as the outcome (HR, 1.07 [CI, 1.00 to 1.16]) and with shorter drug holidays (1 year: HR, 1.03 [CI, 0.85 to 1.24]; 2 years: HR, 1.14 [CI, 0.96 to 1.32]).

### Ibandronate sodium [^115NdYRg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Quarterly intravenous injection

The effectiveness and safety of ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months were demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, multinational, noninferiority study in 1358 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis (L2 to L4 lumbar spine BMD, T-score below -2.5 SD at baseline). The control group received ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablets. The primary efficacy parameter was the relative change from baseline to 1 year of treatment in lumbar spine BMD, which was compared between the intravenous injection and the daily oral treatment groups. All patients received 400 international units of vitamin D and 500 mg of calcium supplementation per day.

- **Effect on BMD**: In the intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy analysis, the least-squares mean increase at 1 year in lumbar spine BMD in patients (n = 429) treated with ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months (4.5%) was statistically superior to that in patients (n = 434) treated with daily oral tablets (3.5%). The mean difference between groups was 1.1% (95% confidence interval: 0.5%, 1.6%; p < 0.001; see Figure 1). The mean increase from baseline in total hip BMD at 1 year was 2.1% in the ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months group and 1.5% in the ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablet group. Consistently higher BMD increases at the femoral neck and trochanter were also observed following ibandronate sodium injection 3 mg once every 3 months compared to ibandronate sodium tablets 2.5 mg (ibandronate) daily oral tablet.
