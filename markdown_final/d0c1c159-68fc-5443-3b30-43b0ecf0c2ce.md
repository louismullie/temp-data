## Question

Management of the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins in hospitalized patients. Diagnosis according to tests and guidelines.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management and diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to varicose veins in hospitalized patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and resuscitation. Then, I should verify pre-endoscopic pharmacologic therapy and antibiotics. Next, I will consider timing and preparation for endoscopy. After that, I need to review endoscopic diagnosis and definitive hemostasis by variceal type. Then, I should confirm post-endoscopic management, including vasoactive therapy duration and secondary prophylaxis. Finally, I will examine rescue strategies for refractory bleeding and special populations, and close with quality metrics and a concise algorithm summary, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, and circulation come first, with two large-bore IVs or central access, aggressive crystalloid resuscitation, and early airway protection if there is massive hematemesis or altered mental status, because aspiration risk is high and sedation for endoscopy may be unsafe otherwise [^38c9748d] [^425b58ed].

> Wait, let me verify the transfusion thresholds before I commit to a number. In hemodynamically stable patients without cardiovascular disease, a restrictive strategy with transfusion at hemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dL and a post-transfusion target of 7–9 g/dL is recommended; in those with significant cardiovascular disease, a higher threshold around 8–9 g/dL is reasonable, and overtransfusion should be avoided given risks of worsening portal hypertension and rebleeding in cirrhosis [^80b95f2f] [^e5c0fff9] [^38c9748d].

> I need to check coagulation management carefully. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about correcting INR in cirrhosis; routine fresh frozen plasma is not recommended because it does not reliably improve hemostasis and may worsen portal hypertension, and platelet transfusion is generally reserved for active bleeding with platelets < 50 × 10⁹/L, with decisions individualized rather than driven by INR alone [^e3581209] [^49c1620a].

> Next, I should review pre-endoscopic pharmacologic therapy. Vasoactive agents should be started as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected, ideally before endoscopy, and continued for 2–5 days after initial hemostasis; octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin are acceptable, with terlipressin or octreotide commonly used and octreotide favored by some for its safety profile, and all reduce portal pressure and improve control of bleeding [^0efe0eb2] [^e3581209] [^e203ff85].

> I should confirm antibiotic prophylaxis. All patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding should receive prophylactic antibiotics, with ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily for up to 5–7 days as first-line given its superiority to norfloxacin and the risk of infections including SBP; antibiotics can be discontinued once bleeding is controlled and there is no active infection [^e3581209] [^07f406a1].

> Now, timing and preparation for endoscopy. Let me think about the optimal window: most high-quality guidance recommends upper endoscopy within 12 hours of presentation once the patient is hemodynamically stabilized, with erythromycin 250 mg IV 30–120 minutes pre-procedure to improve visualization; unstable patients should proceed immediately after resuscitation, and delays beyond 24 hours are associated with worse outcomes in variceal bleeding [^07f406a1] [^e3581209] [^38c9748d].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic objectives during endoscopy. The goals are to identify the bleeding source, classify variceal type using the Sarin system, and document active versus recent bleeding; for esophageal varices, band ligation is the preferred endoscopic therapy, whereas for gastric varices, cyanoacrylate injection is first-line, with band ligation reserved for GOV1-type lesions that behave like esophageal varices [^07f406a1] [^8ade08dc].

> Let me consider post-endoscopic management next. Vasoactive therapy should be continued for a total of 2–5 days to prevent early rebleeding, and patients should be monitored in a high-acuity setting given the risk of early rebleeding and decompensation; secondary prophylaxis with nonselective beta-blockers should be initiated once hemostasis is achieved, and endoscopic eradication sessions for esophageal varices should be scheduled at 1–4 week intervals until obliteration, followed by surveillance endoscopy [^e3581209] [^07f406a1] [^dba090fa].

> But wait, what if bleeding recurs or is refractory to standard therapy. I should double-check rescue options: balloon tamponade or a self-expandable esophageal stent can temporize uncontrolled esophageal variceal bleeding, while definitive rescue with TIPS is indicated for failure of endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy; early pre-emptive TIPS within 72 hours, preferably within 24 hours, should be considered in high-risk patients such as Child-Pugh C or Child-Pugh B with active bleeding, as it reduces rebleeding and improves survival in selected cohorts [^1b78223c] [^656eacbb] [^07f406a1].

> For gastric varices, I need to ensure I am precise. If cyanoacrylate injection fails or is not feasible, TIPS or BRTO are appropriate rescue strategies, with TIPS particularly effective for fundal varices; multidisciplinary discussion with interventional radiology is essential to tailor therapy based on anatomy and local expertise, and TIPS may be complemented by variceal embolization to reduce encephalopathy and rebleeding in selected cases [^3a1156dc] [^f5eae56f] [^433dbb32].

> Let me reconsider special populations and settings. In resource-limited environments, mortality from variceal bleeding remains high due to delays in resuscitation, antibiotics, vasoactive therapy, and endoscopy; implementing standardized bundles and transfer pathways to centers with TIPS capability can mitigate this, and using simple clinical decision tools like APRI may help early identification of variceal etiology to trigger guideline-concordant therapy while awaiting endoscopy [^83a86fb7] [^c2725477].

> I should confirm quality metrics to track performance. Key indicators include antibiotic administration within 24 hours, endoscopy within 12 hours for suspected variceal bleeding, and vasoactive therapy initiation within 12 hours; adherence to these process measures correlates with improved outcomes and should be embedded into local protocols and audits [^e3581209] [^07f406a1].

> In summary, I need to ensure the algorithm is coherent: stabilize with restrictive transfusion and airway protection, start vasoactive therapy and ceftriaxone immediately, perform endoscopy within 12 hours with erythromycin prep, achieve hemostasis with EVL for esophageal varices and cyanoacrylate for gastric varices, continue vasoactive therapy for 2–5 days, initiate NSBB and schedule eradication for secondary prophylaxis, and escalate to rescue TIPS or BRTO if bleeding persists or recurs, with all steps coordinated by a multidisciplinary team in a high-acuity setting [^e3581209] [^07f406a1] [^656eacbb].

---

Upper GI bleeding from varices is a **life-threatening emergency** [^e3581209] requiring rapid diagnosis and coordinated care. The cornerstone is **early upper endoscopy within 12–24 hours** [^07f406a1] [^e3581209] to confirm the diagnosis and enable definitive endoscopic therapy, with pre-endoscopic vasoactive drugs and antibiotics started immediately when variceal bleeding is suspected [^0efe0eb2] [^e3581209]. Risk stratification with Child-Pugh and MELD guides urgency and disposition, and restrictive transfusion (hemoglobin 7–8 g/dL) is essential to avoid worsening portal hypertension [^80b95f2f] [^e3581209]. Management is multidisciplinary, with ICU-level monitoring, serial hemoglobin checks, and readiness for rescue TIPS if endoscopic therapy fails [^72036f19] [^656eacbb].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

Immediate priorities are **airway, breathing, and circulation** [^425b58ed]; intubate for massive hematemesis or altered mentation, establish two large-bore IVs or central access, and begin crystalloid resuscitation [^38c9748d]. Apply a **restrictive transfusion strategy** (transfuse at hemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dL, target 7–9 g/dL) unless there is significant cardiovascular disease, to limit portal pressure and rebleeding risk [^80b95f2f] [^e3581209]. Correct coagulopathy only if actively bleeding and guided by fibrinogen and clinical context; avoid routine FFP or platelets solely for abnormal labs [^e3581209] [^49c1620a].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should determine **hemodynamic stability**, quantify bleeding severity, and identify cirrhosis risk factors (alcohol, viral hepatitis, NASH) and prior variceal bleeding or endoscopic therapy [^425b58ed]. Risk stratify using **Child-Pugh and MELD** to predict mortality and guide urgency and level of care [^07f406a1] [^dfda3145].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count**: Baseline and serial hemoglobin/hematocrit.
- **Coagulation profile**: PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen.
- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin.
- **Renal function**: Creatinine, BUN (BUN:creatinine ratio > 36 suggests UGIB) [^425b58ed].
- **Type and crossmatch**: Minimum 4–6 units PRBCs.
- **Additional tests**: Consider ammonia if encephalopathy is suspected.

---

### Imaging

Imaging is generally not required acutely; **portal vein Doppler** may be considered if portal vein thrombosis is suspected or to guide TIPS planning [^notfound].

---

## Timing and role of endoscopy

Endoscopy should be performed **within 12–24 hours** after stabilization, with a goal of **within 12 hours** for high-risk patients (Child-Pugh C, active bleeding, hemodynamic instability) [^07f406a1] [^e3581209]. Pre-endoscopic erythromycin 250 mg IV 30–120 minutes prior improves visualization and reduces need for repeat endoscopy [^07f406a1] [^e3581209]. Endoscopy confirms the diagnosis, classifies varices (Sarin), and enables definitive hemostasis [^8ade08dc].

---

## Endoscopic diagnosis and classification

During endoscopy, identify the **bleeding source** and classify varices using the **Sarin classification** to guide therapy:

| **Variceal type** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| GOV1 | Esophageal varices extending to the lesser curve of the stomach |
| GOV2 | Esophageal varices extending to the fundus |
| IGV1 | Isolated gastric fundal varices |
| IGV2 | Isolated ectopic varices (e.g. duodenal) |

---

## Definitive endoscopic therapy

- **Esophageal varices**: Band ligation (EVL) is first-line; sclerotherapy is rarely used [^07f406a1] [^e3581209].
- **Gastric varices**: Cyanoacrylate (tissue adhesive) injection is first-line; band ligation may be used for GOV1 [^07f406a1] [^5a7390da].
- **Failure of endoscopy**: Consider balloon tamponade or self-expandable esophageal stent as bridge to rescue therapy [^1b78223c].

---

## Pharmacological management

Start **vasoactive agents immediately** when variceal bleeding is suspected and continue for 2–5 days after hemostasis: terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin are acceptable, with terlipressin or octreotide commonly used [^0efe0eb2] [^e3581209]. Initiate **antibiotic prophylaxis** with ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily for up to 5–7 days to reduce infection, rebleeding, and mortality [^07f406a1] [^e3581209]. Proton pump inhibitors are not routinely indicated unless there is concomitant ulcer disease; if used, discontinue once variceal source is confirmed [^e3581209] [^b192527d].

---

## Monitoring and post-endoscopic care

- **Observation**: ICU or step-down monitoring for 24–48 hours given high rebleeding risk.
- **Serial hemoglobin**: Every 4–6 hours initially.
- **Rebleeding surveillance**: Watch for hematemesis, melena, hemodynamic instability, or drop in hemoglobin > 2 g/dL.
- **Secondary prophylaxis**: Start nonselective beta-blockers (propranolol or carvedilol) and schedule EVL eradication sessions for esophageal varices [^07f406a1] [^e3581209].

---

## Rescue therapies for refractory bleeding

If endoscopic therapy fails, **rescue TIPS** is indicated for refractory variceal bleeding or high-risk patients (Child-Pugh C or B with active bleeding), ideally within 24–72 hours [^07f406a1] [^656eacbb]. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (**BRTO**) is an alternative for gastric varices when TIPS is contraindicated or unavailable [^3a1156dc] [^656eacbb]. Surgical shunting is rarely used and reserved for selected cases with preserved liver function and no access to TIPS [^a1f49f82].

---

## Special considerations

In **Child-Pugh C** patients, consider early TIPS and discuss transplant referral [^07f406a1] [^656eacbb]. For **anticoagulation**, reverse warfarin or DOACs if life-threatening bleeding; coordinate resumption with the treating team [^e17e7416]. In **resource-limited settings**, prioritize resuscitation, vasoactives, antibiotics, and transfer for endoscopy/TIPS when feasible [^83a86fb7].

---

## Quality metrics and outcomes

Key quality indicators include **endoscopy within 12–24 hours**, **antibiotics within 24 hours**, and **vasoactive therapy within 12 hours**. Six-week mortality remains 10–20% despite advances, underscoring the need for adherence to guidelines and early definitive therapy [^e3581209] [^bc1be903].

---

Early endoscopy with **definitive endoscopic therapy**, combined with vasoactive drugs, antibiotics, and restrictive transfusion, is the backbone of care; **multidisciplinary coordination** and readiness for rescue TIPS are essential to reduce rebleeding and mortality.

Guidelines from national and international professional societies on upper gastrointestinal bleeding highlight the important clinical issues but do not always identify specific management strategies pertaining to individual patients. Optimal treatment should consider the personal needs of an individual patient and the pertinent resources and experience available at the point of care. This article integrates international guidelines and consensus into three stages of management: pre-endoscopic assessment and treatment, endoscopic evaluation and haemostasis and postendoscopic management. We emphasise the need for personalised management strategies based on patient characteristics, nature of bleeding lesions and the clinical setting including available resources.

Figure 2
Comparison of mortality and further bleeding between urgent (< 6 h) versus early (6–24 h) endoscopy in patients with high risk gastrointestinal bleeding (Glasgow Blatchford Score ≥ 12)

Although current evidence does not appear to support urgent endoscopy at less than 6 h, some variceal bleeding guidelines advise that endoscopy should be performed at between 12 h and 24 h. Exact timing of endoscopy can be challenging and should be decided on the basis of thorough clinical assessment, including haemodynamics and underlying comorbidities. Appropriate resuscitation and optimisation of comorbidities is essential before endoscopy.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^426881b7]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7–8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management. Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 h of presentation for patients admitted to hospital, although optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high risk lesions and use of subsequent high dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal haemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Oesophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Recurrent bleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^82b0cb02]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The mainstays of therapy include prompt resuscitation, early risk stratification, and appropriate access to endoscopy. Patients with high-risk endoscopic findings should receive endoscopic hemostasis with a modality of established efficacy. The pillar of post-endoscopic therapy is acid-suppression via proton pump inhibitors (PPI), although the optimal dose and route of administration are still unclear. Post-discharge management of patients with peptic ulcers includes standard oral PPI treatment and eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection. The risk of recurrent bleeding should be carefully considered and appropriate gastroprotection should be offered when non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-platelet agents, and/or anticoagulation need to be used. This review seeks to survey new evidence in the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding that has emerged in the past 3 years and put it into context with recommendations from recent practice guidelines.

Introduction

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (NVUGIB) is a common emergency, affecting 44 to 99 per 100,000 persons every year. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the principal cause of NVUGIB. Significant bleeding can result in major consequences, such as acute coronary syndromes. The mortality from NVUGIB remains high. A recent UK national audit found a 9.6% in-hospital mortality rate. Recurrence of bleeding occurs in 8–26% of patients, and is associated with an even higher mortality. Mortality is also increased in the elderly.

Such a serious disease inspires constant research in the hope of decreasing complications and mortality. A number of practice guidelines have been developed to help clinicians manage patients with NVUGIB, including those issued by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), an International Consensus meeting, and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Of note, the Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology held a national consensus meeting on NVUGIB in Athens on June 8, 2008; the recommendations have not been published, but were remarkably similar to the International Consensus recommendations that were formed a few months later. The principle components of management include resuscitation, risk-stratification, endoscopy for diagnosis and appropriate intervention, and post-endoscopic acid-suppression. All of these factors are the subject of constant revision and rigorous testing to improve outcomes and, in the last three years in particular, the literature has grown considerably. This review serves to survey the most recent evidence to emerge in the management of NVUGIB and put in into context with recommendations from the recent practice guidelines.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^143e43db]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of bleeding gastric varices (GV) presents a unique challenge for patients with portal hypertension. Despite over thirty years of diagnostic and treatment advances standardized practices for bleeding GV are lacking and unsupported by adequate evidence. There are no definitive natural history studies to help with risk assessment or prospective clinical trials to guide clinical decision making. Available literature on the natural history and management of gastric varices consists of case series, restricted cohort studies, and a few small randomized trials, all of which have significant selection biases. This review summarizes the available data and recommendations based on expert opinion on how best to diagnose and manage bleeding from gastric varices. Table 1 summarizes our recommendations.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^6c42803a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varies, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of the underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause for gastric variceal bleeding, occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in noncirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^ad90db82]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — conclusions on bleeding gastric varices emphasize that bleeding GV is a rare complication of portal hypertension but is typically more severe with higher mortality than other portal hypertension bleeding. The diagnostic and treatment algorithms of bleeding GV are complex and require a multidisciplinary team approach to management, often at a tertiary care center where multiple options for therapy are available. Given the heterogeneity of prior research and lack of uniform definitions or standardized outcomes in this field, it is difficult to provide strong, evidence-based recommendations. Large studies to define the natural history of GV, risk factors for bleeding, and optimal diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are needed to improve understanding and management of this condition.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^b192527d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of acute variceal hemorrhage

Acute VH is a life-threatening emergency which, despite therapeutic advances in the past decade, continues to have a high 6-week mortality rate of up to 20%. Overall, the current approach is a multimodal strategy aiming to control the acute bleeding, prevent rebleeding, and decrease 6-week mortality rate, which is the main treatment outcome by consensus. The management consists of the following steps (Figure 3):

(a) Adequate resuscitation. Proper intravenous access and intubation in patients with massive hematemesis for airway protection.
(b) Transfusion of red blood cells using a restrictive strategy meaning initiating transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dl and maintaining a goal of 7–9 g/dl. This approach had lower rebleeding and mortality rates, especially in those with CTP A and B when compared with a more liberal approach.
(c) Short-term administration of prophylactic antibiotics. RCTs have showed the use of prophylactic antibiotics that lead to significantly lower rates of infection, death, and early rebleeding. Intravenous ceftriaxone proved to be more effective than oral norfloxacin, and given the higher rates of quinolone resistant organisms and discontinuation of norfloxacin use in the United States, IV ceftriaxone for 5–7 days is the recommended choice. It is important to note that an initial infection, especially spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, could have led to the VH in the first place, therefore ideally, diagnostic paracentesis should be done before administering prophylactic antibiotics.
(d) Intravenous infusion of splanchnic vasoactive medications such as octreotide, somatostatin, or terlipressin to be continued for 5 days. The use of these agents has been associated with lower 7-day all-cause mortality and lower transfusion requirements. Any available agent can be used as no difference in controlled bleeding, rebleeding, or mortality rate was identified in a noninferiority trial.
(e) Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is not recommended as it will not correct coagulopathy and may lead to volume overload and worsening of portal hypertension.
(f) IV proton pump inhibitors can be initiated when a patient presents with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, they should not be continued once a variceal source is identified, unless there is a strict indication to continue them.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting 36 to 48 per 100,000 persons annually. Aggressive resuscitation and upper endoscopy remain the cornerstones of therapy; however, in cases refractory to endoscopic diagnosis and management, radiology plays an increasingly vital and often lifesaving role, thanks to improvements in both imaging and interventional techniques. The various etiologies of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are discussed along with specific management recommendations based on an extensive literature review of current radiographic methods.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices, but are associated with an increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial because of the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

AGA best practice advice — initial evaluation and stabilization of bleeding gastric varices (GV) state that endoscopic classification systems for the appearance of GV should not be used for purposes of guiding primary prophylaxis of GV bleeding, and initial medical management of bleeding GV should be performed according to current practice guidelines for portal hypertensive bleeding. Goals of initial endoscopic evaluation include identification of the bleeding source and classification of the variceal bleeding site, and initial therapy for bleeding GV should focus on acute hemostasis for hemodynamic stabilization with a plan for further diagnostic evaluation and/or transfer to a tertiary care center with expertise in GV management. Following initial endoscopic hemostasis, cross-sectional (MR or CT) imaging with portal venous contrast phase should be obtained to determine vascular anatomy, including the presence or absence of portosystemic shunts and gastrorenal shunts, and determination of definitive therapy for bleeding GV should be made based upon endoscopic appearance, underlying vascular anatomy, presence of comorbid portal hypertensive complications, and available local resources, ideally via a multidisciplinary discussion between the gastroenterologist or hepatologist and the interventional radiologist.

1: ESGE recommends that patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD; due to viruses, alcohol, and/or nonobese [BMI < 30kg/m²] nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) and clinically significant portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] > 10mmHg and/or liver stiffness by transient elastography > 25 kPa) should receive, if no contraindications, nonselective beta blocker (NSBB) therapy (preferably carvedilol) to prevent the development of variceal bleeding. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 2: ESGE recommends that in those patients unable to receive NSBB therapy with a screening upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy that demonstrates high risk esophageal varices, endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the endoscopic prophylactic treatment of choice. EBL should be repeated every 2–4 weeks until variceal eradication is achieved. Thereafter, surveillance EGD should be performed every 3–6 months in the first year following eradication. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 3: ESGE recommends, in hemodynamically stable patients with acute upper GI hemorrhage (UGIH) and no history of cardiovascular disease, a restrictive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion strategy, with a hemoglobin threshold of ≤ 70g/L prompting RBC transfusion. A post-transfusion target hemoglobin of 70-90g/L is desired. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 4: ESGE recommends that patients with ACLD presenting with suspected acute variceal bleeding be risk stratified according to the Child-Pugh score and MELD score, and by documentation of active/inactive bleeding at the time of upper GI endoscopy. Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence. 5: ESGE recommends the vasoactive agents terlipressin, octreotide, or somatostatin be initiated at the time of presentation in patients with suspected acute variceal bleeding and be continued for a duration of up to 5 days. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 6: ESGE recommends antibiotic prophylaxis using ceftriaxone 1g/day for up to 7 days for all patients with ACLD presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, or in accordance with local antibiotic resistance and patient allergies. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 7: ESGE recommends, in the absence of contraindications, intravenous erythromycin 250mg be given 30–120 minutes prior to upper GI endoscopy in patients with suspected acute variceal hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 8: ESGE recommends that, in patients with suspected variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic evaluation should take place within 12 hours from the time of patient presentation provided the patient has been hemodynamically resuscitated. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 9: ESGE recommends EBL for the treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH). Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 10: ESGE recommends that, in patients at high risk for recurrent esophageal variceal bleeding following successful endoscopic hemostasis (Child-Pugh C ≤ 13 or Child-Pugh B > 7 with active EVH at the time of endoscopy despite vasoactive agents, or HVPG > 20mmHg), pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) within 72 hours (preferably within 24 hours) must be considered. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 11: ESGE recommends that, for persistent esophageal variceal bleeding despite vasoactive pharmacological and endoscopic hemostasis therapy, urgent rescue TIPS should be considered (where available). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 12: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection for acute gastric (cardiofundal) variceal (GOV2, IGV1) hemorrhage. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. 13: ESGE recommends endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection or EBL in patients with GOV1-specific bleeding. Strong recommendations, moderate quality evidence. 14: ESGE suggests urgent rescue TIPS or balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for gastric variceal bleeding when there is a failure of endoscopic hemostasis or early recurrent bleeding. Weak recommendation, low quality evidence. 15: ESGE recommends that patients who have undergone EBL for acute EVH should be scheduled for follow-up EBLs at 1- to 4-weekly intervals to eradicate esophageal varices (secondary prophylaxis). Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. 16: ESGE recommends the use of NSBBs (propranolol or carvedilol) in combination with endoscopic therapy for secondary prophylaxis in EVH in patients with ACLD. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence.

Variceal bleeding

Bleeding from gastro-oesophageal varices is a life threatening consequence of portal hypertension. Despite both drug and endotherapeutic advances, six week mortality following a variceal bleed is approximately 20%. First described in 1988, variceal band ligation has long replaced sclerotherapy as the optimal endoscopic management for oesophageal variceal bleeding due to a superior reduction in both rebleeding and mortality.

Gastric variceal bleeding is less common, but associated with poorer outcomes than oesophageal variceal bleeding. The recommended treatment modality advocated by guidelines is dependent on the anatomical location and relationship with any oesophageal varices. The Sarin classification is a useful tool to assess gastric varices and guide endoscopic treatment. Bleeding gastric varices continuous with oesophageal varices extending 2–5 cm along the lesser curve of the stomach can be managed with band ligation, with other types of gastric varices managed with injection of tissue glue or thrombin.

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults: evaluation and… [^425b58ed]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

23 Physicians should inquire about prior upper GI bleeding, history of coagulopathy, and use of antithrombotics, NSAIDs, or SSRIs. To assess the risk of cirrhosis and variceal bleeding, physicians should inquire about prior liver disease, viral hepatitis, and alcohol use. Physical examination includes assessment of hemodynamic stability, presence of abdominal pain or rebound tenderness, and examination of stool color. Initial Evaluation and Stabilization The initial evaluation includes a complete history, examination, and laboratory evaluation. The goal of the initial evaluation is to determine the severity of the bleeding, to identify the possible source of bleeding, and to guide management decisions, such as hospitalization, transfusion, and diagnostic testing. 3 Patients should maintain "nothing by mouth" orders while being evaluated.

Laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, coagulation panel, liver tests, and type and screen. 23 Measurement of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be repeated based on the severity of the upper GI bleeding, clinical judgment, and hemodynamic stability. 23 A blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio greater than 36 is suggestive of upper GI bleeding when distinguishing it from lower GI bleeding. 23 In patients with significant upper GI bleeding, place two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters and a bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer solution to correct hypovolemia and to maintain blood pressure because tachycardia and hypotension may be signs of significant blood loss. 23 Regular monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry is necessary during resuscitation and stabilization. Endotracheal intubation may be necessary to protect the airway in patients with significant and ongoing bleeding.

3 Management of patients with life-threatening bleeding warranting intensive monitoring is beyond the scope of this article. Treatments ENDOSCOPY Patients with hemodynamic instability and signs of upper GI bleeding should be offered urgent endoscopy after fluid resuscitation and stabilization. PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS Proton pump inhibitors should be started upon presentation with upper GI bleeding. Once-daily proton pump inhibitor therapy should be continued for four to eight weeks in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. In patients with peptic ulcer bleeding, the benefits of proton pump inhibitor therapy outweigh the risks. 3.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (Figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

### Complications of diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: common and rare-recognition, assessment and management [^c532ca8a]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Bleeding

Minor bleeding is not uncommon after taking mucosal biopsies but this is almost always self-limiting and requires no therapy. The risk of clinically significant bleeding after diagnostic upper GI endoscopy is exceedingly low, even in the setting of taking multiple biopsies. There are rare case reports of bleeding after biopsy, and as such this should be included in pre-procedure consent (box 2). The ability of the endoscopist to confidently diagnose lesions optically is important to prevent avoidable bleeding, for example recognition of vascular lesions such as varices or angioectasia to avoid unnecessary and potentially dangerous biopsying. Guidelines provide advice for performing endoscopy in patients taking anti-platelets and anticoagulants, including direct acting oral anticoagulants. It should be borne in mind that there is a small increased risk of post procedure bleeding for patients taking such drugs.

Treatment of bleeding

The management of iatrogenic postendoscopy bleeding includes general resuscitative measures, and correction of any identified coagulopathy with appropriate blood products. Often conservative management is sufficient, however, in the context of bleeding after a diagnostic endoscopy, a repeat endoscopy may be appropriate if there is continued bleeding. Patients who are taking antiplatelets or anticoagulants may require specific reversal agents and liaison with haematology, detailed recommendations are covered in BSG guidelines.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^49c1620a]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Platelets and clotting factors

Limited evidence exists regarding the need, or threshold, for platelet transfusion in UGIB. The British Society of Gastroenterology consensus bundle advises a threshold of transfusion at 50×10⁹ platelets/L or less based on major haemorrhage protocols with the acknowledgment that this advice is based primarily on expert opinion. Within the context of variceal bleeding, no evidence suggests that platelet count correlates with inability to control bleeding or rebleeding. However, in the event of these outcomes, the Baveno VII consensus advises correction can be considered on an individual basis, whereas the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and British Society of Gastroenterology variceal guidelines advise transfusion at the threshold of 50×10⁹/L or less.

Clotting abnormalities and their management in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB is a complex area. Prothrombin time is often prolonged leading to the use of fresh frozen plasma; however, prothrombin is not an accurate indicator of the clotting risk in cirrhosis. Studies have not shown a clear benefit from fresh frozen plasma and the most recent iteration of US variceal guidelines did not advocate its use in patients with cirrhosis and UGIB.

Pre-endoscopic approach and management

Resuscitation

All management guidelines recommend prompt assessment of hemodynamic status and resuscitation if required. Generally, the guidelines agree that red blood cell transfusions should be administered to patients whose hemoglobin levels drop to 70 g/L or less. In 2010, Heamshaw et al published a prospective cohort study assessing outcomes in patients who received blood transfusions within 12 h of presentation. They found that, regardless of the initial hemoglobin level (greater than or less than 80 g/L), the rates of rebleeding were higher in those who received early transfusion. The odds ratio (OR) for rebleeding was 2.26, adjusted for Rockall score and initial hemoglobin level. Mortality at 30 days was greater in those receiving transfusion, but not significantly so when adjusted for initial hemoglobin level and Rockall score. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had shown comparable results, but these were performed over a decade ago when appropriate endoscopic hemostasis was not offered in all high-risk patients.

However, a more recent RCT on this topic was published by Villanueva et al who randomized 921 patients (bleeding peptic ulcer 48%, variceal bleeding 24%) with upper GI bleeding to either a restrictive (transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 70 g/L) or liberal (transfuse at a hemoglobin level of 90 g/L) transfusion strategy. The patients were treated according to current standards of care with regards to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment and endoscopic hemostasis. Patients treated with the restrictive strategy had significantly lower mortality at 45 days [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.92], less rebleeding, and experienced fewer overall adverse events. These findings attracted high publicity but should be interpreted with caution because of high risk of performance bias (due to lack of blinding) and limited generalizability (many potentially eligible patients were either not screened or excluded for reasons such as "massive" bleeding or severe comorbidity). Furthermore, the subgroup analyses on peptic ulcer bleeding versus variceal bleeding, albeit important, were underpowered; therefore, no conclusion could be drawn specifically for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.

For over 60 years, diagnostic and interventional radiology have been heavily involved in the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding. For patients who present with upper GI bleeding and have a contraindication to endoscopy or have an unsuccessful attempt at endoscopy for identifying or controlling the bleeding, interventional radiology is often consulted for evaluation and consideration of catheter-based intervention.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^72b25997]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Acute variceal haemorrhage refractory to endoscopic and pharmacological treatments, where TIPSS is usually indicated, must be managed with appropriate resources. TIPSS is an established interventional treatment for refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage. It remains a highly specialised procedure, requiring adequate training and experience. Knowledge of the relevant equipment, anatomy and how to deal with any complications is essential. It should therefore be performed in centres with adequate personnel, multidisciplinary support and equipment required to optimise management and minimise risks. Regional centres with easily accessible interventional radiology services are generally best equipped to perform this procedure. Setting up regional agreements and pathways to allow transfer of appropriate patients to hospitals that undertake TIPSS procedures is an important step. These pathways could also be used to provide emergency endoscopic management if necessary due to problems with out-of-hours endoscopic cover in smaller hospitals. This model referred to as "spoke and wheel" or network model, is well established for other complex procedures and helps to expedite and streamline the process. In the NCEPOD report 'Measuring the units' just 15% of hospitals had on-site access to TIPSS, while 72% had access to TIPSS in other centres.

There have been significant efforts to address the need to improve the upper GI bleeding (UGIB) service. A toolkit was produced in collaboration with BSG; Association of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgeons (AUGIS); Royal Colleges of Physicians, Radiology and Nursing; and Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. The key nine service standards recommended by the document are detailed below:
There will be a nominated individual with the authority to ensure implementation by the contracted provider.
Contracted providers will ensure the minimum service is adequately resourced.
All patients with suspected UGIB should be properly assessed and their risk scored on presentation.
All patients should be resuscitated before therapeutic intervention.
All high-risk patients with UGIB should be endoscoped within 24 h, preferably on a planned list in the first instance.
For patients who require more urgent intervention either for endoscopy, interventional radiology or surgery formal 24/7 arrangements must be available.
The necessary team, meeting an agreed competency level, should be available throughout the complete patient pathway.
Each stage of the patient pathway should be carried out in an area with 'appropriate' facilities, equipment and support including staff experienced in the management of UGIB.
All hospitals must collect a minimum dataset in order to measure service provision against auditable outcomes (case-mix adjusted as appropriate).

In a randomized trial of high-risk upper gastrointestinal bleeding defined by Glasgow-Blatchford score ≥ 12, patients were assigned to urgent (within 6 hours) or early (the next morning and within 24 hours) endoscopy after consultation occurring on average 7–8 hours after presentation; urgent endoscopy was not associated with lower 30-day mortality than endoscopy performed the following morning between 6 and 24 hours after consultation.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^e5c0fff9]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial medical management and antithrombotic considerations: Target hemoglobin is generally 9 g/dL in patients with significant cardiovascular disease and 7 g/dL for all others, and the consensus recommendation was for blood transfusion for hemoglobin levels < 8 g/dL with a threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be administered to all patients with suspected NVUGIB and should not delay endoscopic intervention, and high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors should be continued post endoscopy because their use is associated with decreased risk of rebleeding. The need for reversal of antithrombotic medications requires careful consideration of the risks of thromboembolic events, these decisions should be made by the gastroenterologist in consultation with intensivists, cardiologists, neurologists, and hematologists, and when there is doubt, it is usually better to err on the side of not reversing AT medication because a cardiopulmonary or neurologic thromboembolic event is usually far more devastating than ongoing NVUGIB.

### Consensus recommendations for managing patients with nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^f4d85d3b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding has evolved substantially over the past 10 years amid a paucity of published consensus guidelines.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based management recommendations that address clinically relevant issues. REVIEW AND CONSENSUS PROCESSES: A multidisciplinary consensus group of 25 voting participants representing 11 national societies used a 7-step approach to develop recommendation statements according to accepted standards. Sources of data included narrative and systematic reviews as well as published and new meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence, the strength of the recommendation, and the level of consensus were graded according to recognized classifications.

Main Findings

Recommendations emphasize appropriate initial resuscitation of the patient and a multidisciplinary approach to clinical risk stratification that determines the need for early endoscopy. Early endoscopy allows safe and prompt discharge of selected patients classified as low risk. Endoscopic hemostasis is reserved for patients with high-risk endoscopic lesions. Although monotherapy with injection or thermal coagulation is effective, the combination is superior to either treatment alone. The placement of endoscopic clips for endoscopic hemostasis appears promising. High-dose intravenous proton-pump inhibition is recommended in patients who have undergone successful endoscopic therapy. Routine second-look endoscopy is not recommended. Patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding should be tested for Helicobacter pylori infection and receive eradication therapy if infection is present.

Future Directions

The efficacy of newer endoscopic therapeutic technologies, the optimal regimen of proton-pump inhibition, and the roles of other pharmacologic agents require further research.

Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is a lethal complication of portal hypertension and should be suspected in every patient with liver cirrhosis who presents with upper gastrointestinal bleed. AVH-related mortality has decreased in the last few decades from 40% to 15%-20% due to advances in the general and specific management of variceal hemorrhage. This review summarizes current management of AVH and prevention of recurrent hemorrhage with a focus on pharmacologic therapy.

Overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding — initial triage and pre-endoscopic management algorithm: Very-Low Clinical Risk, defined as risk score indicating 0–1% false negatives for transfusion, hemostatic intervention, or death with Glasgow-Blatchford Score 0–1, is managed with discharge from the emergency department with outpatient management if no other reason for hospitalization, whereas Not Very-Low Clinical Risk, defined as risk score indicating > 1% false negatives with Glasgow-Blatchford Score ≥ 2, is managed with admission to hospital or observation unit. Pre-endoscopic management includes resuscitation and attention to active comorbidities, RBC transfusion if hemoglobin < 7 g/dL, suggesting erythromycin 250mg infusion 30–90 minutes before upper endoscopy, and there is no recommendation for or against proton pump inhibitors. The pathway specifies upper endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation; after endoscopy, low-risk endoscopic findings such as clean-based ulcer, nonbleeding Mallory-Weiss tear, or erosions lead to discharge if stable vital signs and hemoglobin and no other reason for hospitalization, whereas non-low-risk findings such as ulcer with stigmata of hemorrhage, varices, neoplasm, or Dieulafoy lesion result in the patient remaining in hospital.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^dfd68300]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding remains an important emergency condition, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. As endoscopic therapy is the 'gold standard' of management, treatment of these patients can be considered in three stages: pre-endoscopic treatment, endoscopic haemostasis and post-endoscopic management. Since publication of the Asia-Pacific consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) 7 years ago, there have been significant advancements in the clinical management of patients in all three stages. These include pre-endoscopy risk stratification scores, blood and platelet transfusion, use of proton pump inhibitors; during endoscopy new haemostasis techniques (haemostatic powder spray and over-the-scope clips); and post-endoscopy management by second-look endoscopy and medication strategies. Emerging techniques, including capsule endoscopy and Doppler endoscopic probe in assessing adequacy of endoscopic therapy, and the pre-emptive use of angiographic embolisation, are attracting new attention. An emerging problem is the increasing use of dual antiplatelet agents and direct oral anticoagulants in patients with cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Guidelines on the discontinuation and then resumption of these agents in patients presenting with NVUGIB are very much needed. The Asia-Pacific Working Group examined recent evidence and recommends practical management guidelines in this updated consensus statement.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^ff825aad]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Important advances in the management of non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) have been made. The concept of pre-endoscopic treatment has changed. New devices in endoscopic haemostasis have been introduced. The increasing use of antiplatelets and anticoagulants has complicated the picture. Endoscopic interventions, such as mucosectomy and endoscopic submucosal dissection, have become standard care. These procedures are associated with marked risks of bleeding. For these reasons, the Asia-Pacific Working Group felt that it was necessary to update their consensus recommendations for the management of NVUGIB.

Similar to the previous Asia-Pacific consensus statements published in 2011, this update aims to produce management guidelines for clinicians practising in community or referral hospitals. The Asia-Pacific Working Group decided that there was no need to repeat guideline statements previously recommended unless there was a change of view, but only to highlight recommendations based on new evidence reported in the past 5–10 years. Therefore, the 2011 consensus recommendations that are not dealt with in this update are considered to be still valid for the management of NVUGIB. The working group continued to use the same modified Delphi process as beforebut chose to divide the updated consensus into three sections: (1) pre-endoscopic management, (2) endoscopic management and (3) post-endoscopic management of NVUGIB.

The BSG has also produced a care bundle for patients admitted with decompensated cirrhosis in light of the NCEPOD report with a check list method which includes gastrointestinal bleeding.

Since the 2008 Darzi report, quality has become a priority for the NHS. With these guidelines there is real opportunity to introduce quality outcomes based on good clinical evidence. Furthermore by incorporating them into the liver accreditation scheme, Liver Quest, one can improve and assure quality in liver services across the UK. Therefore a small number of quality outcomes measures have been chosen and form part of the key recommendations.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^38c9748d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Table 2 — evidenced-based algorithm for initial management of suspected portal hypertensive bleeding specifies to ensure adequate vascular access with 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous cannulae or central venous access and provide fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid, and to assess airway protection with tracheal intubation advised for active hematemesis, inability to maintain or protect airway, and to enable optimal sedation for endoscopic therapy. Vasoactive therapy includes octreotide initial intravenous bolus of 50 μg (can be repeated in first hour if ongoing bleeding) followed by continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide 50 μg/h for 2–5 d (may stop after definitive hemostasis achieved), and somatostatin analogs inhibit gastric acid secretion so co-administration of proton pump inhibitor is not required. Antibiotic prophylaxis is emphasized, with intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g/24 h (maximal duration 7 d) since prophylactic antibiotics reduce infections, rebleeding, and mortality. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy is outlined: transfuse at Hgb threshold of 7 g/dL and goal maintenance Hgb of 7–9 g/dL, with restrictive transfusion associated with favorable effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient, decreased mortality, and decreased rate for early rebleeding; avoid overuse of blood products in cirrhosis given risks including precipitation of portal venous thrombosis. Urgent endoscopic assessment for source control should follow stabilization, within 12 h of presentation, and consider erythromycin before emergency endoscopy (250 mg intravenous, 30–120 min before) to optimize visualization with QT interval check; patients with acute variceal hemorrhage should be managed within the intensive care unit or other well-monitored units given mortality risk and care complexity.

Definitions

It is important to define the terms that should be used in the context of a variceal bleed. These are the Baveno V consensus definitions.

Variceal haemorrhage

Variceal haemorrhage is defined as bleeding from an oesophageal or gastric varix at the time of endoscopy or the presence of large oesophageal varices with blood in the stomach and no other recognisable cause of bleeding. An episode of bleeding is clinically significant when there is a transfusion requirement for 2 units of blood or more within 24 h of the time zero, together with a systolic blood pressure of < 100 mm Hg or a postural change of > 20 mm Hg and/or pulse rate > 100 bpm at time zero (time zero is the time of admission to the first hospital to which the patient is taken).

Time frame of acute bleeding

The acute bleeding episode is represented by an interval of 120 h (5 days) from time zero. Evidence of any bleeding after 120 h is the first rebleeding episode.

Failure to control active bleeding

Failure to control active bleeding is defined as death or need to change treatment defined by one of the following criteria:
Fresh haematemesis or nasogastric aspiration of ≥ 100 mL of fresh blood ≥ 2 h after the start of a specific drug treatment or therapeutic endoscopy.
Development of hypovolaemic shock.
30 g/L drop in haemoglobin (9% drop of haematocrit) within any 24 h period if no transfusion is given. This time frame needs to be further validated.

Variceal rebleeding

Variceal rebleeding is defined as the occurrence of a single episode of clinically significant rebleeding from portal hypertensive sources from day 5. Clinically significant rebleeding is defined as recurrent melaena or haematemesis in any of the following settings:
hospital admission;
blood transfusion;
30 g/L drop in haemoglobin;
death within 6 weeks.

Early mortality

Death within 6 weeks of the initial episode of bleeding.

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^4f99dfb5]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The guidelines refer closely to the Baveno V consensus statement published in 2010and the 2012 NICE Guidelines on Acute Upper GI bleeding (CG141). These documents are widely used and offer useful evidence-based guidance. However, we feel that owing to significant recent advances, further additions and refinements to the published guidance, with particular focus on resource implications, service development and the patient pathway, are necessary. The previously mentioned documentsdo not cover all the recent advances — in particular, in the field of acute variceal bleeding and the role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS). There have also been developments and better insights into drug treatment for prevention of varices and variceal bleeding — in particular, the role of non-cardioselective β blockers (NSBB).

Guideline development

These guidelines were drafted after discussions within the liver section of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and acceptance of the proposal by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC). There followed division of sections to be researched by designated authors and an exhaustive literature review. The Baveno V consensus and NICE guidelines were closely followed and guideline quality was assessed using the AGREE tool(section 'Assessing the quality of guidelines: the AGREE II instrument').

A preliminary guideline document was drafted by the authors following discussion and, where necessary, voting by members of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG). The draft guidelines were submitted for review by CSSG, then BSG council members. Finally, full peer review was undertaken by reviewers selected by the editor of Gut.

Attempts were made to preserve the format of the original guidelines, with additional sections relating to service development, the patient pathway and pre-primary prophylaxis. The section on the management of acute variceal bleeding has been extensively rewritten to take into account recent important developments in interventional radiology, drug treatment and resuscitation.

### A clinical decision rule based on the AST-to-platelet ratio index improves adherence to published guidelines on the management of acute variceal bleeding [^c2725477]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) depends on identifying a variceal versus nonvariceal etiology. An objective measure predicting etiology could guide early management pending endoscopy. The AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score has been studied as a marker of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, but has not been evaluated in the setting of acute UGIB.

Methods

In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we reviewed endoscopy reports and other data for patients with acute UGIB, and classified episodes as variceal bleeds or other. We assessed the diagnostic utility of the APRI score relative to other objective measures by Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis. We constructed a clinical decision rule based on the APRI score, and assessed how it would have changed management.

Results

The APRI score performed well in predicting a variceal etiology of acute UGIB, with AUROC 0.89. We developed a clinical decision rule using an APRI score of 0.4 to guide early management of acute UGIB patients. Retroactively applying this to our cohort, adherence to published guidelines for administration of octreotide and antibiotics would have increased from 56% to 91%.

Conclusions

The APRI score is an objective metric that helps predict a variceal etiology of acute UGIB. Using our proposed decision rule could improve adherence to guidelines on management of acute variceal bleeding. Although we were unable to demonstrate a survival benefit, improved adherence to evidence-based guidelines serves as a metric related to this most important outcome measure. Prospective study to validate these findings is indicated.

### Timing of endoscopy in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding: protocol of a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^e7eda978]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB), one of the most common emergency and critical conditions in our everyday clinical practice, can cause poor outcomes. Among the patients with liver cirrhosis, the most common source of AUGIB is gastroesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension, which is mainly caused by increased portal blood flow resistance due to a change in the intrinsic structure of the cirrhotic liver. When the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), an indicator for the evaluation of portal pressure, is > 10 mmHg, varices will occur; and when the HVPG is > 12 mmHg, the risk of variceal bleeding will be increased. The incidence of acute variceal bleeding (AVB) in cirrhotic patients is 25%–40%, with a 6-week mortality of 10%–20%.

Endoscopy is an important approach for the diagnosis and treatment of AUGIB in cirrhotic patients. However, it is an invasive procedure and requires technical expertise. Accessibility of emergency endoscopy is often low at hospitals or remote areas that lack 24-h endoscopic service. Thus, most severely ill patients with AUGIB, especially those who fail conventional drug therapy, need to be immediately transferred to a higher-level medical center.

Until now, the optimal timing of initiating endoscopy for the management of cirrhotic patients with AUGIB is inconsistent among various practice guidelines or consensuses. The Baveno consensus, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guideline, the Belgian practice guideline, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy practice guideline recommend that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h since the onset of AVB.– The UK practice guideline recommends that patients with severe and hemodynamically unstable AVB should undergo endoscopy as soon as possible after basic resuscitation, while other patients should undergo endoscopy within 24 h of admission. The Chinese practice guideline recommends that endoscopic examination should be preferably performed within 12–24 h after the onset of AVB.

### Profile and outcome of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding presenting to urban emergency departments of tertiary hospitals in tanzania [^83a86fb7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a medico-surgical emergency. Although there has been a global decline in the mortality associated with UGIB, the incidence and mortality associated with GI bleeding remains high in limited income countries. In the United States, UGIB accounts for 300,000 admissions per year with approximately 5% mortality rate, whereas in several studies from sub-Saharan Africa, mortality ranges from 6 to 30%. It is not clear if the higher mortality seen in low and middle income countries (LIMC's) is due to patient demographics, severity on presentation, etiology or compliance with care standards. Esophageal varices has been implicated as the most common cause of UGIB in several African studies. Rather than being due to alcoholic liver disease as in high income countries (HIC's), varices in sub-Saharan Africa result from Schistosoma-related portal hypertension. This is in contrast to HIC where erosive gastritis has been commonly implicated. Other potential contributors to the higher mortality may be the severity of disease presentation, as there is little primary care in these settings, and many patients seek care very late in their disease.

Another potential contributor is failure to treat patients in accordance with management guidelines. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for those with suspected Non-variceal UGIB (NVUGIB), somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and antibiotics in suspected cases of variceal UGIB (VUGIB) and in those with clinical suspicion of liver disease, timely blood transfusion and early use of endoscopy may not occur in these settings due to lack of appropriate specialists, lack of resources or supply chain issues. A knowledge gap on the current UGIB management guidelines and recommendations amongst the health care providers may also contribute to inadequate management of UGIB cases. Prior studies in Tanzania studies demonstrate lack of appropriate care offered to patients with UGIB. Nearly half of the patients in one the studies did not receive endoscopic evaluation and treatment whereas 47.1% of the patients who required blood transfusion, did not receive blood transfusion in another study.

### Diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal hemorrhage: what you need to know [^4864a7ee]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Acute gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a common cause for hospital admission that requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary management to optimize clinical outcomes. Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) includes both upper and lower GI tract sources with an extensive list of differential pathologies. This review provides a systematic approach to both upper and lower GIB management, emphasizing initial resuscitation, stabilization, diagnostic evaluation to identify the source, and treatment modalities. Endoscopy remains the cornerstone for diagnostic and interventional purposes, significantly reducing the need for surgical procedures. However, lower GIB and severe or refractory cases may necessitate additional imaging and interventions, including surgical management. Integrating clinical guidelines, evidence-based strategies, and individualized care, this review delineates what you need to know to diagnose and manage acute GI hemorrhage.

### Asia-pacific working group consensus on non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: an update 2018 [^b61aa477]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

(Accept-agreement: 94.5%, level of evidence: high)

Most of the studies are very consistent in showing that GBS is the best tool to predict which patients presenting with UGIB are likely to require a hospital-based intervention. This first pertains to blood transfusion and also to the need for endoscopic treatment and surgery. Several studies also point to setting the threshold of GBS < 1–3 as an indicator for patients not requiring hospitalisation.

The Upper Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage International Consortium has examined the subject of threshold of GBS in managing UGIB. In their study recruiting patients from four countries (Scotland, England, Denmark and New Zealand), they found that the GBS at a cut-off point of < 1 and < 2 identified low-risk patients with a higher level of specificity than setting the cut-off value of GBS at 0 (40–49% vs 22%). The GBS at a cut-off value of < 2 had the highest specificity to detect adverse outcomes but missed 3% of high-risk patients. Therefore, the authors suggested that a GBS cut-off point at < 1 was most suitable as a guide for outpatient management. Some argue that even the GBS has a relatively low specificity to predict adverse outcomes. This comment is primarily based on a systematic review. The working group believe that by adopting a GBS cut-off point < 1, most hospitals can reduce the majority of unnecessary hospital admissions without missing high-risk patients. It will naturally translate into a significant reduction in costs of managing UGIB. As we have pointed out in our previous consensus statement, a low risk for recurrent bleeding is not the same as low risk for mortality. Patients whose bleeding is controlled might still die owing to non-bleeding related causes such as cardiac and pulmonary decompensation. Therefore, the GBS score and its cut-off threshold cannot be interpreted as a score to predict mortality. The working group agreed that existing published data support this statement with a level of evidence graded as high.

### Management of variceal and nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis [^dd7bd9f0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage remains the most common medical emergency managed by gastroenterologists. Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with liver cirrhosis can be grouped into two categories: the first includes lesions that arise by virtue of portal hypertension, namely gastroesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy; and the second includes lesions seen in the general population (peptic ulcer, erosive gastritis, reflux esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, tumors, etc.). Emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the standard procedure recommended for both diagnosis and treatment of UGIB. The endoscopic treatment of choice for esophageal variceal bleeding is band ligation of varices. Bleeding from gastric varices is treated by injection with cyanoacrylate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs as well as antibiotic treatment is started before or at the same time as endoscopy. Bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy is less frequent, usually chronic and treatment options include β-blocker therapy, injection therapy and interventional radiology. The standard of care of UGIB in patients with cirrhosis includes careful resuscitation, preferably in an intensive care setting, medical and endoscopic therapy, early consideration for placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and, sometimes, surgical therapy or hepatic transplant.

### Recent advances on the management of patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^be8e3f30]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Schiefer et al assessed the utility of the Blatchford score in a retrospective cohort study that was published in 2012. They reviewed the cases of 478 patients who presented to the emergency departments of 2 centres in the Netherlands with acute upper GI bleeding and scored them by the Blatchford score and other scoring systems. 104 patients had a Blatchford score of 2 or less. Of those, only 2 required endoscopic intervention (neither died). This resulted in 99.2% sensitivity and 42.9% specificity for intervention when a score of 2 was used as a cut-off. This further strengthens previously published guideline recommendations that patients with a low Blatchford score can be safely managed as outpatients. Those who do not meet these criteria are recommended to proceed to endoscopy for diagnosis and possible therapy within 24 h or immediately after resuscitation.

Considerations

Clinicians should assess their patients for presence or history of other medical co-morbidities, particularly coagulopathy. Consideration should be given to the patient's clinical risk as predicted by tools such as the Blatchford Score and/or Rockall Score. These scores should also direct management in the post-endoscopic period. Patients deemed to be at low risk can be managed as outpatients, whereas those at higher risk should proceed to endoscopy within 24 h.

Assessing the quality of guidelines: the AGREE II instrument

The AGREE II instrument is an accepted method for appraising clinical guidelines. Six domains are listed:

Scope and purpose

The guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other healthcare professionals managing patients with cirrhosis and gastro-oesophageal varices in light of recent guidance published by NICEand the Baveno V Consensus. Important subsequent developments are covered in depth due to the potential impact on clinical practice. The guidelines are primarily aimed at management of adult patients

Guideline development group membership and stakeholder involvement

Membership of the group includes gastroenterologists, hepatologists and interventional radiologists with nursing and patient representation.

Rigour of development

The published literature was searched using Pubmed, Medline, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane database between October 2013 and February 2015. The GDG met through a series of teleconferences during that time. The guidelines rely considerably on consensus statements published by the Baveno V Consensus and NICE. The style of graded recommendations is determined by the level of supporting evidence (graded level 1 to 5) as described by the Oxford Centre For Evidence Based Medicine(table 1) and is as follows:
A: consistent level 1 studies;
B: consistent level 2 or 3 studies or extrapolations from level 1 studies;
C: level 4 studies or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies;
D: level 5 evidence or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level.

Table 1
Levels of evidence

Areas of disagreement about the recommendation grade were subjected to discussion and, if necessary, voting by members of the guidelines group. Where possible, the health benefits, side effects and risks of recommendations have been discussed. The guidelines were subject to peer review after submission for consideration of publication in Gut.

Clarity and presentation

Recommendations are intended to be specific to particular situations and patient groups; where necessary, different options are listed. Key recommendations are linked to discussion threads on a discussion forum hosted on the BSG website.

Applicability

Where necessary, we have discussed organisational changes that may be needed in order to apply recommendations. We have attempted to identify key criteria for monitoring and audit purposes.

Editorial independence and conflict of interest

Guideline group members have declared any conflicts of interest.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^656eacbb]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Variceal bleeding

In cases of proven variceal bleeding, vasoactive drugs should be continued for two to five days as noted above. A meta-analysis of eight studies concluded that the combination of vasoactive drugs with endotherapy resulted in better initial control of bleeding and five day haemostasis than endotherapy alone, although this result did not translate to a survival benefit. In people with cirrhosis and UGIB, antibiotics should be administered for up to seven days, even if the cause of bleeding is non-variceal, owing to the risk of sepsis.

A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt decreases portal pressure and can also decrease the risk of variceal rebleeding. A multicentre, European randomised controlled trial of 63 patients Child-Pugh class C < 14 or class B with active bleeding reported reduced risk of rebleeding (3% v 50%, P < 0.001) and improved one year survival (86% v 61%, P < 0.001) in patients undergoing an early (< 72 h) so-called pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. An European guideline and the Baveno VII consensus now advocates the use of early pre-emptive transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (< 72 h) to be considered in patients bleeding from oesophageal varices, or gastro-oesophageal varices type I or II who have bleeding controlled by endotherapy but are at high risk of rebleeding. A Scottish, open label, randomised controlled trial done in two centres of 58 patients also reported a reduced risk of rebleeding (0% v 27.6%, P = 0.04) but no effect on survival (76.9% v 75.9%, P = 0.9). This study reported difficulty in delivering this so-called elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure within 72 h, which could be challenging for many centres globally. In patients with gastric varices and a clinical or anatomical contraindication to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration can be considered with outcomes appearing similar to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in a small retrospective study.

Liver transplantation

This is probably appropriate only for patients who bleed while awaiting liver transplantation, although studies comparing VBL or TIPSS placement with urgent liver transplantation in this situation need to be done. Liver transplantation is an exceedingly rare option for the vast majority of patients, both because it is not commonly available and because of shortages and delays in organ procurement. No controlled trials of liver transplantation in uncontrolled/active bleeding are available.

Recommendations for the control of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis are given below and in figure 3.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (figure 3)
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of < 50×10⁹/L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of < 1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time > 1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (< 72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score < 14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (< 72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators: Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

Ongoing or recurrent bleeding

Non-variceal bleeding

The term "further bleeding" encompasses both no haemostasis at index endoscopy and also early rebleeding. If acute bleeding persists despite standard endotherapy, European guidelines suggest the use of the larger over the scope clip or haemostatic powder; however, owing to reported high rates of rebleeding, haemostatic powder should probably be used as a temporising measure before definitive management by other means, such as interventional radiology.

Rebleeding is indicated by externalisation of blood, more than 20 g/L reduction after stabilisation of haemoglobin concentration, or tachycardia and hypotension. All major guidelines recommend repeat endoscopy in this event. A randomised controlled trial of 100 patients comparing repeat endoscopy with surgery in rebleeding after index endoscopy showed 35 (73%) of 48 patients having repeat endoscopy had long term control of bleeding with significantly reduced complications, no increase in risk of mortality, and reduced resource costs. If bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically, interventional radiology (for transarterial embolisation) or surgical input should be sought; a meta-analysis reported no difference in mortality or need for further intervention between these groups. For patients with substantial comorbidities, interventional radiology is generally a safer option than surgery.

Variceal bleeding

If variceal bleeding is uncontrolled by standard endoscopic band ligation or injection techniques, a balloon tamponade might be required. A 1978 trial of 97 patients showed that balloon tamponade was highly effective at meeting primary haemostasis in oesophageal varices (86%) but rebleeding was common (52%). Safety concerns remain because of potential complications such as aspiration pneumonia and oesophageal rupture. Balloon tamponade is, therefore, only recommended as a temporising measure before repeat endoscopy or so-called rescue transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is undertaken. The self expanding Danis stent has emerged as a possible alternative to the balloon tamponade, with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance and Baveno VII consensus advocating this stent as an alternative in managing uncontrolled bleeding from oesophageal varices. A Spanish, multicentre randomised controlled trial involving 28 patients compared balloon tamponade with stent insertion and reported improved bleeding control in the stent group (85% v 47%, P = 0.037), with a reduced need for transfusion but no significant difference in mortality.

Prevention of recurrent hemorrhage after initial bleeding — timing and risk: After a first AVH, patients are at high risk of rebleeding (up to 60% at 1 y without prophylaxis), and secondary prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding should be instituted immediately after control of the index bleed, within 7 days from admission, because the highest risk period for rebleeding is the first 6 weeks after presentation; in patients who underwent preemptive TIPS, no further measures are required.

### Management of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: guideline recommendations from the international consensus group [^7092f1e4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This update of the 2010 International Consensus Recommendations on the Management of Patients With Nonvariceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB) refines previous important statements and presents new clinically relevant recommendations.

Methods

An international multidisciplinary group of experts developed the recommendations. Data sources included evidence summarized in previous recommendations, as well as systematic reviews and trials identified from a series of literature searches of several electronic bibliographic databases from inception to April 2018. Using an iterative process, group members formulated key questions. Two methodologists prepared evidence profiles and assessed quality (certainty) of evidence relevant to the key questions according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. Group members reviewed the evidence profiles and, using a consensus process, voted on recommendations and determined the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional.

Recommendations

Preendoscopic management: The group suggests using a Glasgow Blatchford score of 1 or less to identify patients at very low risk for rebleeding, who may not require hospitalization. In patients without cardiovascular disease, the suggested hemoglobin threshold for blood transfusion is less than 80 g/L, with a higher threshold for those with cardiovascular disease. Endoscopic management: The group suggests that patients with acute UGIB undergo endoscopy within 24 hours of presentation. Thermocoagulation and sclerosant injection are recommended, and clips are suggested, for endoscopic therapy in patients with high-risk stigmata. Use of TC-325 (hemostatic powder) was suggested as temporizing therapy, but not as sole treatment, in patients with actively bleeding ulcers. Pharmacologic management: The group recommends that patients with bleeding ulcers with high-risk stigmata who have had successful endoscopic therapy receive high-dose proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (intravenous loading dose followed by continuous infusion) for 3 days. For these high-risk patients, continued oral PPI therapy is suggested twice daily through 14 days, then once daily for a total duration that depends on the nature of the bleeding lesion. Secondary prophylaxis: The group suggests PPI therapy for patients with previous ulcer bleeding who require antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy for cardiovascular prophylaxis.

Management of active variceal haemorrhage

The average 6-week mortality of the first episode of variceal bleeding in most studies is reported to be up to 20%. There has been considerable improvement in survival since the early 1980s when the in-hospital mortality was 40–50%, compared with 15% from a recent UK audit. Such is the improvement in outcomes, that a patient with Child's A cirrhosis is very unlikely to succumb to an index variceal bleed. Studies have shown the Child–Pugh score, MELD score, and HVPG to be strong predictors of outcomes. The MELD score has been shown to outperform Child's score in a recent study, with a score > 19 associated with 20% 6 week mortality. Furthermore, the MELD score has been shown to perform as well as the traditional intensive care unit scores in predicting mortality in patients admitted to intensive care in the UK.MELD > 18, active bleeding, transfusing > 4 units of packed red blood cells have been shown to be predictors of mortality and early rebleeding.HVPG has also been shown to predict outcome when measured at 2 weeks after a bleed, and a value of ≥ 20 mm Hg when measured acutely within 48 h has been shown to provide significant prognostic information. However, this technique is not used routinely in the management of patients around the world, and substitution of clinical data in the latter study was shown to provide the same clinical predictive value. These scoring systems are not purely academic; they allow the referring clinician to predict those patients with a high chance of rebleeding to be transferred to a specialist centre offering, for instance, TIPSS before the patient rebleeds.

Nonetheless, probably the most important step in the management of acute variceal haemorrhage is the initial resuscitation assessed according to standard 'ABC' practice, together with protection of the airway to prevent aspiration. Although early endoscopy allows for accurate diagnosis of the bleeding site and decisions about management (figure 3), therapeutic intervention in acute variceal bleeding can be initiated, safely in most cases, before diagnostic endoscopy. As similar efficacy is demonstrated with pharmacological treatment as with sclerotherapy, the former should be first-line therapy.β Blockade should not be started in the acute setting, and those already taking β blockers as prophylaxis should probably stop taking them for 48–72 h in order that the patient's physiological response to blood loss can be allowed to manifest.

### Diagnosis and management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^5b31dee7]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding causes significant morbidity and mortality in the United States, and has been associated with increasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Rapid assessment and resuscitation should precede the diagnostic evaluation in unstable patients with severe bleeding. Risk stratification is based on clinical assessment and endoscopic findings. Early upper endoscopy (within 24 hours of presentation) is recommended in most patients because it confirms the diagnosis and allows for targeted endoscopic treatment, including epinephrine injection, thermocoagulation, application of clips, and banding. Endoscopic therapy results in reduced morbidity, hospital stays, risk of recurrent bleeding, and need for surgery. Although administration of proton pump inhibitors does not decrease mortality, risk of rebleeding, or need for surgery, it reduces stigmata of recent hemorrhage and the need for endoscopic therapy. Despite successful endoscopic therapy, rebleeding can occur in 10 to 20 percent of patients; a second attempt at endoscopic therapy is recommended in these patients. Arteriography with embolization or surgery may be needed if there is persistent and severe bleeding.

Recommendations: management of active haemorrhage from gastric varices (Figure 3)
What is the optimal management of bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices? Gastro-oesophageal varices (GOV)-1: treat as for oesophageal varices (level 2b, grade B). GOV-2 and isolated gastric varices (IGV): We recommend initial endoscopic therapy with cyanoacrylate injection (level 1a, grade A). Thrombin may also be considered (level 4, grade C). TIPSS can be considered, depending on local resources and clinical judgement (level 3a, grade B).
If control of bleeding fails: Balloon tamponade is suggested for GOV and IGV-1 until definitive treatment is undertaken (level 2b, grade B). Salvage TIPSS is suggested as the first-line definite treatment, where feasible (level 3a, grade B). Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) or surgical shunting can be considered if TIPSS is not possible (eg, portal vein thrombosis present) and depending on local resources (level 3a, grade B).
What are the therapeutic options for prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices? We recommend that patients with GOV-1 are entered into a VBL surveillance programme (level 2b, grade B). We recommend endoscopic surveillance with cyanoacrylate injection as needed for GOV-2 and IGV (level 2b, grade B). Note the optimum endoscopic follow-up strategy remains unclear. Thrombin can also be considered (level 4, grade C). NSBB can be considered in certain circumstances after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement (level 1b, grade B). We suggest TIPSS if patients rebleed despite cyanoacrylate injection. TIPSS can also be considered in other selected patients (eg, those with large or multiple gastric varices) (level 1b, grade B). Shunt surgery may be used in selected patients with well-compensated cirrhosis and depending on local resources (level 3c, grade B). Splenectomy or splenic artery embolisation should be considered in all patients where there is splenic vein thrombosis or left-sided portal hypertension (level 4, grade C).
Is there a role for primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding? NSBB (level 2a, grade B) can be considered in selected high-risk patients with large GOV-2 after taking into account the patient's preferences and clinical judgement. Cyanoacrylate injection is not recommended outside clinical trials (level 2a, grade A).
Areas requiring further study: Role of thrombin in gastric varices, comparing this with tissue adhesives in both acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis. Role of TIPSS in acute gastric variceal bleeding and secondary prophylaxis. Role of haemostatic powders in controlling refractory active gastric variceal bleeding. Role of NSBB in the prevention of rebleeding from gastric varices. Role of B-RTO as monotherapy or in combination with endoscopic injection of tissue adhesives in prevention of bleeding from gastric varices. Role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided injection of tissue adhesives or thrombin. Primary prevention of gastric variceal bleeding with tissues adhesives and NSBB.

Introduction

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious and common medical emergency in daily clinical practice, which can lead to unpredictable consequences. In patients with cirrhosis, the most common cause of upper GI bleeding is the rupture of esophageal varices due to portal hypertension. This condition occurs when blood flow in the portal vein is obstructed by structural changes in the cirrhotic liver, resulting in elevated portal pressure and the dilation and rupture of esophageal varices. Nowadays despite advances in management, treatment, and prevention of complications in cirrhosis, the incidence of bleeding from ruptured esophageal varices remains high, ranging from 20 to 40%, with a six-week mortality of 10–20%. Hence, this is a serious complication, directly threatening the patient's life if not intervened promptly. Currently, overall management of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) mainly focuses on key measures such as initial resuscitation to stabilise hemodynamics, the use of vasoconstrictive drugs to reduce portal pressure (octreotide, somatostatin, terlipressin), prophylactic antibiotics, and urgent endoscopic intervention. These approaches not only control bleeding but also contribute significantly to improving long-term outcomes in cirrhotic patients.

It is undeniable that endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is the mainstay treatment for EVB, however, the optimal timing for endoscopy remains a topic of debate in present guidelines and research. Most existing guidelines, including the Baveno VII consensus, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guideline, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline, and the Belgian guideline, suggest that endoscopy should be performed within 12 h of symptom onset in cirrhotic patients with EVB. In contrast, the UK guideline recommends that in case of severe variceal bleeding and hemodynamic instability, endoscopy should be performed immediately after resuscitation. For others, it should be conducted within 24 h after hospitalisation. Meanwhile, Chinese guideline proposes that endoscopy should be conducted within 12–24 h after the presentation of variceal bleeding. Moreover, these conflicting recommendations appear to rely more on expert consensus than on solid clinical evidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: upper gastrointestinal and ulcer bleeding [^b0f09625]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding — future directions: The guideline notes that "Much of the evidence supporting these guideline statements is low or very low quality", and that "Topics to explore in the future may include the following". Priority areas include "(i) Improvements in the performance of risk assessment instruments and implementation in electronic health records to allow timely decision support", "(ii) Enhancement of initial, pre-endoscopic management", with uncertainties in resuscitation targets and identifying subgroups for very-early endoscopy and that "pre-endoscopic PPIs are widely used with marked variability in guideline recommendations", and "(iii) Refinements in hemostatic therapy" such as whether powder-treated ulcers need second-modality retreatment, better defining indications for over-the-scope clips, assessing new interventions, the "role of Doppler probe", and developing economic models.
