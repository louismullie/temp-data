## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about topical NSAIDs, including efficacy, safety, formulation effects, guideline positioning, and practical prescribing considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical indications and scope of evidence. Then, I should verify efficacy data by condition and formulation. Next, I will review safety, including local and systemic adverse effects and special populations. After that, I need to check how major guidelines position topical NSAIDs. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing recommendations and highlight uncertainties and caveats that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical indications and scope of evidence so I don't overgeneralize. The strongest evidence base is for osteoarthritis of the knee and hand, with moderate-to-high quality randomized trials and multiple meta-analyses supporting analgesic benefit, whereas evidence for hip osteoarthritis is limited and mixed, and evidence for other chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes is generally insufficient or low quality, so I should be cautious extrapolating beyond knee and hand OA [^111zWfCP] [^115yBWuL] [^112puXap]. For acute soft-tissue injuries, multiple high-quality guidelines and Cochrane reviews support topical NSAIDs as first-line therapy, with analgesia comparable to oral NSAIDs and fewer systemic adverse effects, which I should keep in mind for strains, sprains, and contusions [^115s11tp] [^117TmqJS] [^116F4iu4].

> Now, I will examine efficacy in osteoarthritis, but wait, let me verify the magnitude and time course of benefit. In chronic knee and hand OA, topical diclofenac and ketoprofen demonstrate statistically significant pain relief versus placebo, with NNTs around 6–10 for clinically meaningful improvement over 6–12 weeks, though the absolute benefit is modest and highly influenced by placebo/contextual effects, which I need to acknowledge when counseling patients [^111zWfCP] [^117SBjzC]. Individual patient data meta-analyses show a specific treatment effect of about 6 points on a 0–100 scale versus placebo, but the overall improvement from baseline including placebo effects is roughly 25 points, underscoring the importance of expectation and measurement context in trials of topical agents [^111782ji] [^115pMi8p]. I should also note that diclofenac patches may show the largest pain effect among topical NSAIDs in network meta-analyses, but this comes with heterogeneity and potential bias, so I should interpret rankings cautiously [^115yBWuL] [^111ZebGE].

> Hold on, I should verify the time course and durability of benefit because some older meta-analyses suggested early benefit that wanes. A 2004 BMJ meta-analysis found benefit only in the first two weeks, but more recent Cochrane and guideline syntheses demonstrate sustained benefit through 6–12 weeks in knee and hand OA, suggesting that earlier conclusions about rapid attenuation may reflect differences in formulations, trial design, or pooling strategies rather than a true pharmacologic limitation [^112vshZz] [^111zWfCP] [^117SBjzC]. Let me reconsider the clinical implication: topical NSAIDs can be reasonable for short-to-medium term symptom control in localized OA, with reassessment of benefit and adherence at 2–4 weeks to decide continuation [^111zWfCP].

> Next, I should review acute musculoskeletal pain, and I need to ensure I'm precise about effect sizes. For strains, sprains, and overuse injuries, topical NSAIDs show low NNTs for 50% pain relief within about a week, with diclofenac emulgel around 1.8, ketoprofen gel around 2.5, and piroxicam gel around 4.4, and multiple guidelines endorse topical NSAIDs as first-line given comparable efficacy to oral NSAIDs with fewer systemic harms, which is clinically actionable in urgent care and primary care settings [^1158ExMm] [^114VXrSJ] [^115s11tp]. But wait, what if the injury is severe or the pain is diffuse? I should confirm that topical NSAIDs are less appropriate for severe trauma or widespread pain, where systemic therapy or multimodal approaches may be needed, aligning with guideline cautions [^115s11tp].

> I will now examine formulation effects because penetration and delivery can meaningfully change outcomes. Gels and emulgels, particularly diclofenac emulgel and ketoprofen gel, consistently show the most favorable NNTs in acute pain, whereas diclofenac patches may demonstrate the largest effects in some OA network meta-analyses, possibly due to occlusive delivery and higher local concentrations, though heterogeneity and potential contextual effects complicate firm ranking, so I should individualize by joint accessibility, skin tolerance, and patient preference [^1158ExMm] [^115yBWuL] [^111ZebGE]. Let me double-check a practical point: patches can be advantageous for single-joint, well-demarcated pain and may improve adherence, but they still require intact skin and can cause local irritation, which I should counsel on upfront [^114VXrSJ] [^117EmuAc].

> Safety is next, and I need to ensure I separate local from systemic risks. Local adverse effects are more frequent with topical NSAIDs than placebo, typically manifesting as mild dermatitis, pruritus, or burning, with NNHs around 16 in chronic pain trials, and most reactions resolve with discontinuation or switching formulation, which I should discuss to set expectations and preempt nonadherence [^114VXrSJ] [^111zWfCP]. Systemic adverse effects are uncommon and generally similar to placebo in RCTs, with observational data not showing clear increases in serious GI, CV, or renal events, but I should confirm that rare systemic AEs have been reported and that labeling still carries class warnings, so shared decision-making is prudent, especially in high-risk patients [^115yBWuL] [^113jemcj]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought systemic exposure is negligible, but pharmacokinetic studies show plasma levels are low, roughly 0.4–2.2% of oral exposure with diclofenac topicals, which explains the favorable systemic safety profile while still justifying caution in advanced CKD, heart failure, or high CV risk states [^114k8Jr1] [^115gRSjH].

> Let me consider special populations, and I should double-check guideline positions for older adults and those with comorbidities. Multiple guidelines prefer topical NSAIDs over oral NSAIDs in patients ≥ 75 years, in those with elevated GI, CV, or renal risk, or in patients on multiple medications, given the lower systemic exposure and fewer drug–drug interactions, which aligns with a risk–benefit approach in geriatrics and multimorbidity [^117TF3Mb] [^114C1ZGe] [^115jW1u9]. I need to ensure I screen for skin integrity, allergies, and ability to apply the product, and I should monitor for local reactions and any signs of systemic intolerance if used long term, even though serious events are rare in trials [^112puXap] [^111zWfCP].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to anchor practice. The ACR/AF strongly recommends topical NSAIDs for knee OA and conditionally recommends them for hand OA, while AAFP recommends offering topical NSAIDs as first-line for knee and hand OA due to effectiveness with fewer adverse effects than oral NSAIDs, and EULAR recommends preferring topical over systemic treatments in hand OA for safety reasons, all of which support a topical-first strategy in appropriate patients [^117TF3Mb] [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^114C1ZGe]. For acute non–low back musculoskeletal injuries, ACP/AAFP gives a strong recommendation for topical NSAIDs as first-line, and EUSEM advises considering topical NSAIDs for soft-tissue injuries, reinforcing their role in acute care pathways [^115s11tp] [^111YMeFE]. But wait, I should verify hip OA guidance: VA/DoD finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or against topical NSAIDs in hip OA, so I should avoid assuming benefit there and tailor to patient response and access [^112puXap].

> I need to check practical prescribing details to minimize failures. Typical dosing uses diclofenac 1% gel at 2–4 g per application to the affected joint up to four times daily, or diclofenac 1.3% patch every 12 hours for acute strains/sprains, with counseling to apply to clean, dry, intact skin, allow drying before clothing, and avoid eyes and mucosa; washing hands after application is essential to prevent inadvertent exposure, and I should confirm patients can manage the application frequency to sustain adherence [^117EmuAc] [^114THX3u]. Hold on, I should verify that combining with oral NSAIDs is usually unnecessary and may increase risk without added benefit, so I should avoid routine dual therapy unless there is a compelling, time-limited rationale and close monitoring [^111RrM2H].

> Let me synthesize the clinical takeaways, but I should be careful not to overstate. For localized knee or hand OA, topical NSAIDs are a reasonable first-line option with modest but real benefit and a favorable safety profile relative to oral NSAIDs, especially in older adults or those with GI, CV, or renal risk, with reassessment at 2–4 weeks to confirm ongoing value and tolerability [^111zWfCP] [^117TF3Mb] [^117UvspK]. For acute soft-tissue injuries, topical NSAIDs provide rapid, clinically meaningful pain relief comparable to oral NSAIDs with fewer systemic adverse effects, making them attractive in urgent care, sports medicine, and primary care settings, provided the skin is intact and the pain is localized [^1158ExMm] [^115s11tp]. I should confirm that evidence is insufficient for hip OA and for widespread chronic pain syndromes, so expectations and shared decision-making are key when trialing topicals in those contexts [^112puXap] [^112tZNAX].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and potential biases so we don't jump to conclusions. Many trials are short-term, industry-sponsored, and enriched by strong placebo/contextual effects, and unpublished negative data may exist, so the true magnitude of benefit may be smaller than pooled estimates suggest; nonetheless, convergent data from multiple guidelines and independent meta-analyses support clinically useful benefit in the right patients and formulations, which I should communicate transparently during counseling [^111zWfCP] [^112yriyi] [^111782ji]. I need to ensure ongoing vigilance for rare systemic adverse effects, especially with prolonged use or in high-risk patients, and to adjust therapy if local reactions, inadequate response, or evolving comorbidities emerge [^115yBWuL] [^115gRSjH].

Topical NSAIDs are effective for **localized musculoskeletal pain** [^114VXrSJ], especially osteoarthritis [^111zWfCP] and acute soft-tissue injuries [^1158ExMm], with **efficacy comparable to oral NSAIDs** [^117SBjzC] but with fewer systemic adverse effects [^115w1KEY]. They are recommended as **first-line therapy** for knee and hand osteoarthritis [^117TF3Mb] and for acute musculoskeletal pain [^115s11tp], particularly in patients at higher risk of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or renal complications [^117DUWfh]. Local skin reactions are the most common adverse effects [^111zWfCP], and systemic risks are significantly lower than with oral NSAIDs [^115gRSjH]. Topical NSAIDs are not recommended for hip osteoarthritis due to insufficient evidence [^112puXap].

---

## Mechanism of action

Topical NSAIDs exert their therapeutic effects by **locally inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes**, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis at the site of application [^114k8Jr1]. This localized mechanism provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing systemic exposure [^114k8Jr1].

---

## Clinical indications

Topical NSAIDs are **primarily indicated** for the following conditions:

- **Osteoarthritis (OA)**: Particularly knee and hand OA [^117TF3Mb], where topical NSAIDs are recommended as first-line therapy due to their favorable safety profile and efficacy [^117TF3Mb].

- **Acute musculoskeletal pain**: Including sprains, strains, and contusions [^1158ExMm], where topical NSAIDs provide effective pain relief with minimal systemic adverse effects [^116F4iu4].

- **Soft tissue injuries**: Topical NSAIDs are recommended for acute soft tissue injuries, offering analgesia comparable to oral NSAIDs but with fewer systemic side effects [^111YMeFE].

---

## Efficacy

Topical NSAIDs have **demonstrated efficacy** in multiple clinical studies and meta-analyses:

- **Osteoarthritis**: Topical diclofenac and ketoprofen have been shown to significantly reduce pain and improve function in OA, with efficacy comparable to oral NSAIDs [^117SBjzC] [^115yBWuL].

- **Acute musculoskeletal pain**: Topical NSAIDs, particularly diclofenac emulgel, ketoprofen gel, and piroxicam gel, have demonstrated significant analgesic efficacy in acute musculoskeletal pain conditions [^1158ExMm] [^114VXrSJ].

- **Comparison with oral NSAIDs**: Topical NSAIDs have been shown to have similar efficacy to oral NSAIDs in OA and acute musculoskeletal pain, with the added benefit of fewer systemic adverse effects [^117SBjzC] [^1158ExMm].

---

## Safety profile

Topical NSAIDs have a **favorable safety profile** compared with oral NSAIDs:

- **Local adverse effects**: The most common adverse effects are local skin reactions, such as rash, itching, and burning sensations [^111zWfCP]. These reactions are generally mild and transient [^1158ExMm].

- **Systemic adverse effects**: Systemic adverse effects, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications, are significantly less frequent with topical NSAIDs compared to oral NSAIDs [^115gRSjH] [^115w1KEY].

- **Serious adverse events**: Serious adverse events are rare with topical NSAIDs, and no significant increase in serious adverse events has been observed compared to placebo or oral NSAIDs [^111zWfCP] [^115yBWuL].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several clinical guidelines **recommend topical NSAIDs** as first-line therapy for specific conditions:

| **Condition** | **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Knee osteoarthritis | American College of Rheumatology (ACR) | Strongly recommended [^117TF3Mb] |
| Hand osteoarthritis | European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) | Preferred first-choice topical treatment [^114C1ZGe] |
| Acute musculoskeletal pain | American College of Physicians (ACP) | Strongly recommended [^115s11tp] |
| Hip osteoarthritis | Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) | Insufficient evidence for recommendation [^112puXap] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite their favorable safety profile, topical NSAIDs have some **limitations**:

- **Limited evidence for hip osteoarthritis**: There is insufficient evidence to recommend topical NSAIDs for hip osteoarthritis [^112puXap].

- **Patient adherence**: Frequent application (up to four times daily) may affect patient adherence and satisfaction [^117EmuAc].

- **Skin sensitivity**: Patients with sensitive skin may experience local reactions, necessitating careful monitoring and patient education [^111RrM2H].

---

## Conclusion

Topical NSAIDs are effective and safe for localized musculoskeletal pain, particularly in osteoarthritis and acute soft-tissue injuries [^114VXrSJ]. They offer **analgesic efficacy comparable to oral NSAIDs** [^117SBjzC] with significantly fewer systemic adverse effects, making them a preferred first-line therapy for many patients [^115s11tp].

### Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^111zWfCP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Use of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to treat chronic musculoskeletal conditions has become widely accepted because they can provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events. This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults', originally published in Issue 9, 2012.

Objectives

To review the evidence from randomised, double-blind, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and our own in-house database; the date of the last search was February 2016. We also searched the references lists of included studies and reviews, and sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers' web sites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, active or inert carrier (placebo) controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain of moderate or severe intensity. Studies had to meet stringent quality criteria and there had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratio and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to carrier or other active treatment. We were particularly interested to compare different formulations (gel, cream, plaster) of individual NSAIDs. The primary outcome was 'clinical success', defined as at least a 50% reduction in pain, or an equivalent measure such as a 'very good' or 'excellent' global assessment of treatment, or 'none' or 'slight' pain on rest or movement, measured on a categorical scale.

Main Results

We identified five new studies for this update, which now has information from 10,631 participants in 39 studies, a 38% increase in participants from the earlier review; 33 studies compared a topical NSAID with carrier. All studies examined topical NSAIDs for treatment of osteoarthritis, and for pooled analyses studies were generally of moderate or high methodological quality, although we considered some at risk of bias from short duration and small size. In studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen were significantly more effective than carrier for reducing pain; about 60% of participants had much reduced pain. With topical diclofenac, the NNT for clinical success in six trials (2343 participants) was 9.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1 to 16) (moderate quality evidence). With topical ketoprofen, the NNT for clinical success in four trials (2573 participants) was 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3) (moderate quality evidence). There was too little information for analysis of other individual topical NSAIDs compared with carrier. Few trials compared a topical NSAID to an oral NSAID, but overall they showed similar efficacy (low quality evidence). These efficacy results were almost completely derived from people with knee osteoarthritis. There was an increase in local adverse events (mostly mild skin reactions) with topical diclofenac compared with carrier or oral NSAIDs, but no increase with topical ketoprofen (moderate quality evidence). Reporting of systemic adverse events (such as gastrointestinal upsets) was poor, but where reported there was no difference between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were infrequent and not different between topical NSAID and carrier (very low quality evidence). Clinical success with carrier occurred commonly - in around half the participants in studies lasting 6 to 12 weeks. Both direct and indirect comparison of clinical success with oral placebo indicates that response rates with carrier (topical placebo) are about twice those seen with oral placebo. A substantial amount of data from completed, unpublished studies was unavailable (up to 6000 participants). To the best of our knowledge, much of this probably relates to formulations that have never been marketed.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen can provide good levels of pain relief beyond carrier in osteoarthritis for a minority of people, but there is no evidence for other chronic painful conditions. There is emerging evidence that at least some of the substantial placebo effects seen in longer duration studies derive from effects imparted by the NSAID carrier itself, and that NSAIDs add to that.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^113c4vWc]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Countries in the European Union have been using topical NSAIDs for more than a decade, while the United States has only recently approved their use for the treatment of OA. As both the amount of data related to the increased risks associated with oral NSAIDs and the clinical experience with topical NSAIDs continue to increase, clinical management guidelines can quickly become out of date if not updated frequently. Attempting to understand the human condition of pain requires a pluralistic approach that incorporates data to create a true "world literature" that supports global remedies for pain. As medicine becomes increasingly globalized, international clinical guidelines for the management of OA that deliver consistent diagnostic and treatment approaches are becoming increasingly important to pain specialists in the European Union, the United States, and around the world.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115my6Me]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Goals for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) emphasize pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and improvement in functioning. Among pharmacological pain management interventions, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently recommended as the most effective treatment option for OA. However, the use of traditional oral NSAIDs is associated with risk of serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. Topical NSAIDs are an alternative with well-established tolerability and efficacy in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand. While the management of OA pain is evolving toward the more widespread use of topical NSAIDs, some OA management guidelines have yet to incorporate these agents in their recommendations. This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, their current placement in OA management guidelines, and their potential role in enabling pain specialists to provide individualized care for their patients with OA.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^115g1y5q]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although highly effective for relieving pain, oral nonselective NSAIDs are associated with serious AEs;–however, this risk may be reduced with the use of topical NSAID formulations. It is important that pain specialists are aware of changes in recommendations for use of oral and topical NSAIDs, based on recent OA guidelines. Topical NSAIDs provide a well-tolerated alternative approach to achieving pain relief with minimal risk of serious AEs. In patients with OA, topical NSAIDs have been shown to have superior efficacy compared with placebo and equivalent efficacy compared with oral NSAIDs, with no increase in the risk of serious AEs. These data suggest that the reduced incidence of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal AEs observed with the use of topical NSAIDs may make them useful in patients who are at high risk.

Optimal management of the pain associated with OA requires awareness and selection of the pharmacologic treatments and non-pharmacologic interventions that best meet a given patient's needs. For patients with OA of the knee or hand, the elderly, or those with certain comorbidities, topical NSAIDs may be the most effective tool for pain management, particularly because of the lower risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular AEs. The recommendations included in the newly updated American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines regarding the use of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of OA of the knee or hand and in the elderly will be helpful in guiding pain specialists around the world on best practices in OA treatment in this population.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^115yBWuL]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This systematic review identified 43 studies, comparing 36 RCTs (7900 patients with OA at any joint) and 7 observational studies (218 074 participants). Topical NSAIDs reduced pain and improved function in patients with OA. Diclofenac patches were the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious AEs were observed in randomised trials or observational studies in the general population. However, confirmation of the CV safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

What is already known on this topic?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for the treatment of osteoarthritis by many guidelines.
There are a number of topical NSAIDs. However, their relative efficacy remains largely unknown because there are few head-to-head comparative trials.
The safety of topical NSAIDs remains unclear, especially its systemic side effects such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events.

What are the new findings?

Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective to reduce pain and improve function in osteoarthritis.
Among all available topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for pain relief and piroxicam was the best option to improve function.
Other than salicylate gel, topical NSAIDs are safe. They are not associated with increased local or systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal and renal events; this can be concluded from both randomised trials and observational studies.

### Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^117SBjzC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly taken orally, but they are also available in topical preparations to be applied to or rubbed onto the skin of a painful joint, typically one affected by arthritis, with the aim of relieving pain locally. Topical NSAIDs are widely used in some parts of the world for acute and chronic painful conditions, but have not been universally accepted until recently. One of the problems has been that older clinical studies were generally short, lasting four weeks or less, and short duration studies are not regarded as adequate in ongoing painful conditions.

Objectives

To examine the use of topical NSAIDs in chronic musculoskeletal pain, focusing on studies of high methodological quality, and examining the measured effect of the preparations according to study duration. The principal aim was to estimate treatment efficacy in longer duration studies of at least 8 weeks.

Search Methods

A series of electronic searches, together with bibliographic searches, and searches of in-house databases were combined with electronic searches of clinical trial registers and manufacturers of topical NSAIDs, or companies known to be actively researching topical NSAIDs. There had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double blind studies with placebo or active comparators, where at least one treatment was a topical NSAID product, in any topical formulation (cream, gel, patch, solution), in studies lasting at least two weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study quality and validity, and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk (RR) and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Information was available from 7688 participants in 34 studies from 32 publications; 23 studies compared a topical NSAID with placebo. Topical NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo for reducing pain due to chronic musculoskeletal conditions. The best data were for topical diclofenac in osteoarthritis, where the NNT for at least 50% pain relief over 8 to 12 weeks compared with placebo was 6.4 for the solution, and 11 for the gel formulation. There were too few data of good quality to calculate NNTs for other individual topical NSAIDs compared with placebo. Direct comparison of topical NSAID with an oral NSAID did not show any difference in efficacy. There was an increase in local adverse events (mostly mild skin reactions) with topical NSAIDs compared with placebo or oral NSAIDs, but no increase in serious adverse events. Gastrointestinal adverse events with topical NSAID did not differ from placebo, but were less frequent than with oral NSAIDs. A substantial amount of data from unpublished studies was unavailable. Much of this probably relates to formulations that have never been marketed.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs can provide good levels of pain relief; topical diclofenac solution is equivalent to that of oral NSAIDs in knee and hand osteoarthritis, but there is no evidence for other chronic painful conditions. Formulation can influence efficacy. The incidence of local adverse events is increased with topical NSAIDs, but gastrointestinal adverse events are reduced compared with oral NSAIDs.

### Topical analgesics for acute and chronic pain in adults-an overview of cochrane reviews [^114VXrSJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Topical analgesic drugs are used for a variety of painful conditions. Some are acute, typically strains or sprains, tendinopathy, or muscle aches. Others are chronic, typically osteoarthritis of hand or knee, or neuropathic pain.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of topical analgesics (primarily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylate rubefacients, capsaicin, and lidocaine) applied to intact skin for the treatment of acute and chronic pain in adults.

Methods

We identified systematic reviews in acute and chronic pain published to February 2017 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (the Cochrane Library). The primary outcome was at least 50% pain relief (participant-reported) at an appropriate duration. We extracted the number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) for efficacy outcomes for each topical analgesic or formulation, and the number needed to treat for one additional harmful outcome (NNH) for adverse events. We also extracted information on withdrawals due to lack of efficacy or adverse events, systemic and local adverse events, and serious adverse events. We required information from at least 200 participants, in at least two studies. We judged that there was potential for publication bias if the addition of four studies of typical size (400 participants) with zero effect increased NNT compared with placebo to 10 (minimal clinical utility). We extracted GRADE assessment in the original papers, and made our own GRADE assessment.

Main Results

Thirteen Cochrane Reviews (206 studies with around 30,700 participants) assessed the efficacy and harms from a range of topical analgesics applied to intact skin in a number of acute and chronic painful conditions. Reviews were overseen by several Review Groups, and concentrated on evidence comparing topical analgesic with topical placebo; comparisons of topical and oral analgesics were rare. For at least 50% pain relief, we considered evidence was moderate or high quality for several therapies, based on the underlying quality of studies and susceptibility to publication bias. In acute musculoskeletal pain (strains and sprains) with assessment at about seven days, therapies were diclofenac Emulgel (78% Emulgel, 20% placebo; 2 studies, 314 participants, NNT 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.1)), ketoprofen gel (72% ketoprofen, 33% placebo, 5 studies, 348 participants, NNT 2.5 (2.0 to 3.4)), piroxicam gel (70% piroxicam, 47% placebo, 3 studies, 522 participants, NNT 4.4 (3.2 to 6.9)), diclofenac Flector plaster (63% Flector, 41% placebo, 4 studies, 1030 participants, NNT 4.7 (3.7 to 6.5)), and diclofenac other plaster (88% diclofenac plaster, 57% placebo, 3 studies, 474 participants, NNT 3.2 (2.6 to 4.2)). In chronic musculoskeletal pain (mainly hand and knee osteoarthritis) therapies were topical diclofenac preparations for less than six weeks (43% diclofenac, 23% placebo, 5 studies, 732 participants, NNT 5.0 (3.7 to 7.4)), ketoprofen over 6 to 12 weeks (63% ketoprofen, 48% placebo, 4 studies, 2573 participants, NNT 6.9 (5.4 to 9.3)), and topical diclofenac preparations over 6 to 12 weeks (60% diclofenac, 50% placebo, 4 studies, 2343 participants, NNT 9.8 (7.1 to 16)). In postherpetic neuralgia, topical high-concentration capsaicin had moderate-quality evidence of limited efficacy (33% capsaicin, 24% placebo, 2 studies, 571 participants, NNT 11 (6.1 to 62)). We judged evidence of efficacy for other therapies as low or very low quality. Limited evidence of efficacy, potentially subject to publication bias, existed for topical preparations of ibuprofen gels and creams, unspecified diclofenac formulations and diclofenac gel other than Emulgel, indomethacin, and ketoprofen plaster in acute pain conditions, and for salicylate rubefacients for chronic pain conditions. Evidence for other interventions (other topical NSAIDs, topical salicylate in acute pain conditions, low concentration capsaicin, lidocaine, clonidine for neuropathic pain, and herbal remedies for any condition) was very low quality and typically limited to single studies or comparisons with sparse data. We assessed the evidence on withdrawals as moderate or very low quality, because of small numbers of events. In chronic pain conditions lack of efficacy withdrawals were lower with topical diclofenac (6%) than placebo (9%) (11 studies, 3455 participants, number needed to treat to prevent (NNTp) 26, moderate-quality evidence), and topical salicylate (2% vs 7% for placebo) (5 studies, 501 participants, NNTp 21, very low-quality evidence). Adverse event withdrawals were higher with topical capsaicin low-concentration (15%) than placebo (3%) (4 studies, 477 participants, NNH 8, very low-quality evidence), topical salicylate (5% vs 1% for placebo) (7 studies, 735 participants, NNH 26, very low-quality evidence), and topical diclofenac (5% vs 4% for placebo) (12 studies, 3552 participants, NNH 51, very low-quality evidence). In acute pain, systemic or local adverse event rates with topical NSAIDs (4.3%) were no greater than with topical placebo (4.6%) (42 studies, 6740 participants, high quality evidence). In chronic pain local adverse events with topical capsaicin low concentration (63%) were higher than topical placebo (5 studies, 557 participants, number needed to treat for harm (NNH) 2.6), high quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence indicated more local adverse events than placebo in chronic pain conditions with topical diclofenac (NNH 16) and local pain with topical capsaicin high-concentration (NNH 16). There was moderate-quality evidence of no additional local adverse events with topical ketoprofen over topical placebo in chronic pain. Serious adverse events were rare (very low-quality evidence).GRADE assessments of moderate or low quality in some of the reviews were considered by us to be very low because of small numbers of participants and events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that some formulations of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen are useful in acute pain conditions such as sprains or strains, with low (good) NNT values. There is a strong message that the exact formulation used is critically important in acute conditions, and that might also apply to other pain conditions. In chronic musculoskeletal conditions with assessments over 6 to 12 weeks, topical diclofenac and ketoprofen had limited efficacy in hand and knee osteoarthritis, as did topical high-concentration capsaicin in postherpetic neuralgia. Though NNTs were higher, this still indicates that a small proportion of people had good pain relief. Use of GRADE in Cochrane Reviews with small numbers of participants and events requires attention.

### Topical NSAIDs for acute musculoskeletal pain in adults [^1158ExMm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Use of topical NSAIDs to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions has become widely accepted because they can provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events. This review is an update of 'Topical NSAIDs for acute pain in adults' originally published in Issue 6, 2010.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs in acute musculoskeletal pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to February 2015. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching online clinical trial registers and manufacturers websites. For the earlier review, we also searched our own in-house database and contacted manufacturers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, active or placebo (inert carrier)-controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adults with acute pain resulting from strains, sprains or sports or overuse-type injuries (twisted ankle, for instance). There had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate the risk ratio and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or additional harmful outcome (NNH) compared with placebo or other active treatment. We reported 95% confidence intervals (CI). We were particularly interested to compare different formulations (gel, cream, plaster) of individual NSAIDs.

Main Results

For this update we added 14 new included studies (3489 participants), and excluded four studies. We also identified 20 additional reports of completed or ongoing studies that have not been published in full. The earlier review included 47 studies. This update included 61 studies. Most compared topical NSAIDs in the form of a gel, spray, or cream with a similar topical placebo; 5311 participants were treated with a topical NSAID, 3470 with placebo, and 220 with an oral NSAID. This was a 63% increase in the number of included participants over the previous version of this review. We also identified a number of studies in clinical trial registries with unavailable results amounting to about 5900 participants for efficacy and 5300 for adverse events. Formulations of topical diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, and indomethacin demonstrated significantly higher rates of clinical success (more participants with at least 50% pain relief) than matching topical placebo (moderate or high quality data). Benzydamine did not. Three drug and formulation combinations had NNTs for clinical success below 4. For diclofenac, the Emulgel® formulation had the lowest NNT of 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1) in two studies using at least 50% pain intensity reduction as the outcome. Diclofenac plasters other than Flector® also had a low NNT of 3.2 (2.6 to 4.2) based on good or excellent responses in some studies. Ketoprofen gel had an NNT of 2.5 (2.0 to 3.4), from five studies in the 1980s, some with less well defined outcomes. Ibuprofen gel had an NNT of 3.9 (2.7 to 6.7) from two studies with outcomes of marked improvement or complete remission. All other drug and formulation combinations had NNT values above 4, indicating lesser efficacy. There were insufficient data to compare reliably individual topical NSAIDs with each other or the same oral NSAID. Local skin reactions were generally mild and transient, and did not differ from placebo (high quality data). There were very few systemic adverse events (high quality data) or withdrawals due to adverse events (low quality data).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs provided good levels of pain relief in acute conditions such as sprains, strains and overuse injuries, probably similar to that provided by oral NSAIDs. Gel formulations of diclofenac (as Emugel®), ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, and some diclofenac patches, provided the best effects. Adverse events were usually minimal. Since the last version of this review, the new included studies have provided additional information. In particular, information on topical diclofenac is greatly expanded. The present review supports the previous review in concluding that topical NSAIDs are effective in providing pain relief, and goes further to demonstrate that certain formulations, mainly gel formulations of diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen, provide the best results. Large amounts of unpublished data have been identified, and this could influence results in updates of this review.

### Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute musculoskeletal pain [^116F4iu4]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with reduced pain intensity in acute musculoskeletal conditions, but without increased adverse events?

Bottom Line

When treating musculoskeletal conditions such as sprains, strains, and contusions, topical NSAIDs are associated with greater pain relief, but are not associated with an increase in adverse events compared with placebo.

### Topical NSAIDs for acute pain in adults [^112rV5Sq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Use of topical NSAIDs to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions is widely accepted in some parts of the world, but not in others. Their main attraction is their potential to provide pain relief without associated systemic adverse events.

Objectives

To review the evidence from randomised, double-blind, controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of topically applied NSAIDs in acute pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and our own in-house database to December 2009. We sought unpublished studies by asking personal contacts and searching on-line clinical trial registers and manufacturers web sites.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, active or placebo (inert carrier)-controlled trials in which treatments were administered to adult patients with acute pain resulting from strains, sprains or sports or overuse-type injuries (twisted ankle, for instance). There had to be at least 10 participants in each treatment arm, with application of treatment at least once daily.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and validity, and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Forty-seven studies were included; most compared topical NSAIDs in the form of a gel, spray, or cream with a similar placebo, with 3455 participants in the overall analysis of efficacy. For all topical NSAIDs combined, compared with placebo, the number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) for clinical success, equivalent to 50% pain relief, was 4.5 (3.9 to 5.3) for treatment periods of 6 to 14 days. Topical diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and piroxicam were of similar efficacy, but indomethacin and benzydamine were not significantly better than placebo. Local skin reactions were generally mild and transient, and did not differ from placebo. There were very few systemic adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. There were insufficient data to reliably compare individual topical NSAIDs with each other or the same oral NSAID.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs can provide good levels of pain relief, without the systemic adverse events associated with oral NSAIDs, when used to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions.

### Efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of osteoarthritis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112vshZz]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, Scientific Citation Index, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and abstracts from conferences.

Review Methods

Inclusion criterion was randomised controlled trials comparing topical NSAIDs with placebo or oral NSAIDs in osteoarthritis. Effect size was calculated for pain, function, and stiffness. Rate ratio was calculated for dichotomous data such as clinical response rate and adverse event rate. Number needed to treat to obtain the clinical response was estimated. Quality of trial was assessed, and sensitivity analyses were undertaken.

Results

Topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo in relieving pain due to osteoarthritis only in the first two weeks of treatment. Effect sizes for weeks 1 and 2 were 0.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.66) and 0.40 (0.15 to 0.65), respectively. No benefit was observed over placebo in weeks 3 and 4. A similar pattern was observed for function, stiffness, and clinical response rate ratio and number needed to treat. Topical NSAIDs were inferior to oral NSAIDs in the first week of treatment and associated with more local side effects such as rash, itch, or burning (rate ratio 5.29, 1.14 to 24.51).

Conclusion

Randomised controlled trials of short duration only (less than four weeks) have assessed the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in osteoarthritis. After two weeks there was no evidence of efficacy superior to placebo. No trial data support the long term use of topical NSAIDs in osteoarthritis.

### Topical agents for the management of musculoskeletal pain [^116t1Mmu]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

The recent recognition of the magnitude of cardiovascular risk of both nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 selective inhibitors, in addition to the persistent concerns about the use of opioids, has brought increased attention to nonsystemic, topical analgesics. These agents have a favorable safety profile and there is increasing evidence indicating their efficacy for a variety of pain disorders. The use of topical analgesics in the treatment of the most prevalent musculoskeletal pain syndromes is described, with a focus on mechanisms for drug delivery and clinical trials data.

Assessing the Analgesic Efficacy of Topical NSAIDs

The analgesic efficacy of topical NSAIDs has been evaluated in several studies. In 2017, Derry et al. conducted a meta-analysis of existing Cochrane reviews and concluded that the evidence from these studies ranged from moderate to high quality. Risk of bias was defined as variations in efficacy at specific doses resulting from differences in formulations and compounds, as well as factors such as short or inadequate trial durations, incomplete outcome data, lack of blinding, insufficient allocation concealment, and small sample sizes. For acute musculoskeletal pain, topical diclofenac emulgel had the lowest number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.8 for 50% pain reduction (95% CI, 1.5 to 2.1), followed by ketoprofen gel (NNT, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 3.4) and piroxicam gel (NNT, 4.4; 95% CI, 3.2 to 6.9). Diclofenac plaster showed similar efficacy to piroxicam gel (fig. 2; table 2). There is a lack of conclusive evidence for the efficacy of other NSAIDs.

### Longterm efficacy of topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in knee osteoarthritis: metaanalysis of randomized placebo controlled clinical trials [^113iZHXP]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the longterm efficacy of topical therapies for pain control in primary knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

Systematic literature search was carried out from January 1, 1966, to December 31, 2004, in Pubmed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane database. Manual searches of related journals in the National Medical Library (New Delhi, India), the library of our institute, and conference abstracts were also carried out. We included randomized controlled clinical trials of 4 weeks or more comparing any topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with placebo or vehicle. Effect size for pain control was estimated.

Results

Out of 172 citations, 4 studies fulfilled all the specified criteria. Four of them compared topical NSAID with placebo or vehicle. Pooled effect of topical NSAID measured at 4 weeks or beyond was superior to placebo/vehicle in pain relief (mean effect size -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.14).

Conclusion

Topical NSAID are effective for pain relief in knee OA for a longer duration; however, this may not hold true for all the preparations.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114zgaNk]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Method

Protocol and registration

This work forms part of a project examining the relative efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in OA and neuropathic pain. The protocol is publishedand is also available on PROSPERO (2016:CRD42016035254).

Eligibility criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any topical NSAID or capsaicin to placebo in participants with OA were included. No other comparators were included for this analysis and only placebo-controlled trials were examined. Participants with painful physician-diagnosed OA (clinical or radiographic) or chronic joint pain attributable to OA at any site (excluding the spine) were included. Spinal pain was excluded as it is difficult to differentiate between OA pain and back pain secondary to other aetiologies. Trials with pain due to multiple conditions were included if the data for OA could be extracted separately.

Trials had to be a minimum of 1 week duration and report pain outcomes. Full texts published in any language and at any date were considered.

Identification and selection of trials

A search strategy, based on terms for (1) RCTs; (2) topical administration; (3) OA; and (4) capsaicin or NSAIDs, was created (Supplementary Information).

Medline, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Cochrane library were searched up to 16/11/2015. The searches were updated on 10/01/2018. In addition, reference lists of included publications and meta-analyses in the area were searched for eligible trials.

Citations were exported to Endnote where duplicates were removed before titles, abstracts, and full texts were assessed for eligibility.

### Predicting response to topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in osteoarthritis: an individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111782ji]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

To identify predictors of the specific (difference between treatment and placebo) and overall (change from baseline in treatment arm) treatment effects of topical NSAIDs in OA.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of topical NSAIDs in OA were identified through systematic literature searching and inquiry to pharmaceutical companies. The raw, de-identified data were analysed in one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA). Negative values for treatment effects (0–100 scale) indicate pain reduction.

Results

Of 63 eligible RCTs, 15 provided IPD (n = 1951 on topical NSAID), including 11 placebo-controlled RCTs (n = 1587 on topical NSAIDs, 1553 on placebo). Seven potential predictors of response were examined. Topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo [−6 (95% CI −9, −4)], with a small, but statistically significant greater effect in women than men [difference −4 (95% CI −8, −1)]. The overall treatment effect was 4-fold larger than the specific effect [−25 (95% CI −31, −19)] and increased with greater baseline pain severity (P < 0.001). No differences in efficacy were observed for age, BMI, features of inflammation, duration of complaints or radiographic OA severity.

Conclusion

Topical NSAIDs are effective for OA pain relief. Greater overall pain relief in individuals with more baseline pain might be due to contextual and non-specific effects, including regression to the mean. Additional factors that have been linked either mechanistically or through empirical evidence to outcomes should be selected for inclusion across future RCTs in order to facilitate the identification of response predictors through IPD-MA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^115w1KEY]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD hip & knee osteoarthritis — topical NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) efficacy and safety: Diclofenac is the only commercially manufactured topical NSAID currently available in the U.S., and trials found topical diclofenac to be superior to placebo and equivalent to oral diclofenac at reducing pain associated with OA of the knee, with another RCT showing no significant difference between topical and oral diclofenac; diclofenac gel provided statistically significant pain relief over placebo and vehicle control. Studies with topical ketoprofen and topical piroxicam compared to oral NSAIDs showed no significant difference in pain reduction, and topical NSAIDs showed indirect superiority over oral acetaminophen, opioids, and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, although these agents have not been compared in head-to-head trials. Treatment with topical NSAIDs was associated with significantly fewer gastrointestinal adverse events but more local adverse events compared to oral NSAIDs; safety data are mostly limited to 12-week follow-up, two open-label studies showed the safety profile of topical diclofenac at one year to be consistent with results at 12 weeks, and the systematic evidence review yielded no studies evaluating the effect of topical NSAIDs on pain associated with OA of the hip.

### Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for management of pain after PRK: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1147hq6J]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic

Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for management of pain in patients after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).

Clinical Relevance

Pain after PRK is a major concern for both patients and surgeons. Although evidence supports the use of NSAIDs postoperatively, no consensus exists regarding the preferred regimen. The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of different topical NSAIDs.

Methods

This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023417651). A systematic search of electronic databases was performed, for randomized controlled trials reporting topical NSAIDs' outcomes of corneal re-epithelization, rescue analgesics intake, and pain in days 0 to 3 after PRK (postoperative days [PODs] 0 to 3). Studies were graded for risk of bias. Data were extracted, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were evaluated in a network meta-analysis in accordance with the Cochrane's guidelines, to which a frequentist approach model was fitted. Transitivity was assessed using the net split method. Treatment effectiveness was ranked using forest plots based on comparison with placebo. P-scores (P) and league tables were used to examine combined direct and indirect comparisons.

Results

Of 1540 studies identified, 27 were included. These encompassed 2286 patients across 11 countries, evaluating 7 distinct topical NSAIDs. At POD0, ketorolac (P 0.764), flurbiprofen (P 0.763), and bromfenac (P 0.717) were the most efficient drugs overall and displayed significantly lower pain scores than placebo. Other than that, flurbiprofen held the highest rank for reported pain throughout, significantly outperforming placebo on POD1 (P 0.874, SMD -1.19, 95% CI -1.86 to -0.52), POD2 (P 0.882, SMD -1.05, 95% CI -1.82 to -0.27), and POD3 (P 0.939, SMD -1.14, 95% CI -2.1 to -0.18). Other NSAIDs were significantly better than placebo only on POD1 and POD0. Rescue analgesic intake analysis favored indomethacin (P 0.834, SMD -0.8, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.27), ketorolac, and diclofenac. Compared with placebo, re-epithelization was slowed to different significances with all NSAIDs but flurbiprofen (P 0.991, SMD -0.7, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.03).

Conclusions

Flurbiprofen was favorable in pain scores on typically painful postoperative days and re-epithelization times. However, analgesics intake, a more objective outcome, suggested superiority of other NSAIDs. Inconsistencies may be explained by the small sample size. For clinical interpretation, NSAID effect sizes should be taken into consideration.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^113jemcj]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Topical NSAIDs offer an alternative to decrease the risk of systemic NSAIDs. Although topical NSAIDs are considered relatively safe, their skin adverse effects (AEs) cannot be ignored (ranging from 10% to 39%). With respect to systemic AEs, GI bleeding, dyspepsia, acute renal impairment and asthma have been reported in relation to topical NSAIDs. Furthermore, the prevalence of systemic AEs in the older population has been reported to be as high as 17.5%, of which 2%–9% may be GI AEs. However, these studies did not have control groups and the risk cannot be wholly attributed to the use of topical NSAIDs. Therefore, the safety profile of topical NSAIDs remains unclear.

The Osteoarthritis Research Society International guidelines consider topical NSAIDs to be safer and better tolerated than oral NSAIDs in knee OA. In UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend topical NSAIDs ahead of systemic analgesics (ie, paracetamol, oral NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors and opioids) for knee and hand OA. In 2004, we conducted a conventional meta-analysis and found that topical NSAIDs were effective for OA pain, but the efficacy only remained significant in the first 2 weeks of application when compared with placebo. Due to the limited number of trials (13) included at the time, the results may not be conclusive. More recently, a meta-analysis of 215 trials reported that topical NSAIDs exhibited the largest overall treatment effect (ie, specific treatment effect plus contextual effect) for pain relief in OA among 11 representative treatments, including complementary, pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical treatments. Although recommended and known to be effective, it is still a challenge to choose a particular topical NSAID when faced with so many available options that vary in terms of the contained NSAID, carrier and mode of application (eg, cream, gel and patch).

A recent Cochrane systematic review examined the efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs in chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, it was not specific to OA and could not compare the relative efficacy between topical NSAIDs as it was not a network meta-analysis. Furthermore, it used only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for safety assessment. RCTs are only relevant for AEs with a high incidence, while observational studies are required for AEs that occur with moderate-low incidence and that require longer term to occur.

We undertook this systematic review and network meta-analysis of RCTs and observational studies and have ranked the topical NSAIDs (including salicylate) based on the results.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112UYGwu]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including salicylate, for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

Methods

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched from 1966 to January 2017. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical NSAIDs with placebo or each other in patients with OA and observational studies comparing topical NSAIDs with no treatment or each other irrespective of disease were included. Two investigators identified studies and independently extracted data. Bayesian network and conventional meta-analyses were conducted. The primary outcomes were pain relief for RCTs and risk of adverse effects (AEs) for observational studies.

Results

43 studies, comprising 36 RCTs (7 900 patients with OA) and seven observational studies (218 074 participants), were included. Overall, topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo for relieving pain (standardised mean difference (SMD) = −0.30, 95% CI −0.40 to –0.20) and improving function (SMD = −0.35, 95% CI −0.45 to –0.24) in OA. Of all topical NSAIDs, diclofenac patches were most effective for OA pain (SMD = −0.81, 95% CI −1.12 to –0.52) and piroxicam was most effective for functional improvement (SMD = −1.04, 95% CI −1.60 to –0.48) compared with placebo. Although salicylate gel was associated with higher withdrawal rates due to AEs, the remaining topical NSAIDs were not associated with any increased local or systemic AEs.

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs were effective and safe for OA. Diclofenac patches may be the most effective topical NSAID for pain relief. No serious gastrointestinal and renal AEs were observed in trials or the general population. However, confirmation of the cardiovascular safety of topical NSAIDs still warrants further observational study.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^113TZCZj]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain is a leading reason for seeking medical care, necessitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate analgesic treatment. When oral administration is impractical due to nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or gastrointestinal issues, or when pain is localized, topical analgesics offer an effective alternative for managing both acute and chronic pain conditions, including osteoarthritis and neuropathic pain. These agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lidocaine, and capsaicin, can provide pain relief while minimizing systemic side effects. Technological advances, such as nanocarriers and microneedles, aim to improve efficacy but face challenges like cost and toxicity. Here, the authors explore the pharmacology and clinical efficacy of topical analgesics, providing recommendations for their use in pain management.

### Topical NSAID therapy for musculoskeletal pain [^112tZNAX]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Systematic reviews previously reported in the literature document that topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in relieving pain in acute and chronic painful musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis, tendonitis, and muscle strains. Because several topical NSAIDs are available, with important differences among the formulations, there is a need to address and summarize the evidence of their effectiveness and safety.

Design

We searched Medline and Cochrane CENTRAL databases for clinical trials and systematic reviews of topical NSAIDs in musculoskeletal pain, using the following keywords: "NSAID", nonsteroidal", antiinflammatory", topical", cream", gel", solution", lotion", patch", plaster", musculoskeletal", tendonitis", strain", sprain", trauma", and word roots "pain" and "arthritis".

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs may vary significantly in their absorption kinetics and pharmacodynamic effects, based on NSAID molecule and the formulation chosen. Some topical NSAID formulations have been shown to be more effective than placebo in multiple studies, or to have comparable efficacy and a better safety profile than oral NSAIDs for single joint osteoarthritis and acute muscle injuries. In acute and chronic low back pain, widespread musculoskeletal pain, and in peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes, the current evidence does not support the use of topical NSAIDs.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^117QHUNK]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A recent network meta-analysis that compared seven different oral NSAIDs for the treatment of OA found that diclofenac 150 mg/day was the most effective for pain and function. Several RCTs have confirmed that the clinical efficacy of topical diclofenac or ibuprofen is comparable with their corresponding oral forms, but with better tolerability and safety, which support the use of topical NSAIDs ahead of their oral counterparts. In addition, the superior safety of topical NSAIDs in terms of GI, CV and renal risks has also been shown in the general population when compared with oral NSAIDs. On the basis of our findings, topical NSAIDs can be readily prescribed for the treatment of OA irrespective of common comorbidities or other medications. The choice of topical NSAID may be made according to the order presented in figure 3. The order should be based on both the SMD and its 95% CI and diclofenac patch is, therefore, the first line topical NSAID.

The status of OA treatment guidelines

Given the proven efficacy and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, they are now included in a number of international guidelines for the treatment of patients with OA of the hand or knee (Table 3).–Some treatment guidelines have further recommended that topical NSAIDs be considered for use before oral analgesics. For example, guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommend that topical NSAIDs be used before oral NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors, or opioids. The European League Against Rheumatism considers topical NSAIDs safe and efficacious in the treatment of OA of the knee, but it does not give specific recommendations. For the treatment of OA of the hand, the European League Against Rheumatism recommends topical treatments over systemic treatments. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends the use of topical NSAIDs in patients who are unresponsive to first-line treatment with acetaminophen.

Before 2007, when topical NSAID formulations received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, topical NSAIDs were not included in US treatment guidelines for OA, in contrast with European Union guidelines. However, after US Food and Drug Administration approval of topical NSAIDs, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons updated its recommendations to strongly recommend oral or topical NSAIDs as first-line therapy for all patients with OA of the knee. The most recent guidelines from the American Geriatric Society also recommend the use of topical analgesics in all patients with localized non-neuropathic pain. The American Pain Society's most recent guidelines on OA are from 2002; therefore, recommendations regarding the use of topical NSAIDs are currently unavailable from the American Pain Society.

In 2012, the American College of Rheumatology updated its recommendations to conditionally recommend that patients with OA of the hand be treated with either topical or oral NSAIDs, topical capsaicin, or tramadol. For the treatment of OA of the knee, the new American College of Rheumatology guidelines conditionally recommend the use of acetaminophen, oral or topical NSAIDs, tramadol, or intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Further, the American College of Rheumatology guidelines recommend that elderly individuals over the age of 75 years who are in need of an NSAID should be treated with topical, rather than oral, NSAIDs.

Relative evidence of analgesic efficacy of topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in acute pain (A, blue bars) and of topical NSAIDs, capsaicin, and lidocaine in osteoarthritis-induced (OA) pain (B, yellow bars). Quality of evidence for efficacy ranges from very low to high and was collected from several sources.–

For chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis, the primary outcome was defined as at least a 50% reduction in pain. The authors concluded that topical diclofenac preparations are effective for moderate osteoarthritis-induced pain, with an NNT of 5.0 (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) for long-term use, but less than 6 weeks. Ketoprofen used during a period of 6 to 12 weeks has an NNT of 6.9 (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.3), and topical diclofenac preparations during the same period have an NNT of 9.8 (95% CI, 7.1 to 16). An interesting general observation is that topical NSAID creams and plasters had higher NNTs as compared to gel or emulgel formulations, suggesting that gels are more effective than creams and plasters (fig. 2; table 2).

Several studies have confirmed the accumulation of NSAIDs in target tissues. For example, Efe et al. investigated diclofenac concentrations in the synovial tissue and synovial fluid of patients with joint effusion. These patients were randomized to apply diclofenac sodium 4% spray gel to their knees either two or three times daily during a 3-day treatment period. The authors found that diclofenac concentrations were 10 to 20 times higher in the synovial tissue as compared to the synovial fluid and blood plasma.

Two meta-analyses conclude that topical NSAIDs may be considered safe in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain. Risk of bias was defined as described in "Assessing the Analgesic Efficacy of Topical NSAIDs". Unlike oral NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs are not associated with gastrointestinal adverse events, and there was no significant difference in the odds ratio for gastrointestinal disorders between topical NSAIDs and placebo.

Topical NSAIDs were the only intervention that improved all outcomes in this population and were not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk for adverse effects; topical NSAIDs plus menthol gel also improved pain at less than 2 hours and symptom relief, although there is no evidence that the combination provides additional benefit over topical NSAIDs alone and topical NSAIDs may not always be appropriate first-line therapy, such as in cases of severe injury.

Topicals

Out of the 17 studies included in this study, 6 reported level 1 evidence in support of the use of topical NSAIDs for knee osteoarthritis.9 studies reported level 2 evidence in support of topical NSAIDsone reported level 3 evidence in support of topical NSAIDs; and one study reported level 2 evidence not in favor of topical NSAID therapy. Adverse events were rare in all included studies, primarily limited to minor skin irritation at the site of application. The clinical effect of topical NSAIDs was modest at best in comparison to placebo, but all studies did report statistically significant improvements in pain reduction. There was insufficient evidence to support recommendations for other topical medications (eg, capsaicin, copper). Osteoarthritis of the knee was the only diagnosis with sufficient literature to support recommendations regarding topical NSAID therapy.

Importantly, five separate studies demonstrated non-inferiority to oral NSAID therapy. Of note, one study reported inferiority of topical NSAID therapy in comparison to placebo. Indeed, the placebo effect was readily apparent in each study, which is a well-known phenomenon found in trials of topical medications (see Table 10).

Table 10
Evidence Table Regarding Topicals

To sum, topical NSAIDs have established efficacy comparable to oral NSAID therapy in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, with a vastly improved adverse side effect profile and decreased cost. Topical NSAIDs may be preferable for patients with knee osteoarthritis older than 75, those with comorbidities or at an increased risk of renal, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal adverse events.

Consensus Points for Topicals

Topical NSAIDs are an effective treatment for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and can be utilized as part of as an adjuvant analgesic treatment plan; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
Topical NSAIDs should be utilized before oral NSAID therapy for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^112mmXtP]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, the analgesic efficacy of topical NSAIDs has been assessed in multiple studies. For acute musculoskeletal pain, diclofenac emulgel had the lowest NNT of 1.8, followed by ketoprofen gel and piroxicam gel. For chronic osteoarthritis pain, there is evidence that topical diclofenac and ketoprofen are effective for moderate pain but with higher NNTs than for acute pain. There is not much evidence to support the efficacy of topical salicylate and other NSAIDs. An interesting observation is that gels seem to be more effective than creams and plasters. Additionally, NSAIDs were found to accumulate significantly more in synovial tissue as compared to synovial fluid and blood plasma. Meta-analyses suggest that topical NSAIDs are safe for treating osteoarthritis pain and do not cause gastrointestinal adverse events, unlike oral NSAIDs.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1119rpsm]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Summary

Objective

To compare the efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with topical capsaicin for pain relief in osteoarthritis (OA).

Design

A systematic literature search was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining any topical NSAID or capsaicin in OA. Pain relief at or nearest to 4 weeks was pooled using a random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) in a Frequentist and Bayesian setting. Analysis was conducted for all trials and for trials using drugs listed as licensed for OA in the British National Formulary (BNF).

Results

The trial network comprised 28 RCTs (7372 participants), of which 17 RCTs (3174 participants) were included in the as licensed analyses. No RCTs directly compared topical NSAIDs with capsaicin. Placebo was the only common comparator for topical NSAIDs and capsaicin. Frequentist and Bayesian effect size (ES) estimates were in agreement. Topical NSAIDs were statistically superior to placebo overall (ES 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19 to 0.41) and as licensed (ES 0.32, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.39). However, capsaicin was only statistically superior to placebo when used at licensed doses (ES 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.64). No significant differences were observed in pain relief between topical NSAIDs and capsaicin (overall: ES 0.04, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.33; as licensed: ES-0.09, 95% CI −0.34 to 0.16).

Conclusions

Current evidence indicates that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in licensed doses may be equally effective for pain relief in OA. Whether the equivalence varies between individuals remains unknown.

Discussion

Current evidence indicates that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, when used as licensed, are both superior to placebo for pain relief. No significant differences were identified in the level of pain relief offered by topical NSAIDs compared to capsaicin. However, limited and poor quality evidence for capsaicin in OA provides uncertainty. Displaying seemingly negligible differences in efficacy, the decision of whether to prescribe topical NSAIDs or capsaicin should be guided by patient preference, safety, costs, and subsequent individual patient response.

Focussing on licensed doses of these two drugs renders the results of this meta-analysis more relevant for clinicians as they relate directly to the drugs recommended for prescription. The list of approved drugs was extracted from the BNF, a resource commonly used to guide prescribing practice in the UK. The BNF was chosen as the leading authority on clinicians' selection of medicines in the UK, however it should be noted that they offer only recommendations of licensed medications and physicians can prescribe medications outside the recommended list.

No direct or indirect (via NMA) quantitative evidence of the relative efficacy of topical NSAIDs vs capsaicin has been published previously. Some guidelines, such as those by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), provide equal recommendations for the two treatments. This may indicate a perceived equivalence in efficacy, in line with the findings of the current meta-analysis. In contrast, a narrative review examining topical treatments in OA concluded that capsaicin had less efficacy than topical NSAIDs. Similarly, topical NSAIDs are generally favoured in guidelines such as those by NICE and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), perhaps indicating a postulated greater efficacy for topical NSAIDs. In addition, OARSI guidelines granted topical NSAIDs a greater mean benefit score (6.0/10) vs capsaicin (5.1/10) 2. However, the comparative efficacy of the treatments in the narrative review was concluded primarily based on their mechanism of action, rather than quantitative analysis. Capsaicin was thought to be less effective as it lacked significant tissue penetration and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, guideline decisions are based not only on perceived efficacy, but on the quality of evidence. Indeed, the preference of topical NSAIDs may reflect a greater confidence in the evidence, rather than a perception of a larger effect. This is in keeping with the wide CI and associated uncertainty in the true effect of capsaicin in the current meta-analysis.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1171NcEr]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Although pain in OA has traditionally been viewed as nociceptive in nature, it is now widely accepted that some people experience pain with neuropathic-like pain components. Pain descriptors indicative of neuropathic pain, such as "burning" and "shooting" pain are used by subsets of individuals with OA. In fact, almost 15% of people with knee pain report neuropathic-like pain. This subgroup is of importance as true neuropathic pain is often difficult to manage and commonly does not respond to traditional analgesics, such as NSAIDs. Capsaicin, however, is licensed and used in neuropathic pain, where it is effective at higher doses. It may therefore be that individuals with predominantly nociceptive OA pain benefit from topical NSAIDs whilst those with neuropathic pain components may benefit more from topical capsaicin. Further evidence on pain phenotypes and response to these two commonly used topical analgesics is warranted.

AAOS osteoarthritis of the knee — topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used to improve function and quality of life for treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, when not contraindicated. Strength of Recommendation: Strong. High quality studies show that topical NSAIDs could result in improved function and quality of life over placebo gel, though inconsistent evidence suggests no significant difference in pain and adverse events between topical NSAIDs and control. For benefits and harms of implementation, topical NSAIDs are now available over the counter, should be used with caution in certain health conditions such as stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure, and there is a risk for skin sensitivity. Resource considerations note that over-the-counter availability will make prescription coverage less and may pose barriers for those without health savings accounts or insurance, and patients might not be willing to apply a topical gel multiple times a day. Acceptability is described as acceptable if cost is not prohibitive and there is no skin irritation from the gel, and feasibility highlights over-the-counter pharmacy availability with main barriers of cost and having to apply the gel multiple times a day. Future research might determine whether continued topical NSAID use is required to sustain benefits or if benefits continue after a defined period of time.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112yriyi]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There are several caveats to this study. First, the number of RCTs for some topical NSAIDs is relatively small, especially in hand OA. Second, although the present study indicated that overall topical NSAIDs were effective and safe for OA, diclofenac patch was the most effective and only topical NSAID to reach the MCID in pain relief. Third, most of the follow-up periods of the included studies were relatively short, only examined the short (1–6 weeks) and medium-term (6–12 weeks) efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs in RCTs. This is problematic for safety profiles as it is not possible to measure long-term outcomes for drug safety, such as GI and CV events. We, therefore, included the observational studies to overcome this limitation. Fourth, we only identified seven observational studies (218 074 participants) for the assessment of the safety of topical NSAIDs in the real world setting, irrespective of the target condition. A population-based and well-controlled cohort study is still needed to confidently determine a causal relationship between topical NSAIDs and AEs, especially CV AEs in people with OA. Fifth, like other meta-analyses, heterogeneity may affect the results of this meta-analysis. Last but not least, after excluding industry-funded/sponsored trials, only diclofenac patch was statistically superior to placebo for pain relief and none of the topical NSAIDs was better than placebo for functional improvement. This suggests that the efficacy of topical NSAIDs may be inflated by industry involvement. However, the limited number of remaining non-industry-funded/sponsored trials (only 12 trials for pain relief and 11 trials for functional improvement) may be too small to detect the difference, as these trials were small (ranging from 31 to 179 participants, median size 100). Further non-industry-funded/sponsored trials for topical NSAIDs are still needed, as this is a group of drugs with greater contextual effect than their oral counterpartsand it is more difficult to blind participants in trials and hence very easy to inflate their treatment benefits over placebo. We also attempted to examine whether trials with ≥ 100 participants per arm would give a different conclusion but failed as only 13 trials which fulfilled this criterion.

Methods

Literature search

Systematic literature searches were undertaken using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Search strategies, using a series of keywords related to topical NSAIDs (including salicylate), formulations and study designs, were used to identify relevant RCTs in patients with OA and relevant observational studies in any condition (online supplementary appendix 1) from 1966 to January 2017. The database search was supplemented by subsequent periodic scrutiny of unpublished and ongoing RCTs from the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP). In addition, references of the retrieved papers and reviews were manually reviewed.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria for RCTs were as follows: (1) RCTs; (2) studies on patients with OA at any joint; (3) studies comparing topical NSAIDs (including salicylate) with placebo or each other; (4) studies reporting pain, function or AE outcomes in patients and (5) studies published in any language. The following studies were excluded: (1) secondary analyses, including some combined data analyses of published RCTs; (2) studies where the follow-up time was less than 1 week; (3) cross-over design studies; (4) topical NSAIDs combined with other drugs; (5) studies for postoperative pain and (6) abstract only (insufficient data).

The inclusion criteria for observational studies were as follows: (1) observational studies (case-control, nested case-control, cross-sectional, cohort or longitudinal studies); (2) studies comparing topical NSAIDs (including salicylate) with no treatment or each other; (3) studies reporting any AE outcomes in humans and (4) studies published in any language. The following studies were excluded: (1) ophthalmological conditions and (2) abstract only.

### Topical NSAID formulations [^113Sx767]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

This article reviews topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) formulations available in the United States, including advantages and disadvantages, therapeutic usefulness, adverse effects, and formulation considerations.

Results

In the United States, several topical NSAID products are approved to treat painful conditions including diclofenac sodium 1% gel (Voltaren Gel®; Endo Pharmaceuticals), diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% w/w in 45.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (PENNSAID®; Mallinckrodt, Inc.), and diclofenac epolamine 1.3% (Flector Patch®; Alpharma Pharmaceuticals LLC, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.). Recent studies suggest topical diclofenac preparations are effective for osteoarthritis pain and suggest the efficacy of topical formulations is similar to that achieved with oral NSAID formulations. All NSAID formulations contain the same boxed warnings regarding cardiovascular and renal toxicity; however, topical NSAIDs are proposed to have a more favorable safety profile than oral NSAIDs due to the low serum concentrations achieved with topical NSAID formulations.

Conclusions

Topical NSAIDs have been shown to be beneficial from both a therapeutics and adverse effect perspective, and are increasingly recommended in treatment guidelines.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first IPD-MA conducted to identify predictors of response to topical NSAIDs in OA. Topical NSAIDs were statistically better than placebo for OA pain (6 points on a 0–100 scale) and produced total pain reductions from baseline, including placebo effects, that were clinically significant (25 points improvement). The results were consistent across different outcome points (nearest to 4 weeks or repeated measures) and IPD-MA approaches (one-stage and two-stage IPD-MAs). Baseline pain predicted overall treatment effect, but other patient-level factors measured in RCTs of topical NSAIDs were not clinically meaningful predictors of response. Future RCTs in OA should measure additional patient characteristics that potentially may be of value for stratification of responses.

We show that participants with higher pain at baseline may report more pain relief than those with less pain at baseline. However, no interaction was observed between baseline pain and topical NSAIDs for the specific treatment effect, possibly indicating that baseline pain is a prognostic factor for the contextual or non-specific effects (such as the Hawthorn effect and regression to the mean) of topical NSAIDs. Previous study-level evidence has shown an association between increased baseline pain severity and increased contextual responses in OA. The present IPD-MA extends these findings to demonstrate that the majority of the treatment effects of topical NSAIDs derive from contextual effects and that the magnitude of contextual effects is dependent on baseline pain levels.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^112McR33]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Efficacy of topical NSAIDs in relieving OA pain

NSAIDs that are available in topical formulations include ketoprofen, diclofenac, ibuprofen, eltenac, felbinac, and piroxicam, all of which have been available in the European Union for more than a decade. Among the topical NSAIDs, topical diclofenac, available as a spray, gel, patch, bio-adhesive plaster, or lotion, has been most extensively tested against placebo in the treatment of OA-related pain.

Only two topical diclofenac formulations have been approved in the United States for the treatment of OA: diclofenac sodium 1% topical gel (Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Chadds Ford, PA, USA; 2007)and diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution (Mallinckrodt Inc, Hazelwood, MO, USA; 2009). A third topical diclofenac formulation, diclofenac epolamine 1.3% topical patch (King Pharmaceuticals Inc, Bristol, TN, USA; 2008), has been approved in the United States for the treatment of pain due to minor strains, sprains, and contusions, but it has not received approval for the treatment of OA. These three topical diclofenac formulations differ in the penetration enhancer utilized, dosage form, and degree of systemic absorption (Table 1).–

Several systematic reviews have compared the short-term (2–4 weeks) effects of topical NSAIDs with those of placebo and consistently demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain at 2 weeks, beyond what could be attributed to rubbing alone. Mason et al conducted a meta-analysis of data from 14 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving nearly 600 patients with OA of the knee; compared with placebo, the relative benefit of topical NSAIDs was 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6–2.6). Lin et al conducted an independent meta-analysis and reported that topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo in relieving pain due to OA in the first 2 weeks of treatment, but not in weeks 3 and 4. For weeks 1 and 2, the effect sizes observed in this study were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.16–0.66) and 0.40 (0.15–0.65), respectively. Likewise, topical NSAIDs produced a greater improvement in functioning in weeks 1 and 2 but not in weeks 3 and 4, when compared with placebo.

Quality assessment

The Cochrane risk of the bias assessment tool was used to determine the methodological quality of RCTs. A total of six domains were evaluated: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, participant blinding, outcome assessor blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Each domain was assigned a judgement of low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. The judgments for each domain were made strictly following the Cochrane Handbook V.5.1.0, Chapter 8.5.

The methodological quality of the observational studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), which was developed to assess the quality of non-randomised studies based on three broad domains: selection of the study groups, comparability among different groups and ascertainment of either the exposure or outcome of interest. The total score of NOS ranges from 0 to 9 based on its assessment items.

Outcome measures

For RCTs, the primary outcome was pain relief. The secondary outcome was functional improvement. The change-from-baseline score at the last follow-up period was used/calculated. If a study reported multiple pain scales, the scale with the highest sensitivity to change was used. The function subscale of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) was used for the assessment of functional improvement. If a study did not measure or report WOMAC function, the Lequesne Index or one of the other functional measurement scales was used instead. If the original paper was unavailable/unpublished, the outcomes were extracted from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, if available. If a study involved multiple treatment groups with different doses of the same drug, the data were combined into one treatment group. Only differences between two treatment arms were calculated. As different scales were used for the same outcome, the standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated.

To determine the safety and tolerability of topical NSAIDs, data from both RCTs and observational studies were analysed separately. The number of participants who experienced any AE (including local, GI, CV and renal AEs) and withdrawals due to AEs were calculated per group. The adjusted OR for any AE was derived for the safety of topical NSAIDs versus placebo/control. If unavailable, the crude OR was selected instead.

### Clinical trial data in support of changing guidelines in osteoarthritis treatment [^113FSVxb]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Only two clinical trials have directly compared the efficacy of topical diclofenac with that of oral diclofenac. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled, multicenter trial conducted in 775 patients with OA of the knee by Simon et al comparing diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution with placebo, a dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle, oral diclofenac, and the combination of the topical diclofenac solution and oral diclofenac demonstrated that diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution was superior to both placebo and the dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle in reducing pain (P < 0.05) and improving function (P < 0.05). In addition, diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution was superior to placebo and the vehicle control in scores on patient overall health assessment (P < 0.05) at the end of the study period. No significant difference was found between diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution and oral diclofenac in pain (−6.0 vs −6.4, respectively; P = 0.429) or physical functioning (−15.8 vs −17.5, respectively; P = 0.319), and the combination of topical and oral diclofenac did not produce greater effects than oral diclofenac alone.

Tugwell et al also demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of 622 patients with OA of the knee that the efficacy of diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution provided equivalent degrees of improvement in pain relief compared with oral diclofenac (44% vs 49%, respectively; P = 0.23). This evidence is further supported by a recent Cochrane Database review, which demonstrated that topical NSAID formulations, particularly those that utilize diclofenac, produce consistent efficacy comparable with oral NSAIDs for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain.

### Perspectives of healthcare professionals towards combination use of oral paracetamol and topical non-steroidal inflammatory drugs in managing mild-to-moderate pain for osteoarthritis in a clinical setting: an exploratory study [^112gGGu1]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Combination Therapy of Paracetamol and Topical Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Mild-to-Moderate Osteoarthritis Pain

The panel (87.5% consensus) agreed that combination APAP therapy with topical NSAIDs was a safer alternative for managing OA than with oral NSAIDs (Figure 3A). One panel member disagreed on the safety profile of topical NSAIDs due to prior observations of patients presenting with adverse events, eg, skin blistering upon prior long-term usage of topical NSAIDs.

There was a lack of confidence in the combination use of APAP with topical NSAIDs among the panel members. All panel members agreed that the low prescription uptake of combination therapy of APAP with topical NSAIDs was due to lack of strong scientific evidence on the efficacy of combined therapy of APAP with topical NSAIDs versus APAP with oral NSAIDs (Figure 3B). There was also a perceived lack of awareness of the benefits and mechanism of action of topical NSAIDs (Figure 3C and D). The panel member with a neutral stance advised for additional investigations in scientific evidence to be conducted by independently and not by the manufacturing companies to add credibility of the evidence.

The majority (87.5%) agreed to consider increasing topical NSAIDs use in OA pain treatment, given the approval and use of topical NSAIDs as a first-line agent in OA treatment guidelines despite their preference for oral NSAIDs (Figure 3E). The panel member who disagreed would conditionally reconsider prescribing topical NSAIDs should more robust and convincing scientific evidence demonstrating the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in OA pain treatment be available.

### Comparison of skin permeation and putative anti-inflammatory activity of commercially available topical products containing ibuprofen and diclofenac [^116SasYB]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often prescribed to manage acute and chronic pain in patients suffering from various musculoskeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and trauma-related conditions such as sprains.

Common NSAIDs include ibuprofen, diclofenac, and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). These drugs exert pain relief and reduce inflammation through inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms COX-2, an inducible isoform of the enzyme that is typically upregulated in inflamed tissue, and COX-1, a constitutively expressed isoform that is generally more widely distributed.NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, have different relative selectivity for COX-1 or COX-2, with diclofenac being a more selective inhibitor for COX-2 compared to COX-1, while ibuprofen inhibits both COX isoforms similarly. The clinical effectiveness of topical ibuprofen and diclofenac for the management of acute (eg, sprains/strains) and chronic pain has been previously demonstrated.

Oral and intravenous NSAIDs are associated with risks for systemic adverse events including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal events;–therefore, topical NSAIDs are often used as effective alternatives with a decreased risk of systemic adverse events.–In addition to pharmacological potency against COX isoforms, drug absorption into the skin is a critical attribute for topical NSAIDs.–These drugs must penetrate the stratum corneum and permeate through the epidermis and dermis to reach the site of inflammation and pain in sufficient amounts to exert a clinical effect. Penetration and permeation can be affected by numerous factors, including application site, formulation chemistry, and drug properties.

While the clinical efficacy and in vitro skin permeability of certain topical NSAIDs have been evaluated previously, there have been no head-to-head comparisons of permeability and potency across multiple commercially available formulations using the same testing protocols. Because differences in efficacy (including intensity and durability of effect) and adverse reactions have been demonstrated with the use of different topically applied NSAIDs, it is important to understand the parameters and sources of potential differences when choosing an appropriate topical formulation for treating patient pain.

Specific treatment effect

Topical NSAIDs were statistically superior to placebo for pain relief at or nearest to 4 weeks [−6 (95% CI −9, −4)] (Fig. 2). Specific treatment effect estimates were comparable to the AD-MA [21 RCTs; 6191 participants; −8 (95% CI −10, −5); Supplementary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online]. The GRADE quality of evidence was moderate, limited by potential data availability bias (Supplementary Table S6, available at Rheumatology online). 2

Overall treatment effect

Participants using topical NSAIDs experienced, on average, a 25-point (95% CI −31, −19) decrease in pain at or nearest to 4 weeks (Fig. 3). A large variation in overall treatment effect was observed. The GRADE quality of evidence was deemed very low due to the study design, lack of blinding of active-controlled trials, inconsistency and potential data availability bias (Supplementary Table S7, available at Rheumatology online).

### Perspectives of healthcare professionals towards combination use of oral paracetamol and topical non-steroidal inflammatory drugs in managing mild-to-moderate pain for osteoarthritis in a clinical setting: an exploratory study [^116w9HYD]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study explored the receptiveness and current clinical practices among different types of healthcare professionals in various geographies towards using APAP monotherapy and combined therapy of APAP and topical NSAIDs for managing mild-to-moderate pain.

Oral paracetamol remains perceived by the panel as a gold standard for managing mild-to-moderate pain due to observations in real-world clinical settings despite scientific evidence demonstrating APAP high placebo effect. The perceived observed lack of awareness towards scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of topical NSAIDs as well as understanding of the mechanism of action could have hindered uptake of this treatment option. This is notwithstanding the updated recommendations in OA clinical guidelines for using topical NSAIDs in combination with APAP.

The findings suggest indications justifying the need for increasing the awareness of the suitability and potential benefits of using adjuvant topical NSAIDs to APAP for effectively managing mild-to-moderate OA pain. Further investigations are needed with larger datasets and more robust evidence on combination therapy of APAP with topical NSAIDs to validate this study's findings.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^11176ppN]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This is the first network meta-analysis to take into account all available evidence from RCTs directly or indirectly comparing topical NSAIDs in OA, thereby increasing the power of the study. For example, although there were only two trials for diclofenac patch (diclofenac patch vs placebo), there were 13 indirect comparisons (32 trials) through the network. The present study is also the first to summarise both RCTs and observational studies regarding the safety of topical NSAIDs. The main findings are: (1) topical NSAIDs are effective for the treatment of OA; (2) apart from topical salicylate acid, topical NSAIDs are not associated with serious GI and renal adverse events; (3) diclofenac patch is the most effective topical NSAIDs for pain relief, whereas topical piroxicam is the most effective topical NSAIDs for functional improvement.

Our previous conventional meta-analysis (13 RCTs) suggested that the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in OA only remained significant in the first 2 weeks compared with placebo. According to the NICE OA Guidelines 2014, both effect estimate and the related 95% CI need to be greater than 0.5 SD, corresponding to a 1.2 cm decrease on a 10 cm visual analogue scale, which was considered to be the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Although the present conventional meta-analysis (36 RCTs) further confirms the time-dependent effects of topical NSAIDs, they did not reach the MCID at any time-point (online supplementary appendix 5). A similar pattern was also observed for functional improvement (online supplementary appendix 5). However, care must be taken in the interpretation of this result, as the studies pooled at each time point were different. This may partially explain why there were some fluctuations/variations. Further studies to examine the wear-off effect of topical NSAIDs for analgesia and functional improvement in OA are still warranted.

### Pharmaceutical treatment of osteoarthritis [^116JgF4S]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review the current state of pharmaceutical treatment recommendations for the management of osteoarthritis.

Method

A narrative review was drafted to describe treatment guidelines, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity for nine classes of pharmaceuticals: 1) oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2) topical NSAIDs, 3) COX-2 inhibitors, 4) duloxetine, 5) intra-articular corticosteroids, 6) intra-articular hyaluronic acid, 7) acetaminophen (paracetamol), 8) tramadol, and 9) capsaicin.

Results

In general, oral and topical NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, are strongly recommended first-line treatments for osteoarthritis due to their ability to improve pain and function but are associated with increased risks in patients with certain comorbidities (e.g., heightened cardiovascular risks). Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are generally recommended for osteoarthritis management and have relatively minor adverse effects. Other treatments, such as capsaicin, tramadol, and acetaminophen, are more controversial, and many updated guidelines offer differing recommendations.

Conclusion

The pharmaceutical management of osteoarthritis is a constantly evolving field. Promising treatments are emerging, and medicines that were once considered conventional (e.g., acetaminophen) are gradually becoming less acceptable based on concerns with efficacy and safety. Clinicians need to consider the latest evidence and recommendations to make an informed decision with their patients about how to optimize treatment plans for patients with knee, hip, polyarticular, or hand osteoarthritis.

### Topical agents in the treatment of rheumatic pain [^113ozTYh]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

In rheumatic pain there is good evidence that topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are about as effective as oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but are probably safer and more tolerable because of much less systemic absorption and lower plasma concentrations. The best information is for topical diclofenac. For topical capsaicin, evidence of efficacy is trivial. For topical rubefacients there is no evidence of efficacy.

### Changes in pain and concurrent pain medication use following compounded topical analgesic treatment for chronic pain: 3-and 6-month follow-up results from the prospective, observational optimizing patient experience and response to topical analgesics study [^113VEJ5Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability in the US and worldwide–and a frequent reason for consultations with primary care and specialty clinicians.–Among a weighted total of 234.9 million who responded to the Functioning and Disability Supplement of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, 126.1 million (weighted percentage, 55.7) reported some pain in the past 3 months. Of these, 25.3 million experienced daily chronic pain, 23.4 million reported that they experienced a lot of pain, and 10.5 million suffered a lot of pain every day.

Chronic pain is associated with profound negative effects on personal, social, and psychological well-being,–increased morbidity and mortality, absenteeism and job loss,–and presenteeism, which is defined as reduced productivity attributable to physical, mental, or emotional illness or injury. Chronic pain is the number one cause of years lived with disabilityand increases the risk for other chronic illnesses, as well as all-cause mortality and death from cardiovascular disease.

Treatment goals for chronic pain focus on effective pain relief, improved quality of life, and enhanced functional ability. Medications, including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are commonly prescribed for chronic pain. The imperative to effectively treat patients with chronic pain, the established efficacy of opioid analgesics for pain management, and limited therapeutic alternatives to opioids are considered factors contributing to the overutilization of opioid medications in the US.

The number of prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances increased dramatically in recent years. During this time, rates of misuse, overuse, diversion, abuse, addiction, and death also escalated.–Together, these events prompted a national initiative to develop more effective regulatory policies and implement clinical strategies to safely and effectively manage pain. These efforts included national guidelines for clinicians, policy reports and recommendations by the US Surgeon General, and the development of the National Pain Strategy.

### Medication pain management in the elderly: unique and underutilized analgesic treatment options [^111YcWsd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By 2030, the US population of adults aged ≥ 65 years will increase by > 80%, and these adults will account for nearly 20% of the US population. In this population, the decline of multiple physiologic processes and diseases collectively influence treatment options. Physiologic changes, drug-drug interactions resulting from polypharmacy, and drug-disease interactions combine to make elderly patients more sensitive to the adverse events (AEs) associated with medications, all of which must be considered in drug selection.

Objective

This article focuses on select underutilized medication options for analgesia that may provide significant advantages in the elderly population above and beyond commonly prescribed conventional choices.

Methods

We performed a complete review of the literature using the search terms pain management, elderly, opioids, NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs, levorphanol, buprenorphine transdermal, and tapentadol. Databases searched included PubMed, Google Scholar, Ovid, and Athens. Package inserts were utilized for approval dates, indications, and formulations available. We looked at reviews of agents to identify important studies for consideration that searches may have missed. Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic data were taken from randomized trials focusing in this area. Pivotal Phase III trials were utilized for discussion of clinical trial experience and to summarize efficacy and AEs. For purposes of validity, only peer-reviewed literature was included.

Results

There were limited data that specifically outlined analgesic drug selection and highlighted safer alternatives for the elderly patient based on polypharmacy risks, end-organ deterioration, and/or drug choices that presented less risk. We focused on unique opioid alternatives: levorphanol, which offers several therapeutic advantages similar to methadone but without the pharmacokinetic and drug-interaction pitfalls associated with methadone; tapentadol, associated with significantly less gastrointestinal distress and constipation; and transdermal buprenorphine, an agonist/antagonist with less risk for the toxicities associated with conventional opioids and with compliance benefits. Topical NSAIDs are discussed as a viable therapeutic option. Specific attention to a more desirable tolerability profile, including avoidance of drug interactions, end-organ dysfunction, and gastrointestinal bleed with topical NSAID agents versus their oral counterparts is discussed, including the ability to achieve superior tissue levels for appropriately selected inflammatory conditions.

Conclusion

It is incumbent that providers consider these options as part of an analgesic armamentarium in an effort to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize risks in the increasing elderly patient population.

### Improvement of pain and function after use of a topical pain relieving patch: results of the RELIEF study [^1119jmMW]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is the most common reason for patients to consult primary care providers. Evaluation of effective treatments for pain relief is critical to identify safer opioid-sparing approaches to pain treatment. Chronic pain is often treated by oral opioids, yet datasuggest that patients still do not achieve adequate pain relief. Opioid based, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and common, over-the-counter oral medications have been associated with end-organ dysfunction including gastrointestinal (GI), cardiovascular (CV), renal and hepatic events. Alternative pain relief options have become increasingly common and include a combination of pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacological interventions.

Successful pain treatments, including multi-modal strategies, can address negative effects associated with chronic pain conditions, including a patient's quality-of-life, psychological well-being, and their everyday functional abilities.

National initiatives that include new guidelines and strategies have recently been published highlighting safe and effective pain management options. One group of therapies that have been suggested as a first-line treatment option are topical analgesics, a targeted therapy aimed at the location of pain. Previous research supports that topical agents are effective and safe for patients with chronic pain. By targeting the nociceptor pathways, topical formulations have reduced risk of systemic adverse events because of significantly less plasma exposure, bypassing absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) track, while delivering effective concentrations in the targeted tissues. Limited drug–drug interactions, less potential for misuse, ease of application, direct application to the targeted site of pain, patient satisfaction, and success in treating the patient's pain can provide advantages over systemically delivered oral medications.,

Although adverse GI and renal side effects appear reduced with topical versus oral diclofenac, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates that warnings be placed on all NSAID products about the risks of GI and CV adverse effects.

### Topical analgesics: pharmacology and clinical applications [^117Handa]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain is the primary reason patients seek medical attention. Accurately diagnosing and treating the specific type of pain with appropriate pain medications is essential to provide analgesia. Pain management involves not only selecting the appropriate analgesic but also determining the optimal route of administration. Oral administration can be challenging in some cases due to swallowing difficulties or gastrointestinal issues that affect drug absorption. In other cases, pain is strictly localized. For these patients, topical analgesics offer a suitable alternative. Although designed for localized pain relief, they are also effective in managing a range of painful conditions. These include acute pain, such as strains, muscle aches, and sprains, as well as chronic inflammatory pain, such as osteoarthritis-related pain, and neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia and pain from diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The spectrum of analgesics suitable for topical pain management encompasses nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the local anesthetic lidocaine, and other substances such as capsaicin, a vanilloid, a voltage gated channel blocker, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel (TRPV1) agonist. Topical analgesics can be similarly effective to oral analgesics, but they can bypass the risk of systemic adverse effects and problems associated with systemic absorption, metabolization and elimination. They can be beneficial for patients with impaired drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract or other gastrointestinal issues such as nausea/vomiting or difficulty swallowing.

The pharmacologic treatment of neuropathic pain remains particularly challenging due to the limited effectiveness of current therapies and the distinct mechanisms compared to acute and inflammatory pain. Topical analgesics, such as high-concentration lidocaine and capsaicin patches, have also found application and are recommended as potential therapeutics in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Here, we review pharmacology and efficacy of topical analgesics to provide recommendations for their application.

Topical diclofenac gel was shown to be superior to placebo in a large RCT (low RoB), leading to small improvements in pain and function, and not more AEs, after 8 weeks. Topical NSAIDs led to similar pain relief as oral NSAIDs, yet lower risk of any AE (RR 0.40 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.74)), gastrointestinal AEs (RR 0.64 (0.35 to 1.20)), severe AEs (RR 0.54 (0.17 to 1.71)), and withdrawals due to AEs (RR 0.15 (0.03 to 0.63)) (online supplementary table 5.2, figures S9-S11). Pooled safety data from two RCTs comparing topical diclofenac gel to placebo in patients with hand OA showed similar and low rates of AEs in subgroups at low versus high risk of NSAID-related AEs (ie, age ≥ 65 years, and with comorbid hypertension, type 2 diabetes or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease). A trial (low RoB) comparing topical ibuprofen cream to arnica cream found no between-group differences. Two studies (one high RoB, one unclear RoB) comparing topical NSAIDs with a non-pharmacological treatment reported superiority of the comparator. Topical capsaicin was assessed in one RCT (unclear RoB), reporting better pain relief than placebo at the cost of increased risk of local AEs (burning and stinging sensation, RR 3.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.5)), which likely also compromised the trial's success of blinding. A single application of topical salicylates was reported in two trials (high RoB) to lead to improvements in pain and stiffness, but also numerically more local AEs.

### Effectiveness and safety of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioid treatment for knee and hip osteoarthritis: network meta-analysis [^117LgMt9]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recent network meta-analyses have suggested that topical NSAIDs could be beneficial for osteoarthritis treatment. However, these analyses included observational studies and small trials of low methodological quality, or did not provide treatment effect estimates separately for each drug preparation and dose. Our findings are based on high quality randomised trials and indicate that topical diclofenac 70–81 mg/day might be the best treatment in terms of effectiveness and safety. However, all diclofenac topical trials included only patients with knee osteoarthritis, so the evidence is unclear for hip osteoarthritis. Patients with osteoarthritis who require analgesic treatment but have not responded to first line treatments, such as topical NSAIDs, and have a contraindication to oral NSAIDs, might be prescribed opioids or paracetamol. Recent reviews indicate that both treatments do not have a clinically relevant effect on osteoarthritis symptoms and also raised safety concerns. Our analyses indicate that the small benefits of opioids or paracetamol might be outweighed by potential harms, regardless of dose. However, our findings are based on average estimates and it is possible that some of the patients who did not respond to other treatments could still benefit from opioids or paracetamol. We have previously shown that no association exists between opioid dose and improvement in osteoarthritis pain. The findings of the current analysis corroborate this finding and also indicate that higher doses of opioids lead to more harm.

Pharmacologic Aspects of Topical Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used worldwide, primarily for treating inflammatory pain. However, their use is often restricted due to their tendency to cause gastrointestinal injury. Topical NSAIDs deliver effective drug levels to the affected area while minimizing the amount of drug entering the bloodstream and causing related adverse events. Topically applied NSAIDs are usually used for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, mainly after injuries, soft tissue pain, and rheumatic diseases (table 1). Similar to systemic administration, topical NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase 2–dependent synthesis of proinflammatory and proalgesic prostaglandins. This prevents the activation of prostaglandin receptors and the subsequent sensitization of ion channels in peripheral nerves(fig. 1). Topical NSAIDs are available in various formulations. For instance, diclofenac can be found as a hydrogel, emulsion gel, or patch (diclofenac hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine). Additionally, it is available as a solution combined with dimethyl sulfoxide.

One key question in the pharmacologic use of topical NSAIDs is whether a fraction of the applied drugs can enter the bloodstream and act systemically. This was investigated by several clinical studies. In a randomized, three-way crossover design study, participants received either an oral treatment or topical diclofenac sodium gel. The gel was applied in doses of 4 g to one knee four times daily (total daily dose, 16 g) or 4 g to each knee plus 2 g to both hands four times daily (total daily dose, 48 g). Mean plasma concentrations of diclofenac were approximately 17 times lower with topical administration than with oral treatment, and peak concentrations were approximately 150-fold lower. Likewise, only oral therapy was associated with treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events. Similar results are observed with other topical NSAIDs. Leppert et al. conclude that the blood serum concentration of an NSAID that was applied topically reaches only up to 15% of the concentration achieved after systemic administration. These results show that a portion of topically applied NSAIDs can enter the bloodstream and have a systemic effect. However, the concentrations in the plasma remain significantly lower as compared to those achieved with oral NSAIDs.

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115qHgAg]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of pain and disability for which two topical treatments are used: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin. Topical NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, reversibly block the production of prostanoids, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. Topical NSAIDs, alongside paracetamol, are recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as first line pharmacological treatments. Over £32 million's worth of prescriptions of topical NSAIDs were dispensed in community pharmacies in England in 2016. Topical NSAIDs are also freely available over-the-counter and are widely advertised to consumers. Meanwhile, capsaicin, the substance responsible for the warming spiciness of chili peppers, is primarily available on prescription in the UK. Almost 200,000 tubes of 0.025% capsaicin were dispensed in 2016, amounting to over £4 million. Capsaicin is thought to cause defunctionalisation of spontaneously active peripheral nociceptors that otherwise maintain chronic pain conditions.

Topical NSAIDs and capsaicin are applied directly to the skin over the painful joint and little to no active drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in their favourable safety profiles. Topical administration therefore offers a safe and effective alternative to oral analgesics for people with just one or a few painful peripheral joints, especially for individuals with comorbidities, multiple medications, or those wishing to avoid tablets. The efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in OA is documented, however, no evidence for their relative efficacy is available so far to guide clinicians' prescribing practice. We therefore undertook the present network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare topical NSAIDs with capsaicin in people with symptomatic OA.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^115gRSjH]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Topical NSAIDs versus systemic NSAIDs — recommendation and renal safety data: Topical NSAIDs are recommended for use in knee osteoarthritis based on evidence of equivalent efficacy for improving pain and function and superior systemic adverse effect profiles compared to oral NSAIDs. Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials indicate adverse effects of topical NSAIDs are similar to placebo except for increased local adverse effects, mostly mild skin reactions. Diclofenac is a topical NSAID approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis, and in a pooled safety analysis of 7 RCTs of topical diclofenac 1.5% use, among 138 patients using topical diclofenac for 4–12 weeks, no patients experienced a serious kidney adverse event; changes in blood pressure and kidney function were similar between the diclofenac and placebo/control groups. Studies with topical diclofenac also report that the level attained in blood is 0.4–2.2% of the maximum serum.

### Perspectives of healthcare professionals towards combination use of oral paracetamol and topical non-steroidal inflammatory drugs in managing mild-to-moderate pain for osteoarthritis in a clinical setting: an exploratory study [^112Jwixx]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20% of chronic pain globally has been attributed to osteoarthritis (OA). The global prevalence and incidence of OA in 2019 was estimated at 6,348.3 per 100,000 population and 492.2 per 100,000 population, respectively. Pain resulting from OA was associated with functional impairment, negative effects on mental health as well as significant avoidance of social activities, decline in work productivity, and activity impairment.

Pharmacological options recommended by various clinical guidelines for managing OA pain and improving function include oral analgesics, topicals, and intra-articular therapies. Oral analgesics such as oral paracetamol (hereafter APAP) and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were recommended for nociceptive OA pain. In events where oral analgesics may not provide clinically meaningful pain relief, opioids were considered as the next line of treatment for OA pain management and are often associated with risks of dependency and/or drug abuse.

In recent years, there had been discussions on the suitability of APAP being used as a first-line analgesic for OA due to small clinical effect size. This prompted a shift of many OA guidelines from recommending APAP monotherapy as a first-line pharmacologic to recommending adding adjuvant options, eg, topical/oral NSAIDs, or intra-articular injections of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid. For instance, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) OA guidelines 2018 reflected a neutral stance towards using APAP monotherapy for managing OA pain.

The emerging evidence on the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in clinical studies led to the approval of topical NSAIDs as first-line analgesic therapy or adjuvant treatment to APAP monotherapy for effective OA pain management. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) OA guidelinesas well as OA guidelines by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOHM)recommended topical NSAIDs to be used with APAP ahead of oral NSAIDs for mild-to-moderate OA pain management.

### Relative efficacy and safety of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for osteoarthritis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies [^112PKDpR]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Previous systematic reviews have indicated that the overall effect size of topical NSAIDs in the treatment of knee or hip OA is 0.44 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.62) for pain relief. However, the present study showed a smaller effect size (0.30, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.40), which may be explained by the recent publication of more high quality RCTs. The most novel finding is that diclofenac patch exhibited the largest effect on pain, even above that of diclofenac gel and solution. This may be due to the constant and continuous delivery of the active ingredient to the affected area by means of an occlusive bandage and slow release of the drug when compared with traditional topical formulations such as gel and solution. It may also be due to the higher contextual effects of patches than creams/gels. Due to the limited number of trials for other topical NSAIDs, we were unable to examine the different formulations for each topical NSAID. Thus more work needs to be done to confirm whether the patch formulation is indeed better than other formulations and what makes it better. Another possible explanation may be the shorter follow-up duration of diclofenac patch studies, as evidence suggests that the effects of topical NSAIDs may be gradually weakened with the passage of time. However, a subgroup analysis conducted by restricting to trials with efficacy data at 1 or 2 weeks for all topical NSAIDs showed that diclofenac patch still exhibited the largest effect.

For the overall safety of topical NSAIDs, only RCT evidence has been systematically reviewed previously. Although some individual RCTs have indicated higher skin reactions in topical NSAIDs than in placebo, this study did not confirm this. This may be due to the larger sample size lowering the likelihood of 'small study effects'. Another possible explanation is that a higher incidence of skin AEs may be attributed to specific topical NSAIDs (eg, diclofenac solution, diclofenac gel and salicylate gel). Furthermore, there were two trials with significantly higher skin reactions in placebo groups than in active groups, which may offset the effect of topical NSAIDs. It should be noted that one of the studies used hyaluronan gel as the placebo group. The present study also found that topical NSAIDs overall exhibited a higher withdrawal rate due to AEs than the placebo group (OR = 1.56). After excluding the trials with salicylate gel, which were associated with higher withdrawals due to AEs, we still observed a significant, but smaller AE risk (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.90).

### The relative efficacy of topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and capsaicin in osteoarthritis: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112wPxjR]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

The present meta-analysis is subject to several limitations. Firstly, the conclusions drawn are limited by the scarcity of data available on capsaicin in OA. Only four trials compare 0.025% capsaicin to placebo and no direct estimates were available to compare topical NSAIDs to capsaicin. The low number of studies and participants on capsaicin resulted in an estimate with much uncertainty. The equivalence of the drugs may therefore be an artefact of the wide CIs. Secondly, the probability of being the best treatment is based predominantly on the ES, not on the uncertainty of the estimate. The probability of being the best was chosen to facilitate the translation of results to clinical practice, however the results should be interpreted with caution and in conjunction with the ES estimates. Thirdly, risk of bias assessment identified concerns over the high risk of bias in included trials. Poor compliance with complete outcome data reporting, analysis of all randomised participants, and pre-specification of published outcomes all have the potential to overestimate the results of this meta-analysis. Fourthly, because capsaicin is associated with a warming sensation on application, making it difficult to blind, it was deemed a high risk of bias domain for all capsaicin trials. This may result in inherent differences in the placebo group across the trial network, threatening the assumption of transitivity. Furthermore, the efficacy data for topical NSAIDs is predominantly based on knee OA (22 of 23 studies), whilst the trial population for capsaicin included hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle OA. The differences in study populations may limit comparisons between the two treatments, however, it was not possible to conduct subgroup analyses by joint type due to limited data. Finally, by the very nature of analyses conducted at trial-level, the results of this NMA relate to populations of individuals with OA and may not be reflected at the individual patient level. In addition, data were unavailable to examine the efficacy of topical NSAIDs and capsaicin in subgroups with differing OA phenotypes (e.g. nociceptive vs neuropathic-like pain). Studies at the individual patient level are still required.

In conclusion, current evidence indicates that topical NSAIDs and capsaicin offer similar levels of pain relief in OA. Larger and better conducted RCTs, particularly for capsaicin, are required to confirm this. However, it is unknown whether individuals with different pain phenotypes respond differently to these two commonly used topical analgesics. Further work on phenotypic features of OA pain and their response to these two drugs is warranted.

Duration of pain

Duration of pain is a decisive factor guiding the choice of an appropriate analgesic regimen. However, duration of pain should always be correlated with the pain intensity.
Acute pain The primary pain management goal here is early intervention to reduce the pain to acceptable levels. Most of the acute pain is nociceptive and treatment for acute pain involves a combination of paracetamol, opioids and some topical agents. Mild somatic acute pain could be treated with paracetamol, NSAIDs, topical anesthetics and physical treatments such as ice, compression and so on. For acute visceral pain, NSAIDs, opioids, corticosteroids and agents modulating the central neuronal activity (TRPV1 antagonists) may be used, depending on the underlying comorbidity. For moderate-to-severe pain, a combination of opioids and nonopioids could offer optimal pain relief. In cases of pain from trauma or surgical procedures, systemic medication would have to be administered.
Chronic pain Management goals for chronic pain include reducing the suffering due to pain and the associated emotional distress, in addition to increasing the coping ability and psychosocial well-being of the patient, by targeting the hypersensitive nervous system. Multimodal therapy involving a combination of treatments is recommended for treatment of chronic cancer or noncancer pain. The treatment for CNCP could include nonopioids (paracetamol, NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors), opioids, analgesics, TCAs, corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, sedatives and anxiolytics.
Nociceptive pain Nociceptive pain is generally time limited as the pain resolves when the tissue damage heals, but it may also be persistent when associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment for localized pain should be started with the use of topical or oral NSAIDs. Moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs may be treated with opioids to manage symptoms and control inflammation. Additionally, corticosteroids and immune-modulating agents (biologics) can also be used to manage inflammation in arthritic pain.
Neuropathic pain Peripheral neuropathic pain manifests as stimulus-independent pain or stimulus-evoked pain (pain hypersensitivity triggered by a stimulus following damage to sensory neurons). Neuropathic pain may persist for months or years beyond the normal healing time of any damaged tissues. Evidence from randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and systematic reviews have confirmed the efficacy of TCAs (amitriptyline and nortriptyline), antiseizure medications (pregabalin, gabapentin and carbamazepine) and opioids in the treatment of various neuropathic conditions.–Evidence supports the use of opioids as second- or third-line therapies for neuropathic pain, particularly of peripheral origin (Table S1) (A). However, further confirmation from well-controlled studies is warranted to establish the efficacy of these agents in complex neuropathies.
Mild, moderate and severe pain Treatment recommendations are also dependent on the severity of pain. Acetaminophen and other mild NSAIDs such as aspirin are the preferred treatment for mild chronic pain and may be used to supplement other agents in treating mild-to-moderate pain. However, acetaminophen lacks anti-inflammatory effects, limiting its use in pain associated with inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. NSAIDs are recommended for periodic flare-ups of mild-to-moderate inflammatory or nonneuropathic pain. For management of persistent moderate-to-severe pain, opioid therapy is the most sought-after treatment. Opioids are considered effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain that is not responsive to initial therapies, but not in the treatment of inflammatory, mechanical or compressive pain. Certain strong opioids, however, do not necessarily improve functional or psychological status and should be administered under adequate supervision.–

Results

Study selection and characteristics of the included studies

Forty-three studies, comprising 36 RCTs (7900 patients with OA) and 7 observational studies (218 074 participants), were included. Figure 1 depicts the details of the selection process. Twelve topical therapies (ibuprofen, diclofenac patch, diclofenac gel, diclofenac solution, ketoprofen, eltenac, nimesulide, indomethacin, etoricoxib, piroxicam, salicylate and placebo) were evaluated for OA in the included RCTs (figure 2). The characteristics of the included comparisons are shown in table 1 and detailed information on the included RCTs and observational studies is shown in online supplementary appendix 3. The methodological quality was evaluated for all included trials and observational studies (online supplementary appendix 4).

Effects on pain relief in RCTs (vs placebo at last follow-up point)

A total of 29 trials involving all 12 topical therapies were analysed.

Conventional meta-analysis

Topical NSAIDs overall were superior to placebo for pain relief (SMD = −0.30, 95% CI −0.40 to −0.20) (online supplementary appendix 5). Subgroup analysis further indicated that statistically significant differences were evident at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and over 4 weeks (online supplementary appendix 5). Diclofenac patch exhibited the largest effect for pain relief (SMD = −0.94, 95% CI −1.20 to −0.68) (table 1).

### Topical preparations for pain relief: efficacy and patient adherence [^113J8EBh]. Journal of Pain Research (2010). Low credibility.

There has been an increasing focus on development of new routes of drug administration to provide tailored treatments for patients, without decreasing efficacy of analgesia, in proportion to the progression of the knowledge of pain mechanisms. While acute pain acts as an alarm, chronic pain is a syndrome requiring meticulous selection of analgesic drugs of high bioavailability for long-term use. Such criteria are challenges that topical medications aim to overcome, allowing progressive delivery of active component, maintaining stable plasma levels, with a good safety profile. This review presents recent findings regarding topical formulations of the most widely used drugs for pain treatment, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anesthetics, and capsaicin, and the role of physical agents as delivery enhancers (phonophoresis and iontophoresis). Although the number of topical agents is limited for use in peripheral conditions, increasing evidence supports the efficacy of these preparations in blocking nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Patient adherence to medical treatment is also a challenge, especially in chronic painful conditions. It is known that reduction of treatment complexity and pill burden are good strategies to increase patient compliance, as discussed here. However, the role of topical presentations, when compared to traditional routes, has not yet been fully explored and thus remains unclear.

NMA

Overall analysis

The trial network was comprised of 28 RCTs with 3473 participants on placebo (28 RCTs), 3693 on topical NSAIDs (23 RCTs), and 206 on capsaicin (5 RCTs) (Fig. 3). Direct evidence for topical NSAIDs vs placebo and capsaicin vs placebo were available from placebo-controlled trials. No trials directly compared topical NSAIDs to capsaicin, and the two treatments were therefore compared using placebo as a common comparator (indirect evidence).

Trial network diagram. Nodes (circles) are weighted to represent the number of participants using each intervention. The solid lines represent the direct comparisons of the treatments in RCTs. The dotted line represents indirect comparisons generated through the NMA. The lines are weighted to represent the number of comparisons.

Frequentist and Bayesian analyses were in agreement with identical ES and only minor differences in the CI vs CrI (Table I). Direct estimates indicated that topical NSAIDs were superior to placebo for pain relief. In contrast, the ES estimate between capsaicin and placebo was associated with considerable variability and did not reach statistical significance. However, the indirect analyses found no statistically significant differences between topical NSAIDs and capsaicin, although the ES favoured topical NSAIDs. Topical NSAIDs had the highest probability of being the best treatment, followed by capsaicin and then placebo (Table II).

As licensed analysis

Topical NSAIDs and capsaicin were used as licensed in 17 RCTs. 1705 participants on placebo (17 RCTs), 1328 on topical NSAID (13 RCTs), and 141 on capsaicin (4 RCTs) were included in the as licensed NMA. The results are presented in Table I. Exclusion of non-licensed topical NSAIDs marginally raised the ES and it remained superior to placebo. In contrast, capsaicin at its licensed dose had a considerably increased ES that was statistically superior to placebo. Using placebo as a common comparator, no statistically significant differences remained between topical NSAIDs and capsaicin used as licensed. However, the ES favoured capsaicin, which also had the highest probability of being the best treatment, followed by topical NSAIDs and placebo (Table II).

Comparative effectiveness — adults with acute non–low back musculoskeletal injuries: Interventions with statistically significant benefit versus placebo and at least 1 other intervention were considered to be "among the most effective" interventions. For pain reduction at less than 2 hours, moderate‑certainty evidence showed that acetaminophen, acetaminophen plus an opioid, oral NSAID, and topical NSAIDs alone or plus menthol were among the most effective; low‑certainty evidence showed that transdermal fentanyl may be among the most effective for pain reduction at less than 2 hours. For pain reduction at 1 to 7 days, moderate‑certainty evidence showed that acetaminophen, oral NSAIDs, and topical NSAIDs may be among the most effective.

Methods

Protocol and registration

The study is part of body of work, the protocol of which is published and available on PROSPERO (2016; CRD42016035254). We were unable to conduct an IPD-MA for topical capsaicin as pre-specified, as none of the data custodians were willing or able to contribute data (10 eligible RCTs). The present work therefore examines only topical NSAIDs in OA.

Study selection

The process for study selection is available in the protocol and is briefly described below. RCTs comparing topical NSAIDs to any active or placebo comparator in participants with OA were eligible. RCTs had to have a minimum duration of 1 week and report pain outcomes. Trials were identified through systematic literature searches (to November 2015) of six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science and Cochrane Library) and scrutiny of the reference lists of included publications and MAs in the area (Supplementary material, section Example literature search strategy, available at Rheumatology online). In addition, unpublished RCTs were sought from pharmaceutical companies that manufacture topical NSAIDs for sale in the UK or that have registered trials for the medications. Companies were identified via the British National Formulary or electronic Medicines Compendium. Trial registrations were searched via clinicaltrials.gov and clinicaltrialsregister.eu. Approval from a research ethics committee was not required, as the work involved analysis of de-identified data and no new data collection was undertaken.

AD

AD extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by two authors (M.S.M.P. and J.S.). Data extracted included publication information, trial design, participant demographics, interventions and pain outcome data. Risk-of-bias assessment was conducted using a modified Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. AD were used to determine whether the captured IPD were representative of the published evidence base.

Topical analgesics are a growing area of clinical interest, given improvements in formulation drug delivery and local delivery of medicine, limiting risk for potential adverse systemic effects. Topical analgesics include medications for acute and chronic pain, such as musculoskeletal pain disorders, including sprains and strains; neuropathic pain; and muscle pain related to trauma. This review covers an update on formulations for acute and chronic pain, a discussion on advancements in drug delivery, and an update on recent treatment guidelines related to topical medications for osteoarthritis and neuropathic pain conditions.

### Characteristics of analgesic patch formulations [^114THX3u]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Diclofenac Topical Patch

Diclofenac is a NSAID. It is available in multiple formulations including a patch system. The patch contains 1.3% diclofenac with a DIA design (180 mg of diclofenac in 14 g of an acrylate-based adhesive). The patch is similar in size to the lidocaine systems, 10 × 14 cm. The diclofenac patch is indicated in the US for treatment of acute pain due to minor strains, sprains, and contusions in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older. The patch instructions are to apply the topical system every 12 hours to the most painful area (twice a day).

A recent meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritis found that diclofenac patch systems were safe and effective. Furthermore, this international review noted that the most effective topical NSAID for relief of pain associated with osteoarthritis was the diclofenac patch. Serious gastrointestinal and renal adverse events were not associated with the topical diclofenac patch systems in the reviewed trials. As a reminder, one of the major advantages of topical patch systems is that they can minimize systemic exposure and therefore AEs including the risk of gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs. The diclofenac patch is not indicated for the pain secondary to osteoarthritis, and further studies could clarify its usefulness for treating this condition.

Network meta-analysis

Diclofenac patch was most effective for pain relief (SMD = −0.81, 95% CI −1.12 to −0.52) (figure 3). The detailed results are illustrated in table 2 and the rankings based on SUCRA are shown in online supplementary appendix 6. Diclofenac patch had the largest probability of being the best treatment option (SUCRA = 95.7%), followed by ibuprofen cream (SUCRA = 88.81%). Network meta-regression showed that there were no significant interactions between pain relief and baseline pain level or length of follow-up time (online supplementary appendix 7). There was no evidence of high heterogeneity among the trials (τ 2 = 0.01). Evaluation of the goodness of fit demonstrated a good fit with a posterior mean residual deviance of 61.31 (58 data points). Subgroup analysis of studies with patients with knee OA and studies with efficacy data at 1 or 2 weeks did not reveal any substantial change (online supplementary appendix 8). Only one trialinvestigated the effects of topical diclofenac gel on patients with hand OA (SMD = −0.20, 95% C: −0.40 to 0.00). After excluding commercially funded/sponsored trials (17 trials), only diclofenac patch was statistically superior to placebo for pain relief (SMD = −0.82, 95% CI −1.65 to −0.03) (online supplementary appendix 8).

### Cancer pain management: an Italian Delphi survey from the rational use of analgesics (RUA) group [^115hGDCj]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The participants in this Delphi survey agreed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), alone or in combination with opioids, could be used to manage mild-moderate and severe pains. NSAIDs are useful for mild to moderate pain with an inflammatory component (eg, bone metastases or fungating lesions). Regularly scheduled NSAIDs should be taken for maximal efficacy and adding an NSAID to an opioid for severe pain may enhance analgesia and allow lower opioid doses. In the choice of an NSAID, it should be considered that those with longer half-life require less frequent dosing but may increase the risk for adverse effects, especially in elderly or unhealthy people. Furthermore, NSAIDs have an analgesic ceiling, above which only toxicity increases. A safe strategy is topical NSAID application over a painful site, which may decrease pain with little risk for systemic absorption and adverse effects.

According to the Delphi survey results, the use of strong opioids is useful to treat uncontrolled pain, severe pain and end-of-life pain. The role of weak opioids, however, was less agreed on amongst participants. The unreached consensus on items concerning weak opioids reflects the debate on these drugs in the management of cancer pain. The effectiveness of weak opioids – the second step of the WHO ladder – was limited to 30–40 days for most patients because of insufficient analgesia, rather than to adverse effects. Despite similar side effects, such as constipation, drowsiness and nausea, several clinical trials reported that weak opioids were less effective than strong opioids in controlling chronic pain. Therefore, many authors suggested the elimination of the second step in the WHO ladder or the introduction as the second step of strong opioids at low dosing (morphine < 30 mg/die, oxycodone < 20 mg/die, even in combination with paracetamol).

VA/DoD hip & knee osteoarthritis — topical NSAID administration and counseling: Some patients prefer topical agents given the potential for fewer systemic effects because there is lower systemic bioavailability with topical NSAIDs compared to oral NSAIDs; however, since these agents may need to be applied up to four times daily, administration may be burdensome and application can be difficult if the site is covered by clothing or when used on larger joints or in patients with certain skin conditions. Topical diclofenac should not stain or damage clothing, but it may rub off under tight clothing if an appropriate amount of time for absorption and drying is not allowed, and patients and caregivers should be educated to wash their hands thoroughly after the use of topical NSAIDs and to avoid contact with irritated skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.

### Topical NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults… [^114MYjgA]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Practice Pointers Osteoarthritis is one of the most common presentations in outpatient primary care practices, with the knee being the joint most often involved. 2 Topical NSAIDs are used to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain because they are thought to be as effective as and have fewer adverse effects than oral NSAIDs. In this updated Cochrane review, the authors sought to determine the effectiveness of topical NSAIDs vs. placebo and oral NSAIDs, as well as compare adverse effect profiles.
1. 1 All studies were considered to have at least moderate methodologic quality and small to moderate risk of bias. The primary outcome of the review was clinical success, defined by any of the following: reduction of pain by at least 50%, a very good or excellent global assessment rating of treatment, or no pain or slight pain with movement of the joint. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects or withdrawals from treatment.

No reports addressed topical NSAID use for other joints or for soft tissue pain. All studies included dosing of topical NSAIDs at least once daily, but dosages varied or were not always recorded. Only five studies included a blinded comparison between topical and oral NSAID administration. Three of the studies used topical diclofenac; the others used piroxicam and ketoprofen. The oral NSAID used was either ibuprofen, diclofenac, or celecoxib. Analysis of these five studies revealed no statistically significant difference in clinical improvement between the oral and topical therapies. In the studies comparing patients treated with topical vs. oral medication, local adverse effects were more common among those using topical NSAIDs. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were less common in the topical NSAID group than in the oral NSAID group.

General expert consensus supports the use of topical NSAIDs as a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis of the hand and knee. 3 The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons includes topical and oral NSAIDs in its updated 2013 guideline recommendations for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. 4 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published a guideline in 2014 recommending a trial of topical NSAIDs for hand and knee osteoarthritis as a first-line therapy before initiating oral NSAIDs. 5.

### Topical vs. oral ibuprofen for chronic knee pain… [^114Jdx1V]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Background: Topical and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provide short-term relief of chronic knee pain. Topical NSAIDs are believed to be as effective as oral agents, but with fewer adverse effects. Underwood and colleagues compared the outcomes of advice to older patients about using oral or topical ibuprofen. The Study: Study participants were 50 years or older. To be eligible, participants must have consulted a general practitioner in one of the 26 participating practices in England. Participants must have had osteoarthritis, or knee or leg pain in the preceding five years, or have been prescribed oral or topical NSAIDs during the previous year. Participants were required to have had troublesome knee pain on most days for at least one month, as well as knee pain for more than three months during the previous year. Patients who had knee replacements were excluded from the study.

Participants were asked to refrain from using any oral or topical NSAIDs for one week before study intake. Patients were clinically assessed based on the American College of Rheumatologists' clinical criteria for knee osteoarthritis. Baseline clinical and demographic data were gathered on entry to the study. Participants were offered the choice of joining a randomized controlled trial of oral versus topical NSAIDs, or a preference study in which they selected their own form of NSAID therapy. The groups did not differ significantly in reported major or minor adverse effects, but respiratory adverse effects were less common in the topically-treated groups. A statistically significant difference in favor of topical therapy was recorded in creatinine concentrations in the randomized trial. After 12 months, 11 percent more participants in the topical group in the randomized trial changed treatments because of inadequate pain relief.

Five percent of those randomized to oral treatment obtained prescriptions for topical agents. However, 37 percent of those randomized to topical treatment and 26 percent of those selecting topical treatment obtained prescriptions for oral NSAIDs. The number of participants receiving rescue medication was greater among those who selected oral therapy in the preference study than those who chose the topical therapy. This difference almost achieved statistical significance. Conclusion: Advising patients to use topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritis of the knee was associated with similar clinical outcomes but slightly fewer adverse effects than advising patients to use oral versions of the same medications. The authors conclude that topical NSAIDs may be a useful alternative to oral NSAIDs for symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee.

### Topical nonprescription pain medications for adults… [^111RrM2H]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Topical nonprescription pain medications are over-the-counter drugs applied to the skin to treat pain. Topical pain medications can effectively treat pain caused by several acute and chronic conditions. Because they are applied directly to the skin, topical pain medications are easy to use and less likely to cause side effects or interact with other medications than oral pain medications. Pain relief typically occurs within several days of starting a topical pain medication. Topical Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Topical NSAIDs include diclofenac and methyl salicylate. These may be applied as a gel, cream, lotion, ointment, patch, or topical solution pump. Topical NSAIDs may be useful for treating sprains, strains, and osteoarthritis pain of the hand, wrist, elbow, foot, ankle, or knee.

They are not typically recommended for individuals already taking an oral NSAID because they are unlikely to provide additional pain relief. Topical NSAIDs may cause skin reactions such as rash, itching, or burning.
