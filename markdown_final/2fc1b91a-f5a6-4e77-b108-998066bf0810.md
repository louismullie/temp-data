## Question

what is the treatment for resistatnt allregic conjunctivitis for aannoying nurse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the treatment is for resistant allergic conjunctivitis in an adult, possibly a nurse with occupational exposures, and how to escalate therapy when first-line measures fail, including the role of tacrolimus, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, DEXTENZA, immunotherapy, and monitoring, with attention to safety and practicality at work settings.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and fix the wording, because "aannoying nurse" looks like a typo; hold on, I should verify the intended query as resistant allergic conjunctivitis in an adult who is a nurse and has persistent symptoms despite OTC antihistamine or dual-action drops and avoidance measures, which aligns with a refractory phenotype after failure of standard first-line care per AAO guidance.

> Next, I should review severity and phenotype before choosing advanced therapy; mild to moderate seasonal or perennial disease is mainly pruritus and hyperemia without corneal involvement, whereas severe vernal or atopic keratoconjunctivitis may show giant papillae and corneal disease, and this stratification matters because corneal involvement pushes me toward steroid-sparing immunomodulators rather than repeated steroid bursts, which the AAO PPP and contemporary pathophysiology reviews support [^1138bV9j] [^116XvM4c].

> Now, I will outline the escalation ladder beyond failed OTC or second-generation topical H1 antagonists and dual-action agents; wait, I need to ensure I adhere to AAO sequencing that favors short steroid pulses for flares and early introduction of topical calcineurin inhibitors in severe or chronic disease to minimize steroid exposure, reserving systemic therapy for exceptional cases only [^116XvM4c] [^111bXa4v].

> For topical calcineurin inhibition, let me consider cyclosporine and tacrolimus; cyclosporine is recommended in severe vernal or atopic conjunctivitis, while tacrolimus 0.1% is specifically helpful when refractory disease includes proliferative lesions or corneal involvement, with prospective evidence showing significant reductions in signs and symptoms, steroid-sparing effects, efficacy even after cyclosporine failure, and a common transient burning adverse effect that I should counsel about [^116XvM4c] [^1138bV9j].

> For corticosteroids, I need to be precise; the AAO recommends short courses of soft or lower-penetration agents like loteprednol or fluorometholone for acute exacerbations, but hold on, let me verify the risks and monitoring because prolonged or unsupervised use increases intraocular pressure and cataract risk, requiring baseline and interval IOP checks and strict time-limited tapers to avoid steroid-induced complications [^116ccxXX].

> Regarding the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert, I initially thought it was indicated for chronic allergic conjunctivitis; wait, let me verify and correct that: it provides preservative-free, sustained dexamethasone delivery for about 30 days and is supported by phase 3 trials and a recent meta-analysis for ocular itching and redness in allergic conjunctivitis, with real-world data suggesting better outcomes versus topical loteprednol and strong patient preference, making it a practical, adherence-friendly option rather than an indefinite "chronic" indication per se [^112avBPu] [^112Qn4Py] [^116PRV6E].

> Systemic therapy should be rare; I should confirm the AAO position that systemic agents be considered only in exceptional circumstances after topical strategies fail and under specialist supervision, and I need to correct my own thinking here because I almost lumped leukotriene receptor antagonists in as immunosuppressants, but they are not and should not be first-line for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, given guideline recommendations against using montelukast as initial therapy and cautioning its limited role [^111bXa4v] [^116EwiEF] [^111w4HLn].

> For disease modification, I need to check the role of allergen immunotherapy; allergen-specific immunotherapy is guideline-endorsed for selected adults with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and can reduce ocular symptoms and medication burden, although benefits are often greater in pediatrics, and shared decision-making is key when pharmacotherapy and avoidance are insufficient [^113QTJnB] [^116myyEZ] [^111rAJqm].

> Adjunctive non-pharmacologic measures remain important even in resistant disease; I should emphasize cold compresses and lubricants to reduce itch and surface irritation, reinforce environmental modifications and allergen avoidance strategies, and remind patients not to rub, because rubbing exacerbates inflammation and has been linked to ectatic complications like keratoconus in susceptible corneas [^1112uF8z] [^111QnCkC] [^112avBPu].

> Let me consider occupational factors for a nurse; I need to check for workplace allergen or irritant exposures such as disinfectants, latex, and medication powders, tailor avoidance and protective strategies accordingly, and favor steroid-sparing regimens like tacrolimus or cyclosporine for maintenance; for convenience and adherence during shifts, a single in-office DEXTENZA insert may be advantageous compared with multiple daily topical doses, and I should confirm this preference signal from real-world data [^111QnCkC] [^116PRV6E].

> Monitoring and follow-up should be structured; I will re-evaluate at 2 to 4 weeks after initiating advanced therapy, check IOP at baseline and periodically whenever topical steroids are used, assess ocular surface tolerability with calcineurin inhibitors and counsel on transient burn or sting, and if using DEXTENZA, confirm retention early and reassess effect at around 30 days, then continue follow-up every 3 to 6 months to titrate therapy and minimize steroid exposure [^1138bV9j] [^112avBPu].

> Pulling this together, my treatment recommendation for an adult with resistant allergic conjunctivitis is to escalate to a steroid-sparing calcineurin inhibitor, choosing topical tacrolimus 0.1% twice daily when there are proliferative tarsal changes or corneal involvement, with cyclosporine as an alternative for severe vernal or atopic disease without corneal lesions; use a short, time-limited steroid pulse for acute flares with careful IOP monitoring, consider a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert for sustained, preservative-free control and adherence advantages, reserve systemic therapy for exceptional cases, layer in immunotherapy for long-term modification in appropriately sensitized patients, and consistently reinforce non-pharmacologic measures and eye-rub avoidance to protect the cornea [^1138bV9j] [^115V8ctM] [^116ccxXX] [^112avBPu] [^112Qn4Py] [^113QTJnB].

> In summary, to manage refractory allergic conjunctivitis in an adult nurse, I should verify the phenotype and corneal status, prioritize calcineurin inhibitors to reduce steroid dependence, deploy short steroid bursts or an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for flares or sustained control, integrate immunotherapy for disease modification when appropriate, and customize avoidance and follow-up to the workplace context while monitoring safety parameters like IOP and ocular surface tolerance [^1138bV9j] [^116ccxXX] [^116PRV6E] [^116myyEZ].

---

For resistant allergic conjunctivitis, escalate to **topical calcineurin inhibitors** (cyclosporine 0.05–0.1% [^115V8ctM] or tacrolimus 0.03–0.1% twice daily) [^112E4fiD] for steroid-sparing control [^1138bV9j], and use **short-course topical corticosteroids** (loteprednol or fluorometholone) [^116ccxXX] for acute flares with close IOP monitoring. Add **allergen immunotherapy** (SCIT/SLIT) [^113QTJnB] for persistent symptoms despite maximal topical therapy [^116myyEZ], and consider a dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEXTENZA) [^112R1Y3c] for sustained relief [^112Qn4Py]. Support with cold compresses, preservative-free lubricants [^1112uF8z], and strict allergen avoidance [^111QnCkC]; refer to ophthalmology for corneal involvement or steroid dependence.

## Pharmacological management

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers

For topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, **first-line therapy** uses dual-action agents (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, bepotastine) [^117YCyuQ] for rapid itch relief and mast cell stabilization [^1154NSKo] [^113UWXqc]. However, their **limitations** are evident in resistant cases, where they may be insufficient alone, necessitating escalation [^1138bJPx].

---

### Topical corticosteroids

For topical corticosteroids, the **indication** is short courses (≤ 2 weeks) [^116ccxXX] for acute flares or severe inflammation, with monitoring of IOP and cataract risk [^112R1Y3c]. Preferred agents are **loteprednol** or **fluorometholone** for lower IOP risk.

---

### Topical calcineurin inhibitors

For topical calcineurin inhibitors, **cyclosporine** 0.05–0.1% twice daily provides steroid-sparing control in severe or chronic disease [^115V8ctM] [^116XvM4c]. In refractory cases, **tacrolimus** 0.03–0.1% twice daily is used, including for proliferative lesions or corneal involvement [^112E4fiD] [^1138bV9j].

---

### Systemic antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists

For systemic antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists, **systemic antihistamines** can be added for significant systemic allergy symptoms [^113N1M37]. Leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as **montelukast**, may be considered for coexisting allergic rhinitis or asthma [^111WwGv3].

---

### Allergen immunotherapy

For allergen immunotherapy, the **indication** is **SCIT or SLIT** [^113QTJnB] for persistent symptoms despite maximal topical therapy [^111iP8Md], with greater effectiveness in pediatric patients [^115D33mv].

---

### Novel therapies

Among novel therapies, the **dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEXTENZA)** provides sustained corticosteroid delivery for up to 30 days [^112Qn4Py] and is effective in reducing itching and redness [^112avBPu]. For refractory cases, **intense pulsed light (IPL)** is an emerging adjunct, particularly with meibomian gland dysfunction.

---

## Non-pharmacological management

- **Allergen avoidance**: Environmental modifications to reduce exposure [^111QnCkC].
- **Cold compresses and lubricants**: Symptom relief and ocular surface protection [^1112uF8z].
- **Eye hygiene**: Regular lid hygiene to reduce allergen load.

---

## Indications for ophthalmology referral

- **Corneal involvement**: Shield ulcers, keratitis, or vision-threatening disease.
- **Steroid dependence**: Need for prolonged corticosteroids.
- **Refractory disease**: Persistent symptoms despite maximal therapy.

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Topical antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers | First-line therapy |
| 2 | Short-course topical corticosteroids | Acute flares/severe inflammation |
| 3 | Topical calcineurin inhibitors | Steroid-sparing control |
| 4 | Systemic antihistamines/leukotriene antagonists | Significant systemic symptoms |
| 5 | Allergen immunotherapy | Persistent symptoms |
| 6 | Novel therapies (DEXTENZA, IPL) | Refractory cases |

---

Resistant allergic conjunctivitis requires a **stepwise approach**, escalating from dual-action antihistamines to corticosteroids and then to calcineurin inhibitors, with immunotherapy and novel options for persistent disease. Ophthalmology referral and **close monitoring** are essential for complications or steroid dependence.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement.
- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included 1,436 patients with refractory allergic conjunctivitis whose condition had responded poorly to conventional antiallergic drugs, topical steroids, and/or topical cyclosporine. All patients received tacrolimus eye drops twice daily during the study period. Ten clinical signs and six clinical symptoms were rated on a four-grade scale. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total clinical signs and symptoms score at the last observation or following six months of treatment.
- **Results**: Total signs and symptoms score significantly decreased after one month of treatment (p < 0.001). Giant papillae and corneal lesions were also reduced by tacrolimus eye drop use (p < 0.001). The drug proved effective in patients whose condition did not respond well to topical cyclosporine therapy. About 50% of all patients using topical steroids were weaned. The most common adverse reaction was a transient burning sensation (3.20%).
- **Conclusions**: Tacrolimus eye drops are highly effective in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement, and may reduce or replace topical steroid use.

### Dextenza versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112R1Y3c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common cause of ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, and watering and can be triggered by both seasonal and perennial allergens. Its prevalence has been estimated at up to 40%. The condition negatively impacts quality of life and work productivity.

The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves immune responses mediated by histamine and mast cells. Treatment consists of antihistamines for immediate relief and mast-cell stabilizers for long-term control. Corticosteroids can be used for short periods to manage acute flares; however, safety issues such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation limit long-term use. Recently, Dextenza, a 0.4 mg dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (Ocular Therapeutix, Bedford, MA), has been approved for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. It is also approved for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The dexamethasone intracanalicular insert is a rod-shaped depot of 0.4 mg preservative-free dexamethasone encapsulated within polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel that expands after contact with fluid to occlude the punctum and secure its placement. Fluorescein is conjugated to the hydrogel to enable visualization. The insert delivers a sustained and tapered dose of dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days and resorbs completely.

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the dexamethasone insert relieved ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis more effectively than placebo when evaluated using a mo.

### Tezspire [^1119QDSb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as rash and allergic conjunctivitis, were observed in clinical trials following the administration of Tezspire. Postmarketing cases of anaphylaxis have also been reported [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6)] These reactions can occur within hours of administration or, in some cases, have a delayed onset of days. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient to determine whether to continue or discontinue treatment with Tezspire.
- **Acute asthma symptoms or deteriorating disease**: Tezspire should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations. It should not be used to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after the initiation of treatment with Tezspire.
- **Risk associated with abrupt reduction of corticosteroid dosage**: Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with Tezspire. Reductions in corticosteroid dosage, if appropriate, should be gradual and under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.
- **Parasitic (helminth) infection**: Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from clinical trials.

### Cyproheptadine hydrochloride [^115fZaeC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

**Indications and usage**: Cyproheptadine hydrochloride is indicated for a range of allergic conditions, including perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis due to inhalant allergens and foods. It is also used for mild, uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations such as urticaria and angioedema. Additionally, it assists in the amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma and is effective in treating cold urticaria and dermatographism. Furthermore, cyproheptadine hydrochloride serves as an adjunct therapy for anaphylactic reactions, complementing epinephrine and other standard measures once the acute manifestations have been controlled.

### Clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis: A systematic review [^115XneoP]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Ocular allergy represents one of the most common conditions encountered by allergists and ophthalmologists. However, there is wide variability in study designs in clinical trials of allergic conjunctivitis, which results in conflicting evidence regarding their optimal management. We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials to critically evaluate their quality and to highlight biases to be avoided in future clinical research in ocular allergy.
- **Methods**: Clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis performed since 1965 were retrieved, and data on patients, interventions, comparisons of interventions, and outcomes were extracted. Four authors independently assessed articles for inclusion in the systematic review and evaluated trials' quality using the Jadad scale.
- **Results**: Three hundred and sixty-two trials were included in the study. Only a minority of trials fulfilled all the criteria of proper clinical trial design. In most of the studies, there was a very limited use of objective (quantifiable) parameters for both patient selection and evaluation of drug efficacy and safety. Several outcomes of primary importance, such as disease relapses and recurrence rates, were omitted in clinical trials of allergic conjunctivitis.
- **Conclusions**: Evidence emerging from clinical trials in ocular allergy is limited, affecting the strength of recommendations to healthcare providers and policymakers for optimal management. Standardized diagnostic criteria for patient selection and quantifiable primary outcomes are recommended to improve the design of future clinical trials.

### Oral immunotherapy for allergic conjunctivitis [^116DfSSE]. Cornea (2014). Low credibility.

Antigen-specific immunotherapy is expected to be a desirable treatment for allergic diseases. Currently, antigen-specific immunotherapy is performed by administering disease-causing antigens subcutaneously or sublingually. These approaches induce long-term remission in patients with allergic rhinitis or asthma.

The oral route is an alternative to subcutaneous and sublingual routes and can also induce long-term remission, a phenomenon known as "oral tolerance". The effectiveness of oral tolerance has been reported in the context of autoimmune diseases, food allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis in both human patients and animal models. However, few studies have examined its efficacy in animal models of allergic conjunctivitis.

Previously, we showed that ovalbumin feeding suppressed ovalbumin-induced experimental allergic conjunctivitis, indicating the induction of oral tolerance is effective in treating experimental allergic conjunctivitis. In recent years, transgenic rice has been developed that can induce oral tolerance and reduce the severity of anaphylaxis. The major Japanese cedar pollen antigens in transgenic rice, Cryptomeria japonica 1 and C. japonica 2, were deconstructed by molecular shuffling, fragmentation, and changes in the oligomeric structure. Thus, transgenic rice may be an effective treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.

### Efficacy and toxicity evaluation of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free eye drops vs olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% BAK-preserved eye drops in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^112cXZUB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting approximately 20% of the global population. The prevalence of AC is region-dependent and appears to be increasing worldwide. This pathology is associated with seasonal pollen sensitivity, although perennial forms are associated with exposure to animal dander, mites, and molds. AC is a type-1 IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction that occurs in individuals previously exposed to a specific allergen. The immune response involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin, prostaglandins, proteases, and cytokines, which contribute to the development of signs and symptoms. Histamines from degranulated mast cells are the principal immune mediators related to early allergic responses. This molecule binds to receptors (H1, H2, H3, and H4) on vascular endothelial cells, neuronal fibers, goblet cells, immune cells, and conjunctival epithelium, culminating in clinical manifestations of allergic conjunctivitis including redness, periocular swelling, chemosis, itching, and tearing. This is followed by a late phase that is manifested by pro-inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of immune cells including eosinophils and neutrophils.

The keystone of the treatments is histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines), which inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine receptors and, consequently, inhibiting clinical manifestations related to this mediator. Mast cell stabilizers inhibit mast cell degranulation and, consequently, the release of mediators involved in allergic conjunctivitis.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^114YtKzx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis, caused by an immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammatory reaction to an allergen, is the most common form of ocular allergy. Several epidemiological reports estimate its prevalence ranging from 15% to 20% worldwide, depending on the geographic location and patients' age. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III data, approximately 40% of the population in the US annually experiences ocular symptoms indicative of allergic conjunctivitis. The most common symptoms include ocular itching, redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing.

Several treatment options are available for allergic conjunctivitis, each with different mechanisms of action. Olopatadine, an antiallergic agent, exhibits its effects through selective antagonism of histamine H1 receptors, mast cell stabilization, and prevention of histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production.

Olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (Patanol® and Pataday®, respectively; Alcon Research Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA) has been approved for managing allergic conjunctivitis in over 100 countries, including the US and Canada. It is available as twice-daily and once-daily treatments, respectively. Once-daily doses of olopatadine 0.2% and alcaftadine 0.25% effectively reduce signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis for no more than 16 hours.

Despite the efficacy of available formulations of olopatadine and other topical ocular antiallergy treatments, there is a need for products that address incomplete symptom relief and/or provide longer duration of action.

### Bepotastine besilate [^113UWXqc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

Clinical efficacy was assessed through two conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) studies involving 237 patients. Bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution, 1.5%, demonstrated increased effectiveness over its vehicle in alleviating ocular itching induced by an ocular allergen challenge, both at 15 minutes post-dosing and 8 hours post-dosing of the solution.

The safety of bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution was evaluated in a randomized clinical study involving 861 subjects over a six-week period.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^114BsmRK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Ocular allergic reactions depend on the allergen load on the ocular surface, the stability of the mast cells, and the integrity of the conjunctival epithelial cells. Most allergens can secrete proteolytic enzymes that enhance the disruption of the epithelial barrier function via degradation of tight junction proteins, which facilitates the access of allergens to the conjunctival stroma. Moreover, eosinophils could be recruited to the conjunctiva of patients with allergic conjunctivitis via H4 receptor interaction. The eosinophils that are recruited degranulate to release mediators that destabilize the barrier function of the conjunctival epithelium. However, preclinical studies have shown that alcaftadine can inhibit eosinophil recruitment, allergen-induced degradation of tight junction proteins, and promote the stability of the tight junction proteins of the conjunctival epithelium. Alcaftadine's ability to inhibit the influx of eosinophils could explain why it prevents disruption of the tight junction proteins.

Activation of H1 and H2 receptors results in itching sensation, conjunctival injection, upregulation of adhesion molecules, cytokine release, vasopermeability, collagen synthesis, and the proliferation of conjunctival fibroblasts. H4 receptor activation is associated with the release of cytokines and chemokines, upregulation of adhesion molecules, and activation and recruitment of immune cells. It is noteworthy that the histamine released following mast cell degranulation recruits and activates dendritic cells (DCs) that induce Th2-lymphocyte-mediated responses.

### Sublingual immunotherapy for treating allergic conjunctivitis [^1127AmKB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Allergic ocular symptoms, although frequently trivialized, are common and represent an important comorbidity of allergic rhinitis. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for allergic rhinitis, but its effects on symptoms of ocular allergy have not been well established.
- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy of SLIT compared with placebo for reductions in ocular symptoms, topical ocular medication requirements, and conjunctival immediate allergen sensitivity.
- **Search strategy**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011), Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2011), Web of Science (January 1970 to January 2011), Biosis Previews (January 1979 to January 2011), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com) (January 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) (January 2011), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (www.actr.org.au) (July 2010), SCOPUS (November 2008), and the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (January 2010). There were no language or date restrictions in the search for trials. All electronic databases except for SCOPUS, the UK Clinical Trials Gateway, and ANZCTR were last searched on 19 January 2011.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), double-masked and placebo-controlled, which evaluated the efficacy of SLIT in patients with symptoms.

### Epithelial barrier dysfunction in ocular allergy [^1138bJPx]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

Ocular allergy, also known as allergic conjunctivitis, refers to a collection of hypersensitivity disorders primarily affecting the eyelids and conjunctiva. These disorders include different phenotypes such as seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), chronic vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), and contact blepharoconjunctivitis.

Successful management of ocular allergy involves preventive, non-pharmacologic, and pharmacologic measures. Over the years, various therapeutic options have been developed to achieve symptom control in ocular allergy, including topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and dual-acting agents. Corticosteroids and immunomodulators are used in severe cases. However, in chronic forms, none of these treatments completely control the signs and symptoms or prevent recurrences.

- **Ocular surface inflammation**: In VKC and AKC, it often leads to severe suffering and complications such as corneal ulcers, tissue remodeling, scars, and rarely limbal stem cell (LSC) deficiency, characterized by the invasion of conjunctival epithelium into the cornea. Further complications related to treatment, such as increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataract arise due to the side effects of steroid overuse, warranting new and safer therapeutics.

Given that the eyes are directly exposed to the outer environment, a defective barrier may be primarily involved in the pathology of ocular allergy. Epithelial barrier integrity is known to be compromised in dry eye pathologies, suggesting that barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in different ocular surface disorders.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^113hfRa1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Eleven clinical studies were submitted as part of the FDA approval application for alcaftadine 0.25%, including three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies. Additionally, published clinical studies have displayed the clinical efficacy and safety of the drop. Each published study utilized the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. The CAC model is a well-utilized study design to evaluate antiallergy medications in a controlled environment. The CAC has been employed as a study model for over 20 years and utilized as a standard clinical method by the FDA in evaluating allergic diseases.

The typical CAC format includes two baseline visits. The first visit allows the investigators to titrate the allergen dose to achieve the desired clinical response. The second visit then confirms the initial titration results. The patients who demonstrate reproducible results and the desired clinical response proceed to a third visit. During the third and fourth visits of the study, the onset and duration of action are measured by administering the medication (active ingredient) and comparative agents (placebo and comparator), followed by challenging the patient with the appropriate dose of allergen. Ocular allergy manifestations including hyperemia, chemosis, and pruritus are then evaluated. The patient rates the itch symptoms on a scale from 0 (least symptomatic) to 4 (most symptomatic). Study personnel utilize the same scale to rate ocular redness and chemosis signs of allergic conjunctivitis. The onset can be measured within minutes after drug administration, concluding the study model.

### Antibiotics for the allergist: part 1 [^1152yagb]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

To review antibiotic use and selection for disorders commonly seen in allergy practice, MEDLINE searches were performed. They cross-referenced the keywords: antibiotic, antimicrobial, management, and treatment with multiple disorders commonly encountered in allergy practice. Additionally, references of the selected articles were examined to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Articles were chosen based on their relevance to the subject matter. The results indicated a large body of research concerning both conventional and novel uses of antibiotics. The usage of antibiotics is questioned for some disorders, while novel approaches, particularly with macrolide antibiotics, are being actively investigated. Patterns of microbial resistance continue to evolve.

For decades, antibiotics have been the traditional first-line treatments for many disorders. However, this paradigm seems to be shifting as periods of observation gain popularity, and nonbacterial causes of inflammation are scrutinized more closely. Despite these changes, appropriate antibiotic selection often remains a crucial element in treating these disorders. An understanding of relevant microbiology is essential for selecting antibiotic therapies and requires awareness of trends in bacterial resistance.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^115PRSm4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis affects less than 15% of the global population, including as much as 30% of the US population and up to 50% of the European population. Allergic conjunctivitis reactions range from a mild, self-limiting disease to a debilitating condition that significantly impairs one's quality of life. An individual's allergic response can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including tree and grass pollens, animal hair and dander, and other environmental insults. This response manifests in a cascade of ocular symptoms, including itching, redness, chemosis, tearing, and eyelid swelling.
- **Phases of allergic conjunctivitis**: The signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis progress through an early acute phase and a late phase in response to an allergen. Allergens interact with IgE bound to sensitized mast cells, activating enhanced levels of histamine and causing degranulation. In the acute phase, the release of histamine and other proallergic mediators induces itching, vasodilation, and vascular leakage, which lead to ocular redness, chemosis, and lid swelling. Mast cells synthesize and release cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, initiating a cascade of inflammatory events leading to a final late phase reaction characterized by the recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages in the conjunctival tissues.

### Undertreatment of allergy: Exploring the utility of sublingual immunotherapy [^1167gcnX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Allergic syndromes are highly prevalent and encompass a wide variety of clinical problems, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis and urticaria, asthma, and food allergies. Numerous studies have shown that allergic syndromes are both underdiagnosed and undertreated. This is related to many factors, including the trivialization of allergic conditions by physicians and patients, failure to adhere to diagnostic and treatment guidelines, and dissatisfaction with conventional pharmacologic treatments. Immunotherapy involves the administration of allergen extracts in an attempt to induce immunologic tolerance and has been used for the treatment of allergic syndromes and the prevention of long-term complications. Conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy is effective but is also associated with a risk of serious adverse events, requires administration by a trained healthcare professional, and is contraindicated in certain populations. By contrast, sublingual immunotherapy has been used extensively in Europe and possesses most of the benefits of subcutaneous immunotherapy along with increased safety, tolerability, and convenience. This narrative review explores data from selected clinical studies and concludes that sublingual immunotherapy may be well-suited to fill the gap posed by the undertreatment of allergic syndromes in the United States.

### Clinical practice guideline: Allergic rhinitis [^112FVUn4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most common diseases affecting adults. It is the most common chronic disease in children in the United States today and the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States overall. AR is estimated to affect nearly 1 in every 6 Americans and generates $2 to $5 billion in direct health expenditures annually. It can impair quality of life and, through loss of work and school attendance, is responsible for as much as $2 to $4 billion in lost productivity annually. Not surprisingly, myriad diagnostic tests and treatments are used in managing this disorder, yet there is considerable variation in their use. This clinical practice guideline was undertaken to optimize the care of patients with AR by addressing quality improvement opportunities through an evaluation of the available evidence and an assessment of the harm-benefit balance of various diagnostic and management options.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to address quality improvement opportunities for all clinicians, in any setting, who are likely to manage patients with AR as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The guideline is intended to be applicable for both pediatric and adult patients with AR. Children under the age of 2 years were excluded from the clinical practice guideline because rhinitis in this population may be different than in older patients and is not informed by the same evidence base.

### Executive summary: Japanese guidelines for allergic conjunctival diseases 2021 [^117GNZc6]. Allergology International (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on allergic conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva caused by an allergic reaction.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves exposure to allergens triggering an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, leading to mucosal inflammation and associated ocular symptoms.
- **Epidemiology**: Allergic conjunctivitis is estimated to affect 6–30% of the general population.
- **Risk factors**: These include a personal or familial predisposition to allergies, along with environmental elements that augment exposure to allergens. These allergens may include pollen, dust mites, animal dander, pollutants, and fungal allergens.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, allergic conjunctivitis presents with symptoms such as redness, itching, eye discharge, foreign body sensation, and swollen eyelids. Some patients may also experience burning and stinging, which can be attributed to chronic neuropathic pain.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of allergic conjunctivitis is generally good. While it is a chronic condition, it can be effectively managed with treatment, including allergen avoidance, the use of antihistamines, and in some cases, specific immunotherapy.

### Conjunctivitis: A systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^1138Wf4y]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on infectious conjunctivitis:

- **Definition**: Infectious conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
- **Pathophysiology**: Viruses account for 80% of all cases of acute conjunctivitis, with most cases caused by adenoviruses. Other viral causes include HSV, VZV, EBV, influenza, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus. Bacterial conjunctivitis is commonly caused by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Ophthalmia neonatorum is typically caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae. Fungal conjunctivitis is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised patients.
- **Epidemiology**: It is estimated that approximately 6 million cases of acute conjunctivitis occur annually in the US.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include close contact with infected individuals, poor hand hygiene, use of contaminated contact lenses, and exposure to contaminated water.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, infectious conjunctivitis presents with redness, itching, tearing, discharge, and crusting. Bacterial conjunctivitis often presents with purulent discharge, while viral conjunctivitis usually has a watery discharge and may be associated with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Fungal conjunctivitis may present with chronic, indolent symptoms.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most cases of infectious conjunctivitis are self-limiting, lasting 1–2 weeks. Mild bacterial conjunctivitis typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112avBPu]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

The dexamethasone insert is a preservative-free steroid treatment. Exposure to preservatives in topical ocular therapies may be associated with a compromised ocular surface due to dry eye disease and inflammatory irritation. The most common ophthalmic antimicrobial preservative utilized is benzalkonium chloride (BAK), which is associated with discomfort and pain following instillation as well as ocular surface toxicity, conjunctival hyperemia, decreased tear production, tear film instability, and superficial punctate keratitis. There are currently no other commercially available preservative-free ophthalmic steroid therapy options for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Untreated allergic conjunctivitis can result in ocular complications, underscoring the need for safe, effective treatments for allergic conjunctivitis. Eye rubbing due to ocular itching is associated with corneal ectasia, including keratoconus, which can lead to acute corneal hydrops, corneal perforation, corneal scarring, and vision loss. Potential complications associated with untreated allergic conjunctivitis are detrimental to quality of life, especially for individuals who have concomitant dry eye disease. Concomitant dry eye disease is common in individuals with allergic conjunctivitis, and future studies in this population are needed. The two conditions interact with each other, and the symptoms of dry eye disease may exacerbate the itching, redness, and chemosis experienced during allergen challenge in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis.

### ICON: Diagnosis and management of allergic conjunctivitis [^116DcWjy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Ocular allergy (OA), also known as allergic conjunctivitis, is a common immunological hypersensitivity disorder affecting up to 40% of the population. This condition has been increasing in frequency, with symptoms such as itching, redness, and swelling significantly impacting an individual's quality of life (QOL). Despite its prevalence, OA is often underdiagnosed and undertreated, as only 10% of patients with symptoms seek medical attention. Most patients rely on over-the-counter medications and complementary nonpharmacological remedies.

The clinical course, duration, severity, and co-morbidities of OA are varied and depend partly on the specific ocular tissues affected and the local and systemic immunologic mechanisms involved. OA is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis, commonly recognized as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and with other allergic comorbidities. Predominantly self-managed, there is an increased risk of suboptimal therapy, leading to exacerbations and the potential development of more chronic conditions that could cause corneal complications and interfere with the visual axis.

Multiple, often co-existing causes make arrival at a correct diagnosis challenging, given the broad differential diagnosis for OA. Ocular allergy often overlaps with other anterior ocular diseases, including infectious disorders and dry eye syndromes. Therefore, successful management involves overcoming underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis challenges with improved understanding and intervention strategies.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^111Eo3Dd]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Male and female patients were eligible for inclusion if they were at least 18 years old, able to have both eyes dosed with eyedrops, and had a positive diagnostic skin test indicative of allergy to cat hair, cat dander, grasses, ragweed, dust mite, dog dander, cockroaches, and/or trees within 24 months of visit 1 (day 21 ± 2, Figure 1). Additionally, eligible patients were required to have a history of seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis for ≥ 1 year before visit 1 and a positive bilateral CAC response at visits 1 (day 21 ± 2) and 2 (day 14 ± 3), and were willing to discontinue wearing contact lenses for ≥ 72 hours before the first study visit and throughout the study.

Exclusion criteria included a known history or presence of persistent dry eye syndrome or treatment for dryness of eyes, and the presence of active blepharitis, active meibomian gland dysfunction, active rosacea affecting the ocular adnexa, follicular conjunctivitis, iritis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, ocular irritation not due to ocular allergy, or any other clinically significant ophthalmic abnormality. Other medical conditions that precluded participation in the study included presumed or actual ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or a history of ocular herpes; the presence of any chronic ocular degenerative condition or active intraocular inflammation that, in the opinion of the investigator, was likely to worsen during the study; any contraindications or hypersensitivities to use of the study medications or their components; and a history of ocular surgery.

### The efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intracanalicular insert use in patients with chronic seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Qn4Py]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of DEXTENZA, an intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, for the treatment of seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis.
- **Methods**: Multiple databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, the Directory of Open Access Journals, and Scopus, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of DEXTENZA with a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence, and the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials was employed to assess bias.
- **Results**: Four RCTs involving 323 participants met the eligibility criteria, and all had a low risk of bias. A meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the mean CAC change for conjunctival itching, with low heterogeneity among measurements at 3 minutes (P < 0.00001, I2 = 47%), 5 minutes (P < 0.00001, I2 = 46%), and 7 minutes (P < 0.00001, I2 = 41%). Additionally, the meta-analysis found a statistically significant increase in the mean CAC change for conjunctival redness with low heterogeneity (P < 0.00001, I2 = 15%). The pooled analysis showed no significant difference (P = 0.57, I2 = 0%) between the DEXTENZA and placebo groups in the frequency of adverse events.
- **Conclusion**: DEXTENZA has emerged as a promising and viable treatment option for patients with seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis and is an effective alternative to current treatments.

### Zerviate [^1167Tquj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of Zerviate was established in three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) clinical trials in patients with a history of allergic conjunctivitis.
- **Onset and duration of action**: These were evaluated in two of these trials in which patients were randomized to receive Zerviate or vehicle ophthalmic solutions. Patients were evaluated with an ocular itching severity score ranging from 0 (no itching) to 4 (incapacitating itch) at several time points after CAC administration. A one-unit difference compared to vehicle is considered a clinically meaningful change in the ocular itching severity score. Patients treated with Zerviate demonstrated statistically and clinically significantly less ocular itching compared to vehicle at 15 minutes and 8 hours after treatment.

Table 1 (not available) reportedly displays data from the mean ocular itching severity scores after ocular administration of an antigen using the CAC model.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^116PRV6E]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world study of the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert for allergic conjunctivitis. Patients experienced greater improvements in signs and symptoms with the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert than with the topical steroid loteprednol and preferred the insert to topical therapy by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Conversely, outcomes were similar, and no clear preference was demonstrated between the insert and the use of the topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine.

Statistical differences in signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis favoring the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol therapy may be explained in several ways. First is the two drugs' relative potency: dexamethasone is considered a highly potent corticosteroid, while loteprednol is considered a weak corticosteroid. Second is differences in formulation. Solutions typically clear from the ocular surface within 15 minutes and suspensions within 2 hours. In contrast, the intracanalicular insert provides constant tapered delivery of dexamethasone over its approximately 30-day dosing period. Consequently, the bioavailability of the drug at the ocular surface is likely greater with the dexamethasone insert compared to the loteprednol solution. Regarding the strong preference expressed by patients for the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol, this may be partly explained by the superior efficacy of the insert over topical drops in relieving the signs and symptoms of ocular allergy, while part may be related to the freedom from self-administration of topical drops.

### The efficacy and safety of dexamethasone intracanalicular insert use in patients with chronic seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115C487g]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

The management of allergic conjunctivitis necessitates a multifaceted approach involving both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Initial measures focus on avoiding environmental irritants to minimize exposure and subsequent allergic reactions. Pharmacological management includes both prophylactic and therapeutic medications, administered via topical ocular drops or systemic routes.
- **Prophylactic drugs**: Sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil function as mast cell stabilizers, blocking the release of inflammatory mediators and thereby preventing the onset of symptoms.

- **Symptomatic relief**: This is achieved through the use of decongestants, including astringents (e.g. silver nitrate or zinc sulfate), vasoconstrictors (alpha and beta sympathomimetics), or antihistamines (e.g. astemizole or cetirizine). These medications work by reducing conjunctival congestion, constricting blood vessels, and inhibiting histamine-mediated allergic responses.

- **Anti-inflammatory drugs**: NSAIDs and corticosteroids play a key role in reducing inflammation and suppressing immune-mediated responses. These agents act by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and modulating the immune response, thereby alleviating symptoms and promoting ocular comfort.

Corticosteroids are effective for allergic reactions by inhibiting the production of inflammatory substances such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reducing inflammatory cells, and suppressing mast cell proliferation. These pleiotropic actions make corticosteroids a critical component of allergic conjunctivitis management.

### Clinical trials in allergen immunotherapy: Current concepts and future needs [^116myyEZ]. Allergy (2018). High credibility.

A large body of evidence from meta‐analyses and systematic reviews of double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trials (DBPC RCTs) shows that allergen immunotherapy (AIT), whether delivered subcutaneously (SCIT) or sublingually (SLIT), is a safe, effective treatment for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR) and allergic asthma.

As such, AIT is the only causal treatment option for allergic patients, as it directly targets the pro‐inflammatory immune response and thus has disease‐modifying properties. Accordingly, AIT has the potential to decrease the neo‐sensitization rate (i.e. the development of sensitizations to secondary allergens) and has been shown to reduce the risk of developing allergic asthma in AR patients. Accordingly, many medical societies and expert groups have recommended the use of AIT in selected individuals. This mainly covers patients with moderate‐to‐severe AR who either (i) do not gain sufficient relief from symptomatic medications or (ii) do obtain sufficient relief from symptomatic medications but consider that AIT may counter the severity of their AR symptoms and prevent progression to asthma. Despite these observations, levels of AIT acceptance, both by patients and physicians, are rather modest, as only a minority of eligible patients receive this treatment option.

### Conjunctivitis: Diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis.
- **Viral and allergic conjunctivitis**: These are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis.
- **Bacterial conjunctivitis**: This condition is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing.
- **Ophthalmology referral is indicated** for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115HQn6P]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic disorders of the ocular surface are primarily characterized as IgE- and/or T-lymphocyte-mediated disorders that affect the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelid. Approximately 40% of individuals in developed countries have allergic conjunctivitis; it is the most common form of ocular allergy. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis is the most prevalent type, significantly impacting the quality of life of patients.

This article reviews the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, clinical efficacy, and safety of alcaftadine. Histamine and the pathological mechanism of ocular allergy are briefly reviewed to provide a background for the detailed discussion on the clinical utility of alcaftadine in allergic conjunctivitis. The Medline PubMed, Elsevier Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases were used to search for evidence-based literature on histamine, the immunopathological mechanism of allergic conjunctivitis, and the pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical trials, and clinical efficacy of alcaftadine.

The treatment and management goals of allergic conjunctivitis are to prevent or minimize the inflammatory cascade associated with the allergic response in the early stages of the pathological mechanism. Activation of histamine receptors on immune and non-immune cells is associated with allergen-induced inflammation of the conjunctiva and its associated ocular allergic manifestations, including itching, edema, hyperemia, and tearing. Alcaftadine is an efficacious treatment option in these cases.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials for adolescents with atopic dermatitis or asthma [^114p776G]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Several types of topical treatments for conjunctivitis were used in these studies, including anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infective therapies, combination therapies, decongestants, and anti-allergic agents (e.g. mast cell inhibitors/stabilizers, antihistamines), sodium chloride, and artificial tears. Regardless of the type of treatment used, most cases recovered during the study treatment period in both the asthma trial and the atopic dermatitis (AD) trials.

A number of treatment protocols for conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients with AD have been proposed in the literature. These include warm compresses, artificial tears, eyedrops or ointments with antihistamines, anti-inflammatories, corticosteroid drops and ointments, anti-infective therapies, calcineurin inhibitors, topical cyclosporine A, and combination treatments. It should be noted that topical corticosteroid eye treatments increase the risk of eye infection, and longer-term use increases the risk of cataracts and glaucoma.

In addition, some prescribers have used prophylactic tears upon starting dupilumab therapy to address potential issues of eye dryness. Currently, there is no consensus on an optimal approach to preventing and managing conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the various treatments currently in use.

### A randomized, multicenter phase 3 clinical trial evaluating intracanalicular dexamethasone insert for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^112KecqA]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory-mediated disorder induced by seasonal or perennial allergens, affecting up to approximately 40% of the general United States (US) population. However, it is often underdiagnosed and undertreated due to its association with other disorders, such as dry eye disease and allergic rhinitis. Two of the most common symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are itching and redness. For patients with moderate to severe symptoms, there is a detrimental impact on quality of life. Several studies have examined the impact of allergic conjunctivitis on patients' quality of life. In a study of 220 patients with ocular allergy, nearly half rated their disease severity at least 6 on a scale of 1 to 10; moreover, patient-reported quality of life significantly declined during allergic conjunctivitis episodes (P < 0.001). A study of more than 1,000 patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis found that allergic conjunctivitis was associated with decreased productivity, illustrated by impairment while working and an increase in hours of work missed.

Treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis include topical antihistamines, which have a rapid onset and short duration of action, and topical mast-cell stabilizers, which require a long loading period. Topical corticosteroids are effective in both the early and late phases of the allergic response but are generally limited to a short course (1–2 weeks) for patients with more severe or persistent symptoms due to the potential for misuse or abuse of steroids, which can lead to complications.

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^112t1Fzq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is classified as a type 1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction that occurs in individuals previously exposed to the offending allergen. The signs and symptoms of AC are primarily caused by the action of mast cell-derived histamine, which acts on H1 and H2 histamine receptors in the surrounding ocular tissues. For this reason, medications that stabilize mast cells and reduce degranulation, as well as those that directly antagonize the action of histamine at its receptors, have become the first-line therapy for AC. Medications of this class, dual-action antihistamines, have both an improved safety profile and increased therapeutic effect compared to older topical agents, such as pheniramine maleate, used in the treatment of AC.

Bepotastine besilate is an anti-allergic agent with multiple mechanisms of action that has been extensively investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies. It is a dual-action agent and a highly selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist with potent mast cell-stabilizing effects. The anti-inflammatory actions of bepotastine besilate include inhibition of leukotriene B4 and attenuating eosinophil chemotaxis and activation. Bepotastine has also been shown to inhibit the biosynthesis of proinflammatory IL-5 in vitro. Oral formulations of bepotastine besilate have been well-characterized in Japan in both preclinical and clinical reports, as well as in several clinical safety studies. Positive results from these studies led to approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in July 2000 of an oral bepotastine besilate formulation.

### Update on sublingual immunotherapy [^1149NtsG]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). High credibility.

To obtain an understanding of the mechanisms, clinical indications, efficacy, and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for treating children and adults with allergic rhinitis, asthma, and allergic conjunctivitis, a MEDLINE and Index Medicus search for peer-reviewed articles on SLIT was performed.

Since the approval of SLIT by the World Health Organization in 1988, the efficacy and safety of SLIT have been confirmed in several new double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for monosensitized patients allergic to house dust mites, grass pollens, ragweed, and birch pollen. Documented immunologic responses to SLIT have included a decrease in serum eosinophilic cationic protein and interleukin 13 (IL-13) levels, an elevation in IL-12 levels, a reduction in late-phase responses, and increases in IgG4/IgE ratios. A Cochrane review of 22 studies confirmed the efficacy and safety of SLIT for patients with allergic rhinitis. A long-term asthma study showed sustained efficacy 5 years after discontinuing the vaccine. The safety of SLIT has been confirmed in postmarketing studies, and severe systemic adverse effects have never been reported. In view of its safety profile, SLIT is taken by the patient at home (away from specialized centers), and no specialized resuscitation facilities are required.

In conclusion, SLIT is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. Because of its efficacy, safety, and ease of administration, it has been accepted in Europe, Southern Africa, and Australasia.

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution 1.5% [^116zdcr8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting up to 60 million Americans annually. The hallmarks of AC include a combination of ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia (redness), which are often accompanied by chemosis, lid swelling, tearing, as well as rhinorrhea and other nasal symptoms. The most common instigators of this allergic condition are either seasonal pollens or perennial allergens, including, but not limited to, dust mites, molds, or animal dander.

Allergic responses generally occur in two phases:

- **Early or immediate (acute) phase**: Occurs within minutes of allergen exposure and results from antigen-evoked mast cell degranulation and subsequent histamine release.
- **Late or delayed (chronic) phase**: Occurs hours or days after exposure and is manifested by proinflammatory mediators and recruitment of immune cells, including eosinophils and neutrophils.

### Therapeutic effects of 0.1% tacrolimus eye drops for refractory allergic ocular diseases with proliferative lesion or corneal involvement [^114EinJf]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement.
- **Methods**: This prospective observational study included 1,436 patients with refractory allergic conjunctivitis whose condition had responded poorly to conventional antiallergic drugs, topical steroids, and/or topical cyclosporine. All patients received tacrolimus eye drops twice daily during the study period. Ten clinical signs and six clinical symptoms were rated on a four-grade scale. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total clinical signs and symptoms score at the last observation or following six months of treatment.
- **Results**: Total signs and symptoms score significantly decreased after one month of treatment (p < 0.001). Giant papillae and corneal lesions were also reduced by tacrolimus eye drop use (p < 0.001). The drug proved effective in patients whose condition did not respond well to topical cyclosporine therapy. About 50% of all patients using topical steroids were weaned. The most common adverse reaction was a transient burning sensation (3.20%).
- **Conclusions**: Tacrolimus eye drops are highly effective in treating refractory allergic conjunctivitis with proliferative lesions and/or corneal involvement, and may reduce or replace topical steroid use.

Trial registration number: UMIN 000008640.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^112fKYq6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common ocular condition estimated to affect 15%–40% of the general population in developed nations. Ocular allergy is characterized by an inflammatory response primarily of the conjunctival mucosa that may also affect the cornea and eyelids. Allergic conjunctivitis encompasses a group of disorders, including seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), and more severe, chronic conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis.

Acute allergic conjunctivitis is primarily caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. The release of histamine induces ocular itching, the hallmark symptom of ocular allergy, along with other signs and symptoms such as redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing. These ocular symptoms are often accompanied by nasal symptoms or rhinitis and are collectively referred to as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. Ocular itching is directly related to the action of histamine on H1 receptors in the conjunctiva. Other allergic symptoms have been attributed to the action of H1 or H2 receptors on the vasculature.

### Dextenza versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^115mBKDb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was preferred over topical therapy. It was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Larger head-to-head trials of therapies for allergic conjunctivitis can further clarify the roles of these agents in disease management.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: A pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^116GBp9u]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). High credibility.

After all evaluations were completed at the end of each visit, the use of the over-the-counter antiallergy eye drop Visine-A® was permitted. However, systemic and/or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin or aspirin-containing products, prescription, over-the-counter or homeopathic antiallergy therapies (including over-the-counter sleeping aids that contain an antihistamine and all antihistamines), all other topical ophthalmic preparations (including tear substitutes), and H1 antagonist antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers (i.e. olopatadine) were not permitted up to 72 hours prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study. Systemic and/or topical corticosteroids were not allowed up to 14 days prior to the start of the study or during the study.
- **Efficacy and safety endpoints**: The primary efficacy measure was ocular itching, 16 hours after instillation of the study medication, evaluated by the subject at 3 minutes post-CAC (primary endpoint) and at 5 and 7 minutes post-CAC (secondary endpoints). For safety assessment, the incidence of adverse events was monitored, and the severity and relationship to the study drug were determined by the investigator. Adverse events were coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 13.1.

### Sublingual immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma: a systematic review [^111iP8Md]. JAMA (2013). High credibility.

Allergic rhinitis affects up to 40% of the US population. To desensitize allergic individuals, subcutaneous injection immunotherapy or sublingual immunotherapy may be administered. In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. However, some US physicians use aqueous allergens off-label for sublingual desensitization.

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness and safety of aqueous sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma.

The evidence was acquired by searching the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through December 22, 2012. English-language randomized controlled trials were included if they compared sublingual immunotherapy with placebo, pharmacotherapy, or other sublingual immunotherapy regimens and reported clinical outcomes. Studies of sublingual immunotherapy that are unavailable in the United States and for which a related immunotherapy is unavailable in the United States were excluded. Paired reviewers selected articles and extracted the data. The strength of the evidence for each comparison and outcome was graded based on the risk of bias (scored on allocation, concealment of intervention, incomplete data, sponsor company involvement, and other bias), consistency, magnitude of effect, and the directness of the evidence.

Sixty-three studies with 5131 participants met the inclusion criteria. Participants' ages ranged from 4 to 74 years. Twenty studies (n = 1814 patients) enrolled only children.

### Management of ocular allergy [^111wZqCy]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment and management of ocular allergy (OA) remain a major concern for various specialties, including allergists, ophthalmologists, primary care physicians, rhinologists, pediatricians, dermatologists, clinical immunologists, and pharmacists. A systematic review was conducted of all relevant publications in MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web Science, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, specifically focusing on treatments and management strategies for OA. If no evidence or good quality evidence was found, a broader systematic literature search was conducted.

There are effective drugs for the treatment of OA; however, an optimal treatment for the perennial and severe forms is still lacking. Topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, or double-action drugs are the first choice of treatment, all of which are effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of OA. The safety and optimal dosing regimen of the most effective topical anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, remain a major concern. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used in steroid-dependent or resistant cases of severe allergic keratoconjunctivitis. Allergen-specific immunotherapy may be considered in cases where first-line treatments fail or to alter the natural course of OA disease. Based on the wealth of publications and collective experience, recommendations for the management of OA have been proposed.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^1145dViH]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Exposure of the conjunctiva to allergens is associated with an immunopathological response that occurs in three phases: sensitization, early phase, and late phase.
- **Sensitization phase**: The sensitization phase of allergic conjunctivitis occurs upon initial exposure of the conjunctiva to airborne allergens such as pollen. When the allergens are deposited on the conjunctiva, their proteolytic enzymes degrade the tight junctions of the conjunctival epithelial cells to gain access to immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and mast cells. The immature DCs engulf the allergen, process it, and undergo biochemical changes leading to the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. The processed allergen is displayed as a peptide in association with MHC class II molecules on the DCs. The mature DC migrates to the regional lymph node where it activates naïve T-cells to proliferate and differentiate into Th2-lymphocytes. The Th2-lymphocytes secrete cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Additionally, the naïve B-lymphocyte interacts with the same allergen, processing it into peptides that are presented in association with MHC class II molecules as a peptide:MHC class II complex on the B-cell receptors. Interaction between T-cell receptors of the allergen-specific Th2-lymphocytes and B-cell receptors of the allergen-activated B-lymphocytes, in conjunction with CD40–CD40L interactions in the presence of IL-4, triggers the proliferation and differentiation of the B-lymphocytes.

### Phase III trials examining the efficacy of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% compared to vehicle for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^114yLcWL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Most approved treatments for ocular allergies are antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, or both. They act to reduce the signs and symptoms of the early-phase reaction. Cetirizine hydrochloride (Zyrtec®; Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc; New Brunswick, NJ, USA) is the number one oral antihistamine allergy treatment recommended by allergists. The cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% used in these studies was a sterile, buffered, clear, colorless aqueous solution containing cetirizine 0.24% (equivalent to cetirizine hydrochloride 0.29%) and 0.010% benzalkonium chloride (preservative). Cetirizine hydrochloride selectively inhibits H1 histamine receptors to treat seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, idiopathic urticaria, and itching due to chronic hives and has a long-standing record of approval in different formulations. Cetirizine hydrochloride is safe and well-tolerated. It was approved in tablet form (5 and 10 mg) in the United States in 1995, as a syrup formulation in 1996, for children aged 2–5 years in 1998, for children aged 6 months and older in 2002, and for nonprescription use as a chewable tablet and syrup in 2007. The long-standing therapeutic success and safety of cetirizine hydrochloride in different formulations and pronounced ocular symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis supported the development of cetirizine hydrochloride as an ophthalmic solution to combat the ocular effects of allergic conjunctivitis.

In 2018, cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0.24% (Zerviate™) was approved by the Food and Drug Agency for the treatment of ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

### Allergic conjunctivitis: Update on pathophysiology and prospects for future treatment [^116njrWC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis is, in actuality, a group of diseases affecting the ocular surface and is usually associated with type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. Two acute disorders, seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, and three chronic diseases, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis, exist. The ocular surface inflammation, usually mast cell driven, results in itching, tearing, lid and conjunctival edema-redness, and photophobia during the acute phase. It can lead to a classic late-phase response, with associated eosinophilia and neutrophilia, in a subset of individuals. As is the case in other allergic diseases, a chronic disease can also develop, accompanied by remodeling of the ocular surface tissues. In severe cases, the patient experiences extreme discomfort and sustains damage to the ocular surface. For such cases, there is no highly effective and safe treatment regimen. Topical administration of corticosteroids is used in severe cases but is associated with an increased risk for the development of cataracts and glaucoma. Thus, there is a worldwide search for new biotargets for the treatment of these diseases. This article provides a brief update on the clinical symptoms associated with these diseases, the rationale for disease classification, recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the diseases, and an update on both preclinical and clinical advances toward refined therapies for these diseases.

### Vernal keratoconjunctivitis [^1175xtke]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There is currently no defined gold-standard treatment algorithm for VKC, but there are many options available, and treatment should be tailored to the individual. Whatever treatment regimen is prescribed, it should be initiated promptly and the patient should be monitored closely for the development of any corneal complications.

A Cochrane review by Mantelli et al. included 27 randomized controlled trials encompassing 2,184 eyes in an effort to evaluate topical therapies for the treatment of VKC. They found that all common antiallergic eye drops are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of the disease, and that some patients even respond to placebo.

A critical initial component of all allergic disease involves avoidance of inciting factors. Patients should be encouraged to wash hands frequently and avoid touching or rubbing their eyes. Cold compresses and artificial tears may help alleviate symptoms in mild cases or as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic treatment.
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: First-line pharmacologic therapy for VKC is topical treatment, and there is considerable therapeutic overlap with other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. Mast cell stabilizers are a mainstay for prophylaxis. In milder cases, antihistamines may be of benefit, but more severe cases may require corticosteroid treatment. Long-term steroid use is associated with many complications, so other immunomodulatory treatments have been studied extensively.
- **Mast cell stabilizers**: Mast cell stabilizers are thought to prevent mast cell degranulation via inhibition of calcium channels.

### Allergen-specific immunotherapy: From therapeutic vaccines to prophylactic approaches [^112jyTXe]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin E-mediated allergies affect more than 25% of the population. Allergen exposure induces a variety of symptoms in allergic patients, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma, dermatitis, food allergy, and life-threatening systemic anaphylaxis. Currently, allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), which is based on the administration of the disease-causing allergens, is the only disease-modifying treatment for allergies.

Therapeutic allergy vaccines are still prepared from relatively poorly defined allergen extracts. However, with the availability of the structures of the most common allergen molecules, it has become possible to produce well-defined recombinant and synthetic allergy vaccines that allow specific targeting of the mechanisms of allergic disease. This paper provides a summary of the development and mechanisms of SIT and reviews new forms of therapeutic vaccines based on recombinant and synthetic molecules. Finally, it discusses possible allergen-specific strategies for the prevention of allergic disease.

### Rhinitis 2020: A practice parameter update [^111rAJqm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for allergic rhinitis, particularly concerning allergen immunotherapy, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2020 guidelines recommend considering offering allergen immunotherapy (subcutaneous or sublingual) through shared decision-making in patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis:

- **Not controlled with allergen avoidance and/or pharmacotherapy**: Patients who are unable to manage their symptoms through conventional means may consider this option.
- **Choosing immunotherapy as the preferred method of treatment**: Some patients may prefer immunotherapy due to a desire to avoid the adverse effects, costs, or long-term use of pharmacotherapy.
- **Desiring the potential benefit of immunotherapy to prevent or reduce the severity of comorbid conditions, such as asthma**: This potential benefit can be an important consideration for patients with interconnected allergic conditions.
