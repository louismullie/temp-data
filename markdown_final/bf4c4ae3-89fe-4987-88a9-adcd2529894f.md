Interpret this. Iron 73. Transferrin 333. Ferritin 11. Tibc 466. Transferrin sat 16

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an interpretation of an iron study panel showing serum iron 73 mcg/dL, transferrin 333 mg/dL, TIBC 466 mcg/dL, transferrin saturation 16%, and ferritin 11 ng/mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic calculations and whether the reported indices are internally consistent. Then, I should verify how each parameter behaves in iron deficiency versus iron overload states. Next, I will apply guideline-based diagnostic thresholds, especially ferritin and transferrin saturation, and consider inflammation. After that, I should integrate the pattern into a unifying diagnosis and grade the severity. Finally, I will outline immediate next steps, including hemoglobin confirmation, inflammatory markers, and source evaluation, and close with a concise synthesis and caveats about confounders and special populations.

> Let me first confirm the arithmetic and internal consistency of the panel, because if the math is off, the interpretation could be misleading. The transferrin saturation is calculated as serum iron divided by TIBC times 100, so 73 divided by 466 equals 0.1566, which is 15.66% and rounds to 16%, which matches the reported TSAT, and the transferrin and TIBC are directionally concordant, so the numbers are internally consistent and I can proceed with confidence.

> Now, I will examine each parameter in the context of iron deficiency physiology. Ferritin at 11 ng/mL is unequivocally low and, in the absence of inflammation, is highly specific for depleted iron stores, while transferrin saturation at 16% is below the commonly cited 20% threshold indicating insufficient circulating iron for erythropoiesis, and TIBC at 466 mcg/dL is elevated reflecting increased transferrin production when stores are low, which together reinforce absolute iron deficiency rather than functional sequestration or overload physiology [^116PBzzy] [^114L59rA] [^1154eFBy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ferritin alone. I should confirm guideline thresholds because different cutoffs change sensitivity and specificity, and the AGA recommends using a ferritin cutoff of 45 ng/mL in patients with anemia to maximize sensitivity, whereas the very low 15 ng/mL cutoff is overly specific and misses many cases, so a ferritin of 11 ng/mL is not just below 15 but also far below 30–45, which strengthens the diagnosis of absolute iron deficiency in this context [^112knLuE] [^116PBzzy] [^113Sa7RP].

> Wait, let me verify the role of transferrin saturation. TSAT less than 20% is a recognized marker of insufficient iron delivery to tissues and is particularly helpful when ferritin might be equivocal or confounded by inflammation, and here TSAT is 16%, which independently supports iron-restricted erythropoiesis and aligns with the low ferritin to indicate absolute iron deficiency rather than anemia of chronic disease or functional iron deficiency [^114L59rA] [^115bHVQo] [^1154eFBy].

> I need to check for confounding by inflammation because ferritin is an acute-phase reactant. In the presence of inflammation, ferritin can be falsely normal or elevated despite iron deficiency, so I should confirm CRP or ESR and, if inflammation is present, rely more on TSAT and consider soluble transferrin receptor or the sTfR/log ferritin index to improve diagnostic accuracy, but with ferritin this low and TSAT below 20%, the likelihood of true iron deficiency remains very high even before inflammatory markers are known [^112knLuE] [^116PBzzy] [^113eg9a9].

> Let me synthesize the pattern. Low ferritin with low TSAT and high TIBC is the classic triad of absolute iron deficiency, and the magnitude of ferritin depletion here indicates that iron stores are exhausted to the point where anemia is expected if not already present, so I should confirm hemoglobin, MCV, and RDW to document iron-deficiency anemia and to stage severity, while also remembering that a robust hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks of iron therapy is itself highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency even if baseline studies were equivocal [^116PBzzy] [^112knLuE] [^115bHVQo].

> Next, I should review immediate actions. I will now examine a complete blood count with indices to confirm anemia and its morphology, obtain CRP to assess inflammation, and, if the patient is a man or a postmenopausal woman or if there is no clear menstrual explanation, initiate a gastrointestinal evaluation for occult blood loss because iron deficiency in these groups mandates evaluation for malignancy and other GI pathology, with bidirectional endoscopy commonly recommended in guidelines [^112knLuE] [^115bHVQo] [^114RKcrQ].

> But wait, what if the patient is premenopausal? I should double-check menstrual history and consider a therapeutic trial of iron if symptoms and history strongly suggest benign menorrhagia, yet even then, persistent or recurrent iron deficiency warrants source evaluation, and I must avoid anchoring on a single cause because mixed etiologies can coexist, so shared decision-making about timing and extent of GI evaluation is prudent [^1156qyBS].

> I should confirm treatment implications. Oral iron is first-line for most patients, but if there is malabsorption, intolerance, ongoing blood loss, or the need for rapid repletion, intravenous iron is appropriate, and in parallel I must treat the underlying cause to prevent recurrence, with follow-up labs in 4–8 weeks to document hematologic response and reassess ferritin and TSAT for repletion of stores.

> In summary, after verifying the calculations and aligning the pattern with guideline thresholds, this profile represents unequivocal absolute iron deficiency with exhausted stores and insufficient circulating iron supply, and the next critical steps are to confirm anemia on CBC, assess inflammation, and pursue source identification — particularly gastrointestinal evaluation in men and postmenopausal women — while initiating iron repletion and arranging close follow-up to confirm response and prevent recurrence [^112knLuE] [^116cC5xS] [^114J4SK1].

This iron study shows **iron deficiency anemia** [^115LH3LE] with low ferritin (11 ng/mL) [^112knLuE], low transferrin saturation (16%) [^114JLXDd], and elevated TIBC (466 mcg/dL), indicating depleted stores and reduced circulating iron [^1154eFBy]. The pattern is not consistent with iron overload [^116AdNiR] or anemia of chronic disease [^1162718v]. Confirm with CBC, reticulocytes, and inflammatory markers [^112knLuE], then evaluate for **GI blood loss** [^115bHVQo] (colonoscopy/EGD) [^114RKcrQ] and other causes if unexplained. Treat with **iron replacement** [^115LH3LE] and address the underlying source.

## Interpretation of iron studies

| **Parameter** | **Patient value** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Serum iron | 73 mcg/dL | 60–170 mcg/dL | Low-normal |
| Transferrin | 333 mg/dL | 200–400 mg/dL | Normal |
| Ferritin | 11 ng/mL | 15–150 ng/mL | Low |
| TIBC | 466 mcg/dL | 250–370 mcg/dL | High |
| Transferrin saturation | 16% | 20–50% | Low |

---

- **Ferritin**: Low (11 ng/mL) indicates depleted iron stores [^112knLuE].
- **Transferrin saturation**: Low (16%) reflects reduced circulating iron [^1154eFBy].
- **TIBC**: High (466 mcg/dL) indicates increased transferrin production due to low iron [^115LH3LE].
- **Serum iron**: Low-normal (73 mcg/dL) is consistent with early iron deficiency [^115LH3LE].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The pattern of low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, and high TIBC is most consistent with **iron deficiency anemia** [^1154eFBy]. Other causes — such as anemia of chronic disease, iron overload, or functional iron deficiency — are less likely given the low ferritin and low transferrin saturation [^1162718v] [^116AdNiR].

---

## Clinical implications

Iron deficiency anemia is common and may cause fatigue, pallor, and impaired quality of life [^115LH3LE]. It is essential to **identify and treat the underlying cause** [^115LH3LE] to prevent recurrence.

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Confirm anemia**: Obtain CBC, reticulocyte count, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) [^112sp2gt].
- **Identify cause**: Evaluate for gastrointestinal blood loss (colonoscopy, upper endoscopy) [^112adccT] and other sources if unexplained [^113vr4kU].
- **Treat deficiency**: Initiate iron replacement therapy (oral or intravenous) based on severity and tolerance [^115LH3LE].
- **Monitor response**: Recheck hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation after 4–6 weeks of therapy [^1156qyBS].

---

## Conclusion

The iron studies indicate **iron deficiency anemia** [^115LH3LE] with depleted stores and reduced circulating iron. Confirm with CBC and inflammatory markers, identify the cause, and treat with iron replacement to restore stores and correct anemia [^112knLuE].

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrates a substantial increase in the rate of iron deficiency diagnoses when ferritin cutoffs of 30 and 45 ng/mL, respectively, are chosen over 15 ng/mL. Our results provide an information base for health system–level evaluations of ferritin testing in primary care. In addition, they highlight the need for harmonization of guidelines for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

Postdisclosure Health Behaviors and Laboratory Findings

Postdisclosure health behaviors examined in MyCode-identified participants included laboratory testing relevant to iron metabolism, liver biopsy, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), phlebotomy, and chelation. For each behavior that was completed after disclosure, attribution to the HFE result disclosure was assessed using clinician documentation (eg, medical record notes) and diagnostic codes associated with orders in the EHR.

Laboratory test results relevant to iron metabolism that were available in the EHR were evaluated for each MyCode-identified participant. Each participant's highest serum iron, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation levels and lowest total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) level were collected and assessed for evidence of iron overload. Participants were considered to have iron overload if they met laboratory, imaging, or other criteria.

The laboratory criteria were transferrin saturation of 45% or greater and serum ferritin level of 300 ng/mL or greater in individuals assigned male at birth or 200 ng/mL or greater in individuals assigned female at birth, (to convert serum ferritin to microgram per liter, multiply by 1.0); laboratory studies could be completed asynchronously. Imaging criteria were a radiology report explicitly referencing iron overload (eg, moderate hepatic iron deposition noted on MRI). Other criteria were iron overload on liver biopsy or clinical documentation of iron overload such as on the problem list, encounter diagnoses, clinician documentation, and scanned notes.

Comparisons and Definitions

Iron metabolism laboratory values and laboratory iron overload rates were compared between MyCode-identified participants and participants negative for p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity. The HFE- associated phenotypes that were compared between MyCode-identified participants and clinically identified participants included iron overload, liver disease, and heart disease. Liver disease was defined as fibrosis, cirrhosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and/or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, abnormal results of a liver function test (≥ 2 elevated transaminase measurements in the EHR ≥ 3 months apart without an intervening normal value), or other documentation of chronic liver disease (eg, diagnosis of liver disease on the problem list). As a secondary research question exploring the synergistic effect of genomic and other liver disease risk factors, frequency of liver disease was assessed in MyCode-identified participants and clinically identified participants with or without liver disease risk factors, defined as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use disorder (AUD; mention of AUD in the EHR). Heart disease was defined as evidence of cardiomyopathy and/or heart failure documented in the EHR.

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and serum folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
Hb electrophoresis.
Free light chains and bone marrow examination.

Treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy Anaemia of CKD (guidelines 2.1–2.4)

Guideline 2.1 - treatment of Anaemia with iron therapy – Iron repletion

We recommend that patients should be iron replete to achieve and maintain target Hb whether receiving ESAs or not. (1B)

Iron repletion is usually defined as:
%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg/ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA therapy. (ungraded)

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116gS2jE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — when to initiate treatment is outlined for HFE genotypes: Treatment should be initiated in C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin (SF), defined as > 300 ng/mL in men and > 200 ng/mL in women, along with a transferrin saturation (TS) of ≥ 45%. Homozygous patients with a SF within normal limits at diagnosis are unlikely to develop clinically relevant iron overload later in life and therefore can be monitored with serial assessment of liver aminotransferase and SF levels. Although patients with a SF of < 1,000 ng/mL at diagnosis are unlikely to have end-organ damage, we still suggest treatment because between 13% and 35% of men and between 16% and 22% of women will progress to a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL if left untreated. For compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) the risk of developing clinically relevant iron overload is low; a liver biopsy can be considered to rule out secondary liver disorders or to evaluate NAFLD and cirrhosis, particularly among individuals with a SF above 1,000 ng/mL, and for compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes with evidence of elevated hepatic iron concentration (HIC) on biopsy, iron removal can be considered.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116PBzzy]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^116RmEyQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to measure serum ferritin levels in the assessment and management of patients with all forms of iron-restricted erythropoiesis, including functional iron deficiency. View values < 12 mcg/L indicative for absent iron stores.
Do not exclude the possibility of functional iron deficiency in case of values as high as 1,200 mcg/L in patients with CKD, and recognize that some such patients may respond to IV iron therapy. View a serum ferritin concentration of < 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis patients or < 200 mcg/L in chronic hemodialysis patients as predictive of iron deficiency and potentially good response to IV iron therapy.
Do not use values above the suggested cut-offs to guide iron therapy. Use serum ferritin values > 1,200 mcg/L to ascertain obtaining evaluation for potential iron overload.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113vJuQi]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: all patients with IBD are at risk for anemia. For laboratory screening, a complete blood count, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and C-reactive protein should be used. For patients in remission or mild disease, measurements are suggested every 6–12 months, and in active disease it is suggested to repeat screening every 3 months. In the presence of iron deficiency, iron supplementation is advised; intravenous iron is considered more effective and often better tolerated than oral iron, oral iron repletion is reasonable in mild anemia or clinically inactive disease, and dosing is based on baseline hemoglobin and body weight.

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm 3, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### Anemia in children with inflammatory bowel disease: a position paper by the IBD committee of the north American society of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^113eMMXn]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Serum ferritin — assessment in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes threshold-based interpretation and important caveats: the WHO and American Academy of Pediatrics definitions note iron deficiency at ferritin levels below 12 and 15 μg/L in otherwise healthy children, while in adult IBD guidance serum ferritin levels below 30 μg/L are highly suggestive of iron deficiency and levels above 100 μg/L are unlikely; values between 30 and 100 μg/L may still indicate iron deficiency with inflammation, and post–intravenous iron ferritin may be misleading for up to 8 weeks. Interpretation requires consideration of inflammatory markers because ferritin is an acute phase reactant and can be altered by non–iron-related conditions.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relationship to other clinical parameters including the patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine, and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among women and children from Africa, Asia, Europe, and central America: a multinational comparative study [^111tZ19f]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of iron deficiency commonly relies on measurement of serum ferritin concentrations. WHO guidelines identify serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency among healthy individuals of less than 15 μg/L for women and less than 12 μg/L for children under 5 years, based on expert opinion. We report thresholds for iron deficiency for apparently healthy non-pregnant women and young children based on physiological indicators.

Methods

We performed secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from women (aged 15–49 years) and children (aged 6–59 months) from 12 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and central America from available surveys (2007–19). Using haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations as individual-level indicators of iron deficiency, we identified country-specific serum ferritin thresholds. We conducted multivariate meta-analysis using individual participant data to assess multinational heterogeneity and intercountry consistency.

Findings

Data were collected from July, 2007 to March, 2019. 18251 individuals (13864 women and 4387 children) were included in the final analysis. The thresholds of pooled serum ferritin levels corresponding to the starting point of decline in circulating haemoglobin concentrations were 24.8 μg/L (95% CI 24.4–25.2) for women and 22.1 μg/L (20.8–23.4) for children based on the national survey data from 12 countries. The thresholds were consistent among countries (p heterogeneity: women = 0.73, children = 0.43) but median serum ferritin concentrations and lower 5% reference ranges differed. In all countries, the prevalence of iron deficiency was higher using physiologically based thresholds than that using WHO current guidelines for women (36.0% [95% CI 25.3–46.8] vs 20.1% [11.5–28.7], p < 0.0001) and for children (34.2% [24.3–44.1] vs 16.6% [11.2–22.0], p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

These results provide evidence that the prevalence of iron deficiency as indicated by physiological measures is substantially higher than those based on current WHO guidelines. The consistency of physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds in apparently healthy women and young children offers a potential means to achieve evidence-informed coordination in thresholds for iron deficiency across populations. The use of physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds could help in detecting the clinical and functional outcomes of iron deficiency.

Screening tests and interpretation in IBD-related anemia specify that initially a complete blood count (CBC), CRP, and ferritin levels should be performed, and if anemic, testing should include CBC with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hgb concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, CRP, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT); in IDA and FID anemia is more likely to be microcytic and hypochromic (low MCV and MCHC) whereas in ACD it is more likely normocytic and normochromic; macrocytosis may be seen with vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency or drug therapy including sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 6-MP, and azathioprine; a high RDW in the presence of microcytosis suggests iron deficiency and has a high sensitivity of about 93% for the diagnosis of iron deficiency; the reticulocyte count is a useful marker of bone marrow response where a low count indicates suppression of erythropoiesis and a high initial count raises suspicion for hemolysis prompting further evaluation including a peripheral blood cell smear, serum haptoglobin, bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and direct Coomb's test; if the platelet count is high, iron deficiency and/or inflammation is more likely.

### New cut-off values for ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor for the assessment of iron deficiency in children in a high infection pressure area [^113eg9a9]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, the diagnostic efficiency of sTfR and a variety of more conventional laboratory tests for the identification of deficiency of iron stores or functional deficiency was evaluated. The results suggested that serum transferrin, TIBC and transferrin saturation were of limited value in diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores as their corresponding AUC ROC values did not provide acceptable sensitivity and specificity estimates. Most likely, this relates to the interference of inflammatory cytokines produced as part of the acute phase response during an infection.

The bone marrow iron smear was used as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of deficiency of iron stores. It has generally been considered the most reliable diagnostic test, but has the limitations of being more invasive than peripheral blood iron markers. Furthermore, incorrect assessment of iron stores in bone marrow aspirates has been described.

Ferritin has been widely used as an iron marker in individuals without inflammatory conditions. Conversely, sTfR is considered to reflect the degree of tissue iron need, and there is evidence that it is a good indicator of iron status when the iron stores are depleted. The reciprocal relationship between sTfR and ferritin describes a perfect log-linear relationship over a wide range of normal and depleted iron stores states. Punnonen et al evaluated various possibilities of combinations of sTfR and ferritin parameters, and concluded that use of the sTfR/log ferritin ratio (TfR-F index) considerably improved diagnostic efficiency, even in settings with a high infection pressure.

In the present study, serum ferritin had a high specificity and sTfR a high sensitivity, which is consistent with previous studies. Changing the current conventional cut-off of TfR-F index (5.6) to its optimal cut-off (according to the ROC analysis) of 5.3 has little effect on its diagnostic efficiency. This is in contrast with ferritin and sTfR which required a change of 810% and 80%, respectively, to achieve maximal sensitivity and specificity.

### Raised serum ferritin concentration in hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome is not a marker for iron overload [^113e9x6Y]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Serum ferritin concentration, in the absence of potential confounding factors such as inflammation, obesity, and cancer, is an indicator of body iron stores. Despite its widespread use as a clinical marker, the origins of serum ferritin remain incompletely understood. Serum ferritin mainly comprises truncated FTL subunits and surprisingly contains little iron, so it differs from intracellular ferritin. Serum ferritin is thought to be mainly secreted by macrophages, although hepatocytes and other cells may also contribute. In HHCS, L-ferritin synthesis is uncoupled from cellular iron stores so that hyperferritinemia indicates unregulated L-ferritin synthesis, not iron overload. Although in HHCS L-ferritin may accumulate harmlessly in other tissues, this is not the case in the lens of the eye, where low protein turnover and containment by the capsule may retain ferritin synthesized within the lens; accumulated ferritin crystals may then disrupt light transmission.

HHCS is associated with bilateral cataracts, autosomal dominant inheritance, and hyperferritinemia unrelated to body iron stores. Although HHCS is increasingly recognized as a clinical syndrome, other published reports indicate that the diagnosis is often missed initially and only recognized following the adverse effects of venesection or chelation therapy with desferrioxamine. This is well illustrated in the present patient in whom there were several missed opportunities for exclusion of hemochromatosis and diagnosis of HHCS. These include: family screening (at presentation of the grandmother and mother as well as the patient); at interpretation of the liver biopsy histopathology result showing no iron overload; at rheumatological investigation of this young patient with rheumatoid factor negative arthritis. For the serum biochemical investigation of iron status, along with measurement of ferritin concentration, iron concentration, and TIBC for determination of transferrin saturation are always required. In this case, despite venesection and the development of iron deficiency, serum ferritin remained persistently elevated in the absence of iron overload. Hemochromatosis cannot be diagnosed on the grounds of hyperferritinemia without iron overload.

Guideline 1.5 - evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
free light chains and bone marrow examination.
Hb electrophoresis.

### Iron dextran [^113M5a7A]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Oral iron should be discontinued prior to administration of INFeD.

Dosage:

I. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Periodic hematologic determination (hemoglobin and hematocrit) is a simple and accurate technique for monitoring hematological response, and should be used as a guide in therapy. It should be recognized that iron storage may lag behind the appearance of normal blood morphology. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and percent saturation of transferrin are other important tests for detecting and monitoring the iron deficient state.

After administration of iron dextran complex, evidence of a therapeutic response can be seen in a few days as an increase in the reticulocyte count.

Although serum ferritin is usually a good guide to body iron stores, the correlation of body iron stores and serum ferritin may not be valid in patients on chronic renal dialysis who are also receiving iron dextran complex.

Although there are significant variations in body build and weight distribution among males and females, the accompanying table and formula represent a convenient means for estimating the total iron required. This total iron requirement reflects the amount of iron needed to restore hemoglobin concentration to normal or near normal levels plus an additional allowance to provide adequate replenishment of iron stores in most individuals with moderately or severely reduced levels of hemoglobin. It should be remembered that iron deficiency anemia will not appear until essentially all iron stores have been depleted. Therapy, thus, should aim at not only replenishment of hemoglobin iron but iron stores as well.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^112adccT]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Recognition of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is important to initiate timely evaluation for gastrointestinal tract cancer. Retrospective studies have reported delays in diagnostic evaluation of IDA as a common factor associated with delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

Objective

To assess how US primary care physicians (PCPs) approach testing for anemia, interpret iron laboratory studies, and refer patients with IDA for gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This survey study, conducted in August 2019, included members of the American College of Physicians Internal Medicine Insiders Panel, a nationally representative group of American College of Physicians membership, who self-identified as PCPs. Participants completed a vignette-based survey to assess practices related to screening for anemia, interpretation of laboratory-based iron studies, and appropriate diagnostic evaluation of IDA.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Descriptive statistics based on survey responses were evaluated for frequency of anemia screening, correct interpretation of iron laboratory studies, and proportion of patients with new-onset IDA referred for gastrointestinal tract evaluation.

Results

Of 631 PCPs who received an invitation to participate in the survey, 356 (56.4%) responded and 31 (4.9%) were excluded, for an adjusted eligible sample size of 600, yielding 325 completed surveys (response rate, 54.2%). Of the 325 participants who completed surveys, 180 (55.4%) were men; age of participants was not assessed. The mean (SD) duration of clinical experience was 19.8 (11.2) years (range, 1.0–45.0 years). A total of 250 participants (76.9%) screened at least some patients for anemia. Interpretation of iron studies was least accurate in a scenario of a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL) with low transferrin saturation (2%); 86 participants (26.5%) incorrectly responded that this scenario did not indicate IDA, and 239 (73.5%) correctly identified this scenario as IDA. Of 312 participants, 170 (54.5%) recommended bidirectional endoscopy (upper endoscopy and colonoscopy) for new IDA for women aged 65 years; of 305 respondents, 168 (55.1%) recommended bidirectional endoscopy for men aged 65 years.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this survey study, US PCPs' self-reported testing practices for anemia suggest overuse of screening laboratory tests, misinterpretation of iron studies, and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy for evaluation of new-onset IDA. Both misinterpretation of iron studies and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy can lead to delayed diagnosis of gastrointestinal tract cancers and warrant additional interventions.

DIAGNOSIS OF IRON DEFICIENCY

Serum ferritin is widely recognized as the most specific and cost‐effective biomarker for evaluating iron stores in the body. Establishing standardized ferritin thresholds that align with physiological norms is essential for accurately diagnosing low iron stores. However, current guidelines differ, which may lead to the potential underdiagnosis or overdiagnosis of ID.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines ferritin thresholds as < 12 μg/L for children and < 15 μg/L for women, but these values were based on expert opinion rather than physiological data, and the method used to determine cut‐offs was not detailed. A study analysing data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) identified a serum ferritin threshold of 25 μg/L for non‐pregnant women aged 15–49 years. This threshold was derived using restricted cubic spline models that assessed the physiological relationship between serum ferritin and both haemoglobin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations in healthy individuals. Data from 62 anaemic individuals with either bone marrow‐confirmed ID (n = 54) or a documented response to iron therapy (n = 8) showed that ferritin < 12 μg/L yielded a sensitivity of only 25% for the diagnosis of ID. In contrast, increasing the threshold to < 30 μg/L significantly improved sensitivity to 92%. The soluble transferrin receptor showed a sensitivity of 92%, outperforming ferritin at the < 12 μg/L threshold and matching the performance of ferritin at the < 30 μg/L threshold. Increasingly, experts recommend a ferritin cut‐off of 30 μg/L for healthy males and females over 15 years.,

Although ferritin is the most reliable marker of iron stores, it can be elevated during inflammation, potentially masking ID. Therefore, measuring C‐reactive protein (CRP) or α1‐acid glycoprotein alongside ferritin helps distinguish true ID from inflammation‐related conditions in relevant cases. Additionally, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin receptor levels can provide further insights, particularly in cases where ferritin levels may be unreliable due to inflammatory conditions,(Table 1).

### Iron deficiency anemia [^1156qyBS]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^114RKcrQ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a classic early diagnostic sign of gastrointestinal (GI) tract malignant neoplasm. Between 1% and 10% of adult patients with IDA may have undiagnosed GI tract cancer. Prompt and thorough evaluation of IDA is essential. However, retrospective studies have reported that delays in diagnostic evaluation of IDA are common, and can lead to a delayed diagnosis of colorectal cancer. This problem is of increasing importance given the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients outside the age range for which routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, for whom IDA may be the first diagnostic sign of malignant neoplasm.

Clinical practices related to identification and evaluation of IDA likely vary substantially, with at least 30 different guidelines from 10 specialty societies. However, variation related to testing practices, interpretation of laboratory test results, and diagnostic evaluation of IDA among physicians is not well studied even though these factors may be associated with diagnostic delays, missed cancer diagnoses, and low-value care. For instance, because of a low diagnostic yield, anemia screening is not recommended for adults except during pregnancy, and recommendations about screening during pregnancy are mixed. Inappropriate screening may be associated with health care waste and potential unintended harm (eg, additional downstream diagnostic tests). Inaccurate test interpretation of iron studies (eg, serum ferritin level and iron saturation) can also lead to medical error, with misclassification of patients' iron level. Interpretation can be complicated because the ferritin level may be elevated in the context of an inflammatory process, potentially masking underlying iron deficiency. Guidelines consistently recommend that men with IDA and postmenopausal women, in the absence of obvious causes, should be evaluated for potential occult GI tract blood loss with colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, older guidelines, which predated the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among younger patients observed over the past decade, recommended against initial endoscopic evaluation for premenopausal women with IDA given the more common cause of iron deficiency secondary to menstrual blood loss. Together, these issues introduce ambiguity and complexity to the evaluation of IDA.

Our objective was to understand how primary care physicians (PCPs) approach testing and evaluation of patients for IDA. To do this, we conducted a survey study consisting of a vignette-based assessment of PCPs to examine their practices related to IDA testing and evaluation for male and female patients of different ages. A better understanding of current PCP evaluation and referral patterns for GI endoscopy in the context of IDA may reveal potential opportunities to intervene and promote earlier diagnosis of GI tract cancers.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^114JLXDd]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Circulating iron bound to transferrin (TIBC, total iron binding capacity — by transferrin) reflects the amount of iron available for metabolizing target cells. Importantly, neither serum iron nor serum transferrin alone should be used as biomarkers of iron status. Instead, transferrin saturation (Tsat), the per cent of transferrin that has iron bound to it (ratio of serum iron and TIBC × 100), is recommended. Reduced Tsat (< 20%) is considered a surrogate of insufficient iron available for metabolizing cells. With malnutrition accompanying chronic diseases, liver synthesis and blood transferrin levels may be low, which can artificially increase Tsat disproportionate to the iron content.

When serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg/L (which is frequent in patients with chronic diseases with pro-inflammatory activation), the diagnosis of ID is more complex. Such values are usually associated with normal/slightly increased intracellular iron stores and the diagnosis of absolute ID cannot be made. If there is restricted iron delivery to target cells (reduced Tsat < 20%), functional ID can be diagnosed.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^115PFf6Y]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

Chronic kidney disease in diabetes mellitus — laboratory assessment and mineral-bone management are specified as follows: persons with CKD in DM should undergo annual or more frequent assessment of electrolytes, blood counts, and calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH) vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements to assess mineral metabolism. For those with serum bicarbonate level < 22 mEq/L, the addition of oral sodium bicarbonate is recommended to correct the serum bicarbonate level. Anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women, should be further investigated with iron, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin B12, and folate levels, and deficiencies should be replaced with a transferrin saturation target of ≥ 30% achieved. AACE recommends adequate calcium intake and achievement of 25(OH) vitamin D levels of > 30 ng/dL; supplementing vitamin D2 or D3 may reduce PTH in persons with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and active vitamin D preparations are usually necessary to keep the PTH level from increasing as eGFR declines.

Compared with an ESA alone, adding iron increased the likelihood of hematopoietic response (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.26) and reduced the likelihood of RBC transfusion (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92).

### Harmonization of blood-based indicators of iron status: making the hard work matter [^117FwaKj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Blood-based indicators that are used in the assessment of iron status are assumed to be accurate. In practice, inaccuracies in these measurements exist and stem from bias and variability. For example, the analytic variability of serum ferritin measurements across laboratories is very high (> 15%), which increases the rate of misclassification in clinical and epidemiologic studies. The procedures that are used in laboratory medicine to minimize bias and variability could be used effectively in clinical research studies, particularly in the evaluation of iron deficiency and its associated anemia in pregnancy and early childhood and in characterizing states of iron repletion and excess. The harmonization and standardization of traditional and novel bioindicators of iron status will allow results from clinical studies to be more meaningfully translated into clinical practice by providing a firm foundation for clinical laboratories to set appropriate cutoffs. In addition, proficiency testing monitors the performance of the methods over time. It is important that measures of iron status be evaluated, validated, and performed in a manner that is consistent with standard procedures in laboratory medicine.

### ACG clinical guideline: hereditary hemochromatosis [^116AdNiR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis — iron studies for diagnostic evaluation: Transferrin saturation (TS) is the preferred initial screening test, and fasting is not required to accurately determine TS. A TS of greater than 45% identifies 97.9%–100% of C282Y homozygotes, although a small proportion of patients with HH such as young individuals at an earlier stage may have TS of < 45%. Serum ferritin (SF) is an excellent predictor of advanced fibrosis; in C282Y homozygotes, a SF of > 1,000 ng/mL, in combination with elevated aminotransferase levels and/or low platelet count, predicts cirrhosis in more than 80% of patients. A normal SF, defined as less than 200 ng/mL in premenopausal women or 300 ng/mL in men and postmenopausal women, in combination with a TS of < 45%, has a negative predictive value of 97% for excluding iron overload. A unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) below 26 μmol/L has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 50% for detecting C282Y homozygosity.

Iron (Fe) status

There are several parameters that can be measured to evaluate the the iron status of an individual, including Zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) serum ferritin and transferrin saturation measurements.

The interpretation of all three parameters should be done with some caution. Measurement of iron status in samples with hypochromic, microcytic indices but with normal Hb A 2 and F is useful to distinguish between cases of iron deficiency and those with possible α -thalassaemia trait or certain form of 'silent' β -thalassaemia trait, the latter of which should have normal iron status. This distinction is useful to prevent unnecessary further investigation as well as inappropriate iron therapy. However, it is important to note that iron deficiency can co-exist with the thalassaemias, which could lead to misinterpretation. If an individual is found to be iron deficient, it is recommended to repeat the haematology screen once the individual is iron replete, although this may not always be practical or feasible in a couple with an on-going pregnancy.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) good practice statement — iron testing and management: In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron binding capacity), with testing ideally administered in the morning avoiding all iron-containing supplementation and foods at least 24 hours prior to blood draw. Consensus guidelines suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be instituted with oral or intravenous (IV) iron if serum ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%, and only with IV iron if serum ferritin is between 75 and 100 ng/mL; in children, supplementation of iron should be instituted for serum ferritin < 50 ng/mL with oral or IV formulations. The first step in the management of RLS should be addressing exacerbating factors, and RLS is common in pregnancy; prescribers should consider the pregnancy-specific safety profile of each treatment being considered.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^117T6jBq]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although iron-deficiency anemia is common, interpreting iron laboratory test results can be challenging in patients with comorbidities. We aimed to study the accuracy of common iron biomarkers compared with bone marrow iron staining in a large retrospective data set of patients with hematologic disorders. We collected from 6610 patients (median age, 66 years) results of iron staining, with their concurrent ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, transferrin, hemoglobin, and mean red blood cell volume results from Helsinki University Hospital electronic health records. In receiver operating characteristics analysis, ferritin had the highest area under the curve (AUC) with 88% (95% confidence interval [CI] 86–90) for females and 89% (95% CI, 87–91) for males in predicting reduced bone marrow iron. Using a ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L resulted in high specificity rates of 97% in females and 99% in males. However, sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. Other studied biomarkers had inferior AUCs. Multivariate logistic regression models did not significantly perform better in prediction than ferritin alone. With 50% preprobability for reduced iron stores, a ferritin of 30 μg/L (females) and 51 μg/L (males) had a 95% positive predictive value for reduced iron stores. A 95% negative predictive value was achieved at 1750 μg/L (females) and 4967 μg/L (males). In our large population study, ferritin was the best single biomarker for iron deficiency in secondary care. Adding other blood tests in a multivariate model did not improve performance. However, in these patients with hematologic disorders, even a high ferritin did not rule out iron deficiency with 95% certainty.

### Laboratory reference intervals in the assessment of iron status in young children [^11485xEt]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Iron deficiency is one of the most common single-nutrient deficiencies in both developing and developed countries, and peaks in prevalence in early childhood.
For the laboratory assessment of iron status in young children, laboratory reference intervals are not well established and high-quality decision limits based on clinical studies are not available.

What this study hopes to add?

This study presents age- and sex-specific reference intervals for haematological and biochemical tests commonly ordered by clinicians when assessing the iron status of children.
Clinical laboratories may consider adopting the published paediatric reference intervals and age categories, rather than using adult reference intervals.
Future research to develop high quality decision limits based on clinical studies of outcomes is a priority.

### Should serum transferrin saturation Be included as a therapeutic target in addition to serum ferritin in treating HFE-hemochromatosis? [^113Gvcb6]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

In HFE-hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation (TSAT) indirectly reflects plasma non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI), which drives iron overload and tissue damage. TSAT above ~75% suggests harmful NTBI levels. Despite its clinical relevance, NTBI remains understudied due to the limitations of current assays. High TSAT levels persist during maintenance therapy, yet some guidelines omit TSAT monitoring, though it correlates with symptoms like fatigue and joint pain. Monitoring TSAT may improve outcomes. Randomized trials comparing ferritin-only versus ferritin-plus-TSAT-guided treatment are needed. Consideration should be given to approaches that minimize plasma NTBI in managing and monitoring patients with hemochromatosis. Until reliable NTBI testing has been established, TSAT should be included in the management of HFE-hemochromatosis.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### Iron deficiency screening is a key issue in chronic inflammatory diseases: a call to action [^11189XPC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is frequent in chronic conditions

Until very recently, iron deficiency (ID) was considered only in the context of iron‐deficiency anemia. It is only in the last 10–15 years that ID has been considered as an autonomous pathological entity in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs. Therefore, early ID detection and treatment became important goals, as iron is essential for the functioning of all organs. The fact that the biological definition of ID is debated and inconsistently defined by authors in different studies has probably contributed to preventing the recognition of ID as an independent condition. An international multidisciplinary group of experts recently proposed a more comprehensive definition of ID: "Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia". This definition is important because it indicates that ID may have specific symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment, even in the absence of anemia. Furthermore, as detailed in the next section, ID is associated with poor prognosis in many diseases, thus highlighting the importance of its diagnosis.

Depending on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, two types of ID can be distinguished, with identical clinical symptoms: absolute ID, which is the consequence of a quantitative decrease in iron stores, and functional ID, which is due to the sequestration of iron in otherwise quantitatively normal or abundant stores. These two types of ID are not mutually exclusive and are often associated. Understanding their underlying mechanisms is essential for the development of rational diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.

In daily practice, the most effective biomarkers of iron status are serum ferritin, which reflects stored iron, and transferrin saturation (TSAT), which is indicative of transported iron. TSAT is always present; thus, the decrease of TSAT is an essential diagnostic criterion of absolute or functional ID. Since the reliability of serum ferritin measurement may be compromised in patients with chronic diseases or any inflammatory condition, there is a large consensus in guidelines to determine both serum ferritin and TSAT in the first line. There is still no consensus on the thresholds, but recent recommendations of international guidelines have shown agreement for defining ID by serum ferritin < 100 µg/L and/or TSAT < 20%.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

### Assessing iron status: beyond serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [^116DvtSE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of multiple comorbidities among anemic patients with chronic kidney disease has made the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation more challenging in diagnosing iron deficiency. Because serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and because the inflammatory state may inhibit the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial stores, the scenario of patients with serum ferritin > 800 ng/ml, suggesting iron overload, and transferrin saturation < 20%, suggesting iron deficiency, has become more common. This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^114G128N]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Bone marrow aspirate interpretations were categorized with a regular expression algorithm based on the bone marrow aspirate report keywords and phrases to 4 different iron storage categories (none, low, normal, and abundant) and to undefined. Cases with undefined iron storage were excluded. We verified the accuracy of the categorization algorithm by selecting 100 random aspirates from the defined categories and checked by reading the whole aspirate report if the categorization was corresponding to the report. We then calculated the proportion of correctly classified results with the binomial exact confidence intervals (CIs). In the verification, all the samples were correctly classified (95% CI, 96–100) by the algorithm. Given the lack of standardized methodology for bone marrow iron staining interpretation, we assessed the variability of the interpretations: 3 independent laboratory hematologists analyzed a random set of samples (n = 105) from 2012 to 2020 (supplemental Table 1). The observed inter-rater variability is attributable to the subjective nature of the interpretation process. There was 84% agreement between consensus and the original report. In our study, we mainly used only 2 categories, that is, reduced (none and low) and full (normal and abundant) iron stores, and there, the agreement was as high as 98%. No time-related change was observed (P = 0.81).

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^115Lkd1H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is accompanied by multiple hematological abnormalities. Iron deficiency anemia is a frequent complication of advanced liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial, mostly due to chronic hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is very challenging, as simple laboratory methods, including serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and mean corpuscular volume are affected by the liver disease itself or the cause of the disease, resulting in difficulty in the interpretation of the results. Several new parameters, such as red blood cell ferritin, serum transferrin receptor test and index, and hepcidin, have been studied for their utility in indicating true iron deficiency in combination with chronic liver disease. Once iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, it should be treated with oral or parenteral iron as well as portal pressure reducing drugs. Blood transfusion is reserved for symptomatic anemia despite iron supplementation.

Key Points

Question

How is the choice of guideline-recommended cutoffs for ferritin associated with the incidence of iron deficiency diagnoses in primary care?

Findings

In this cohort study of 255 351 adult primary care patients, ferritin cutoffs of 15, 30, and 45 ng/mL were associated with incidences of iron deficiency diagnoses of 10.9, 29.9, and 48.3 cases per 1000 patient-years, respectively.

### Screening, diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency in chronic heart failure: putting the 2016 European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines into clinical practice [^114L59rA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Practical recommendations on the screening and diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure

The current 2016 ESC HF guidelines 1 recommend that evaluation of iron status should be considered in the diagnostic work‐up of all newly diagnosed HF patients (class of recommendation I, level of evidence C). A practical recommendation of the working group is that iron status should also be evaluated in patients with existing CHF, particularly if they are symptomatic despite receiving optimal background HF medications. In addition, as part of routine follow‐up, consideration should be given to the re‐evaluation of iron status 1–2 times per year, as well as after hospitalization for HF.

Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are widely available blood markers for evaluating iron status. Their use for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is recommended by the 2016 ESC HF guidelines. 1 Ferritin is an intracellular iron‐storage protein secreted by iron‐storing tissues (e.g. liver and reticuloendothelial system). Serum ferritin concentrations are a surrogate marker of stored iron quantity. 9 TSAT (defined as % of transferrin that has iron bound to it) is used as a marker of the availability of circulating iron to supply metabolizing cells. 9 TSAT value is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron‐binding capacity (TIBC):

The 2016 ESC HF guidelines recommend treating iron deficiency based on a serum ferritin level < 100 µg/L, or 100–299 µg/L when TSAT < 20%. Two different cut‐offs are used because ferritin levels may become elevated in the presence of inflammation and may, therefore, appear to be within the normal range (100–300 µg/L). As ferritin, an acute‐phase protein, is elevated as a result of inflammation, TSAT levels < 20% indicate that insufficient circulating iron is available to supply metabolizing cells (functional iron deficiency). 9 Therefore, in accordance with the 2016 ESC HF guidelines, it is important to ensure that both ferritin and TSAT testing is performed simultaneously and evaluated together when assessing iron status (Figure 1). Lower ferritin cut‐offs (e.g. < 30 µg/L) may be used to confirm the presence of iron deficiency in other disease settings and are often displayed on laboratory test results as the lower limit of normal. However, the thresholds defined above are recommended to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with CHF.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^111nbrx1]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

One-fourth of the world's population is currently having anemia. Anemia is defined by the World Health Organization as hemoglobin concentration < 130 g/L for males, 120 g/L for nonpregnant females, and 110 g/L for pregnant females. The most common cause of anemia is iron deficiency, which contributes to approximately half of the cases in females worldwide and more than half of the cases in high-income regions. Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In addition, reliable detection of iron deficiency is clinically important because it may indicate other diseases such as gastrointestinal cancer.

Given that iron is stored in the bone marrow, bone marrow aspiration has been considered the gold standard for diagnosing iron deficiency, but it is invasive and costly. More commonly, surrogate plasma or serum biomarkers are used to assess anemia and iron stores: ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hemoglobin and erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV). These biomarkers have high diagnostic accuracy value in healthy adult population in diagnosing IDA. However, interpretation of these laboratory tests is not always straightforward, with multiple confounding factors, including patient-specific, preanalytical, and analytical laboratory assay considerations. For example, inflammation can increase ferritin concentrations and decrease TSAT, and erythropoietic activity affects sTfR levels. Cutoffs are dependent on the reference population and laboratory methods, and consensus on their use in patients with comorbidities (eg, inflammation or cancer) is lacking.

Of these laboratory tests, ferritin has been compared most with bone marrow iron stores in published studies. However, although a recent systematic reviewincluded 6059 patients with ferritin and bone marrow iron data, the diagnostic efficacy of the commonly used decision-making cutoff of 30 μg/Lwas studied in only 512 participants. Other studied cutoffs were heterogenous, ranging from 12 to 200 μg/L. Although ferritin has demonstrated satisfactory specificity in most cutoffs, its sensitivity has been inadequate. Consequently, patients with iron deficiency may present with elevated ferritin levels.

We aimed to assess the agreement of iron biomarkers ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, and MCV with the gold standard bone marrow Prussian blue stain on iron stores in a large real-life population of patients with hematologic disorders. Furthermore, we aimed to determine predictive values for single biomarkers and multivariate models for iron deficiency prediction and to illustrate them.

Hemochromatosis — initial diagnostic markers and transferrin saturation (TS) thresholds are outlined: the initial approach to diagnosis is by indirect markers of iron stores, namely TS or unsaturated iron-binding capacity and serum ferritin, and a recent study using fasting samples showed no improvement in sensitivity or specificity in the detection of C282Y homozygotes; accordingly, this prior recommendation is no longer absolutely necessary, although it is advisable to confirm an elevated TS with a second determination and it is not unreasonable in our opinion to do this on a fasting specimen. Although a cutoff TS value of 45% is often chosen for its high sensitivity for detecting C282Y homozygotes, it has a lower specificity and positive predictive value compared to higher cutoff values, and using a cutoff TS of 45% will also identify persons with minor secondary iron overload as well as some C282Y/wild-type heterozygotes, requiring further evaluation.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^112XZNNU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We also assessed requests for additional iron studies accompanying ferritin testing (within ± 1 week), considering iron studies often mentioned in international and local clinical guidelines for iron deficiency,: serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. To further examine concomitant testing, we considered all patients of the study cohort who received ferritin testing during the study period and considered the presence of hemoglobin and CRP accompanying the first ferritin test recorded during the study period as 2 distinct binary outcomes. We fitted mixed-effects logistic regression models using the R package lme4to assess the associations of each outcome with the same determinants and random effects as for ferritin. Associations are expressed as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with corresponding 95% CIs.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Mutations causing hemochromatosis: variable phenotypic expression in a pair of twins [^113K2mEF]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

PPI are known to limit iron absorption, thus it is possible that twin B absorbed less iron than what would be expected based on the hemochromatosis mutations. However, the patient stopped taking PPI for the last 2 months and the iron studies have not changed appreciably (serum iron 233 vs. 250 mcg/dL, TIBC < 255 vs. < 272 mcg/dL and ferritin 129 vs. 170 ng/mL). Longer observation is needed to make a more meaningful conclusion regarding any effect of PPI on iron parameters since she been taking them for the last 8 years.

We describe for the first time a severe case of juvenile hemochromatosis presenting with classical clinical features in contrast to her twin sister with the same mutations in the HJV gene with no signs of iron overload. In addition to the recognized hemochromatosis genes, other genetic and nutritional factors may modulate the severity of iron overload in hemochromatosis.

### Serum ferritin as an indicator of iron status: what do we need to know? [^111C8V5M]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Determination of iron status in pregnancy and in young children is essential for both clinical and public health practice. Clinical diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through sampling of bone marrow to identify the absence of body iron stores is impractical in most cases. Serum ferritin (SF) concentrations are the most commonly deployed indicator for determining ID, and low SF concentrations reflect a state of iron depletion. However, there is considerable variation in SF cutoffs recommended by different expert groups to diagnose ID. Moreover, the cutoffs used in different clinical laboratories are heterogeneous. There are few studies of diagnostic test accuracy to establish the sensitivity and specificity of SF compared with key gold standards (such as absent bone marrow iron stores, increased intestinal iron absorption, and hemoglobin response to SF) among noninflamed, outpatient populations. The limited data available suggest the commonly recommended SF cutoff of < 15 μg/L is a specific but not sensitive cutoff, although evidence is limited. Data from women during pregnancy or from young children are especially uncommon. Most data are from studies conducted > 30 y ago, do not reflect ethnic or geographic diversity, and were performed in an era for which laboratory methods no longer reflect present practice. Future studies to define the appropriate SF cutoffs are urgently needed and would also provide an opportunity to compare this indicator with other established and emerging iron indexes. In addition, future work would benefit from a focus on elucidating cutoffs and indexes relevant to iron adequacy.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^113P921N]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 255 351 patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [36–66] years; 52.1% female and 47.9% male). Figure 1 summarizes the cohort selection process, and Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. The cohort patients were seen by 262 general practitioners with a median (IQR) age of 48 (40–57) years and a median (IQR) workload of 139 (86–230) consultations per working week in 80 practices. During the study period, 72 817 patients (28.5%) received ferritin testing. Of the first ferritin tests during the study period, 7036 (9.7%) were accompanied by iron studies, most commonly serum iron in 6095 (8.4%), transferrin in 5820 (8.0%), and transferrin saturation in 3856 (5.3%). Accompanying hemoglobin and CRP tests were present in 52 499 (72.1%) and 36 136 (49.6%) cases, respectively.

### Reflective testing: how useful is the practice of adding on tests by laboratory clinicians? [^1176UUnP]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the clinical value and practice of reflective testing, a new term to describe the practice of adding on tests when reporting or clinically authorising results.

Methods

A consultant medical biochemist collected over a calendar year (2001) copies of clinical biochemistry reports on samples to which he had added on either iron studies (iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and percentage saturation), or vitamin D. Iron studies and vitamin D were added on when biochemical results, available clinical information, demographic data, and clinical experience-or combinations thereof-suggested the possibility of haemochromatosis or vitamin D deficiency, respectively. The number of reports that the consultant authorised was estimated for the same calendar year. The number and percentage of raised TIBC percentage saturation and low vitamin D results from the tests that were added on were collated.

Results

Raised TIBC saturation values were found in 28 patients (18.7% of the iron studies added on), of whom 16 were subsequently genotyped, eight having a genotype consistent with haemochromatosis. Thirty one patients with vitamin D deficiency (23.1% of the vitamin D tests added on) were identified.

Conclusions

The addition of iron studies and vitamin D tests by a laboratory clinician, when reporting, resulted in the identification of patients with haemochromatosis and vitamin D deficiency. The practice of adding on tests should be called reflective testing, because it is discretionary and is based on the clinical judgement of a laboratory clinician in the interpretation of results.

### Guideline for the laboratory diagnosis of functional iron deficiency [^112KFCtq]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation for functional iron deficiency, BCSH 2013 guidelines recommend to do not measure the percentage saturation of transferrin in isolation to predict responsiveness to IV iron therapy in patients with CKD. Consider assessing the percentage saturation of transferrin to monitor response to ESAs and/or iron therapy in patients with CKD. Consider measuring the percentage saturation of transferrin in combination with either the serum ferritin concentration or measurements such as the percentage of hypochromic red cells and reticulocyte hemoglobin content for the diagnosis of functional iron deficiency.
