## Question

Should I treat UTI in elderly male with a catheter when the culture is less than 100,000

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an elderly male with an indwelling urinary catheter and a urine culture showing less than 100,000 CFU/mL should be treated for a urinary tract infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct diagnostic thresholds for bacteriuria in catheterized patients. Then, I should verify whether the patient has symptoms or signs of catheter-associated UTI versus asymptomatic bacteriuria. Next, I will review guideline recommendations on when to treat and when to avoid treatment. After that, I need to consider special situations like catheter removal and urologic procedures. Finally, I will outline practical next steps, including specimen handling and stewardship considerations, before concluding with a clear recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic thresholds, because I need to ensure I'm applying the right cutoffs for catheterized specimens. In patients with indwelling catheters, bacteriuria is common and the appropriate diagnostic threshold for bladder bacteriuria is ≥ 10³ CFU/mL, not the ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL used for clean-catch specimens in noncatheterized patients, so a count of less than 100,000 CFU/mL can still represent true bacteriuria in this context, although its clinical significance depends on symptoms and timing of collection [^1172Rvx7].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context next, because treatment hinges on whether this is asymptomatic bacteriuria or true catheter-associated UTI. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is exceedingly common in catheterized patients, with acquisition rates of about 3–7% per catheter-day and near-universal bacteriuria by one month; importantly, pyuria alone is not diagnostic of infection in this setting, and the presence of cloudy or malodorous urine should not trigger treatment without compatible localizing symptoms or systemic signs [^111ATHLW] [^115cj212] [^1142cwV4].

> I should confirm the diagnostic criteria for catheter-associated UTI, and I need to check that I'm not overcalling a colonization as infection. IDSA defines CAUTI by compatible symptoms or signs, no other identifiable source, and bacteriuria at ≥ 10³ CFU/mL; absence of pyuria should prompt me to consider alternative diagnoses, and treatment based solely on a positive culture without supportive clinical findings is inappropriate in most scenarios [^1148Lemh] [^116Uzbcv].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and hold on, I should verify whether any exceptions apply here. Both the 2019 IDSA ASB guideline and contemporary stewardship guidance recommend against screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with short-term or long-term indwelling catheters, citing no proven benefit and meaningful harms including C. difficile, resistance selection, and adverse drug events; this applies regardless of colony count as long as diagnostic criteria for CAUTI are not met [^112pqo7o] [^113j8aEa] [^111gDBjm].

> Let me consider the special case of catheter removal, because I should double-check whether prophylaxis changes management. There is a knowledge gap and no firm recommendation to screen for or treat ASB at the time of catheter removal; a meta-analysis suggested prophylaxis at removal may reduce subsequent symptomatic UTI in surgical cohorts, but data are heterogeneous and not specific to treating documented ASB, so routine screening or treatment solely for ASB at removal is not advised by IDSA [^112pqo7o] [^113QNgjh] [^111qGc6S].

> I will now examine exceptions where treatment of bacteriuria is warranted, and I need to ensure I'm not missing one. The main exceptions are pregnancy and patients undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures with mucosal trauma, for whom pre-procedural screening and targeted short-course prophylaxis are recommended; neither scenario applies to an elderly male with a catheter and no procedure planned [^113GFY7m] [^11666rwx].

> Next, I should review specimen handling, because misinterpretation can occur if the sample is contaminated or mis-collected. For suspected CAUTI, if culture is pursued, the specimen should be obtained from the sampling port after disinfecting the port, or the catheter should be replaced and culture obtained from the newly placed device; bag urine or catheter tip cultures are not appropriate for diagnosis, and delays in processing can artifactually increase colony counts, leading to overtreatment if interpreted out of context [^114o8KKF] [^116gHYk5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should synthesize the clinical picture before deciding. In an elderly male with an indwelling catheter and a urine culture less than 100,000 CFU/mL, this result does not by itself establish UTI; if there are no compatible localizing symptoms or systemic signs attributable to UTI, this is asymptomatic bacteriuria and should not be treated, given the lack of benefit and potential harms; conversely, if there are clear localizing symptoms such as new dysuria, suprapubic pain, flank pain, rigors, or fever without another source, then I should treat as CAUTI using culture-guided therapy and catheter management, recognizing that the diagnostic threshold is ≥ 10³ CFU/mL in this population [^112pqo7o] [^1172Rvx7].

> Let me reconsider the specific colony count one more time to avoid overinterpreting it. A count below 100,000 CFU/mL from a catheterized specimen can still represent true bacteriuria, but in the absence of symptoms or systemic signs it remains asymptomatic bacteriuria; treatment should be withheld while focusing on catheter stewardship, evaluation for alternative causes of symptoms, and observation if nonlocalizing features such as delirium or falls are present in older adults [^1172Rvx7] [^117VPowJ].

> Finally, I should outline concrete next steps, and I need to ensure they align with best practices. Do not start antibiotics based on this culture alone; reassess for UTI symptoms and signs, consider removing or replacing the catheter if it has been in place long-term and obtain a new culture if infection is suspected, avoid sending routine urine cultures without an appropriate indication, and document the rationale for any decision to treat or not treat; if treatment is ultimately indicated for true CAUTI, tailor antibiotics to culture results and follow guideline-concordant durations while minimizing unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure [^112pqo7o] [^116gHYk5] [^116aGNZ8].

Do not treat a UTI in an elderly male with a catheter when the culture is **< 100,000 CFU/mL** unless there are clear localizing symptoms (dysuria, suprapubic pain, costovertebral angle tenderness) or systemic signs (fever, chills, confusion) without another source [^116aGNZ8]. Low-count bacteriuria in catheterized patients is common and often reflects colonization or contamination [^115cj212], not true infection [^111ATHLW]. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria increases harm from antibiotics without benefit [^115K3ua3] [^111gDBjm]. If symptoms are present, obtain a urine culture from a freshly replaced catheter and treat only if the culture meets the ≥ 10³ CFU/mL threshold for a single organism with supportive clinical findings [^1172Rvx7] [^116gHYk5].

---

## Diagnostic thresholds for bacteriuria in catheterized patients

In catheterized patients, the diagnostic threshold for significant bacteriuria is **lower than in non-catheterized patients** due to the high prevalence of colonization and contamination [^1172Rvx7]. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) provide the following guidance:

- **IDSA guidelines**: For catheterized patients, significant bacteriuria is defined as ≥ 10³ CFU/mL of a single organism, with pyuria supporting the diagnosis of a true infection [^1172Rvx7].

- **ASM guidelines**: Urine cultures from indwelling catheters should ideally be obtained from a freshly inserted device (< 48 hours) to minimize contamination and biofilm-related artifacts [^114o8KKF].

Therefore, a culture with **< 100,000 CFU/mL** in a catheterized patient does not meet the diagnostic threshold for a UTI unless accompanied by clinical symptoms and signs [^1148Lemh].

---

## Clinical significance of low-count bacteriuria in elderly catheterized males

Low-count bacteriuria in elderly catheterized males is common and often represents **colonization or contamination** rather than true infection. Factors contributing to this include:

- **Biofilm formation**: Indwelling catheters rapidly develop biofilms, making bacterial eradication difficult and often unnecessary in the absence of symptoms [^111ATHLW].

- **High prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria**: Elderly catheterized males frequently have asymptomatic bacteriuria, which should not be treated with antibiotics [^112pqo7o].

- **Contamination**: Improper collection techniques or delayed processing can result in low-count bacteriuria that does not reflect true infection [^113665eK].

---

## Risks associated with treating low-count bacteriuria

Treating low-count bacteriuria in elderly catheterized males carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Unnecessary antibiotic use promotes the development of multidrug-resistant organisms, complicating future infections [^114NonCc].

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Elderly patients are at increased risk of adverse drug reactions, including Clostridioides difficile infection, renal impairment, and allergic reactions [^notfound].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Unnecessary antibiotic treatment increases healthcare expenditures without providing clinical benefit [^111J6Dw2].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines consistently **recommend against treating low-count bacteriuria** in elderly catheterized males unless there are clear clinical indications. The IDSA 2019 guidelines state that in patients with short-term or long-term indwelling urethral catheters, routine screening for or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not recommended (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) [^112pqo7o]. Similarly, the CDC emphasizes urine culture stewardship, advising against routine urine cultures in asymptomatic catheterized patients [^111ATHLW].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting treatment despite low-count bacteriuria

Although low-count bacteriuria is generally not treated, certain clinical scenarios **may warrant antibiotic therapy**:

- **Symptomatic presentation**: Clear localizing symptoms (dysuria, suprapubic pain, costovertebral angle tenderness) or systemic signs (fever, chills, confusion) without another identifiable source [^116Tc7LP].

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Patients with significant immunosuppression may require a lower threshold for treatment due to increased infection risk.

- **Urologic procedures**: Patients undergoing urologic procedures that breach the urothelium may require treatment of bacteriuria to prevent complications [^1137PKjR].

In these scenarios, treatment should be guided by clinical judgment, patient-specific factors, and culture results obtained from a freshly inserted catheter [^116gHYk5].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

To accurately diagnose UTI in elderly catheterized males, the following diagnostic approach is recommended:

- **Clinical assessment**: Thoroughly assess for localizing symptoms and systemic signs of infection [^116aGNZ8].

- **Urine culture**: Obtain urine cultures from a freshly inserted catheter (< 48 hours) or from the sampling port of an existing catheter after thorough disinfection [^114o8KKF].

- **Interpretation**: Interpret culture results in conjunction with clinical findings, recognizing that low-count bacteriuria alone is insufficient for diagnosis [^114vh2Xz].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

In summary, a urine culture with **< 100,000 CFU/mL** in an elderly male with a catheter should not be treated as a UTI unless there are clear clinical indications. Treating low-count bacteriuria in this population is generally inappropriate, as it often reflects colonization or contamination rather than true infection. Clinicians should adhere to current guidelines, prioritize clinical assessment, and reserve antibiotic treatment for symptomatic patients or specific clinical scenarios.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10³ CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10² to < 10⁵ CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

Published literature indicates that the unjustified ordering or improper collection of urine for urinalysis or culture from either catheterized patients or those without indwelling devices, or misinterpretation of positive results, often leads to adverse health care events, including increased financial burdens, overreporting of mandated catheter-associated urinary tract infection events, overtreatment of patients with antimicrobial agents, selection of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Moreover, national guidelines that provide evidence-based direction on core processes that form the basis for subsequent clinical therapy decisions or surveillance interpretations; that is, the appropriate ordering and collection of urine for laboratory testing and the treatment of patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection, are not widely known or lack adherence. This article provides published evidence on the influence of inappropriate ordering of urine specimens and subsequent treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and associated adverse effects; reviews research on bacterial contamination and preservation; and delineates best practices in the collection, handling, and testing of urine specimens for culture or for biochemical analysis in both catheterized and noncatheterized patients. The goal is to provide infection preventionists (IPs) with a cohesive evidence-based framework that will assist them in facilitating the implementation of a urine culture management program that reduces patient harms, enhances the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infection surveillance, improves antibiotic stewardship, and reduces costs.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10⁸ CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

Conclusion

Continuous educational measures, performance feedback, and increased availability of specialist equipment are useful tools for improving the management of UTIs in the elderly. Small improvements in adherence to guidelines for UTI diagnosis were demonstrated. Additionally, it was shown that these measures could increase the number of urine cultures sent for both continent and incontinent patients, decrease the length of time from diagnosis of UTI to urine collection for culture, and increase the frequency with which appropriate antibiotics are used based on urine culture results. However, the relevance of the latter outcomes rests on the correct initial diagnosis of UTI. Larger studies are needed and should investigate whether these educational measures decrease hospital stay and mortality.

Problem

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly in both the primary and secondary care settings. Despite being common, the inpatient management of UTIs has been suboptimal. Clinicians are often overtreating elderly patients on the basis of non-specific symptoms. In most cases, there are insufficient recorded enquiries of lower urinary tract symptoms. Urine samples are also poorly collected for cultures and sensitivities. Therefore, many patients may be treated with antimicrobials to which the causative organism is resistant.

This project aimed to look into potential strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. These include increasing adherence to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines on the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial therapy.

Results

Results from the final cycle of the audit were analysed and compared to the baseline results obtained initially. Nineteen patients were diagnosed with UTI in the final cycle. In comparison to the baseline results, there was an increase in the percentage of these patients (421%) being correctly diagnosed with UTI, by fulfilling the SIGN criteria. There were also improvements in other aspects of UTI management after implementing the strategies: 89.5% had urine sent for cultures, 71.4% of incontinent patients had urine collected for cultures, and 86.7% of patients with a positive urine culture were treated with appropriate antibiotics after sensitivities became available. In addition, the mean time from UTI diagnosis to urine collection for cultures and sensitivities improved to zero days.

Indwelling urinary catheter — management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in long-term care: Benefit of antimicrobial therapy for ASB while a catheter remains in situ is stated as uncertain and there is high-quality evidence of harm with increased antimicrobial resistance, so screening with urine cultures in catheterized patients or obtaining urine cultures for nonspecific symptoms should be discouraged. A prospective cohort study of prophylaxis to prevent ASB and urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with long-term indwelling catheters reported no benefits, and a randomized bundle intervention was associated with a substantial decrease in screening and treatment for ASB in long-term care patients without an increase in symptomatic UTI.

### Impact of laboratory-reported urine culture colony counts on the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract infection for hospitalized patients [^116A5Pq6]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Reducing health care-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a National Patient Safety Goal. The purpose of this investigation was to establish a colony count threshold to predict clinically significant UTIs that develop in hospitalized patients. A total of 185 cases were reviewed sequentially by 2 physicians. The information extracted included subjective complaints, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, clinical signs and symptoms, WBC count, urinalysis, and urine culture results. The first reviewer recorded whether the patient was diagnosed and treated for a UTI by the clinician. The second reviewer determined if the patient met National Healthcare Safety Network guidelines for nosocomial UTI. Compared with patients with colony counts less than 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), patients with colony counts 100,000 CFU/mL or more were 73.86 times more likely to have a clinically significant UTI (odds ratio, 73.86; 95% confidence interval, 24.23 ∼ 225.15; P < .0001; c-statistic, 0.859). Reporting positive results only for patients with 100,000 CFU/mL or more would have reduced the number of positive cultures by 38%. These data suggest that reporting colony counts less than 100,000 CFU/mL encourages treatment of non-clinically significant UTIs in hospitalized patients, causing inappropriate antibiotic use.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a commonly diagnosed infection in older adults. Despite consensus guidelines developed to assist providers in diagnosing UTI, distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older adults is problematic, as many older adults do not present with localized genitourinary symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cj212]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Catheter-associated bacteriuria — evidence with short-term indwelling catheters: Biofilm formation along the indwelling catheter means all patients ultimately develop bacteriuria if the catheter remains in situ, with acquisition of bacteriuria 3%–5% per catheter day; antimicrobial therapy may delay but not prevent onset. Many individuals with short-term catheters (in place for < 30 days) do not develop bacteriuria because the catheter is removed prior to acquisition. In newly catheterized patients, 235 of 1497 (14.9%) developed bacteriuria (defined as ≥ 10^2 CFU/mL) at a mean of 6.4 ± 6.1 days; only 194 (7.7%) reported subjective symptoms and only 1 episode of bacteremia was considered probably attributable to bacteriuria. In a prospective randomized trial comparing silver coated with uncoated silicone catheters, 3036 patients with catheters in situ for ≥ 48 hours were enrolled; there were 334 (11%) UTIs, 16 with bacteremia (0.5% of catheters; 4.8% of bacteriuric patients). In a retrospective cohort of 444 episodes in 308 patients, 128 (41.6%) had catheter-associated UTI and 180 (58.4%) had ASB; only 3 episodes of bacteremia (0.7% of bacteriuric subjects) were directly attributable to bacteriuria, and > 90% of patients received antimicrobials within 30 days of the urine culture.

### Inappropriate treatment of catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria in a tertiary care hospital [^111xqmsL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based guidelines state that asymptomatic bacteriuria is not a clinically significant condition in men and nonpregnant women and that treatment is unlikely to confer clinical benefit. We hypothesized that, among patients with indwelling catheters or condom collection systems, many who receive a diagnosis of and are treated for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) actually have asymptomatic bacteriuria and, therefore, that antibiotic therapy is inappropriate.

Methods

We reviewed all urine culture results at a veterans affairs medical center during a 3-month period. Cultures yielding 10⁴ colony-forming units/mL were included if the urine had been collected from a hospitalized patient with an indwelling (Foley) catheter or a condom collection system. We applied standardized definitions to determine whether the episode represented catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CAABU) or CAUTI. Antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate for patients who met criteria for symptomatic UTI.

Results

Overall, 280 episodes met criteria for inclusion: 164 CAABU and 116 CAUTI. Of the 164 episodes of CAABU, 111 (68%) were managed appropriately (no treatment), whereas 53 (32%) were treated with antibiotics (inappropriate treatment). In multivariate analysis, older patient age, having predominantly gram-negative bacteriuria, and higher urine white blood cell count were significantly associated with inappropriate treatment of CAABU (P < .05, by logistic regression).

Conclusions

Better recognition of CAABU and the distinction between this condition and CAUTI, consistent with evidence-based guidelines, may play a key role in reducing unneeded antibiotic usage in hospitalized patients.

Bacteriuria at catheter removal — evidence and rationale: one randomized controlled trial (RCT) in women reported 7 of 41 (17%) randomized to no treatment developed symptomatic UTI within 14 days, while 15 (36%) had spontaneous clearance of bacteriuria, with enrollment limited to those with a negative urine culture at insertion, no antimicrobial therapy while the catheter remained in situ, and bacteriuria at removal persisting 48 hours; a meta-analysis including 6 studies (5 surgical) initiated antimicrobials upon catheter removal irrespective of ASB and found benefit on subsequent UTI over 1 to 6 weeks with RD, –65/1000 [95% CI, –96 to –33], though studies were heterogeneous with high risk of selection and attrition bias; the rationale states, "We make a strong recommendation because there is very low certainty of any benefit and high-quality evidence of harm", and that there are no studies generalizable to current practice addressing screening for or treating ASB at catheter removal.

### Managing external urinary catheters [^116eAx2V]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This narrative review explores the use of external urinary catheters. These devices are available in various types and materials for male and female patients. The indications for the use of external urinary catheters include managing incontinence linked to overactive bladder and neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Contraindications to the use of external urinary catheters include urinary obstruction. Proper skin care and proactive infection control measures are necessary to prevent complications. The collection of a urine specimen for culture requires a standardized technique to prevent contamination. Clinician-led patient education on catheter management plays a important role in ensuring patient comfort and safety.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

Indwelling urethral catheters and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — For short-term indwelling urethral catheters (< 30 days), we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence), with similar considerations for indwelling suprapubic catheters. For patients with indwelling catheters at the time of catheter removal, there is a knowledge gap; remarks state that antimicrobial prophylaxis given at removal may confer a benefit for prevention of symptomatic UTI for some patients and that it is unclear whether or not the benefit is greater in patients with ASB. For long-term indwelling catheters, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113GFY7m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months — To establish the diagnosis, clinicians should require both urinalysis results that suggest infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of at least 50 000 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL of a uropathogen cultured from a urine specimen obtained through catheterization or SPA (evidence quality: C; recommendation).

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^114HmEsm]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

KAS 1 Clinicians Should Obtain Urine Specimen by Catheterization or SPA — clinicians should obtain a urine specimen by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration (SPA) for urinalysis and, if the urinalysis result is positive, for culture; this is a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Quality A. For 1000 infants, approximately 94 to 98 infants with urinary tract infections will be detected by a positive urinalysis result, and 2 to 6 may be missed; if the urinalysis result is negative, an estimated 200 to 500 catheterizations or SPAs followed by cultures would be required to detect 1 additional infant with bacteriuria. The American Academy of Pediatrics guideline basis used pyuria and at least 50 000 colony-forming units (cfu) per mL in appropriately collected urine, whereas 10 000 colony-forming units/mL is now an acceptable threshold for diagnosing urinary tract infection from catheterized urine specimens when pyuria and fever are also present, and this addresses laboratories not reporting graduations from 10 000 to 100 000. Culture of urine specimens not collected by catheterization or SPA is not recommended because of an unacceptable rate of false-positive results attributable to contamination, and positive urine culture results without an abnormal urinalysis indicating inflammation are likely to represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or contamination; SPA is effective and complications are rare.

Education and training

Educate HCP involved in the insertion, care, and maintenance of urinary catheters about CAUTI prevention, including alternatives to indwelling catheters, and procedures for catheter insertion, management, and removal.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Assess healthcare professional competency in catheter use, catheter care, and maintenance. – (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Educate HCP about the importance of urine culture stewardship and provide indications for urine cultures. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Consider requiring clinicians to identify an appropriate indication for urine culturing when placing an order for a urine culture. The indication should be supported by the literature,– and should be appropriate for the specific patient population. Include guideline-based remindersfor the specific circumstances. Below is a simple example of appropriate and inappropriate reasons to culture urine are referenced online on the CDC website, though several other lists are available in the literature specific to particular clinical settings (eg, ICU, emergency department, nursing home, and catheterized versus non-catheterized patients): Appropriate uses of urine culture include the following: Presence of symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI): Flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness Acute hematuria New pelvic discomfort New onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing In spinal-cord-injury patients and other highly complex patients (eg, patients with > 40% total body burn, recipients of kidney transplants with graft failure) symptoms may include increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, and/or sense of unease. Inappropriate uses of urine cultures include the following: Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs and symptoms Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications (absence of pyuria suggests diagnosis other than CAUTI) Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve.
Provide training on appropriate collection of urine. Specimens should be collected and should arrive at the microbiology laboratory as soon as possible, preferably within an hour. If delay in transport to the laboratory is expected, samples should be refrigerated (no more than 24 hours) or collected in preservative urine transport tubes. (Quality of evidence: LOW)

Colony counts lower than 50 000 cfu/mL are currently being considered for the diagnosis of UTI if 10 000 cfu/ml is coupled with symptoms (eg, fever) and evidence of inflammation (pyuria), and significant pyuria is ≥ 10 white blood cells/mm3 on an "enhanced urinalysis" or ≥ 5 white blood cells per high power field on a centrifuged specimen of urine or any leukocyte esterase on a dipstick.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent publications concerning the management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), including the issues of diagnosis and prevention. Articles reviewed include the various guidelines concerning CAUTI released recently by multiple organizations.

Recent Findings

There has been a recent upsurge of interest in prevention of CAUTI and a proliferation of guidelines in this area. Social changes in US government reimbursement to hospitals and public reporting of hospital-acquired infections may underlie this interest. The awareness that CAUTI and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria are distinct conditions is increasing, but unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria remains quite prevalent. The focus in recent CAUTI literature is on prevention, often through strategies to minimize urinary catheter use. Very little new evidence is available to guide diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Summary

Interpretation of many studies of CAUTI is impeded by the failure to distinguish between symptomatic CAUTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study outcomes. This distinction currently relies on clinical symptoms and is not easily made, even with the help of various guidelines. Many aspects of the management of CAUTI merit further study, and the current interest in CAUTI is likely to lead to exciting advances in this field.

### Urinary tract infections in long-term-care facilities [^1143GLrH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection occurring in residents of long-term-care facilities. It is a frequent reason for antimicrobial administration, but antimicrobial use for treating UTIs is often inappropriate. Achieving optimal management of UTI in this population is problematic because of the very high prevalence of bacteriuria, evidence that the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not beneficial, and the clinical and microbiological imprecision in diagnosing symptomatic UTI. This position paper has been developed, using available evidence, to assist facilities and healthcare professionals in managing this common problem.

METHODS

Study Design and Participants

RECAPTURE 1 and 2 comprised 2 identical phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trials designed incorporating FDA and EMA guidance. All patients (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent. The studies were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols (available at:) were approved by study sites' independent ethics committees and/or institutional review boards.

Thelists full inclusion/exclusion criteria. In brief, eligible patients were aged 18–90 years, and had cUTI or acute pyelonephritis considered by the investigator to be serious and requiring hospitalization for intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis was based on positive urine cultures obtained within 48 hours of enrollment showing 1–2 gram-negative uropathogens at ≥ 10⁵ colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and pyuria. Complicated UTI without pyelonephritis was defined as presence of ≥ 2 symptoms, including ≥ 1 UTI-specific symptom (dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days) as well as ≥ 1 complicating factor. Acute pyelonephritis was indicated by flank pain with onset/worsening within the previous 7 days, and/or costovertebral angle tenderness, with fever and/or nausea/vomiting. Patients could be enrolled before cultures were available, providing that positive results were expected, the study drugs were considered appropriate empiric therapy, and a urine Gram stain showed gram-negative bacilli and no gram-positive bacteria. Indwelling bladder catheters in place for > 24 hours had to be removed or replaced (unless considered unsafe or contraindicated) before the baseline urine collection. Standardized catheter management guidelines were followed.

Key exclusion criteria included complete obstruction of any portion of the urinary tract, perinephric or intrarenal abscess, or prostatitis; UTI symptoms potentially attributable to another process; urinary diversion or vesicoureteral reflux; creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≤ 30 mL/minute (including patients on dialysis).

Indwelling urethral catheters — screening or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB): In patients with a short-term indwelling urethral catheter (< 30 days), we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Remarks state that considerations are likely to be similar for patients with indwelling suprapubic catheters, and it is reasonable to manage these patients similar to patients with indwelling urethral catheters, for both short-term and long-term suprapubic catheterization. In patients with indwelling catheters, we make no recommendation for or against screening for and treating ASB at the time of catheter removal (knowledge gap); remarks note antimicrobial prophylaxis given at the time of catheter removal may confer a benefit for prevention of symptomatic UTI for some patients, that evidence largely comes from studies enrolling surgical patients who receive prophylactic antimicrobials at the time of short-term catheter removal generally without screening to determine if ASB is present, and that it is unclear whether or not the benefit is greater in patients with ASB. In patients with long-term indwelling catheters, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^111qGc6S]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary catheterization is common in patients in hospital, particularly for surgical patients in the perioperative period when physiological mechanisms of bladder emptying are suspended. Catheterization of the urinary tract, however, is associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infection, the risk being associated with the duration of catheterization. National guidelines recommend removal of urinary catheters once they are no longer needed, and surgical experts advocate discontinuation of catheterization as early as 24–48 hours postoperatively. Bacteriuria in a patient with a catheter, however, can persist after the catheter is removed and can develop into a symptomatic urinary tract infection. Manipulation of the catheter itself during removal might also predispose to infection. Current definitions' from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reflect this by identifying infections up to 48 hours after catheter removal as catheter associated.

Whether administration of prophylactic antibiotics when the catheter is removed will prevent subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection is unclear. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results, and there has been no meta-analysis. Also, there is considerable heterogeneity in the management of antimicrobial prophylaxis around removal of a urinary catheter. The 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infection determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend widespread antibiotic prophylaxis after catheterization. In contrast, in their 2008 best practice policy statement the American Urological Association (AUA) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for patients with bacteriuria at time of catheter removal, particularly for those with certain risk factors (such as advanced age, immunodeficiency, or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract).

We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials to clarify whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of urinary catheter removal confers a benefit in terms of preventing subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infections.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^111pQQ63]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections affecting the elderly. However, UTI is overdiagnosed and overtreated in this group. This project aimed to look into strategies for improving the management of UTI in elderly medical inpatients. A retrospective audit was performed on the case notes of medical inpatients in a district general hospital from December 2012 to April 2013. The target measures for improvement include increasing adherence to SIGN guidelines in the diagnosis of UTI, increasing the frequency and timeliness of urinary culture collection in suspected UTI, and increasing use of urine culture sensitivities to tailor antimicrobial treatments.

Initial baseline measurement revealed 16 patients treated for UTI. 31.3% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for UTI. 68.5% had urine cultures performed. 60% of patients with positive urine cultures had correct antibiotic therapy after sensitivity results. The mean time from the diagnosis of UTI to urine collection for culture was 4 days.

Three further cycles were performed. Following each cycle, improvement measures were implemented to raise the awareness of medical staff about the management of UTI in the elderly. These comprised presentations to junior doctors at local teaching sessions; emails to ward managers with results of the previous audit cycle broken down by ward; and prominent display of guidelines on medical wards and ensuring availability of 'Newcastle pads' for taking sterile urine cultures from incontinent patients.

In the final cycle, 19 patients were diagnosed with UTI. 42.1% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for diagnosis of UTI. 89.5% had urine cultures sent. 86.7% of patients with a positive urine culture were treated with appropriate antibiotics after sensitivities became available. Mean time from UTI diagnosis to culture collection improved to zero days.

In conclusion, continuous educational measures, performance feedback, and increased availability of specialist equipment are imperative for improving management of UTIs in the elderly.

Section 2: Background on definitions of CAUTI

The clinical diagnosis of CAUTI is often a diagnosis of exclusion, making it difficult to have a standardized definition. At present, all of the available definitions have substantial limitations. We discuss the criteria, advantages, and limitations of different definitions used for CAUTI in Table 4.

The optimal definition for CAUTI used for surveillance and quality improvement is one that only captures true instances of symptomatic infection that would benefit from antimicrobial treatment. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been adopted nationally, but other definitions are also used for clinical care and administrative purposes. The NHSN CAUTI definition has been updated in 2015 with exclusion of yeast as a pathogen and increase in the urine-culture bacterial threshold to ≥ 10 5 colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) to align with a clinical definition for symptomatic CAUTI.

Baseline Measurement

Assessment of UTI management in a district hospital setting (Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wrightington, Wigan) was achieved retrospectively from 160 case notes of medical inpatients aged 65–95 years, using a proforma recording demographics, date of UTI diagnosis, date of urine sample taken for culture, presenting symptoms and signs, incontinence, type and route of antibiotics used, results of urine culture and sensitivities, and actions taken after culture results were available. Patients under the age of 65 or diagnosed with neutropenic sepsis were excluded from the data. Sixteen patients were treated for UTI: 31.3% of these fulfilled SIGN criteria for UTI; and 68.5% had urine cultures performed (40% of incontinent patients). The mean time from the diagnosis of UTI to urine collection for culture was 4 days. Sixty per cent of patients with positive cultures had correct antibiotic therapy based on sensitivity results.

### Characteristics of febrile urinary tract infections in older male adults [^115ebAQ7]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Regarding directed antimicrobial therapy, as prostatic involvement in males with FUTI is common, FQ have been considered the first therapeutic choice due to their high degree of prostatic penetration. The use of FQ is limited due to high resistant rates and the risk of severe adverse events related to its use, including aortic aneurysms. Co-trimoxazol is an alternative but again high resistance rates and the risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia in older adults hampers its use. Fosfomycine has emerged as an additional option for directed therapy as it achieves reasonable intraprostatic concentrations and it is active against most MDRO including ESBL strains. Regarding the duration of antimicrobial treatment in males with FUTI, very few studies have analysed this topic. Ulleryd et al. showed that 14 day was not inferior to 28 day treatment while more recently van Niewkoop et al. demonstrated that 7 days was less efective than 14 day treatment in males with FUTI. In our study, older and non-older patients received slightly more than 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy.

Management of IUC in FUTI is also important, particularly in older patients who are frequently catheterized. IDSA guidelines recommend replacing a long-term IUC to hasten the resolution of symptoms in catheter-associated UTI. This recommendation has recently been questioned in a study by Babich et al. in which the authors found no clinical benefit from replacing a long-term IUC at the onset of a catheter-associated UTI. In a later editorial letter, the authors were questioned about the IDSA guidance to obtain a urine culture from a freshly placed catheter as a sample from a long-term IUC might not reflect the status of the infection in the bladder. The authors replied that in 97% of cases of bacteremia the same species was isolated from the urine while recognizing the need for further research with randomized controlled trials.

It has been shown that incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age and are more prominent in women than men. In older women, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recorded to be more than 15%. This number increased up to 50% for those who reside in long-term care facilities. In most scenarios, asymptomatic bacteriuria does not lead to urinary tract infections, and therefore, antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. In 2019, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) updated its asymptomatic bacteriuria management guidelines, which emphasized on the risks and benefits of treating the condition. Women who are pregnant should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first trimester and treated, if positive. Individuals who are undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures should be screened and treated appropriately for asymptomatic bacteriuria as well. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in individuals with diabetes, neutropenia, spinal cord injuries, indwelling urinary catheters, and so on has not been found to improve clinical outcomes. Furthermore, unnecessary treatment is often associated with unwanted consequences including but not limited to increased antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and increased health care cost. As a result, multiple antibiotic stewardship programs around the US have implemented protocols to appropriately reduce unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. It is important to appropriately screen and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria only when there is evidence of potential benefit.

### Urinary tract infections: 2021 Update [^11176wb8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) remains one of the most prevalent, but preventable, health care-associated infections and predominantly occurs in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. Duration of urinary catheterization is the most important modifiable risk factor for development of CAUTI. Alternatives to indwelling catheters should be considered in appropriate patients. If indwelling catheterization is necessary, proper aseptic practices for catheter insertion and maintenance and use of a closed catheter collection system are essential for preventing CAUTI. The use of intervention bundles and collaboratives helps in the effective implementation of CAUTI prevention measures.

### Management of urinary tract infections in elderly patients: strategies for improvement [^114zvLqY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lessons and Limitations

The strategies implemented were simple, straightforward, cost effective, easily achievable, and can be implemented in any setting, be it a district or teaching hospital. This study has demonstrated an overall improvement of the various aspects of UTI management. This was likely due to a combination of increased medical and nursing staff awareness and increased availability of specialised equipment detailed above. However, despite a small improvement, the number of patients fulfilling SIGN criteria for a diagnosis of UTI remained low. Small sample sizes and consequent reduction in power meant we were unable to demonstrate statistical significance for any of these improvements.

The low number of patients fulfilling SIGN criteria for a diagnosis of UTI presents problems in interpreting the effects of our measures on other outcomes, such as the increased number of urine cultures sent. Since the SIGN guidance requires that urine cultures be sent only after a certain number of symptoms and signs have been demonstrated, it could be argued that increases in urine culture rates without similar increases in the number of diagnoses concurring with SIGN guidelines do not represent an improvement in management.

Due to the complex presentation of some of the elderly patients with altered mental state, it was challenging for clinicians to obtain a comprehensive history to diagnose a UTI. This posed a similar challenge for our nursing colleagues when attempting to obtain urine samples from this group of patients. For future purposes, the proforma could be improved by including patients' mental or behavioural state on admission. Data could then be analysed for any effect of patient's mental state on the management of their illness.

There will be difficulties in sustaining improvements in practice. The high turnover of medical trainees means many of the educational actions will have to be repeated. There is ongoing work to include a summarised version of the guidelines into the induction pack of both doctors and nurses.

Diagnosis: culture

Laboratory culture is the gold standard for UTI diagnosis. Urine is sterile; therefore, the presence of bacteria in sufficient quantity, with concurrent evidence of active infection, suggests UTI. Urine is added to a growth medium, from which bacteria and antibiotic sensitivities are identified. Culture takes around 24 hours, then the presumptive diagnosis can be reviewed. All major UTI guidelines recommend culture is required for UTI diagnosis.

How many bacteria are needed to diagnose UTI in children? Thresholds vary between guidelines and collection methods. The commonly quoted threshold of 100 000 CFU/mL of a single organism is based on a seminal study in adult women by Kassfrom 1956. Does this threshold apply in children? American guidelines suggest a 50 000 CFU/mL threshold with concurrent pyuria for SPA and catheter specimens. More recent evidence suggests an even lower 10 000 CFU/mL threshold would slightly increase sensitivity without reducing diagnostic specificity. Many guidelines suggest that any growth on SPA is abnormal, as SPA has negligible contamination.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is the presence of bacteria in the urine without active infection. ASB prevalence is estimated at 1.4%–1.9% in childhood. Bacterial growth without evidence of active infection (eg, pyuria) does not suggest UTI.

In reality, these diagnostic thresholds are not binary. Low colony counts on culture may represent early infection, contamination or ASB. Pyuria may occasionally be absent in early infection or immunocompromise. Screening and culture results must always be considered in the clinical context.

Contamination

Contamination muddies the waters when evaluating UTI. Assuming a single uropathogen causes UTI, multiple organisms suggests sample contamination. Incidental flora colonise the perigenital skin and can get flushed into the urine sample on voiding. Missed diagnosis can occur if a true uropathogen is concealed in the mix or misdiagnosis if a single contaminant dominates the culture. Contamination can be minimised by cleaning the perigenital skin before sample collectionand avoiding touching inside the specimen jar or holding the jar against the child's skin.

What is on the horizon?

Current tests for UTI lack absolute sensitivity or specificity. Urinary biomarkers such as interleukin 6 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin have been proposed to differentiate between active infection and ASB. Real-time PCR has been proposed to identify common uropathogens such as E. coli. Further research is required to understand the clinical utility of these emerging tests.

### Diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^112DCEkT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is common, costly, and causes significant patient morbidity. CAUTIs are associated with hospital pathogens with a high propensity toward antimicrobial resistance. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with CAUTI accounts for excess antimicrobial use in hospitals and should be avoided. Duration of urinary catheterization is the predominant risk for CAUTI; preventive measures directed at limiting placement and early removal of urinary catheters have an impact on decreasing CAUTI rates. The use of bladder bundles and collaboratives, coupled with the support and active engagement from both hospital leaders and followers, seem to help prevent this common problem.

Urine collection and transport for suspected urinary tract infection — handling and special populations are detailed with explicit directives. Skin cleansing is still generally recommended. Use of urine transport media with preservative or refrigeration immediately after collection decreases the proliferation of microorganisms, whereas urine samples that are delayed in processing and held at room temperature for extended periods of time (> 4hours) are likely to demonstrate moderate to large increases in colony counts that are misleading and, in the majority of cases, are not recommended for culture. Straight or "in-and-out" catheterization of a properly prepared patient usually provides a less contaminated specimen, and while urine samples collected via a midstream void or straight catheterization are preferred to optimize urine culture performance, some diagnostic testing, specifically NAAT for STI, requires a first voided sample for optimal performance. Culture from indwelling catheters is therefore strongly discouraged, and if culture is required the specimen should be taken from the sampling port of a newly inserted device that has been in place for < 48 hours. Cultures of Foley catheter tips and urine from the bag of a catheterized patient are of no clinical value and should be rejected, and bagged urine collections, primarily used for pediatric patients, should be strongly discouraged in favor of straight catheterization. For patients with stents or stones, culture of the removed stent or stone is appropriate, but results should be interpreted in the context of the pathogens identified, the method of device or stone removal, and other laboratory data, including urine culture. For chronic or recurrent UTI, urine culture conditions and interpretive and reporting criteria (ie, lower reporting thresholds) may require modifications, while expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) can recover additional potential urinary tract pathogens but data do not support routine use of these methods for all patient populations. Specimens obtained by more invasive means, such as cystoscope or suprapubic aspirations, are routinely cultured to allow for recovery of bacteria in concentrations as low as 1000 CFU/mL.

### Modified reporting of positive urine cultures to reduce inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria among nonpregnant, noncatheterized inpatients: a randomized controlled trial [^114gQVPF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

DESIGNWe conducted a randomized, parallel, unblinded, superiority trial of a laboratory reporting intervention designed to reduce antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB).METHODSResults of positive urine cultures from 110 consecutive inpatients at 2 urban acute-care hospitals were randomized to standard report (control) or modified report (intervention). The standard report included bacterial count, bacterial identification, and antibiotic susceptibility information including drug dosage and cost. The modified report stated: "This POSITIVE urine culture may represent asymptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infection. If urinary tract infection is suspected clinically, please call the microbiology laboratory… for identification and susceptibility results". We used the following exclusion criteria: age < 18 years, pregnancy, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, samples from patients already on antibiotics, neutropenia, or admission to an intensive care unit. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of appropriate antibiotic therapy prescribed.RESULTSAccording to our intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the proportion of appropriate treatment (urinary tract infection treated plus ASB not treated) was higher in the modified arm than in the standard arm: 44 of 55 (80.0%) versus 29 of 55 (52.7%), respectively (absolute difference, -27.3%; RR, 0.42; p = 0.002; number needed to report for benefit, 3.7).CONCLUSIONSModified reporting resulted in a significant reduction in inappropriate antibiotic treatment without an increase in adverse events.

### Overtreatment of presumed urinary tract infection in older women presenting to the emergency department [^116KBoZr]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine how often older women presenting to an emergency department (ED) are diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) without a positive urine culture and to investigate whether collecting urine by catheterization instead of clean catch improves the accuracy of the urinalysis (UA).

Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Academic-affiliated ED in Providence, Rhode Island.

Participants

One hundred fifty-three women aged 70 and older with diagnosis of UTI in the ED between December 1, 2008, and March 1, 2010.

Measurements

Chief complaint, review of systems, results of UA and culture, urine procurement (clean catch, straight catheter, or newly inserted Foley catheter), antibiotic administered or prescribed, and diagnosis. A confirmed UTI was defined as a positive urine culture, with microbial growth of 10,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/ mL or more for clean-catch specimens and 100 CFU/mL or more for newly inserted catheter specimens; an ED diagnosis of UTI was defined as the designation by an ED physician.

Results

Of 153 individuals with an ED-diagnosed UTI, only 87 (57%) had confirmed UTI according to culture. Of the remaining 66 with negative cultures, 63 (95%) were administered or prescribed antibiotics in the ED. The method of urine procurement affected the ability of a UA to predict the culture result (P = 0.02), with catheterization yielding a lower proportion of false-positive UA (31%) than clean catch (48%).

Conclusion

Nearly half of older women diagnosed with a UTI in an ED setting did not have confirmatory findings on urine culture and were therefore inappropriately treated. Catheterization improved the accuracy of UA when assessing older women for possible UTI.

### Strategies to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^112N2oob]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential practices for preventing CAUTI: Recommended for all acute-care hospitals

Perform a CAUTI risk assessment and implement an organization-wide program to identify and remove catheters that are no longer necessary using 1 or more methods documented to be effective. (Quality of evidence: MODERATE) Develop and implement institutional policy requiring periodic, usually daily, review of the necessity of continued catheterization. Consider utilizing electronic or other types of reminders (see Supplementary Content, Appendices 2 and 3 online) of the presence of a catheter and required criteria for continued use. Examples include the following: Automatic stop orders requiring review of current indications and renewal of order for continuation of the indwelling catheter. Standardized reminders of persistent catheters together with current catheter indications (see Supplementary Content, Appendices 2 and 3 online) targeting either physicians or nurses. Nursing and physician staff conduct daily reviews during rounds of all patients with urinary catheters to ascertain necessity of continuing catheter use.
Provide appropriate infrastructure for preventing CAUTI.(Quality of evidence: LOW) Ensure that the supplies for following best practices for managing urinary issues are readily available to staff in each unit, including bladder scanners, non–catheter-incontinence management supplies (urinals, garments, bed pads, skin products), male and female external urinary catheters, straight urinary catheters, and indwelling catheters including the option of catheters with coude tips. Ensure that non-catheter urinary management supplies are as easy to obtain for bedside use as indwelling urinary catheters. Ensure the physical capability for urinary catheters with tubes attached to patients (eg, indwelling urinary catheters and some external urinary catheters [EUCs]) to be positioned on beds, wheelchairs, at an appropriate height and without kinking for patients in their rooms and during transport.
Provide and implement evidence-based protocols to address multiple steps of the urinary catheter life cycle (Fig. 1): catheter appropriateness (step 0), insertion technique (step 1), maintenance care (step 2), and prompt removal (step 3) when no longer appropriate. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Adapt and implement evidence-based criteria for acceptable indications for indwelling urethral catheter use, which may be embedded as standardized clinical-decision support tools within electronic medical record (EMR) ordering systems. Expert-consensus–derived indications for indwelling catheter use have been developed, although research that assesses the appropriateness of these uses is limited. The limited examples of appropriate indications for indwelling urethral catheter include the following: Perioperative use for selected surgical procedures, such as urologic surgery or surgery on contiguous structures of the genitourinary tract, prolonged surgery, large-volume infusions or diuretics during surgery, or intraoperative monitoring of urine output is needed. Notably, if a catheter is placed intraoperatively simply due to the duration of surgery (eg, > 3 hours) or for decompression to address a specific surgical approach, then such catheters should be removed at the end of the surgical case. Hourly assessment of urine output in ICU patients when used clinically to modify therapies frequently such as volume resuscitation, diuresis, and vasopressors. ICU care alone is not an appropriate justification for indwelling catheter placement; a specific clinical indication is still needed. Management of acute urinary retention, (eg, new retention of urine with postvoid residual bladder volume > 500 cm 3 by bladder scanner if no symptoms, or > 300 cm 3 if having symptoms such as bladder pain or fullness, persistent urge to void, new incontinence or leaking, or only able to have frequent small voids) Assistance in healing of open pressure ulcers or skin grafts for selected patients with urinary incontinence when alternative supplies for protective wound or managing incontinence (eg, external urinary catheters, wound dressings) are not feasible. Facilities may allow exceptions as part of a palliative and/or comfort care regimen, if use of the catheter addresses a specific goal of the patient, such as reducing the need for frequent bed or garment changes or preventing pain that cannot be well managed.
Ensure that only trained HCP insert urinary catheters and that competency is assessed regularly.(Quality of evidence: LOW) Require supervision by experienced HCP when trainees insert and remove catheters to reduce the risk of infectious and traumatic complications related to urinary catheter placement. – Given much higher rates of CAUTI when catheters are placed by trainees such as medical students, educational programs may need to reassess at which point in medical training and which trainees specifically are most appropriate for being involved in urinary catheter insertion in patients compared to simulation models only.
Ensure that supplies necessary for aseptic technique for catheter insertion are available and conveniently located. (Quality of evidence: LOW)
Implement a system for documenting the following in the patient record: physician order for catheter placement, indications for catheter insertion, date and time of catheter insertion, name of individual who inserted catheter, nursing documentation of placement, daily presence of a catheter and maintenance care tasks, and date and time of catheter removal. Record criteria for removal and justification for continued use. (Quality of evidence: LOW) Record in a standard format for data collection and quality improvement purposes and keep accessible documentation of catheter placement (including indication) and removal. If available, utilize electronic documentation that is searchable. Consider nurse-driven urinary catheter removal protocols for first trial of void without an indwelling catheter when the indication for placement has resolved (see Essential Practices, 3). These protocols can be implemented as part of the routine urinary catheter placement order or as an expected reminder (or "standing order") from the nurse to the physician in rounds. These protocols should list some exceptions or "opt outs", such as for postoperative urology surgery patients or patients for whom a catheter required urology consult for placement that should not be removed without physician order.
Ensure that sufficiently trained HCP and technology resources are available to support surveillance for catheter use and outcomes.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Perform surveillance for CAUTI if indicated based on facility risk assessment or regulatory requirements as described in Section 5.(Quality of evidence: LOW)
Standardize urine culturing by adapting an institutional protocol for appropriate indications for urine cultures in patients with and without an indwelling catheter.– Consider incorporating these indications into the EMR, and review indications for ordering urine cultures in CAUTI risk assessment.(Quality of evidence: LOW)

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) values and preferences — The panel states that most patients would wish to receive antimicrobial therapy for ASB if benefits outweigh harms, but where treatment is unlikely to confer a benefit, risks including adverse drug effects, CDI, and antimicrobial resistance suggest most would not wish to receive antimicrobial treatment. From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

### Urinary tract infection and antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department [^117HSXZy]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to assess empiric antibiotic use for presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department (ED) and to determine how often urine culture results subsequently do not confirm the diagnosis.

Methods

This study is a retrospective cohort study of patients aged 21 years or younger in the Nationwide Children's Hospital ED from May 1, 2012, to October 31, 2012, who had a urinalysis and urine culture performed and were discharged home with empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed UTI. Patients with known urinary tract anomaly or antibiotic use in the previous 7 days were excluded. Confirmed UTI was defined as pyuria (> 5 white blood cells per high-power field or dipstick positive for leukocyte esterase) and a positive urine culture (≥ 50,000 colony-forming units/mL of a uropathogen).

Results

Of the 175 enrolled patients, urine was obtained by clean catch in 138 (79%), catheterization in 35 (20%), first-pass void in 1 (0.6%), and undocumented method in 1 (0.6%). Pyuria was demonstrated in 164 patients (94%), but only 97 (55%) had a positive urine culture. The combination of pyuria and a positive urine culture confirmed UTI in 90 patients (51%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were cefdinir in 103 patients (59%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 40 (23%), and ciprofloxacin in 23 (13%). The median duration of prescribed therapy was 10 days (interquartile range, 7–10 days). Treatment duration was correlated negatively with age (r = -0.53, P < 0.01).

Conclusions

The current management of suspected UTI in ED patients results in unnecessary antibiotic exposure, highlighting an important opportunity for outpatient antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114vh2Xz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Cystitis and pyelonephritis — quantitative urine culture thresholds and test utilization specify that the standardized threshold in symptomatic patients is > 100 000 CFU/mL for organisms identified as common pathogens, though many sites now use either 10 000 CFU/mL or 1000 CFU/mL based on the method of collection or patient population as a baseline for culture workup and clinical significance. Laboratories typically provide antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for potential pathogens recovered in significant gram numbers as part of standard laboratory protocol. The Gram stain is not routinely utilized for the diagnosis of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, but it may have limited utility in patients with febrile urinary tract infection (pyelonephritis, prostatitis, urosepsis) where high numbers of gram-negative bacilli may be present in urine screen. Because urine may be readily contaminated with urogenital microbiota, proper specimen collection is essential for urine culture and should be performed using a process that minimizes contamination from the perineal and superficial mucosal microbiota.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^113fEjAS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

FAQs: Urinary Tract Infection Events Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection and Non-Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection and Other Urinary System Infection On This Page.
- Spinal cord injury, heavily sedated, or ventilated patients
- 100, 000 CFU/ml included in more than 1 laboratory category
- Mixed flora
- Morphology determining what equates to > 2 organisms
- Multiple colony counts for the same organism
- Number of organisms in cultures. Spinal cord injury, heavily sedated, or ventilated patients Surveillance criteria may not be equally sensitive for all patient populations. Patient populations in which the UTI criteria may not be as sensitive include spinal cord injury patients, those with brain injuries, and heavily sedated patients. NHSN constructed its surveillance definitions to balance sensitivity and specificity along with feasibility.

A set of criteria that covered every subpopulation with high specificity and sensitivity would be too complicated to employ consistently across different facilities. NHSN recommends following the criteria as written in locations in which you are performing CAUTI surveillance. 100, 000 CFU/ml included in more than 1 laboratory category My lab offers culture counts that are: 75k-100, 000 CFU/ml > 100, 000 CFU/ml You must check with your laboratory to determine if they can identify whether at least 100, 000 CFU/ml are identified in the urine culture, and if yes, to report it as ≥ 100, 000 CFU/ml. Some laboratories have been able to clarify this. If the laboratory cannot clarify the culture count and cannot say for certain that a culture has at least 100, 000 CFU/ml, do not use that culture for NHSN UTI surveillance.

40, 000–50, 000 CFU/ml Klebsiella oxytoca > 100, 000 CFU/ml Pseudomonas aeruginosa < 10, 000 CFU/ml Candida, not albicans No, the urine culture would be ineligible for use to meet NHSN UTI criteria, because there would be a total of three organisms present, including the candida. An excluded organism, such as candida, can be in a positive urine culture, however, there can only be one other organism present that has. __ > __100K CFU/ml to be an eligible urine culture. Patient reported fever If the patient reports a fever > 38. 0°C, during the POA timeframe and within the IWP of a positive urine culture, the fever can be used to determine if a UTI event occurred during the POA timeframe. A general report of "fever" by the patient, without an accompanying temperature measurement, may not be used. Yes.

If the patient's urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria occurred when the indwelling urinary catheter was not in place at the time the patient experienced the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria, then the urinary urgency, urinary frequency, or dysuria can be used as an element to meet NHSN UTI criteria, even on a day when the was in place for part of the day. Ideally, clinical decisions about "with no other recognized cause" for the UTI signs/symptoms, suprapubic tenderness or costovertebral angle pain or tenderness, should be made by a physician and/or their designee in your organization who has access to a patient's entire medical record and clinical picture. The other recognized cause must occur during the current admission. Clinical judgment determination must be able to be defended and backed up by physician documentation and there should be clear rationale for that determination in the event the case is validated. Leg bags/attaching urometers Yes.

### Indwelling urinary catheter culture stewardship: overview… [^111ATHLW]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Urine culture stewardship is a multifaceted approach to ensure that urine cultures are: Background An indwelling urinary catheter is a thin, hollow tube inserted through the urethra into the urinary bladder to collect and drain urine. Once inserted, a balloon is inflated which keeps the catheter in place. An indwelling urinary catheter may be left in place for a period of days to weeks. The catheter is connected to a drainage bag that has a valve that can be opened to release urine as well as a separate port that can be used to collect a urine sample.

Multifaceted approach Urine culture stewardship is a multifaceted approach to ensure that urine cultures are:

- Performed only when appropriate indications are present in order to determine if treatment with antibiotics is indicated
- Collected, stored, and processed in a manner to best prevent contamination with microorganisms such as bacteria This approach can be used in patients with and without indwelling urinary catheters in a variety of settings. Colonization Indwelling urinary catheters quickly become colonized with microorganisms after insertion. These microorganisms produce proteins and other substances that are sticky and facilitate the formation of biofilms. These biofilms make it impossible to eradicate the bacteria even with antibiotics. Bacteriuria Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in urine. Because indwelling urinary catheters become colonized so easily, the incidence of bacteriuria is 3–7% per day.

Nearly 100% of patients with urinary catheters will have bacteriuria after one month. Catheter-associated Asymptomatic Bacteriuria CA-ASB is the presence of bacteria in a urine sample due to bacterial colonization of the urinary tract and/or indwelling urinary catheter. CA-ASB does not cause symptoms and is not indicative of an infection that needs treatment with antibiotics in most patients; it is appropriate to treat ASB with antibiotics in pregnant women and in those undergoing certain invasive urological procedures. Catheter-associated Urinary Tract Infection A CAUTI occurs when germs enter the urinary tract through the urinary catheter and cause symptoms. CAUTIs have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs, and hospital length of stay. They require treatment with antibiotics. Is it CA-ASB or CAUTI. Distinguishing between CA-ASB and CAUTI is important to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use.

Studies have shown that inappropriate treatment of patients with urinary catheters and ASB is widespread and can lead to unintended consequences. Pitfalls of unnecessary antibiotic overuse are numerous and include: Clostridioides difficileinfections.
- Colonization or infection with resistant bacteria.
- Adverse drug events. Advantages of Urine Culture Stewardship Institutions that have implemented urine culture stewardship have reported: Decreases in
- the number of total urine cultures ordered
- the number of ASB cases treated inappropriately
- costs related to overtreatment of ASB
- CAUTIs No increases in
- patient adverse events. Resources
- Recommendation from the Choosing Wisely Campaign to reduce unnecessary medical tests, treatments, and procedures is an initiative of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation.
- Don't perform urinalysis, urine culture, blood culture or C. difficile testing unless patients have signs or symptoms of infection.

### Urine culture stewardship in patients without indwelling urinary… [^116Tc7LP]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Information on Urine Culture Stewardship in patients without indwelling urinary catheters. Who is at risk The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients without indwelling urinary catheters varies widely among groups and is more common in women, the elderly, those with urogenital abnormalities, institutionalized patients, and certain comorbidities. Treatment of ASB in these patients contributes significantly to antibiotic misuse. Use of urine cultures in patients without indwelling urinary catheters Here are some examples of appropriate and inappropriate uses of urine cultures that you can consider when drafting your list of facility-approved indications, other indications might exist at your facility: These examples are not meant to replace the clinical judgement of an individual treating provider. Decisions regarding patient diagnosis and management depend on individual patient characteristics and medical history.

For example, conditions other than a bacterial urinary tract infection may cause symptoms or pyuria; additional investigation for nonbacterial causes of pyuria, including but not limited to sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, interstitial cystitis, and carcinoma in situ of the bladder, may be warranted. Resources. Appropriate uses Urine cultures may not be needed in cases of uncomplicated cystitis unless patient fails empiric treatment.
- Dysuria, urgent or frequent urination, suprapubic pain or tenderness, flank pain or costovertebral angle tenderness, acute hematuria, or pelvic discomfort
- New onset or worsening sepsis with no identifiable cause
- Fever or altered mental status without evidence of another source on history, physical examination, or laboratory testing.
- Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria
- Early pregnancy
- Prior to certain urology procedures
- Preoperative evaluations, prior to urologic surgeries where mucosal bleeding is anticipated
- **In spinal cord injury patients**: increased spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia, sense of unease. Inappropriate uses
- Odorous, cloudy, or discolored urine in the absence of other localizing signs/symptoms
- Reflex urine cultures based on urinalysis results, such as pyuria, in the absence of other indications
- Urine culture to document response to therapy unless symptoms fail to resolve
- Screening for ASB in most groups
- Preoperative evaluations in most groups.
