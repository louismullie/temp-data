## Question

What is the mcid for 5xsts

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the 5-times sit-to-stand test (5×STS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the exact test variant and measurement unit. Then, I should verify the highest-quality anchor-based estimates across populations. Next, I will review distribution-based estimates to triangulate a reasonable range. After that, I need to consider population-specific nuances and how test administration affects interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic recommendation and note limitations and exceptions where the MCID may differ.

> Let me first confirm the construct and unit. The 5×STS is typically timed in seconds, with shorter times indicating better function; some studies use repetitions in 30 seconds, but the MCID question here is about the timed 5-repetition version, so the unit should be seconds, and improvement is a reduction in time [^0e8be104] [^b1e9a823].

> Next, I should review anchor-based estimates, which are generally preferred because they link change to patient-perceived benefit. In ambulatory spinal cord injury, a prospective cohort using global rating of change found MCIDs of about 2.27 seconds with hands and about 2.0 seconds without hands, indicating that reductions of roughly 2 seconds are meaningful in that population [^2bc38af3]. In lumbar disc herniation patients after surgery, averaging anchor-based methods yielded an MCID of 3.6 seconds, suggesting that a reduction around 3.5 seconds is clinically relevant in that surgical spine population [^66978ed7]. In COPD, a conservative anchor-based estimate is 1.7 seconds, reflecting smaller but still meaningful improvements in this respiratory population [^b1e9a823]. Hold on, I should verify that these anchor-based values align with distribution-based methods; indeed, the LDH study reports that 0.5 SD and 95% MDC both land near 3.0–3.8 seconds, supporting the 3.6-second anchor estimate in that group [^66978ed7].

> I will now examine distribution-based estimates to triangulate a range. Common benchmarks like 0.5 SD and SEM-derived MDC often produce values around 2–4 seconds depending on baseline variability. For example, in COPD the conservative anchor-based estimate is 1.7 seconds, and distribution-based approaches in other populations yield roughly 2–4 seconds, reinforcing that a 2–4 second improvement is a reasonable working range across contexts [^b1e9a823] [^66978ed7]. Wait, let me verify the MDC angle: in institutionalized older adults, the MDC95 for 5×STS was about 9.6 seconds, which is much larger than typical MCIDs; that reflects measurement error in a frail, multimorbid setting and underscores why MCID should exceed MDC to be interpretable at the individual level [^4d4d4415].

> But wait, what if the population or protocol changes the meaning of a 2–4 second change? I need to ensure population specificity. In frail or multimorbid older adults, baseline times are slower and variability is higher, so a 2–4 second change may represent a smaller relative improvement and may be less detectable against noise; conversely, in high-functioning adults, even a 1–2 second change can be meaningful. In COPD, the MCID is about 1.7 seconds, whereas in surgical lumbar disc herniation it is about 3.6 seconds, illustrating that MCID is context-specific and should be applied to similar populations and protocols [^b1e9a823] [^66978ed7]. Hold on, I should verify administration effects: allowing arm use can slow times and alter responsiveness, so standardized instructions and consistent chair height are important when comparing within or between patients [^0e8be104].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic answer. For most ambulatory adults, a reduction in 5×STS time of about 2–4 seconds represents a minimal clinically important improvement, with 2 seconds appropriate in higher-functioning or respiratory populations and 3–4 seconds appropriate in lower-functioning or post-surgical populations. I should double-check that this aligns with the anchor-based data: yes, COPD supports ~1.7 s, SCI supports ~2.0–2.3 s, and LDH supports ~3.6 s, which brackets the 2–4 second range across common clinical contexts [^b1e9a823] [^2bc38af3] [^66978ed7].

> I should also note limitations and exceptions. MCID is not a fixed biological constant; it varies by population, baseline severity, and calculation method, and it should exceed the minimal detectable change to be clinically credible. In frail or institutionalized older adults, measurement error is larger and the test may be less suitable for individual-level change, so I need to be cautious about applying standard MCIDs there. Conversely, in cancer rehabilitation and other exercise interventions, observed improvements often surpass 2–4 seconds, but individual variability is high, so group-level MCIDs may not translate neatly to every patient [^4d4d4415] [^a8cca9bf] [^5da85a58].

> Final answer: The minimal clinically important difference for the 5-times sit-to-stand test is a reduction of approximately 2–4 seconds, with 2 seconds reasonable in higher-functioning or respiratory populations and 3–4 seconds reasonable in lower-functioning or post-surgical populations. Apply the lower end of the range when baseline function is high and the higher end when baseline function is low, and ensure consistent test administration to interpret change reliably [^b1e9a823] [^2bc38af3] [^66978ed7].

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the 5-times sit-to-stand test (5×STS) is **population-specific**: approximately 1.7 seconds in COPD [^b1e9a823], 2.0–2.3 seconds in spinal cord injury [^2bc38af3], and 3.6 seconds in lumbar disc herniation [^66978ed7]. For older adults, a reduction of about 2.3 seconds is commonly cited [^6d9bb92e], though values range from 0.5–1.7 seconds depending on context [^66f91d25]. MCIDs are calculated using anchor- and distribution-based methods and should be applied within the specific population and protocol used in the study [^f185d167] [^8196dbb8].

## Population-specific MCID values

| **Population** | **Mcid value** | **Methodology** | **Study** |
|-|-|-|-|
| COPD | 1.7 seconds | Anchor-based (global rating of change) | b1e9a823 |
| Spinal cord injury | 2.0–2.3 seconds | Anchor-based (global rating of change) | 2bc38af3 |
| Lumbar disc herniation | 3.6 seconds | Anchor-based (ODI, RMDQ) | 66978ed7 |
| Older adults (general) | 2.3 seconds | Distribution-based (0.5 SD) | 6d9bb92e |
| Older adults (pre-frail) | 0.5–1.7 seconds | Distribution-based (0.5 SD, SEM) | 66f91d25 |

---

## Methodological considerations

- **Anchor-based methods**: Correlate 5×STS change with patient-reported outcomes (e.g. global rating of change, ODI, RMDQ) to identify the smallest change patients perceive as meaningful [^f185d167] [^8196dbb8].
- **Distribution-based methods**: Use statistical metrics (e.g. 0.5 SD, SEM, MDC) to estimate clinically relevant change based on variability and measurement error [^f185d167] [^8196dbb8].
- **Population specificity**: MCIDs vary by population, baseline function, and test protocol; apply MCIDs within the same context in which they were derived [^e43d7a33] [^8196dbb8].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Interpretation**: A reduction in 5×STS time equal to or greater than the MCID indicates a clinically meaningful improvement in lower limb strength and functional mobility [^f185d167] [^8196dbb8].
- **Individualized care**: Use population-specific MCIDs to set realistic goals and evaluate intervention effectiveness [^f185d167] [^8196dbb8].
- **Limitations**: MCIDs are not universal; consider baseline function, comorbidities, and test conditions when interpreting changes [^e43d7a33] [^8196dbb8].

---

The MCID for 5×STS varies by population, with **1.7–3.6 seconds** covering most clinical contexts; apply the MCID specific to your patient group and protocol to judge whether observed changes are clinically meaningful.

### Responsiveness and minimal clinically important difference of the five times sit-to-stand test in ambulatory individuals with spinal cord injury: a six-month prospective cohort study [^2bc38af3]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To explore the responsiveness and minimal clinically important differences of the five times sit-to-stand test in ambulatory individuals with spinal cord injury.

Methods

This six-month prospective cohort study was conducted in 109 individuals with spinal cord injury who could walk with or without a walking device for at least 10 meters. Participants were assessed for the five times sit-to-stand test in the four arm-placement conditions and standard measures to determine responsiveness of the test, at baseline, and one, three, and six months. At six months, participants were also interviewed for the global rating of change to estimate the minimal clinically important differences of the five times sit-to-stand test.

Results

The five times sit-to-stand test showed large internal responsiveness (standardized response means > 0.83), with moderate external responsiveness as compared to the 10-meter walk test (ρ = -0.28 to -0.48, p < 0.005). The changes in the outcomes ≥ 2.27 and ≥ 2 s could be used to indicate a level of minimal clinically important change for participants who executed the test with and without hands, respectively.

Conclusion

The five times sit-to-stand test is a responsiveness measure for ambulatory individuals with spinal cord injury. The levels of minimal clinically important differences found in this study (< u > > < /u > 2.27 and < u > > < /u > 2s) can be applied as a useful benchmark for the decision of clinically relevant changes over time for these individuals.

### Estimating the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of the five-repetition sit-to-stand test in patients with lumbar disc herniation [^66978ed7]. European Spine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of surgical interventions on lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is often assessed using objective functional impairment (OFI) tests like the five-repetition sit-to-stand (5R-STS) test. This study calculates the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for 5R-STS improvement in patients with LDH one year after surgery.

Methods

Adult patients with LDH scheduled for surgery were prospectively recruited from a Dutch short-stay spinal clinic. The 5R-STS time, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Numeric Rating Scale for back and leg pain, EQ-5D-3L health-related quality of life questionnaire and EQ5D-VAS were recorded preoperatively, at 6-weeks and 1-year post-operatively. The MCID was calculated using anchor-based methods (within-patient change; between-patient change; and receiver-operating characteristic approaches) and distribution-based methods (0.5 standard deviation (SD); effect size; standard error of measurement; standardized response mean; and 95% minimum detectable change (MDC)). The final MCID value was based on the "gold standard": an averaging of the anchor-based methods using ODI and RMDQ as the closest available anchors.

Results

We prospectively recruited 134 patients. One-year follow-up was completed by 103 (76.8%) of patients. The MCID values derived using different methods varied from 0.7 to 5.1 s (s). The final, averaged, anchor-based MCID for improvement was 3.6 s. Within distribution-based methods, 95% MDC and 0.5SD approach, yielded an MCID of 3.0 and 3.8 s, respectively, aligning closely with the overall anchor-derived MCID for 5R-STS.

Conclusion

In a patient with LDH, an improvement in 5R-STS performance of at least 3.6 s can be regarded as a clinically relevant improvement.

### The five-repetition sit-to-stand test as a functional outcome measure in COPD [^b1e9a823]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Moving from sitting to standing is a common activity of daily living. The five-repetition sit-to-stand test (5STS) is a test of lower limb function that measures the fastest time taken to stand five times from a chair with arms folded. The 5STS has been validated in healthy community-dwelling adults, but data in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) populations are lacking.

Aims

To determine the reliability, validity and responsiveness of the 5STS in patients with COPD.

Methods

Test-retest and interobserver reliability of the 5STS was measured in 50 patients with COPD. To address construct validity we collected data on the 5STS, exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk (ISW)), lower limb strength (quadriceps maximum voluntary contraction (QMVC)), health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) and composite mortality indices (Age Dyspnoea Obstruction index (ADO), BODE index (iBODE)). Responsiveness was determined by measuring 5STS before and after outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in 239 patients. Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) was estimated using anchor-based methods.

Results

Test-retest and interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.97 and 0.99, respectively. 5STS time correlated significantly with ISW, QMVC, SGRQ, ADO and iBODE (r = -0.59, -0.38, 0.35, 0.42 and 0.46, respectively; all p < 0.001). Median (25th, 75th centiles) 5STS time decreased with PR (Pre: 14.1 (11.5, 21.3) vs Post: 12.4 (10.2, 16.3) s; p < 0.001). Using different anchors, a conservative estimate for the MCID was 1.7 s.

Conclusions

The 5STS is reliable, valid and responsive in patients with COPD with an estimated MCID of 1.7 s. It is a practical functional outcome measure suitable for use in most healthcare settings.

### The 1-min sit-to-stand test – A simple functional capacity test in cystic fibrosis? [^6ddef8df]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to assess the measurement properties and the minimal important difference (MID) of the 1-min sit-to-stand (STS) test in cystic fibrosis (CF).

Methods

Patients with CF were tested during a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Five STS tests were performed during the program; two tests at the beginning (STS0 and STS1) and three tests at the end (STS2a-2c). Exercise capacity, pulmonary function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and patient-reported health status were measured at the beginning and end of the program. We calculated overall mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the STS test. The MID was calculated using anchor-based and distributional methods.

Results

Fourteen participants (8 female, mean age 30.4 ± 6.1years) were included. STS test performance increased significantly from STS0 to STS1 indicative of a learning effect. Test-retest reliability for the subsequent STS2a-2c tests was excellent (ICC 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–0.99). The estimated MID for the STS test was 5 repetitions. STS test performance was responsive to change (effect size of 0.97) and correlated with exercise capacity (r = 0.63–0.73) and with the physical functioning HRQoL scale (r = 0.72).

Conclusions

The 1-min STS test appears to be a reliable, valid, and feasible test to measure functional capacity in patients with CF.

### Community-based exercises improve health status in pre-frail older adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^66f91e25]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Our review has revealed significantly moderate effect size in lower limb strength when comparing pre-frail older adults who received pre-frailty intervention compared to minimal intervention (SMD = 0.67). During our post-hoc subgroup analyses of trials which used timed 5-times sit-to-stand test (n = 4), the significance in pooled lower limb strength remained (SMD = 0.58, p = 0.04). This corresponds to a reduction by 2.25 secs (Supplementary Fig. 4Aii), which concurs with the minimal clinically important difference, that is 0.5 to 1.7 secs, as reported by a previous study. When we analysed trials which used 30 s chair rise stand test (n = 3), the significance in pooled lower limb strength persisted as well (SMD = 1.35, p = 0.001), and this is borne out to be approximately 4 repetitions. On the contrary, Liu and co-workers (2022) reported a lack of significance in pooled mean difference. This discordance may plausibly be due to the trials included during analysis. For example, we included trials which recruited mostly community-dwelling older adults with pre-frailty, whereas Liu and co-workers (2022) included trials which recruited hospitalized pre-frail older adults, pre-frail older adults from residential living centres, pre-frail elderly women who visited the sport training centre, and community-dwelling pre-frail elderly people. Future reviews may include more specific inclusion criteria to enhance comparison between studies, and to better understand the target population being studied.

### Effectiveness of exercise intervention on physical and health outcomes in patients admitted to an acute medical ward: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6d9bb92e]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
Meta-analysis of the effect of exercise intervention on maximum isometric strength.

Balance was measured in one study using the timed up-and-go test. The timed up-and-go is a measure of mobility and dynamic balance. It is validated to assess falls risk in older adults and easily performed in a clinical setting. A minimal clinical important difference range of 0.9–3.5 seconds has been reported for this test. The one study to investigate balance using the timed up-and-go test demonstrated no difference between groups for time to completion. Two studies reported findings for the five times sit-to-stand test. It is validated to measure the dynamic balance and functional mobility in older adults. A minimal clinical important difference of 2.3 seconds has been reported in the literature. One study demonstrated a significant difference between groups in favour of exercise. A meta-analysis was not able to be completed as appropriate data was not published and not provided after contact with the author.

One study assessed balance via the semi-tandem and tandem stance balance tests. These tests are a measure of static balance. Data was not published or provided after author contact; therefore, no outcome was able to be analysed.

### The "Minimum clinically important difference" in frequently reported objective physical function tests after a 12-week renal rehabilitation exercise intervention in nondialysis chronic kidney disease [^13a9bc79]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic kidney disease patients are characterized by impaired physical function. The goal of exercise-based interventions is an improvement in functional performance. However, improvements are often determined by "statistically significant" changes. We investigated the "minimum clinically important difference", "the smallest change that is important to the patient", for commonly reported physical function tests.

Design

Nondialysis chronic kidney disease patients completed 12-wks of a combined aerobic (plus resistance training). The incremental shuttle walking test, sit-to-stand 5 and 60, estimated 1-repetition maximum for the knee extensors, and VO2peak were assessed. After the intervention, patients rated their perceived change in health. Both anchor- and distribution-based minimum clinically important difference approaches were calculated.

Results

The minimum clinically important difference was calculated as follows: incremental shuttle walking test, +45 m; sit-to-stand 5, -4.2 secs; VO2peak, +1.5 ml/kg per min. Because of comparable increases in "anchor" groups, no minimum clinically important difference was estimated for the sit-to-stand 60 or estimated 1-repetition maximum.

Conclusions

We have established the minimum clinically important difference in chronic kidney disease for common tests of physical function. These values represent the minimum change required for patients to perceive noticeable and beneficial change to their health. These scores will help interpret changes after exercise interventions where these tests are used. These minimum clinically important differences can be used to power future studies to detect clinically important changes.

### COPD online-rehabilitation versus conventional COPD rehabilitation-rationale and design for a multicenter randomized controlled trial protocol (CORe trial) [^ab5a47e8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Secondary outcome measures

The 30-s sit-to-stand test (30s-STS) will be used as an indirect assessment of lower extremity muscle strength. A standardized chair with a seat height of 45–47 cm is used, and the patients will be asked to stand up fully and sit down as many times as possible in 30 s with the arms across the chest. The numbers of full stands will be recorded. The score zero will be recorded if a patient is unable to rise from the chair without using the arms. Two tests will be performed to eliminate a potential learning effect, and the best result will be recorded. A 30-min rest is mandatory between first and second 30s-STS.

COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a patient completed 8-item questionnaire that assesses the impact of COPD on self-reported health status and symptoms. Each item scores from 0 to 5 points (0 indicating no impact or symptoms, 5 worst possible impact or symptoms) summing up to a total CAT score range of 0–40 points. CAT is a validated tool with a Cronbach's α of 0.88 and found responsive to change in self-reported health status and symptoms after pulmonary rehabilitation. A minimal clinical important difference (MCID) of 2–3 points is suggested.

### The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies [^86aa4cf7]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

We analyzed participant demographics and baseline characteristics for each study independently using descriptive statistics; some data have been previously reported in each study's main publication. We summarized outcomes using descriptive data. For each measure and time point, we identified the frequency distribution of scores (counts, percentages); identified floor (≥ 15% of participants with minimum score) and ceiling effects (≥ 15% of participants with maximum score); calculated central tendency [mean (standard deviation) or median (1st, 3rd quartiles) for skewed data]; and assessed normality (Shapiro–Wilk test, a = 0.05). For the 30 s STS, we calculated the mean or median time to assessment for each time point, and we considered the "maximum" score based on the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for sex-matched normative values (29 repetitions for women, 32 for men). For paired assessments, we calculated each participant's difference score (hospital minus ICU discharge); the overall group change score [mean (standard deviation) or median (1st, 3rd quartiles) for skewed data]; we compared the difference in assessment scores using a paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (skewed data), with a two-tailed a = 0.05. We also calculated the standard error of the measurement (SEM) and the minimal detectable change at a 90% confidence level (MDC 90) from paired assessments. We conducted a sensitivity analysis, removing participants who were assigned a score of "0" if they were unable to complete an assessment. Outcome assessment data were analyzed using Stata (v. 15.0, College Station, Texas: StataCorp LP).

We compared 30 s STS scores at each time point against established thresholds for maintenance of physical independence and normative values for community-dwelling older adults matched to our cohort characteristics.

### Functional outcomes in ICU-what should we be using?-an observational study [^0f683551]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The minimal important difference is the smallest change in an outcome that is considered to be clinically relevant. There are two main methods used to determine the minimal important difference, the distribution-based method and the anchor-based method. The distribution-based method utilizes statistical analyses to determine the minimal important difference using the degree of test score variability. The main disadvantage with this method is that it does not take into account whether the clinician or patient feels that change is clinically meaningful. The anchor-based estimation takes into account a patient-related anchor such as the global rating of change scale to determine if the patient is clinically changed. Future studies need to determine whether the cutoff values developed using the distribution-based methods remain stable when applying the anchor-based methods and demonstrate a change that is clinically meaningful.

Higher PFIT-s scores (better function) were shown to be predictive of discharge to home on both awakening and ICU discharge time points. Higher FSS-ICU and IMS scores were predictive of discharge to home only at ICU discharge. The differences in the predictive validity of the functional outcomes at the two time points may relate to differences in the individual constructs measured within each measure. The PFIT-s involves evaluation of peripheral muscle strength (shoulder flexion and knee extension); sit to stand assistance and marching in place cadence. In contrast the IMS and FSS-ICU examine a hierarchical level of dependence/assistance required to perform functional tasks such as bed mobility, sitting, standing and walking. Physical function is a complex entity to measure and can encompass a range of different constructs. Therefore, in the future it is important that within functional tests we consider what the individual constructs of a functional test are able to tell us about a patient's future trajectory of recovery and the prediction of discharge to home and resumption of family, societal and community roles.

### The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies [^5c9e4d8f]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Participants in our sample performed a median of 2 (ICU discharge) and 6 (hospital discharge) sit-to-stand repetitions in 30 s. Community-dwelling patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed an average of 13 sit-to-stand repetitions following pulmonary rehabilitation, and those with moderate–severe disease completed 10.8 repetitions. Our data were comparable to the average of 5 repetitions performed by male veterans with an average age of 91 years, using the modified STS (mSTS). This level of disability lends itself to considering use of a mSTS, which is used with older adults and allows participants to use chair arm rests to perform the test. Our data suggest the ICU survivor population is closer to the geriatric population in physical function at discharge with two potential implications: A mSTS may be best suited and secondly, that MCIDs would be better extrapolated from the geriatric population. While the inability to perform a STS is predictive of falls which is common across all forms of the test, a difference of 1 mSTS repetition has an odds ratio of 0.75 for decreasing falls risk, and a cutoff of 7 repetitions corresponds to significant decreases in falls risk. The MDC 90 of the mSTS is 0.7, indicating that a change of 1 or greater is a change beyond that which can be attributed to measurement error. Further, in our cohort of participants, we identified an MDC 90 of 1.19, representing 1 repetition clinically. Based on these data and our MDC 90 results, our findings of a median difference score between ICU and hospital discharge of 3 (1, 6) indicate a true change in physical function and is likely functionally meaningful for patients.

### Minimum clinically important difference in 30-s sit-to-stand test after pulmonary rehabilitation in subjects with COPD [^26924314]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The sit-to-stand (STS) test is a feasible tool for measuring peripheral muscle strength of the lower limbs. There is evidence of increasing use of STS tests in patients with COPD. We sought to evaluate in subjects with COPD the minimum clinically important difference in 30-s STS test after pulmonary rehabilitation.

Methods

Stable COPD subjects undergoing a 30-s STS test and a 6-min walk test (6MWT) before and after pulmonary rehabilitation were included. Responsiveness to pulmonary rehabilitation was determined by the change in 30-s STS test results (Δ 30-s STS) before and after pulmonary rehabilitation. The minimum clinically important difference was evaluated using an anchor-based method.

Results

96 subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD were included. At baseline, 30-s STS test results were significantly related to distance covered in a 6MWT (6MWD) (r = 0.65, P < .001), FVC (r = 0.46, P < .001), P aCO2 (r = -0.42, P < .001), FEV 1 (r = 0.39, P < .001), and age (r = -0.31, P = 0.002). After pulmonary rehabilitation, a significant improvement in 30-s STS test results was observed (mean difference +2 repetitions, P < .001). The Δ30-s STS was positively related to Δ6MWD (r = 0.62, P < .001), transitional dyspnea index (r = 0.67, P < .001), and baseline residual volume (r = 0.27, P = 0.007). The receiver operating characteristic curves method identified a Δ 30-s STS cut-off of 2 repetitions as the best discriminating value (area under the curve: 0.892, P < .001) to identify the minimum clinically important difference for Δ6MWD (30 m). In a multivariate logistic regression model, baseline 30-s STS (odds ratio 2.63; 95% CI 1.09–6.35, P = 0.031) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (< 53% predicted) (odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.04–5.98, P = 0.041) predict the risk to have a Δ 30-s STS ≥ 2 repetitions.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that in stable subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD, the 30-s STS test was a sensitive tool to assess the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation. A Δ 30-s STS of ≥ 2 repetitions represented the minimum clinically important difference, which may be predicted by the baseline ability in the 30-s STS test and lung function in terms of diffusing lung capacity (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT03627624).

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^0e8be104]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Activity limitations — 5-Times Sit-to-Stand Test (5TSS) is a performance-based mobility measure at the activity level conducted with a straight-backed chair (against a wall), timing the ability to stand up and sit down 5 times with arms folded across the chest; it is limited to higher-functioning patients because upper extremity use is not permitted.

### The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies [^6528a0a0]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Surviving critical illness to hospital discharge is only the beginning of the journey for patients leaving intensive care. Many patients will experience post-intensive care syndrome, with impaired health-related quality of life for ≥ 5 years. Muscle wasting is a major driver for functional disability, with rates of loss of 2–3%/day during critical illness. Despite extensive research and high-quality trials into physical rehabilitation strategies, there are no consistent results demonstrating benefit for patients, despite level 1 evidence in other clinical settings. One explanation could be the range of primary outcome measures chosen for rehabilitation trials.

The increasing focus on functional measures as primary outcomes for multicenter trials of physical, nutritional, and metabolic interventions within critical care has led to an increasing number of Core Outcomes Sets. While such standardization is important, the clinimetric properties of these outcomes are likely to influence trial results. Single and composite measures currently used in the intensive care unit (ICU) demonstrate both floor (≥ 15% of participants with a minimum score) and ceiling effects (≥ 15% of participants with a maximum score). For example, the 6-min walk test and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) have floor effects at ICU discharge and the Physical Function in ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s) has ceiling effects at hospital discharge. These measurement limitations could impair our ability to assess intervention effects.

### Many faces of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID): a literature review and directions for future research [^79423f53]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for an instrument is a much sought after, but elusive figure. In this review we will highlight new findings in this area, including taxonomy of MCID, methods used to ascertain MCID, the perspective taken for evaluating importance, and other sources of variation for MCID values. In the end we believe the MCID will be a context-specific value rather than a fixed number. The review highlights the need to do methodological research in this area, especially concurrent comparisons between approaches, or across different patient groups. There are many faces to the MCID, it is not a simple concept, nor simple to calculate.

### The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies [^ed4abf1a]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The 30 s STS is relevant to patient function, has good clinimetric and statistical properties, and can be used across the continuum of recovery post-ICU in clinical practice and research. The 30 s STS could be used to assess strength and function at ICU and hospital discharge in moderate to severely ill participants in future studies of physical, nutritional, or metabolic interventions. Until we develop normative values for critically ill patients, our study can inform normative values for ICU survivors and help clinicians contextualize patients' recovery.

### Group exercise can improve participants' mobility in an outpatient rehabilitation setting: a randomized controlled trial [^7c3244cf]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the effects of group exercise on mobility and strength.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Two public hospital outpatient rehabilitation services.

Participants

One hundred and seventy-three people (mean age 74.9 years, SD 10.8) with impaired mobility were randomized and 159 people (92%) completed the trial.

Interventions

Five-week, twice-weekly; circuit-style' group exercise programme run by a physiotherapist (n = 85) and a no-intervention waiting list control group (n = 88).

Main Outcome Measures

Three aspects of mobility: balance while standing and stepping (Step Test, semi-tandem and tandem stance times); sit-to-stand ability (rate and minimum height) and gait (6-metre and 6-minute walk tests). Lower limb muscle strength (knee flexion and extension).

Results

At retest, exercise participants had improved significantly more than their control counterparts on measures of balance while stepping, sit to stand and gait. Exercise participants averaged 1.6 more steps on the 15-second Step Test (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5 to 2.8, P = 0.005), walked an average of 0.12 m/s faster (95% CI 0.05 to 0.2, P = 0.002) and took 2.5 fewer steps in 6 metres (95% CI -4.2 to -0.8, P = 0.004). Exercise participants also averaged 0.04 more sit-to-stands/second, (95% CI 0.003 to 0.08, P = 0.037) and walked an average of 30.9 metres further in 6 minutes (95% CI 9.4 to 52.4, P = 0.005). There were no clinically important or statistically significant between-group differences at retest for the measures of strength (knee extension and flexion), balance while standing or minimal sit-to-stand height.

Conclusion

This short-duration circuit class programme improved mobility, but not strength.

### Feasibility of performance-based and self-reported outcomes in self-managed falls prevention exercise interventions for independent older adults living in the community [^7d428502]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Feasibility of the outcome measures

Median values, interquartile ranges and effect sizes are presented in Table 2. In the balance test, from the SPPB, 70% of the participants managed the highest possible score (level 4) indicating an evident ceiling effect. The falls-efficacy questionnaires ABC and Icon-FES also indicated ceiling effects. The median value for ABC total score was 84 out of a maximum of 100 points and 25% reached scores over 89.5 points. For Icon-FES the median score at pre-assessment was 47 and 25% scored below 40.5 points with 30 being the best score out of 120 possible. The SPPB total score was in the higher range with a median score of 9 and 25% scoring above 10 points of 12 at pre-assessment. No ceiling or floor effects were indicated for the LLFDI-FC. For gait speed and chair stands, ceiling effects are not obtainable as they are a timed measure.

### Effect of preoperative home-based exercise training on quality of life after lung cancer surgery: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^f8afeed5]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Global QoL Scale

A significant group × time interaction was found in global QoL (F 2,38 = 6.571; p = 0.004; Fig. 3 A). Significant and clinically relevant differences between groups were found in global QoL before surgery (mean difference, 13.5 points; 95% CI, 2.4–24.6 points; p = 0.019) and 1 month after surgery (mean difference, 12.4 points; 95% CI, 1.3–23.4 points; p = 0.029), favoring PHET. Compared with baseline, 6 patients (30%) in the PHET group and 15 patients (71.4%) in the CG reported clinical deterioration in global QoL (p = 0.013; Fig. 4).

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^218a0e71]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Home-based and community-based exercise training — In COPD, an equivalence study comparing appropriately resourced home- versus outpatient exercise training after a 4-week educational program found important outcomes equivalent for both groups, with a lower than anticipated 6MWT response but equivalent and meaningful improvements in cycle endurance time. A randomized prospective home-based program including individuals with severe COPD who used long-term supplemental oxygen enrolled 50 individuals and confirmed efficacy and safety. A 12-week home exercise program delivered via a user-friendly computer system for five or more days per week in 25 clinically stable patients produced significant improvements in exercise performance, arm-lift and sit-to-stand repetitions, and health status scores. Regarding outpatient delivery, there is no strong evidence to suggest any difference in outcome between hospital-based and non–hospital-based programs for individuals with moderate to severe COPD.

### The test-retest reliability and minimal clinically important difference of the dubousset functional test and its correlation with rolland morris disability questionnaire in chronic non-specific low back pain [^774daa56]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study examines the test-retest reliability, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and its correlation with the Rolland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) of the Dubousset Functional Test (DFT) in evaluating the functional capacity and dynamic balance of patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (cnsLBP).

Methods

Seventy-five patients with cnsLBP aged 18 years and over were included. The Five-Repetition Sit-To-Stand Test (5R-STS), the subcomponents of the DFT (the Up and Walk Test, the Steps Test, the Down and Sitting Test, and the Dual-Tasking Test) were administered to the patients. Patients were rested for 1 h, and the DFT was applied again. Pain level was evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale before the tests started and after the tests were completed. Self-report function assessment was made using the RMDQ.

Results

The test-retest reliability of the subcomponents of the DFT was excellent. The ICCs were: 0.91, 0.86, 0.89, and 0.89, respectively. The standard measurement errors of the subcomponents of the DFT were 0.32, 0.12, 0.14, and 0.25, respectively. The subcomponents of the DFT were highly correlated with the RMDQ and 5R-STS with the correlation coefficients of 0,83, 0,83, 0,79, 0,83 and 0,81, 0,75, 0,73, and 0,82, respectively (p < 0.01). The MCIDs of the subcomponents were 0,60, 0,23, 0,27, and 0,48, respectively.

Conclusion

The DFT is reliable in evaluating patients' functional capacity and dynamic balance with cnsLBP without causing discomfort. It is simple, quick, and simultaneously assesses multiple areas contributing to spinal alignment, muscle integrity, and balance.

### Short physical performance battery: response to pulmonary rehabilitation and minimal important difference estimates in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^90ea60c4]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the response to a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program and minimal important differences (MIDs) for the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) subtests and SPPB summary score in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Design

Retrospective analysis using distribution- and anchor-based methods.

Setting

PR center in the Netherlands including a comprehensive 40-session 8-week inpatient or 14-week outpatient program.

Participants

A total of 632 patients with COPD (age, 65 ± 8y; 50% male; forced expiratory volume in the first second = 43% [interquartile range, 30%-60%] predicted).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measure

Baseline and post-PR results of the SPPB, consisting of 3 balance standing tests, 4-meter gait speed (4MGS), and 5-repetition sit-to-stand (5STS). The chosen anchors were the 6-Minute Walk Test and COPD Assessment Test. Patients were stratified according to their SPPB summary scores into low-performance, moderate-performance, and high-performance groups.

Results

5STS (∆ = -1.14 [-4.20 to -0.93]s) and SPPB summary score (∆ = 1 [0–2] points) improved after PR in patients with COPD. In patients with a low performance at baseline, balance tandem and 4MGS significantly increased as well. Based on distribution-based calculations, the MID estimates ranged between 2.19 and 6.33 seconds for 5STS and 0.83 to 0.96 points for SPPB summary score.

Conclusions

The 5STS and SPPB summary score are both responsive to PR in patients with COPD. The balance tandem test and 4MGS are only responsive to PR in patients with COPD with a low performance at baseline. Based on distribution-based calculations, an MID estimate of 1 point for the SPPB summary score is recommended in patients with COPD. Future research is needed to confirm MID estimates for SPPB in different centers.

STS assistance

Of 387 potentially eligible participants alive at ICU discharge, 327 (84.5%) had a completed assessment (Fig. 1). The median STS assistance PFIT-s score was 2 (1, 3) representing assistance with one person, and we calculated a ceiling effect in 45.9% (n = 150) (Fig. 2). Of 220 potentially eligible participants alive at hospital discharge, 102 (46.4%) had a completed assessment (Fig. 1). Measurement time points excluded from the parent study protocol accounted for 88 (74.6%) missing assessments (Additional file 1: Fig. 1). The median STS assistance PFIT-s score at hospital discharge was 3 (3, 3) representing no assistance, and a ceiling effect occurred in 77.5% (n = 79) (Fig. 2). In 99 participants with paired data, the median difference score between ICU and hospital discharge was 1 (0, 2) (Fig. 2; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3).

30 s STS

Of 90 potentially eligible participants alive at ICU discharge, 80 (88.9%) had a completed assessment (Fig. 1) with a median 30 s STS score of 2 (1, 5) repetitions, and a floor effect occurred in 15.0% (n = 12) (Fig. 2). The median (IQR) time to 30 s STS assessment was 1 day (0, 3) after ICU discharge. Thirty-six participants (45%) used their arms during the test. Of 82 potentially eligible participants alive at hospital discharge, 58 (70.7%) had a completed assessment, with a median 30 s STS score of 6 (3, 9) repetitions (Fig. 1). The median (IQR) time to 30 s STS assessment was 1 day (0, 3) before hospital discharge. Thirty-three participants (57%) used their arms during the test. We did not observe a floor or ceiling effect (Fig. 2). In 54 participants with paired data, the median difference score between ICU and hospital discharge was 3 (1, 6) (n = 54; Fig. 2; p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). The SEM was 0.51, and the MDC 90 was 1.19 STS repetition (Additional file 1: Table 3). Sensitivity analyses are included in Additional file 1: Table 4.

Patients were potentially eligible for an assessment if they were enrolled in an included trial and it was part of the trial protocol to complete an outcome measure assessment at that time point. The number of potentially eligible patients for knee extension and STS assistance is lower at hospital discharge because these outcome measures were not performed at this time point in the EXERCISE trial.

### Deficits in functional performance and gait one year after total knee arthroplasty despite improved self-reported function [^98a9a6ba]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

The Five Times Sit-to-Stand (5STS) test is a timed test where the participant is asked to rise from a seated position to a standing position five times as quickly as possible. Performance on this test is associated with quadriceps strength and functional performance up to 6 months after TKA in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The test shows excellent relative and absolute reliability in older adults (ICC 0.95, SEM 0.9 s). The test was performed twice, timed to a hundredth of a second, and the best (lowest) value was used in the analysis. To determine post-operative improvement in objectively measured function, the 5STS was used as it is a method easily applicable in clinical practice. Patients with knee osteoarthritis were grouped and compared based on their 5STS results according to the established minimally detectable change (MDC) of 2.5 s in 5STS performance. Patients with a reduction in time equal to or greater than 2.5 s were considered to have a "Good 5STS outcome", and those with a reduction of less than 2.5 s or an increase in time were considered to have a "Bad 5STS outcome".

### Home physical therapy versus telerehabilitation in improving motor function and quality of life in Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled trial [^8bdd770a]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The baseline and outcome measures were assessed by a rater who was not involved in either the allocation or implementation of the intervention. Measurements were taken in the clinical setting to standardize the assessment. At baseline, individuals were weighed, and their BMI (Body Mass Index) and clinical characteristics were recorded via clinical interviews and medical history. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the motor section score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS3). The secondary outcomes included between-group differences in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up-and-Go test (TUG), Five Times Sit-to-Stand test (FTSST), Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ), gait cycle parameters, muscle strength, and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) scores. All tests were performed in a standardized state.

Primary outcome

Motor examination

The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), well validated clinical rating scale, is widely regarded as the "gold standard" for assessing the severity of patients' symptoms in PD patients. The UPDRS3 comprises 18 items designed to evaluate the severity of motor symptoms associated with PD.

Secondary outcomes

Balance function

The 14-item Berg Balance Scale is commonly utilized to assess the extent of postural instability during both static and functional mobility tasks, as well as to predict the risk of falling. For PwPD, the minimal clinically important difference for the BBS has been reported to be approximately 4 to 6 points.

Risk of fall

The TUG and FTSST are objective measurement tools that can be used to predict the risk of falling and functional performance. During the TUG, participants stood up from a chair, walked 3 m at their usual safe walking speed, turned around, and returned to a seated position. A proposed cut-off score of 11.5 s was suggested for discriminating between PwPD who did and did not fall. In the FTSST, participants rose from a chair and returned to the seated position as quickly as possible for five repetitions, with their arms folded across their chests during the test. Patients could rest for one minute before and after the test to ensure that they were in their optimal state. The proposed cut-off score for discrimination between PwPD who did and did not fall was 16.0 s.

### A phase 2 study of a longitudinal multidimensional rehabilitation program for allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation patients [^a8930737]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Secondary clinical outcomes

Physical functioning (primary outcome) was measured on the SF-36 using the subscales of physical functioning and role limitations due to physical health. Treatment effects exceed the minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) reported at 3 to 5 points for the SF-36. For the physical functioning subscale, moderate effects were seen at T2 (effect size [ES], 0.54; 95% CI, –0.05 to 1.13), and treatment effects of 14.1 points were observed. Small effects were seen at T3 (ES, 0.25; 95% CI, –0.37 to 0.88), and treatment effects reach 6.64 points. The subscale of role limitations due to physical health problems showed an increase in effect size from T2 (ES, 0.20; 95% CI, –0.40 to 0.80) to T3 (ES, 0.46; 95% CI, –0.17 to 1.09). Treatment effects at these time points also exceeded the MCIDs at 8.13 (T2) and 18.5 (T3). The physiological data suggested similar trends. Large effect sizes were observed as measured by the 30-second sit-to-stand test (30s-STS) at both T2 (ES, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.31–1.28) and T3 (ES, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.20–1.21), and treatment effects exceeded the MCIDs. A summary of the treatment effects and effect sizes is shown in Figure 3. Table 5 reports all effect sizes and treatment effects.

Figure 3.
Summary of the treatment effect and effect sizes. This plot summarizes the estimated effect sizes for each outcome at admission, discharge, and follow-up. The color of the point corresponds to the level of statistical significance of the treatment effect with no controls for multiple testing. Positive effect sizes indicate that, given equal baseline values, we would expect a better outcome value in the intervention group. ns, not significant.

Table 5.
Outcome effect sizes and treatment effects at different time points

A difference was observed between groups at baseline (lower in INT) in many outcomes. Greater positive effects were reported at T2 (discharge) than at T3 (3-month follow-up) in many outcomes favoring the INT group. Changes over time suggest a more stable transplant journey for INT vs CON (supplemental Figure 2).

### The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies [^e9f973ca]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With ICU mortality rates decreasing, it is increasingly important to identify interventions to minimize functional impairments and improve outcomes for survivors. Simultaneously, we must identify robust patient-centered functional outcomes for our trials. Our objective was to investigate the clinimetric properties of a progression of three outcome measures, from strength to function.

Methods

Adults (≥ 18 years) enrolled in five international ICU rehabilitation studies. Participants required ICU admission were mechanically ventilated and previously independent. Outcomes included two components of the Physical Function in ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s): knee extensor strength and assistance required to move from sit to stand (STS); the 30-s STS (30 s STS) test was the third outcome. We analyzed survivors at ICU and hospital discharge. We report participant demographics, baseline characteristics, and outcome data using descriptive statistics. Floor effects represented ≥ 15% of participants with minimum score and ceiling effects ≥ 15% with maximum score. We calculated the overall group difference score (hospital discharge score minus ICU discharge) for participants with paired assessments.

Results

Of 451 participants, most were male (n = 278, 61.6%) with a median age between 60 and 66 years, a mean APACHE II score between 19 and 24, a median duration of mechanical ventilation between 4 and 8 days, ICU length of stay (LOS) between 7 and 11 days, and hospital LOS between 22 and 31 days. For knee extension, we observed a ceiling effect in 48.5% (160/330) of participants at ICU discharge and in 74.7% (115/154) at hospital discharge; the median [1st, 3rd quartile] PFIT-s difference score (n = 139) was 0 [0,1] (p < 0.05). For STS assistance, we observed a ceiling effect in 45.9% (150/327) at ICU discharge and in 77.5% (79/102) at hospital discharge; the median PFIT-s difference score (n = 87) was 1 [0, 2] (p < 0.05). For 30 s STS, we observed a floor effect in 15.0% (12/80) at ICU discharge but did not observe a floor or ceiling effect at hospital discharge. The median 30 s STS difference score (n = 54) was 3 [1, 6] (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Among three progressive outcome measures evaluated in this study, the 30 s STS test appears to have the most favorable clinimetric properties to assess function at ICU and hospital discharge in moderate to severely ill participants.

### The five-repetition sit-to-stand test: evaluation of a simple and objective tool for the assessment of degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine [^92c15214]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Recently, objective functional tests have generated interest since they can supplement an objective dimension to clinical assessment. The five-repetition sit-to-stand (5R-STS) test is a quick and objective tool that tests movements frequently used in everyday life. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the 5R-STS test in patients with degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine.

Methods

Patients and healthy volunteers completed the standardized 5R-STS, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS) for back and leg pain, and EQ-5D for health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To assess convergent validity, the 5R-STS test times were correlated with these questionnaires.

Results

Overall, 157 patients and 80 volunteers were enrolled. Direct correlation with RMDQ (r = 0.49), ODI (r = 0.44), and VAS for back pain (r = 0.31) and indirect correlation with the EQ-5D index (r = -0.41) were observed (p < 0.001). The 5R-STS test showed no correlation with VAS for leg pain and EQ-5D VAS (p > 0.05). In 119 individuals, the 5R-STS test demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98. The upper limit of normal, distinguishing patients with and without objective functional impairment, was identified as 10.35 seconds. A severity stratification classified patients with test times of 10.5–15.2, 15.3–22.0, or greater than 22.0 seconds as having mild, moderate, or severe functional impairment, respectively.

Conclusions

The 5R-STS test is a simple and effective tool to describe objective functional impairment. A patient able to perform the test in 10.4 seconds can be considered to have no relevant objective functional impairment. Clinical trial registration no.: NCT03303300 (clinicaltrials.gov).

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^c4b125d4]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

5‑Times Sit‑to‑Stand (5TSS) test — older adults with hip fracture: The 5TSS test is a mobility measure that tests the ability to perform transfers at the activity level. Interrater reliability between 3 and 12 weeks after fracture: ICC = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.93) and test‑retest reliability between 3 and 12 weeks after fracture: ICC = 0.91 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.96). Correlations with other scales were nonsignificant (r = 0.15–0.40). Sensitivity/responsiveness showed that effect sizes ranged from 0.74 to 1.12, and area under the curve (AUC), using the EuroQol‑5 dimensions scale (EQ‑5D) as the reference, was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.75). Floor effects are highlighted by more than 88% of patients not able to rise from a chair in the acute setting after hip fracture surgery. Moderate evidence, based on level II evidence, was found for the 5TSS, and because 90% of hip fractures are associated with a fall, fall‑risk assessment is emphasized. Physical therapists should conduct and document the 5TSS or 30‑second sit‑to‑stand test in postacute inpatient, home, and outpatient settings to measure mobility and fall risk.

### Responsiveness and meaningful improvement of mobility measures following MS rehabilitation [^e7b81722]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine responsiveness of functional mobility measures, and provide reference values for clinically meaningful improvements, according to disability level, in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) in response to physical rehabilitation.

Methods

Thirteen mobility measures (clinician- and patient-reported) were assessed before and after rehabilitation in 191 pwMS from 17 international centers (European and United States). Combined anchor- and distribution-based methods were used. A global rating of change scale, from patients' and therapists' perspective, served as external criteria when determining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the minimally important change (MIC), and the smallest real change (SRC). Patients were stratified into 2 subgroups based on disability level (Expanded Disability Status Scale score ≤ 4 [n = 72], > 4 [n = 119]).

Results

The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, physical subscale of the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (especially for the mildly disabled pwMS), Rivermead Mobility Index, and 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (especially for the moderately to severely disabled pwMS) were the most sensitive measures in detecting improvements in mobility. Findings were determined once the AUC (95% confidence interval) was above 0.5, MIC was greater than SRC, and results were comparable from the patient and therapist perspective.

Conclusions

Responsiveness, clinically meaningful improvement, and real changes of frequently used mobility measures were calculated, showing great heterogeneity, and were dependent on disability level in pwMS.

### Influence of a multicomponent exercise intervention on fear of falling and gait parameters in community-dwelling older adults: a prospective study [^fad1d027]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Changes after the intervention for the total cohort

Changes in gait parameters and gait quality perception

First, we observed a time effect for the locomotion SarQoL score (p < .001) and for all spatial parameters that improved significantly after the multicomponent exercise intervention (p < .05). No time effect was observed for the temporal gait parameters. Nevertheless, we observed a tendency towards improved stride variability (p = .065) (Table 2). Moreover, the locomotion SarQol score exceed the smallest detectable change for group of 0.85 point (+ 4.56 points).

Changes in FES-I score and physical function

As shown in Table 2, a time effect was observed for the FES-I score that significantly decrease (p < .01) after the multicomponent exercise intervention. There is no minimal detectable change or minimal important change for FES-I score, however we found an effect size of −0.22 that is lower to the one found in a recent meta-analysis (effect size of −0.34). A time effect was also observed for all physical and functional parameters (SPPB score, 5-STS time, 6-m gait speed, TUG time, and 50-m gait speed) that improved significantly (p < .001). Moreover, SPPB score and 5-STS time reached a clinical meaningful difference (+ 1.18 points and − 3.05 s respectively). Finally, 6-meters gait speed was close to reach the clinical threshold of + 0.1 m/s (+ 0.09 m/s).

### Minimal clinically important difference for quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction following pulmonary rehabilitation in people with interstitial lung disease [^5a37b338]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Skeletal muscle loss has a devastating effect on daily lives of people with interstitial lung disease (ILD). Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves muscle strength; however, the lack of cut-off values to define clinical improvement limits the interpretability of the obtained gains.

Objective

To estimate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (QMVC) in people with ILD, assessed with hand-held dynamometry as an absolute value in kilogram-force (KgF) and as percentage of the predicted value (% pred), after PR in people with ILD.

Methods

A secondary analysis of data from three previous studies was conducted. Participants took part in a 12-week community-based PR programme. The MCIDs were computed using anchor- and distribution-based methods. Anchors explored were the 1-minute sit-to-stand (1-min STS) test, the 6-minute walking distance, handgrip strength, modified Medical Research Council questionnaire, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Subscale. The pooled MCIDs were computed using the weighted arithmetic mean (2/3 anchor and 1/3 distribution-based methods).

Results

Fifty-nine people with ILD (61% female, 66 ± 11years) were included in the analysis. The 1-min STS test was the only anchor fitting the criteria. There were significant improvements after PR in the QMVC (mean difference = 3.9 ± 8.2 KgF and median difference = 10.9 [1.6; 22.0] % pred, p < 0.001) and 1-min STS test (mean difference = 6.6 ± 7.1 repetitions, p < 0.001). The pooled MCIDs were 3.2 KgF and 10.6% pred.

Conclusion

An increase of at least 3.2 KgF or 10.6% pred for QMVC in people with ILD after PR represents clinically relevant improvements.

### Concurrent change in quadriceps strength and physical function over five years in the multicenter osteoarthritis study [^0d303aa0]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Quadriceps weakness, associated with functional limitations, is a target of treatment of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Limited data exist on the relationship between modest strength increases and improvements in function. The aim of this study was to evaluate concurrent change in strength and physical function over 5 years.

Methods

Among subjects from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study, we excluded those with knee replacement after baseline. A 3-category variable defined whether, at 5 years, knee extensor strength increased, decreased, or remained within 15% of baseline, a clinically important cut-off. The outcomes were the 5-times sit-to-stand test, 20-meter walk test, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) physical function score, and 3 individual physical functions from WOMAC: arising from a chair, going up stairs, and getting on/off toilet. Linear and logistic models, stratified by sex, evaluated associations between change in strength and change in physical function over 5 years. To compare weaker versus stronger women, we stratified analyses at 56 Nm baseline strength.

Results

Among 1,534 participants (60.6% women), 22% of men and 30% of women increased strength by at least 15% at 5 years. Compared with women whose strength did not change, women whose strength increased had improved chair stand performance (odds ratio 2.27 [95% confidence interval 1.56, 3.30]) but no improvement in other functions. In men, an increase in strength was not associated with significant improvement in physical function. Similar results were observed for a 20% or 30% increase.

Conclusion

Modest improvement in quadriceps strength was associated with improved chair stand performance in women but not in men. Most functions did not improve with an increase in strength, and targeted interventions may be required to improve functional status.

### Short-term efficacy of integrating the easy-flex device with inpatient rehabilitation in individuals with total knee arthroplasty: insights from a single-blind randomized controlled trial [^cdd78aad]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of Easy-Flex as an adjunct to standard inpatient rehabilitation on clinical and functional outcomes.

Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Outpatient clinic and research laboratory.

Participants

A total of 44 patients were randomized to the Easy-Flex Group (EFG) or Control Group (CG).

Interventions

A rehabilitation program averaging 50–60 minutes per day was implemented for the patients with CG. In the EFG, in addition to 30–40 minutes of exercise with the Easy-Flex, the rehabilitation program applied to the CG was integrated with reduced sets and repetitions, with an average duration of 20 minutes. All interventions were performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist during hospitalization. After discharge, both groups received the same home exercise program.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome is the flexion and extension range of motion (ROM). The secondary outcomes include the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test (5-TSST), 10-Meter Walking Test (10-MWT), Short Form (SF)-12v2, and Global Rating of Change scale.

Results

After 6 weeks, the overall group-by-time interaction for the 2 × 3 mixed-model analysis of variance was found to be significant for flexion ROM (P = 0.005), NPRS-rest (P = 0.04), NPRS-activity (P = 0.01), 10-MWT (P = 0.003), WOMAC (P = 0.021), and SF-12 physical component summary (PCS) (P = 0.032) in favor of EFG exercising with Easy-Flex in addition to standard rehabilitation. The between-group differences in favor of the EFG were -8.0° knee ROM, 1.35–1.5 points for pain intensity, and 0.12 m/s for gait speed. Furthermore, differences favoring EFG in NPRS-rest, 10-MWT speed, and SF-12 PCS were greater than the reported minimum clinically important difference.

Conclusions

Incorporating Easy-Flex into standard physical therapy can be a beneficial, safe, and effective approach in clinical practice, as patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty typically prioritize improving their quality of life by reducing pain and increasing ROM.

### Minimal clinically important difference: a review of outcome measure score interpretation [^8196dbb8]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Clinicians, researchers, and outcome stakeholders have the crucial, albeit difficult, task of quantifying when a person or group experiences important change or difference on any given outcome measure, often in response to a specific intervention. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) provides this quantified value of change/difference for a measure. There are many methods for MCID derivation, which can result in multiple values for the same measure. Thus, it is important for potential users of MCID values to be aware of the nuances of MCID development and cautions for interpreting values. This review outlines MCID-related definitions, methods, and guidelines.

### Functional outcomes in ICU-what should we be using?-an observational study [^9dc10e1b]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Procedure

Assessments were performed twice in the ICU for each patient: on awakening and ICU discharge. Day of awakening was defined as when the patient scored greater than three out of five on the De Jonghe comprehension criteria on two consecutive occasions within a 6-hour period. Between the two time points of testing (awakening and ICU discharge), patients received usual-care rehabilitation involving early mobility activities such as active exercises in bed, sitting on the edge of the bed, standing, marching, and walking. At each time point of testing, the participants completed the PFIT-s and a range of additional functional tests (FSS-ICU, IMS, SPPB). The Medical Research Council-Sum Score (MRC-SS) was assessed at awakening in order to determine the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) within the population studied. The order of testing varied, and was not controlled within this study. In order to minimize fatigue as an issue, all tests were completed within a 12-hour period, and participants were required to return to baseline based on clinical parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels before the next functional test was undertaken. Patients were stable and unchanged in the time between completing the PFIT-s and additional functional tests. All assessors were qualified physical therapists and had received standardized training in the outcome measures (PFIT-s, SPPB, FSS-ICU, IMS, MRC-SS) from one senior physical therapist. The same assessor (where possible) performed awakening and ICU discharge measures within the same patient.

Physical function in intensive care test scored

The PFIT-s is a battery outcome measure involving four components: sit to stand assistance, marching on the spot cadence, shoulder flexor and knee extensor strength. The PFIT-s scores range from 0 (able to perform strength testing only with a maximum score of 2 out of 5 for shoulder and knee) to 10 (performance without any difficulty). This tool has established validity, reliability and a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.5 points out of 10.

### High variation among clinical studies in the assessment of physical function after knee replacement: a systematic review [^d3b7437f]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Fifty-seven studies (31.5%) used at least one PBOM to analyse physical function. The most frequently used were the Timed-Up-and-Go test (TUG) (30 studies) and the six-minute-walk test (6MWT) (21 studies). Other PBOMs were used in less than 10% of the studies (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Distribution of performance-based outcome measures among the articles included in the review * TUG = Timed up and go test, 6MWT = 6-Minute Walk Test, SCT = Stair climb test, 30sCST = 30 s chair-stand test, SLS = single leg stance, WS = walking speed, 10MFWT = 10 m Fast Walk Test, SLRT = Straight Leg Raising Time, 40MFWT = 40 m Fast Walk Test, 5SST = 5-time sit to stand test, FR = Forward reach, Fo8WT = Figure of 8 walk test, WA = walking ability, PT = Proprioception tests, RT = Roomberg test, BBS = berg balance test.

Regarding IBOMs, ROM was used in 74 studies, whereas all the other IBOMs were used in less than 5% of the studies (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Distribution of impairment-based outcome measures among the articles included in the review

Some studies used more than one category of functional outcome, such as one PROM and one PBOM or IBOM or all three types of measure. Overall, 51 articles (28.2%) used one PROM and one PBOM, 79 articles (43.7%) used one PROM and one IBOM and only 31 papers (17.1%) adopted all three types of measure.

By analysing differences in the outcome measurement instruments used to assess physical function according to the main topic of the included studies (Table 1), we observed that post-operative rehabilitation-related studies adopted PBOMs more than surgery-related studies (68.9% and 12.2%, respectively).

Table 1
Comparison of outcome measures used per main topic of the trial

Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for functional outcomes was reported in only seven studies (3.9%).

### Reproducibility and validity of adapted clinical tests for the assessment of muscle strength in community-dwelling older adults living with Alzheimer's disease [^7d4b391c]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

5STS

Intra- and inter-rater reliability among all participants on the adapted 5STS test was moderate (ICC 3,1: 0.60 and 0.50). The same result was found considering the stages of AD, with the exception of inter-rater reliability in the Mild-AD group which was low (ICC 3,1: 0.46). Intra-rater SEM and MDC 95 among all participants were lower (3.59 and 8.33) compared to inter-rater values (4.02 and 9.32). Considering the stages of the disease, the Mild-AD group had lower intra-rater SEM% and MDC 95% (10.87% and 24.72%) and the Moderate-AD had lower inter-rater SEM% and MDC 95% (11.41% and 26.47%). The results of the reliability of the adapted tests are presented in Table 2.

### Effects of a physical therapist-driven individualized hybrid model of the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation on patient outcomes: a prospective single group, time-series design [^1a444eb6]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this prospective single group, time-series study was to determine the feasibility, adherence, and effectiveness of an individualized physical therapist (PT)-driven hybrid model of the exercise component of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) that uses a novel intensity-recovery progression protocol (IRPP) and cardiac testing template (CTT) to assess achieved heart rate (HR) intensity, HR recovery, and intensity-recovery total to guide treatment.

Methods

Assessment of a questionnaire, treadmill 6-min walk (6MW), 1-min sit-to-stand (1STS), 1-min step, and 1-min agility square tests were assessed on 100 participants. Compared to traditional CR the 36-visit 1:1 hybrid model was individualized using the IRPP program and CTT.

Results

Adherence was 35% (timely) and 44% (overall) completion. The per-protocol analysis (PPA) and intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis suggest significant improvement in objective assessments baseline to visit 15 (PPA = 11 of 14) (ITT = 13 of 14), baseline to visit 30 (PPA = 12 of 14) (ITT = 12 of 14) and visit 15 to visit 30 (PPA = 9 of 14) (ITT = 10 of 14). Improvement beyond the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was 94.3% in the 6MW and 91.4% in the 1STS.

Conclusions

The PT-driven IRPP program was feasible in terms of adherence and safety, showing significant improvement in a majority of assessments. Analysis of HR using the CTT may help clinical decision making for progression in CR.

### Evaluating individual level change in physical function response following an exercise program for cancer survivors [^a8cca9bf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer survivors physical function response to exercise programs at the group level is well-established. However, to advance toward a more personalized approach in exercise oncology, a greater understanding of individual response is needed. This study utilized data from a well-established cancer-exercise program to evaluate the heterogeneity of physical function response and explore characteristics of participants who did vs. did not achieve a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).

Methods

Physical function measures (grip strength, 6-min walk test (6MWT), and sit-to-stand) were completed pre/post the 3-month program. Change scores for each participant and the proportion achieving the MCID for each physical function measure were calculated. The independent t-tests, Fisher's exact test, and decision tree analyses were used to explore differences in age, body mass index (BMI), treatment status, exercise session attendance, and baseline value between participants who achieved the MCID vs. those who did not.

Results

Participants (N = 250) were 55 ± 14 years old, majority female (69.2%), white (84.1%), and diagnosed with breast cancer (36.8%). Change in grip strength ranged from-42.1 to+47.0 lb, and 14.8% achieved the MCID. Change in 6MWT ranged from-151 to+252 m, and 59% achieved the MCID. Change in sit-to-stand ranged from-13 to+20 reps, and 63% achieved the MCID. Baseline grip strength, age, BMI, and exercise session attendance were related to achieving MCID.

Conclusions

Findings illustrate wide variability in the magnitude of cancer survivors' physical function response following an exercise program, and that a variety of factors predict response. Further investigation into the biological, behavioral, physiological, and genetic factors will inform tailoring of exercise interventions and programs to maximize the proportion of cancer survivors who can derive clinically meaningful benefits.

### Self-directed home-based neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) in patients with advanced cancer and poor performance status: a feasibility study [^b28eb9a9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Safety and feasibility were assessed following the intervention via reported adverse events and, participant recruitment and retention, and self-reported compliance with the intervention prescription. To assess the concurrent NMES protocol, objective tests of physical function and psychosocial outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention. Physical assessments included functional muscle strength and aerobic exercise capacity. Participant reported outcomes measured HR-QoL. Participant experience was determined following the intervention using semi-structured interviews.

Physical assessment

Functional muscle endurance

Lower limb muscle endurance was assessed using the 30-s sit-to-stand (30STS). The 30STS required patients to stand up from, and sit down on a 45 cm padded chair with no armrests as many times as possible in 30 s. Participants could use their hands to help them stand if required and were provided standardised verbal encouragement to continue to sit and stand throughout the test. Participants completed one trial. A change in 30STS score of ≥ 2 reps was considered the minimal clinically important difference (MCID).

Functional exercise capacity

Six-minute walk test

Functional exercise capacity was assessed using a six-minute walk test (6MWT) which is a simple walking test, often used as a surrogate measure of aerobic capacity. Participants were instructed to walk as far as possible in the 6-min, back and forth along a 20-m corridor, turning briskly around the markers at each end. Participants could slow down, stop and rest if necessary. Standardised moderate verbal encouragement was provided every 2 min by the same investigator to each patient. The distance walked in 6 min was recorded to the nearest meter. An improvement in distance of 30.5 m was considered the MCID.

Alternate functional test

Timed up and go test:

Functional exercise capacity was assessed using the timed up and go test (TUG). Patients were required to stand up from a 45 cm chair, walk 3 m, turn around, walk 3 m back and sit down again, walking at a preferred pace. The use of a walking aid was allowed. The test was completed twice, with the mean score being recorded. A change of 3 s in TUG time was considered the MCID (size of the relative change; 23%, mean TUG score: 14.3 s, (14.3 × 0.23 = 3.2)).

### Five times sit-to-stand test performance in Parkinson's disease [^f8a64b96]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To (1) determine intrarater and test-retest reliability of the Five times sit-to-stand test (FTSTS) in Parkinson's disease (PD), (2) characterize FTSTS performance in PD at different disease stages, (3) determine predictors of FTSTS performance in PD, and (4) determine the utility of the FTSTS for discriminating between fallers and nonfallers with PD, identifying an appropriate cutoff score to delineate between these groups.

Design

Measurement study of community-dwelling individuals with idiopathic PD.

Setting

A medical school laboratory.

Participants

Participants (N = 82) were recruited via population-based sampling. The final sample included 80 participants. Two were excluded because of exclusion criteria and an unrelated illness, respectively.

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

FTSTS time (seconds) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BEST), Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction-Quadriceps, 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), 6-minute walk, Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, and Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

Results

Interrater and test-retest reliability for the FTSTS were high (intraclass correlation coefficients: .99 and .76, respectively). Mean FTSTS performance was 20.25 ± 14.12 seconds. All mobility measures were significantly correlated with FTSTS (P < .01). The Mini-BEST and 9HPT together explained 53% of the variance in FTSTS. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined a cutoff of 16.0 seconds (sensitivity, .75; specificity, .68) for discriminating between fallers and nonfallers, with an area under the curve of .77.

Conclusions

The FTSTS is a quick, easily administered measure that is useful for gross determination of fall risk in individuals with PD.

### Can objective functional impairment in lumbar degenerative disease be reliably assessed at home using the five-repetition sit-to-stand test? A prospective study [^88e47986]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Objective functional tests like the five-repetition sit-to-stand test (5R-STS) can supplement an objective dimension to conventional patient-reported outcome measures. The reliability of unsupervised obtainment of 5R-STS performance is currently unknown.

Methods

We included patients with degenerative pathologies of the lumbar spine. Patients performed the 5R-STS during the initial clinical visit (supervised), as well as at home after instruction by a physiotherapist. At home, patients were first timed by a relative (unsupervised) and subsequently produced a video recording of themselves performing the 5R-STS for digital measurement (telesupervised). Two raters independently assessed the recordings.

Results

One hundred and twenty-one patients were recruited, of which 100 were eligible. Eighty-eight reported unsupervised results. Sixty-four returned recordings, of which 61 were ratable. Both unsupervised (r: 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.96, p < 0.001) and telesupervised (r: 0.90, 95% CI 0.83–0.94, p < 0.001) measurements demonstrated excellent correlation with clinical test times. Patients did not perform more slowly at home (p > 0.05). The interrater agreement for digital judgement of the telesupervised recording was excellent (ICC: 0.996, 95% CI 0.993–0.998, p < 0.001). We confirmed convergent validity with self-reported disability, back pain, and quality of life (all p < 0.05), but not with leg pain (p = 0.189).

Conclusions

Unsupervised at-home assessment using the 5R-STS is highly reliable. There does not appear to be a specific need for patients to return for a supervised 5R-STS follow-up. Rather, instructions can be provided, and the test performed and rated by a partner or family member at home. This is logistically and economically advantageous for patients, clinicians, and researchers.

### The sit-to-stand test as a patient-centered functional outcome for critical care research: a pooled analysis of five international rehabilitation studies [^1f9e5677]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

We compared 30 s STS scores for the age range of our cohort against the physical independence thresholds for older adults 60–64 years (females: 15 repetitions, males: 17) and normative values for those 60–69 years (females: 21, males: 24) (Fig. 4). One participant (1.3%) met thresholds for physical independence at ICU discharge, while two participants (3.5%) met thresholds at hospital discharge (Fig. 4). None achieved normative values at ICU discharge, and only one (1.7%) achieved 15 repetitions at hospital discharge (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Distribution of 30-Second STS scores at ICU and hospital discharge. We used thresholds to maintain physical independence for moderately active older adults 60–64 years (Rikli and Jones 2013), and normative values for community-dwelling adults aged 60–69 years (Tveter et al. 2014). Blue represents ICU discharge (n = 80), and orange represents hospital discharge (n = 58). The histogram can be interpreted using the Y-axis. Vertical bars represent the number of patients with each number of STS repetitions. The median scores were 2 (1, 5) STS repetitions at ICU discharge and 6 (3, 9) at hospital discharge. Box plots superimposed upon the histogram represent the median participant score and quartiles. The vertical, black line within the box plot represents the median, while the left side represents the 1st quartile, and the right side represents the 3rd quartile. Tails of the box plot represent the spread of scores, where the left tail represents the minimum, and the right represents the maximum. The horizontal tail lines correspond to the number of patients with the median STS repetitions at each time point

### The minimum clinically important difference: which direction to take [^59c17d74]. European Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Minimum clinically important difference: origin

The term MCID was first defined by Jaeschke et al. as 'the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest which patients perceive as beneficial and which would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects and excessive cost, a change in the patient's management' 9. Over time, a mix of various definitions has been adopted for the MCID concept, such as the minimal important difference, the minimally important change, the minimally detectable difference, the minimum detectable change etc. 10, 11. All these adaptations have a common denominator aiming to quantify changes that are considered clinically relevant.

Another related term is the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), which is defined as 'the value beyond which patients consider themselves well' 12. Tubach et al. state that the MCID deals with the concept of improvement (feeling better) whereas the PASS deals with the concept of wellbeing (feeling good), thus also being complementary to the MCID.

### Community-based exercises improve health status in pre-frail older adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^bf81fdcf]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and quality of trials assessment

The methodological quality of the trials was assessed using the 11-item PEDro scale. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies by evaluating the domains of population, treatment allocation, blinding, prognostic comparability, and analysis. Using a standardized extraction form, information on the characteristics of trial participants (age and gender), details of intervention (type of exercise, number of sessions per week, duration of session in minutes, and time span of exercise program in weeks), and outcome measures (pre- and post-intervention) were extracted from each included trial. The assessment methodological quality and extraction of data were performed and verified between 2 reviewers (H.J.L. and E.C.W.L). Differences between reviewers were resolved by agreement with another 2 independent reviewers (W.T.P. and N.D.J.).

The outcome measures included herein in our review were hand grip strength, functional lower limb strength measures such as timed 5-times sit-to-stand, 30 s chair rise test, and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) chair rise score, functional balance measures such as timed one-legged stance and SPPB balance score, gait speed such as 4- to 6-m walk test and SPPB gait score, Timed Up And Go test, SPPB overall score, functional exercise capacity such as 2-min walk test and 6-min walk test, cognitive measures such as Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Frontal Assessment Battery, and Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, quality of life such as EuroQoL-5D, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Quality of life visual analogue scale and Life Satisfaction score, and the number of participants with reversal of pre-frailty status.

The risk of bias was assessed with the use of revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. It evaluates risk of bias in 5 distinct domains, that is, the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result. If the outcome measures were reported for more than one side and/or multiple time points, then the pre- and post-intervention outcome measures which gave the worst mean difference (MD) were extracted. The outcome scores were approximated with the use of available median value, range, interquartile range, and standard error, whenever they were not presented in mean and/or standard deviation.

### Objective functional impairment in lumbar degenerative disease: concurrent validity of the baseline severity stratification for the five-repetition sit-to-stand test [^4fd3f2c8]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The five-repetition sit-to-stand (5R-STS) test provides a new dimension of clinical assessment by capturing objective functional impairment (OFI). Through the utilization of data from two prospective studies, the authors sought to evaluate the concurrent validity of the proposed 5R-STS baseline severity stratification (BSS) for OFI with the following levels based on time to completion in seconds: none, ≤ 10.4; mild, 10.5–15.2; moderate, 15.3–22.0; and severe, > 22.0 seconds.

Methods

Patients with degenerative diseases of the spine performed the 5R-STS test and completed visual analog scales (VASs) for back and leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), and EQ-5D questionnaires. The degree of OFI severity was assessed based on the previously proposed BSS, and its association with patient-reported scales was evaluated using ANOVA as well as crude and adjusted linear regression models.

Results

Our sample included 240 patients, of whom 101 exhibited no OFI, whereas 80, 34, and 25 were judged to have mild, moderate, and severe OFI, respectively. A higher baseline severity was strongly associated with loss of working ability (p < 0.001), as well as results of all patient-reported scales (p ≤ 0.001), with the exception of the VAS for leg pain (p = 0.556). Crude and adjusted regression analyses corroborated these findings, although only patients with moderate and severe OFI as judged by using the 5R-STS BSS demonstrated clinically relevant differences compared with patients without OFI.

Conclusions

The degree of OFI-based on the 5R-STS BSS-is strongly associated with measures of back pain, subjective functional impairment, and health-related quality of life. However, leg pain severity is not reflected within the dimension of OFI measured by the 5R-STS. The proposed BSS appears to be a concurrently valid and clinically relevant measure of OFI in patients with degenerative spinal pathologies.

### Reproducibility and validity of adapted clinical tests for the assessment of muscle strength in community-dwelling older adults living with Alzheimer's disease [^d438337c]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have impaired executive functions and can therefore have greater difficulty following the instructions of assessment tests. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the intra- and inter-rater reliability and criterion validity of the adapted Five-Times Sit-to-Stand (5STS), 30-Second Sit-to-Stand (30STS) and Calf-Rise Senior (CRS) tests for the assessment of lower limb muscle strength in older adults living with AD.

Methods

A methodological study was conducted. For the adaptation of the 5STS, 30STS and CRS tests, standardized verbal commands were added during the execution to assist the older adults in beginning and ending the tests (5STS and 30STS: "stand up" and "sit down"; CRS: "stand on your tip toes" and "now you can get down"). Reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1), standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable change (MDC 95). Criterion validity of the adapted tests was tested by the correlation with isokinetic measures of the knee and ankle using Spearman's correlation.

Results

Forty-two older adults living with AD were included (Mild-AD: 22; Moderate-AD: 20). Intra- and inter-rater reliability were moderate (ICC 3,1: 5STS: 0.60, 0.50; 30STS: 0.55; CRS: 0.68, 0.65), with the exception of inter-rater reliability of the 30STS test which was low (ICC 3,1: 0.32). Intra-rater SEM and MDC 95 (SEM: 5STS: 3.59, 8.33; 30STS: 0.85, 1.97; CRS: 1.37, 3.18) were lower compared to inter-rater values (MDC 95: 5STS: 4.02, 9.32; 30STS: 1.42, 3.29; CRS: 1.76, 4.08). The adapted tests correlated significantly with peak torque, average peak torque and total work of the knee (5STS: extensors and flexors [60°/s] [r: -0.33 to -0.46]; 30STS: flexors [180°/s] [r: 0.31 to 0.61]) and ankle (CRS: plantar flexors and dorsiflexors [total work] [30°/s] [r: 0.32 to 0.37]).

Conclusion

The adapted 5STS, 30STS and CRS tests demonstrated moderate reliability and correlated with maximum lower limb muscle strength and endurance in older adults living with AD.

### Prevention of exacerbations in patients with COPD and vitamin D deficiency through vitamin D supplementation (PRECOVID): a study protocol [^27dcc992]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Physical performance

During every visit (t = 0, t = 6 and t = 12), participants will perform physical performance tests.

In the 6-min walking test the participant is asked to walk as far as possible during a period of 6 min. The participant will walk up and down a hallway. The 6-min walking test is performed according to the ATS guidelines.

In the chair-stands-test the participant will be asked to fold his arms across his chest and to stand up from a sitting position and sit down five times as quickly as possible.

In the 3-meter walking test the participant is asked to walk three meters, turn around 180° and walk back.

In the tandem test the participant is asked to stand with the heel of one foot directly in front of, and touching the toes of, the other foot for at least 20 s with his eyes open and closed.

Muscle strength

Muscle strength will be assessed with measurement of hand grip strength. The participant is seated in a chair and holds the dynamometer in the hand, with the arm at right angles and the elbow by the side of the body. The handle of the dynamometer is adjusted if required. When ready, he squeezes the dynamometer with maximum isometric effort, which is maintained for about 5 s. No other body movement is allowed. This measurement will be performed three times with both hands.

Quality of life

Quality of life will be assessed by three questionnaires These will be completed at every study visit.

The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is designed to measure health impairment in patients with asthma and COPD and produces a symptoms score and an activity and impacts score.

The Short Form 12 health Survey (SF-12) is a multipurpose short-form generic measure of health status. It is a validated subset of the larger SF-36 and monitors health in general and in specific populations. These scores correlate highly with the SF-36 versions. The SF-12 has been previously used in patients with COPD.

The Clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) is a simple 10-item, health-related quality of life questionnaire with good psychometric properties. The questionnaire is responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation and a minimal clinically important difference has recently been defined.

### Feasibility of performance-based and self-reported outcomes in self-managed falls prevention exercise interventions for independent older adults living in the community [^5ee4a878]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection and outcome measures

At the introduction meeting, sociodemographic characteristics, access to technology, self-reported health, function, and mobility, as well as history of falls in the past year, was collected through a self-report questionnaire. One of the researchers was present in the room to answer questions when participants filled in the questionnaires. A physiotherapist blinded to group allocation, and previous results, performed all measurements of physical functioning at the pre- and post-assessment.

Performance-based outcome measurements

Functional performance was measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The SPPB is a valid, reliable and responsive instrument that comprises standing balance, gait speed over four meters, and Five times sit-to-stand test. A total score of 0–12 is formed from the sub-components, higher score indicate a better functional performance. Standing balance was assessed in three positions: feet together, semi tandem, and full tandem. Gait speed was timed at preferred gait speed over four meters. The test was repeated twice, and the fastest time was registered as test result. Preferred walking speed is a reliable and valid measurements to use for older adults. The 4-m gait speed has been found to predict disability almost as well as the total SPPB. The Five times sit-to-stand (5TSTS) is a timed performance of the participants' ability to sit and stand five times as quickly as possible from a chair with arms folded over the chest. The 5TSTS can be used to assess functional leg strength, and identify older adults with impaired balance and fall risk. The test showed good test-retest reliability ICC 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79–0.95.

The 30s Chair stand test (30s CST) was used to assess functional leg strength and endurance. During the assessment, the participant's ability to perform a maximum number of sit-to-stands with arms folded over the chest, in 30 s was counted. The number of correct stands was noted, if the last stand was more than halfway up it was also counted. The 30s CST has been found to have good test-retest reliability (intra-class coefficient R = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79–0.93) and concurrent validity with 1 RM leg-press among community-dwelling older adults (r = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.64–0.85.

### The 5-repetition sit-to-stand test as an outcome measure for pulmonary rehabilitation in subjects with asthma [^de6fdb7f]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (5STS) is valid and responsive in subjects with COPD, but there is a lack of information in subjects with asthma. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the 5STS as an outcome measure of pulmonary rehabilitation in subjects with asthma as compared to subjects with COPD.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective evaluation of subjects with asthma or COPD who underwent pulmonary rehabilitation. Both before and after in-patient pulmonary rehabilitation, subjects underwent the 5STS and the 6-min walk test; dyspnea was assessed with the Medical Research Council scale and the Barthel Index for dyspnea, and the burden of symptoms was assessed with the COPD Assessment Test.

Results

Of 475 patients admitted during the study period, 103 subjects with asthma and 108 with COPD were included. After pulmonary rehabilitation, the 5STS improved significantly in both populations (by a median value of -1.7 s [interquartile range -4.2 to -0.5] and -1.1 s [interquartile range -3.4 to 0.0] in subjects with asthma and COPD, respectively; P < .001 for both, P = 0.17 between groups) independent of body mass index, as did other outcome measures. The baseline 5STS correlated slightly but significantly with age, the 6-min walk test, and the Barthel Index for dyspnea in both populations, whereas it correlated significantly with the Medical Research Council scale only in subjects with asthma and correlated with COPD Assessment Test only in subjects with COPD. No significant correlations between changes in the 5STS and in other assessed outcome measures before and after pulmonary rehabilitation were observed in subjects with asthma, whereas changes in the 5STS correlated slightly but significantly only with changes in 6-min walk test in subjects with COPD.

Conclusions

The 5STS was a reliable outcome measure of pulmonary rehabilitation in subjects with asthma. It must be specifically assessed and may be included in the tools for assessment of effects of pulmonary rehabilitation also in these patients.

### A standard method for determining the minimal clinically important difference for rehabilitation measures [^f185d167]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is receiving increasing interest and importance in medical practice and research. The MCID is the smallest improvement in scores in the domain of interest that patients perceive as beneficial. In clinical trials, comparing the proportion of individuals between treatment and control groups who obtain a MCID may be more informative than comparisons of mean change between groups because a statistically significant mean difference does not necessarily represent a difference that is perceived as meaningful by treatment recipients. The MCID may also be useful in advancing personalized medicine by characterizing those who are most likely to benefit from a treatment. In clinical practice, the MCID can be used to identify if a participant is experiencing a meaningful change in status. A variety of methods have been used to determine the MCID with no clear agreement on the most appropriate approach. Two major sets of methods are either (1) distribution-based, that is, referencing the MCID to a measure of variability or effect size in the measure of interest or (2) anchor-based, that is, referencing the MCID to an external assessment of change in the condition, ability, or activity represented by the measure of interest. In prior literature, using multiple methods to "triangulate" on the value of the MCID has been proposed. In this commentary, we describe a systematic approach to triangulate on the MCID using both distribution-based and anchor-based methods. Adaptation of a systematic approach for obtaining the MCID in rehabilitation would facilitate communication and comparison of results among rehabilitation researchers and providers.

### A comparison of 3 methodological approaches to defining major clinically important improvement of 4 performance measures in patients with hip osteoarthritis [^9933c926]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Objectives

To establish the major clinically important improvement (MCII) of the timed up-and-go test (TUG), 40-meter self-paced walk test (40-m SPWT), 30-second chair stand (30 CST), and a 20-cm step test in patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing physiotherapy treatment. As a secondary aim, a comparison of methods was employed to evaluate the effect of method on the reported MCII.

Background

Minimal clinically important difference scores are commonly used by rehabilitation professionals to determine patient response following treatment. A gold standard for calculating MCII has yet to be determined, which has resulted in problems of interpretation due to varied results.

Methods

As part of a randomized controlled trial, 65 patients were randomized into a physiotherapy treatment group for hip OA, in which they completed 4 physical performance measures at baseline and 9 weeks. Upon completion of physiotherapy, patients assessed their response to treatment on a 15-point global rating of change scale (GRCS). MCII was estimated using 3 variations of an anchor-based method, based on the patient's opinion.

Results

A comparison of 3 methods resulted in the following change scores being best associated with our definition of MCII: a reduction equal to or greater than 0.8, 1.4, and 1.2 seconds for the TUG; an increase equal to or greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.2 m/s for the 40-m SPWT; an increase equal to or greater than 2.0, 2.6, and 2.1 repetitions for the 30 CST; an increase equal to or greater than 5.0, 12.8, and 16.4 steps for the 20-cm step test.

Conclusion

The variation in methods provided very different results. This illustrates the importance of comparing methodologies and reporting a range of values associated with the MCII, as such values vary, depending upon the methodology chosen.

### Minimum performance on clinical tests of physical function to predict walking 6, 000 steps / day in knee osteoarthritis: an observational study [^290efc4e]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Evidence of physical function difficulties, such as difficulty rising from a chair, may limit daily walking for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The purpose of this study was to identify minimum performance thresholds on clinical tests of physical function predictive to walking ≥ 6,000 steps/day. This benchmark is known to discriminate people with knee OA who develop functional limitation over time from those who do not.

Methods

Using data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, we quantified daily walking as average steps/day from an accelerometer (Actigraph GT1M) worn for ≥ 10 hours/day over 1 week. Physical function was quantified using 3 performance-based clinical tests: 5 times sit-to-stand test, walking speed (tested over 20 meters), and 400-meter walk test. To identify minimum performance thresholds for daily walking, we calculated physical function values corresponding to high specificity (80–95%) to predict walking ≥ 6,000 steps/day.

Results

Among 1,925 participants (mean ± SD age 65.1 ± 9.1 years, mean ± SD body mass index 28.4 ± 4.8 kg/m 2, and 55% female) with valid accelerometer data, 54.9% walked ≥ 6,000 steps/day. High specificity thresholds of physical function for walking ≥ 6,000 steps/day ranged 11.4–14.0 seconds on the 5 times sit-to-stand test, 1.13–1.26 meters/second for walking speed, or 315–349 seconds on the 400-meter walk test.

Conclusion

Not meeting these minimum performance thresholds on clinical tests of physical function may indicate inadequate physical ability to walk ≥ 6,000 steps/day for people with knee OA. Rehabilitation may be indicated to address underlying impairments limiting physical function.

### Deficits in functional performance and gait one year after total knee arthroplasty despite improved self-reported function [^41b1884b]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The current literature lacks sufficient information about improvements in gait patterns and function after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and whether patients return to full function. This study evaluated change in gait, performance-based function, and self-reported function 1 year after TKA in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and how these aspects interrelate.

Methods

A total of 28 patients (64% female) with knee osteoarthritis, with a mean age of 66 (± 7) years, and 25 age- and gender-matched controls participated in this prospective cohort study. Three-dimensional gait analysis generated comprehensive measures of kinematic and kinetic gait deviations, respectively. Participants completed the Five Times Sit-to-Stand (5STS) test, and the self-reported questionnaire Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), at baseline prior to surgery and 1 year after TKA.

Results

Kinetic gait deviations of both the operated and non-operated limb persisted in patients with knee osteoarthritis at 1 year after surgery, while kinematic gait patterns were comparable to controls. Performance on the 5STS and KOOS scores in patients with knee osteoarthritis improved significantly 1 year after surgery (effect size 0.5–1.5), but did not reach the level of controls. Ten patients with knee osteoarthritis (36%) exceeded the minimally detectable change on the 5STS.

Conclusion

Measures of overall gait patterns and the 5STS revealed improvements in function 1 year after TKA, but were not restored to the level of healthy controls. Based on change in 5STS performance, we identified patients with substantial improvements in gait patterns. Self-reported measures of function could not detect differences between patients improving in 5STS performance and those who did not. These findings highlight the use of the 5STS in clinical practice since improvement on this test seems to follow the reduction in gait pattern deviations.

### Free-living sit-to-stand characteristics as predictors of lower extremity functional decline among older adults [^769ab332]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome variable measured as change from baseline to follow-up

Lower extremity functioning was assessed in the participant's home using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at baseline and at follow-up. The SPPB comprised tests on standing balance, walking speed over a 3-m distance, and the 5 × STS. From the test results, we calculated the SPPB total score with a maximum of 12 points, where higher scores indicate better performance. Participants whose decline in SPPB total score was at least two points (substantial meaningful change) were classified into the group with a "decline in lower extremity functioning" over 4 yr of follow-up, and those with a decline of 1 or no change or improvement into the group, "no decline in lower extremity functioning", In the "decline in lower extremity functioning" group, there was an average decline in all components (subtests) of the SPPB test during the 4-yr follow-up (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, Comparison of SPPB components between physical functioning decline and nondecline groups).

### The clinical importance of changes in outcome scores after treatment for chronic low back pain [^09279761]. European Spine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

When measuring treatment effect in chronic low back pain with multi-item outcome instruments, it is necessary, both for clinical decision-making and research purposes, to understand the clinical importance of the outcome scores. The aims of the present study were three-fold. Firstly, it aimed to estimate the minimal clinically important difference of three multi-item outcome instruments (the Oswestry Disability Index, the General Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale) and of the visual analogue scale (VAS) of back pain. Secondly, it aimed to estimate the error of measurement of these instruments; and its third aim was to describe the clinical meaning of score change. The study population consisted of 289 patients treated surgically or non-surgically in a randomised controlled trial. The minimal clinically important difference was estimated with patient global assessment as the external criterion. It was compared with the standard error of measurement of the instruments. The individual items of the instruments were compared for score changes related to improvement and deterioration. The standard error of measurement of the Oswestry Disability Index, the General Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale was 4, 6 and 3 units, respectively. The 95% tolerance interval was 10, 16 and 8 units, respectively. The minimal clinically important difference was 10, 12 and 8–9 units, respectively, thus not significantly exceeding the tolerance interval. The minimal clinically important difference of VAS back pain was 18–19 units, well exceeding the 95% tolerance interval, which was 15 units. Improvement after treatment for chronic low back pain tends to occur to a greater extent in sleep disturbance, ability to do usual things and psychological irritability, but to a lesser extent in the ability to sit, stand and lift. We conclude that the VAS of back pain is responsive enough to detect the minimal clinically important difference, whereas the smallest acceptable score changes of the Oswestry Disability Index, the General Function Score and the Zung Depression Scale may require an increase to exceed the 95% tolerance interval when used for clinical decision making and for power calculation. Despite improvement after treatment, the ability to sit, stand and lift, remain notable problems.

### Effects of an exercise-based oncology rehabilitation program and age on strength and physical function in cancer survivors [^a570ab05]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cancer therapy diminishes strength and physical function in cancer survivors. Whether oncology rehabilitation (OR) exercise training following therapy can correct these deficits, and whether its effectiveness differs by age, is not clear. We examine the utility of a clinically based, 12-week, combined aerobic and resistance training intervention on muscle strength and physical function in two age groups of cancer survivors.

Methods

Strength and physical function measures were assessed in middle-aged (45 to 64 years) and older (≥ 65 years) patients following treatment for stage 0-III cancer before and after the OR training program.

Results

Older patients had lower physical function compared to middle-aged patients across a range of subjective and objective measures at baseline, and exercise improved all indices of physical function and strength in both age groups. Compared to the middle-aged individuals, older participants tended to have less improvement leg strength and the 5 time sit to stand (5TSTS) test as a result of OR. In models predicting post-intervention measures, older age contributed to less improvement in walking distance and power as well as the 5TSTS test.

Conclusion

Prior to beginning the OR exercise program, middle-aged patients had higher physical function compared to older patients. However, a 12-week aerobic and resistance training intervention improved physical function across both age groups, although older age did limit responsiveness in some physical function measures. The physical function and strength of middle-aged and older cancer survivors improve in response to an exercise-based OR program after cancer treatment.

### Effects of veverimer on serum bicarbonate and physical function in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease and metabolic acidosis: subgroup analysis from a randomized, controlled trial [^161e069a]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Improvement in the ability to conduct activities of daily living and to rise from a chair are important clinical and patient-centric outcomes. Loss of these abilities has important health, social and economic consequences because they can gauge whether a patient can continue to live independently. Prior studies showed that metabolic acidosis leads to bone loss and increased protein degradation; and correction of acidosis increases bone density and reduces protein degradation. Others have suggested that metabolic acidosis contributes to frailty, fractures and failure to thrive in patients with CKD. Our study provides evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD improves physical function. The observed effects on physical function in this study were both statistically and clinically significant. The observed improvement in patient-reported physical function on the KDQoL-PFD in the veverimer group (+11.4 points in the overall study population and +12.5 points in the diabetes subgroup) exceeded the minimal clinically important difference of 3–5 points for this subscale. Similarly, the improved physical performance on the repeated chair stand test (−4.3 s in the overall population and −4.1 s in the diabetes subgroup) exceeded the 1.7 s minimally reported difference for this instrument. Moreover, the chair stand time decrease of 4.3 s in the veverimer group between baseline and Week 52 was larger than the 3.4 s difference in mean expected performance between 80- to 89-year-olds and 60- to 69-year-olds (i.e. ∼20-year age difference). While this was not a mechanistic study, our findings of reduced limitations in physical functions, particularly those related to lower extremity strength, are consistent with the expected clinical manifestations of reduced muscle protein catabolism and bone loss.

### Minimally clinically important difference (MCID) is a low bar [^6aa24222]. Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients don't care about "statistical" significance. Patient-centered outcome measures focus on "clinical" significance and include minimal clinically important difference (MCID), patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and maximal outcome improvement (MOI). "Minimal" is a low bar. MCID neither addresses whether patients are satisfied nor whether they have derived a substantial benefit. MCID is commonly reported allowing comparison between studies, and MCID can be calculated retrospectively, so reporting MCID is acceptable. However, we also need to report PASS, SCB, and, in unique patients like high-level athletes, we may also need to report MOI to adjust for high pretreatment scores and a ceiling effect. Finally, threshold scores are patient-level metrics and must be reported as percentage of patients who meet the threshold, not reported as to whether, as a group, the mean score for the cohort meets the threshold or not (which is a common error).

On the 6 MW, subjects in the clinic arm walked somewhat farther with less effort on the Borg Effort test than those in the community arm (Table 1). On other measures, the two study arms differed little. No significant baseline differences appeared between 69 persons with and 42 persons without follow-up measures (Online Appendix B).

Minimal Clinical Important Differences

Distribution-based methods were applied to pretreatment data on all subjects to generate a DMD-specific estimate of the MCID for the following clinical endpoints:

6MWD: Based on the standard error of measurement [defined as baseline SD · √(1 − r) where r is test–retest reliability], the MCID for 6MWD in DMD is estimated to be 28.5 m (Table 6). Based on a definition of one-third of the standard deviation at baseline, the estimated MCID for 6MWD in DMD is 31.7 m (Table 6). These MCID values represent 8.0% and 8.9% of the mean baseline 6MWD.

### Cut-off of the one-minute sit-to-stand test to detect functional impairment in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^cfb0a85f]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is a widely used measure to assess functional status of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it requires a long hallway and might be time-consuming. Other simple measures might be useful as a first screening tool. We explored the predictive ability of the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-min STS) in discriminating people with COPD with or without functional impairment.

Methods

A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was performed. We determined a threshold for the 1-min STS to identify functional impairment based on different cut-offs of the 6MWT (300, 350, 400 and 450 m).

Results

A total of 135 people with COPD were included. Except for the < 450 m cut-off of the 6MWT, all other cut-offs identified 19.5 repetitions as the optimal cut-off point for the 1-min STS. All AUCs showed excellent discrimination (AUCs = 0.812–0.901). The best AUC (< 300 m cut-off) had an outstanding discrimination (0.901; 95%CI: 0.84–0.96; other AUCs 0.812–0.836) between people with or without functional impairment, with 86% specificity and 83% sensitivity.

Conclusion

A cut-off of 19.5 repetitions in the 1-min STS discriminates accurately people with COPD with a functional impairment. Future studies may validate our treatable trait candidate in other samples and investigate its utility in predicting other meaningful outcomes.

### Dance for people with chronic breathlessness: a transdisciplinary approach to intervention development [^ae4c28a3]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Data collection

The exercise instructor recorded attendance at each dance class. Demographic and anthropometric information including age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), oxygen and gait aid usage were recorded at visit 0 (baseline) and at visit 1 (10-week follow-up). Most of the participants had prior experience of dance, including ballroom, line dancing and ballet as well as movement practices such as Tai Chi and Taekwando. Exercise capacity, mobility, quadriceps strength, health status, mood and interoceptive awareness were assessed at baseline and after the 10-week programme.

The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a valid, reliable and responsive measure of functional exercise capacity. It was conducted according to international recommendationsand the total distance walked was recorded in metres. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the 6MWT in people with COPD is 25–35m.

The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test provides a timed measure of functional mobility. The test requires individuals to stand from a chair, walk 3 m at a comfortable pace and return to a sitting position. The time taken is recorded in seconds. A TUG value longer than 11 s has been shown to predict falls in people with COPD.

The 30-Second Sit to Stand Test (30-STS) requires participants to stand from a chair and sit fully, completing as many repetitions as possible in 30 s. It is a valid and reliable measure of quadriceps strength. The MCID has been quoted as ≥ 2 pre–post PR.

The COPD Assessment Tool (CAT) is an 8-item measure quantifying the impact of COPD symptoms on health status. Scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating a greater impact on health status. It has good psychometric properties and is responsive to PR and the MCID is estimated to be −2 points.

### Predicting 3-year incident mobility disability in middle-aged and older adults using physical performance tests [^0acbf3b2]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify a standard physical performance test, which can predict 3-year incident mobility disability independent of demographics.

Design

Longitudinal cohort study.

Setting

Population-based middle-aged and older adult cohort assessment performed at a local geriatric clinical center.

Participants

Community-living middle-aged and older persons (age, 50-85y) without baseline mobility disability (N = 622).

Interventions

Not applicable.

Main Outcome Measures

Mobility disability was ascertained at baseline and at 3-year follow-up using an established self-report method: self-reported inability to walk a quarter mile without resting or inability to walk up a flight of stairs unsupported. Physical performance tests included self-selected usual gait speed, time required to complete 5 times sit-to-stand (5TSTS), and 400-m brisk walking. Demographic variables age, sex, height, and weight were recorded.

Results

Overall, 13.5% participants reported 3-year incident mobility disability. Usual gait speed < 1.2m/s, requiring > 13.6 seconds to complete 5TSTS, and completing 400m at < 1.19m/s walking speed were highly predictive of future mobility disability independent of demographics.

Conclusions

Inability to complete 5TSTS in < 13.7 seconds can be a clinically convenient guideline for monitoring and for further assessment of middle-aged and older persons, in order to prevent or delay future mobility disability.

### Assessment of the minimum clinically important difference in the Timed Up and Go test after surgery for lumbar degenerative disc disease [^cb67da1b]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG Test) has previously been described as a reliable tool to evaluate objective functional impairment in patients with degenerative disc disease.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of the TUG Test.

Methods

The TUG Test (measured in seconds) was correlated with validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) of pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale for back and leg pain), functional impairment (Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Index), and health-related quality of life measures (Short Form-12 and EuroQol 5D). Three established methods were used to establish anchor-based MCID values using responders of the following PROs (Visual Analog Scale back and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index, Roland Morris Disability Index, EuroQol 5D index, and Short Form-12 Physical Component Summary) as anchors: (1) average change, (2) minimum detectable change, and (3) change difference approach.

Results

One hundred patients with a mean ± SD age of 56.2 ± 16.1 years, 57 (57%) male, 45 patients undergoing microdiscectomy, 35 undergoing lumbar decompression, and 20 undergoing fusion surgery were studied. The 3 MCID computation methods revealed a range of MCID values according to the PRO used from 0.9 s (Oswestry Disability Index based on the change difference approach) to 6.0 s (EuroQol 5D index based on the minimum detectable change approach), with a mean MCID of 3.4 s for all measured PROs.

Conclusion

The MCID for the TUG Test time is highly variable depending on the computation technique used. The average TUG Test MCID was 3.4 s using all 3 methods and all anchors.

### Physical performance tests have excellent reliability in frail and non-frail patients with prostate cancer [^b1f27be9]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our aim was to investigate the test-retest reliability of the 2-min walk test (2MWT), timed up and go test (TUG), and five times sit-to-stand test (FTSST) in prostate cancer (PC) patients.

Methods

This study was conducted with 73 patients who were classified into two groups as frail and non-frail determined by the Geriatric-8 questionnaire. Patients performed the 2MWT, TUG, and FTSST tests for two times. The test-retest reliability of the 2MWT, TUG, and FTSST was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The standard error of measurement (SEM 95) and minimal detectable change (MDC 95) values were calculated.

Results

All tests showed excellent test-retest reliability for both groups (ICC (2.1) > 0.90). The SEM 95 and MDC 95 values of 2MWT were 3.09, 8.57, and 3.15m, 8.73m for frail and non-frail groups. The SEM 95 and MDC 95 values of TUG for the frail group were 0.6 and 1.66 and 0.43 and 1.19 for the non-frail group, respectively. The SEM 95 and MDC 95 values of FTST for the frail group were 0.68 and 1.88 and for the non-frail group 0.86 and 2.38.

Conclusions

The 2MWT, TUG, and FTSST showed excellent reliability in frail and non-frail older adults with PC which can be used to assess physical performance.

### Norwegian reference values for the short physical performance battery (SPPB): the troms ø study [^1195e343]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The present study is the first to provide comprehensive, up-to-date normative values for SPPB measures in community-dwelling individuals aged at least 40 years and living in Norway. Up-to-date population-specific normative values are essential in enabling clinicians to better evaluate patient performance relative to that for the general population community-living older adults and determine the appropriate intervention/management. Because of ceiling effects, the SPPB has limitations in the assessment of physical functioning across the full spectrum of community-dwelling adults aged 40+ years that should be considered. Finally, we conclude that performance on the SPPB should be reported in terms of the total score, as well as the time to complete the repeated chair sit-to-stand test and the walking speed test. The present data may be used to interpret the results of studies evaluating and establishing appropriate treatment goals.

### Development of a reconditioning program for elderly abdominal surgery patients: the elder-friendly approaches to the surgical environment-BEdside reconditioning for functional improvemenTs (EASE-BE FIT) pilot study [^b32b1e96]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Data collection

Chart review was completed to determine age, sex, race, marital status, living situation prior to admission, type of surgery, postoperative physical and occupational therapy intervention, any occurrence of in-hospital falls, discharge status, and length of stay.

Participants completed a 30-s sit-to-stand (STS) test on postoperative day 2 (prior to receiving the BE FIT program for the BE FIT cohort) and again on the day of discharge. The STS test is a measurement used to assess functional lower extremity strength in older adults. Briefly, a participant rises to a full stand from being seated in a chair, without the use of their arms, and then returns back to the initial seated position. The number of full repetitions that are completed in 30 s is recorded. As all participants had recent abdominal incisions, participants were permitted to use their arms to assist them into a standing position if they felt necessary. More repetitions are indicative of better functional performance.

Six weeks after discharge, for those participants who returned for their scheduled follow-up with their surgeon, a Timed Up and Go (TUG) test was completed. The TUG test is a commonly used screening tool for falls risk. The participant is timed while they rise from a chair, walk 3 m at a comfortable and safe pace, turn and walk back to the chair, and sit down again. Faster time indicates a better functional performance.

Sample size

Sample size was calculated based on the few normative values currently published in scientific literature, along with the established minimal clinically important difference scores (2.6 stands in the STS and 3.5 s in the TUG). For a statistical significance of p = 0.05 and a power value of 0.90, the necessary value for the STS tests was based on the mean and standard deviation values normalized by Jones et al. on community-dwelling older adults, suggesting a minimum sample of 11. For the TUG, using mean and standard deviation scores normalized by Steffen et al. a sample size of 22 is suggested. We therefore attempted to enroll a minimum of 60 participants (30 in each group) to increase power and attempt to have equivalent distribution of baseline characteristics between groups.

### Randomized trial of chronic pain self-management program in the community or clinic for low-income primary care patients [^9395fb30]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In unadjusted analyses among subjects completing 6-month measures, performance on five of seven outcome measures improved significantly (Table 2). On the 5XSTS test, subjects in both arms completed the test faster at 6 months, but only the community arm was also faster at 3 months. Conversely, only the clinic arm subjects improved significantly at 6 months on the 6 MW, Borg Effort test, and SF-12 PCS. The score on the SDMT was significantly increased in both study arms at 6 months.

### Functional tests for adults with asthma: validity, reliability, minimal detectable change, and feasibility [^a2c5f52b]. The Journal of Asthma (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To verify the validity, reliability, learning effect, Minimal Detectable Change (MDC), and feasibility of four functional tests (4-Meter Gait Speed [4MGS], Timed Up-and-Go [TUG], Sit-To-Stand [STS], and Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB]) for adults with asthma.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, fifty-two subjects with stable asthma underwent three sets of different functional tests protocols (4MGS, TUG, STS, SPPB) in a random order by two raters. For validation analysis, tests were compared with a sex-age matched control group without asthma and correlated with the Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT), and peripheral muscle strength, as well as with quality of life and asthma control questionnaires. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, MDC, and feasibility were verified.

Results

Adults with asthma presented worse results than controls in the functional tests, except for SPPB. All functional tests were significantly correlated with 6MWT (0.45 < r < 0.67) and peripheral muscle strength (0.32 < r < 0.63), but not with quality of life and asthma control (0.02 < r < 0.17). The tests presented good to excellent intra-rater Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC ≥ 0.75 for all). In all tests, a considerable learning effect and variability of measurement was observed, therefore, the best of two measurements should be used. MDC ranged from 15 to 31% and all tests were performed in a short time, small space, and without clinical adverse events.

Conclusion

Different protocols of 4MGS, TUG, STS, and SPPB are valid, reliable, and feasible to assess the functional capacity of adults with asthma. These tests are quick and practical new alternatives for assessing functional capacity in this population.

### Variability in physical function for patients living with breast cancer during a 12-week exercise program [^5da85a58]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the variability during weekly performance on physical function tests during a 12-week individualized exercise program for patients with breast cancer and to test if the expected improvements in physical function surpass the minimally clinically important difference (MCID), after accounting for week-to-week variance.

Methods

Twenty-five participants, 19 years and older living with breast cancer within 2 years of their initial diagnosis, were recruited. Some participants were undergoing active treatment, while others completed their treatment. The intervention was an individualized exercise session twice a week, for 1 h each session, for a total of 12 weeks. Main outcomes tested included the 6-min walk test and chair stand test.

Results

A significant average improvement was observed in the 6MWT (p < .01) and the chair stand test (p < .001) following the intervention. Individual confidence intervals were wide across all testing measures with only 28% and 8% of participants meeting or surpassing the MCID for the 6MWT and chair stand test, respectively.

Conclusion

Despite a significant improvement in physical function during the program, the majority of patients did not reach the MCID, which could be due to large variability resulting from treatment-related side effects or measurement error.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^58b60c10]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — patient-centered outcomes and minimal important difference: Patient-centered outcomes have historically been used for patient assessment and measurement of change or impact of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic respiratory disease, with the strongest evidence of impact for improvement in symptoms, exercise performance, and quality of life in individuals with COPD. Analyses of outcomes include the minimal (clinically) important difference (MID), defined as the smallest difference in a measurable clinical parameter that indicates a meaningful change for better or worse as perceived by the patient, clinician, or investigator. Determination of program impact requires, at minimum, that measurements be taken before the program begins and after the program is finished, and long-term outcome measurement can offer important understanding of the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation.

### The 6-minute walk test and other clinical endpoints in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: reliability, concurrent validity, and minimal clinically important differences from a multicenter study [^b332bc84]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE OF ENDPOINTS

Interpretation of functional changes in walk tests can guide clinical management and be primary endpoints in interventional studies. It thus is important to determine whether a change in function is clinically relevant. Data from this study will allow us to determine quantitatively the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the test. The MCID is a concept defined as "the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest which patients perceive as beneficial and which would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects and excessive cost, a change in patient management". The MCID is different from the minimal detectable change, which indicates the amount of change required to exceed measurement variability. When interpreting clinical measures, it is important to consider that, although small changes may be significant statistically, they may not be relevant clinically. Numerous methods to derive the MCID have been described.–These include anchor-based methods, which compare a patient's change score with another measure of clinically relevant change, and distribution-based methods,–such as the standard error of measurement (SEM), effect size, and one third the standard deviation (SD) at baseline, which are built on the statistical distribution and psychometric properties of the measure in a population. Anchor-based and distribution-based methods are seen as complementary approaches for MCID determination.

### Inter-rater reliability, standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change of the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 and four performance tests in institutionalized ambulatory older adults [^4d4d4415]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Self-reported and performance-based instruments are both necessary for a comprehensive view of the functioning of institutionalized older adults. Our aim was to assess the reliability and measurement error of the 12-item World Health Organization Disability assessment Schedule and compare these indexes against performance-based tests.

Materials and Methods

One hundred participants from Nursing Homes and Day Care Centers were assessed twice (two days to one week apart) by two independent assessors. Reliability and measurement error indexes were calculated.

Results

Reliability of the World Health Organization Disability assessment Schedule total score, and of three performance tests was appropriate for individual comparisons (ICC ≥ 0.92). Reliability for the five times seat to stand test was appropriate for group comparisons only (ICC = 0.84). The high measurement error of the timed up and go test (SEM = 4.25; MDC = 11.78) and of the five times seat to stand test (SEM = 3.47; MDC = 9.62) and the number of participants unable to perform them (TUG: n = 11; FTSST: n = 41) suggest that these tests are less suitable to monitor individual changes.

Conclusions

The 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule total score, the gait speed and hand grip tests could be used to monitor changes at both the individual and group level in a population with decreased functioning. Implications for Rehabilitation The 12-item World Health Organization Disability assessment Schedule, could be used to monitor changes in perceived functioning both at the individual and group level in institutionalized ambulatory older adults. The gait speed and hand grip tests could be used to monitor changes in performance both at the individual and group level in institutionalized ambulatory older adults' functioning. The utility of the time up and go and of the five times seat to stand test might be of limited value when aiming to monitor changes in institutionalized older adults' functioning.

### Weight-bearing asymmetry during sit-stand transitions related to impairment and functional mobility after total knee arthroplasty [^d289474a]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine changes in weight-bearing (WB) asymmetry during sit-stand transitions for individuals during the first 6 months after unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Relationships between WB asymmetry, clinical measures of knee impairment, and functional mobility also were evaluated.

Design

Prospective repeated-measures design.

Setting

Clinical research laboratory.

Participants

People (N = 36) with knee osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled to undergo unilateral TKA and a control (CTL) group (N = 17 healthy people) were enrolled.

Intervention

The TKA group participated in acute, home, and outpatient phases of exercise-based rehabilitation.

Main Outcome Measures

WB asymmetry measured during a 5-Times Sit-to-Stand Test (FTSST) based on average vertical ground reaction force under each foot, self-reported knee pain using a numerical pain rating scale, knee active range of motion symmetry, knee extensor strength symmetry, FTSST time, 6-minute walk test distance, and Stair Climbing Test time.

Results

Compared with preoperative values, the TKA group showed greater WB asymmetry at 1 month after surgery (P < .001). By 6 months, the TKA group had less WB asymmetry than preoperative values (P < .001), which was not different from the CTL group. Symmetry in WB correlated with functional outcomes and symmetry of quadriceps strength for the TKA group 6 months postoperatively.

Conclusions

Patients with unilateral knee OA showed WB asymmetry during sit-stand transitions early after unilateral TKA that improved by 6 months after surgery and was no different from that for healthy people of similar age. For people in the first 6 months after TKA, greater symmetry was related to better function and strength symmetry.

### Understanding the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of patient-reported outcome measures [^e43d7a33]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) represents a threshold value of change in PROM score deemed to have an implication in clinical management. The MCID is frequently used to interpret the significance of results from clinical studies that use PROMs. However, an understanding of the many caveats of the MCID, as well as its strengths and limitations, is necessary. The objective of this article is to provide a review of the calculation, interpretation, and caveats of MCID.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and PubMed Central.

Review Methods

Literature search-including primary studies, review articles, and consensus statements-pertinent to the objectives of this review using PubMed.

Conclusions

The MCID of a PROM may vary depending on the patients and clinical context in which the PROM is given. The primary approaches for calculating MCID are distribution-based and anchor-based methods. Each methodology has strengths and limitations, and the ideal determination of a PROM MCID includes synthesis of results from both approaches. The MCID of a PROM is also not perfect in detecting patients experiencing a clinically important improvement, and this is reflected in its accuracy (eg, sensitivity and specificity).

Implications For Practice

Interpretation or application of MCID requires consideration of all caveats underlying the MCID, including the patients in whom it was derived, the limitations of the methodologies used to calculate it, and its accuracy for identifying patients who have experienced clinically significant improvement.

### "Reliability of the Norwegian version of the short physical performance battery in older people with and without dementia" [^908f7783]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The SEM shows the test–retest differences in absolute values, using the same unit as the measurement of interest. The MDC values show the limits of change a participant has to achieve before we can say that the change is a clinical change beyond measurement error. In Table 3, both the MDC95 and the MDC90 reflecting a 95% and 90% certainty, are presented.

For the SPPB summary score SEM was 0.28, MDC95 was 0.8 and MDC90 was 0.7. For 4mwt in m/s SEM was 0.14, MDC95 0.39; and MDC90 0.33.

Regarding the subgroup analyses of dementia/no dementia, presented in Table 5, there was a slight difference in SPPB summary score ICCs with 0.84 for dementia and 0.91 for no dementia. For the other scores, ICCs and weighted Ks were almost identical in the two groups. In other words, relative reliability was only slightly lower for the group with dementia. Likewise, absolute reliability values of SEM and MDCs did not differ between groups for the total score of SPPB (SEM = 0.68, MDC95 = 1.88, MDC90 = 1.59). The greatest difference in absolute reliability was found for the STS subscale and for the 4mwt in favor of the group with dementia. For example, for the 4mwt the estimated SEMs for the group without dementia were almost double the value of the group with dementia (SEM = 0.18 and 0.10 respectively and MDC95 = 0.50 and 0.28 respectively).

### Effectiveness of internet-based exercises aimed at treating knee osteoarthritis: the iBEAT-OA randomized clinical trial [^f9beddda]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Osteoarthritis is a prevalent, debilitating, and costly chronic disease for which recommended first-line treatment is underused.

Objective

To compare the effect of an internet-based treatment for knee osteoarthritis vs routine self-management (ie, usual care).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 2018 to March 2020. Participants included individuals aged 45 years or older with a diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis recruited from an existing primary care database or from social media advertisements were invited. Data were analyzed April to July 2020.

Interventions

The intervention and control group conformed to first-line knee osteoarthritis treatment. For the intervention group, treatment was delivered via a smartphone application. The control group received routine self-management care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change from baseline to 6 weeks in self-reported pain during the last 7 days, reported on a numerical rating scale (NRS; range, 0–10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10, worst pain imaginable), compared between groups. Secondary outcomes included 2 physical functioning scores, hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and quantitative sensory testing.

Results

Among a total of 551 participants screened for eligibility, 146 were randomized and 105 were analyzed (mean [SD] age, 66.7 [9.2] years, 71 [67.1%] women), including 48 participants in the intervention group and 57 participants in the control group. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. At the 6-week follow-up, the intervention group showed a greater NRS pain score reduction than the control group (between-group difference, -1.5 [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.8]; P < .001). Similarly, the intervention group had better improvements in the 30-second sit-to-stand test (between-group difference, 3.4 [95% CI, 2.2 to 4.5]; P < .001) and Timed Up-and-Go test (between-group difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -3.0 to -0.5] seconds; P = 0.007), as well as the WOMAC subscales for pain (between-group difference, -1.1 [95% CI, -2.0 to -0.2]; P = 0.02), stiffness (between-group difference, -1.0 [95% CI, -1.5 to -0.5]; P < .001), and physical function (between-group difference, -3.4 [95% CI, -6.2 to -0.7]; P = 0.02). The magnitude of within-group changes in pain (d = 0.83) and function outcomes (30 second sit-to-stand test d = 1.24; Timed Up-and-Go test d = 0.76) in the intervention group corresponded to medium to very strong effects. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that this internet-delivered, evidence-based, first-line osteoarthritis treatment was superior to routine self-managed usual care and could be provided without harm to people with osteoarthritis. Effect sizes observed in the intervention group corresponded to clinically important improvements.

### Discordance abounds in minimum clinically important differences in THA: a systematic review [^6286102d]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is intended to detect a change in a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) large enough for a patient to appreciate. Their growing use in orthopaedic research stems from the necessity to identify a metric, other than the p value, to better assess the effect size of an outcome. Yet, given that MCIDs are population-specific and that there are multiple calculation methods, there is concern about inconsistencies. Given the increasing use of MCIDs in total hip arthroplasty (THA) research, a systematic review of calculated MCID values and their respective ranges, as well as an assessment of their applications, is important to guide and encourage their use as a critical measure of effect size in THA outcomes research.

Questions/Purposes

We systematically reviewed MCID calculations and reporting in current THA research to answer the following: (1) What are the most-reported PROM MCIDs in THA, and what is their range of values? (2) What proportion of studies report anchor-based versus distribution-based MCID values? (3) What are the most common methods by which anchor-based MCID values are derived? (4) What are the most common derivation methods for distribution-based MCID values? (5) How do the reported medians and corresponding ranges compare between calculation methods for each PROM?

Methods

The EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases were systematically reviewed from inception through March 2022 for THA studies reporting an MCID value for any PROMs. Two independent authors reviewed articles for inclusion. All articles calculating new PROM MCID scores after primary THA were included for data extraction and analysis. MCID values for each PROM, MCID calculation method, number of patients, and study demographics were extracted from each article. In total, 30 articles were included. There were 45 unique PROMs for which 242 MCIDs were reported. These studies had a total of 1,000,874 patients with a median age of 64 years and median BMI of 28.7 kg/m 2. Women made up 55% of patients in the total study population, and the median follow-up period was 12 months (range 0 to 77 months). The overall risk of bias was assessed as moderate using the modified Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies criteria for comparative studies (the mean score for comparative papers in this review was 18 of 24, with higher scores representing better study quality) and noncomparative studies (for these, the mean score was 10 of a possible 16 points, with higher scores representing higher study quality). Calculated values were classified as anchor-based, distribution-based, or not reported. MCID values for each PROM, MCID calculation method, number of patients, and study demographics were extracted from each study. Anchor-based and distribution-based MCIDs were compared for each unique PROM using a Wilcoxon rank sum test, given the non-normal distribution of values.

Results

The Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and the Hip Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (HOOS) Pain and Quality of Life subscore MCIDs were the most frequently reported, comprising 12% (29 of 242), 8% (20 of 242), and 8% (20 of 242), respectively. The EuroQol VAS (EQ-VAS) was the next-most frequently reported (7% [17 of 242]) followed by the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) (7% [16 of 242]). The median anchor-based value for the OHS was 9 (IQR 8 to 11), while the median distribution-based value was 6 (IQR 5 to 6). The median anchor-based MCID values for HOOS Pain and Quality of Life were 33 (IQR 28 to 35) and 25 (14 to 27), respectively; the median distribution-based values were 10 (IQR 9 to 10) and 13 (IQR 10 to 14), respectively. Thirty percent (nine of 30) of studies used an anchor-based method to calculate a new MCID, while 40% (12 of 30) used a distribution-based technique. Thirty percent of studies (nine of 30) calculated MCID values using both methods. For studies reporting an anchor-based calculation method, a question assessing pain relief, satisfaction, or quality of life on a five-point Likert scale was the most commonly used anchor (30% [eight of 27]), followed by a receiver operating characteristic curve estimation (22% [six of 27]). For studies using distribution-based calculations, the most common method was one-half the standard deviation of the difference between preoperative and postoperative PROM scores (46% [12 of 26]). Most reported median MCID values (nine of 14) did not differ by calculation method for each unique PROM (p > 0.05). The OHS, HOOS JR, and HOOS Function, Symptoms, and Activities of Daily Living subscores all varied by calculation method, because each anchor-based value was larger than its respective distribution-based value.

Conclusion

We found that MCIDs do not vary very much by calculation method across most outcome measurement tools. Additionally, there are consistencies in MCID calculation methods, because most authors used an anchor question with a Likert scale for the anchor-based approach or used one-half the standard deviation of preoperative and postoperative PROM score differences for the distribution-based approach. For some of the most frequently reported MCIDs, however, anchor-based values tend to be larger than distribution-based values for their respective PROMs.

Clinical Relevance

We recommend using a 9-point increase as the MCID for the OHS, consistent with the median reported anchor-based value derived from several high-quality studies with large patient groups that used anchor-based approaches for MCID calculations, which we believe are most appropriate for most applications in clinical research. Likewise, we recommend using the anchor-based 33-point and 25-point MCIDs for the HOOS Pain and Quality of Life subscores, respectively. We encourage using anchor-based MCID values of WOMAC Pain, Function, and Stiffness subscores, which were 29, 26, and 30, respectively.

### Minimal clinically important difference and substantial clinical benefits for single-and dual-task Timed Up and Go test following motor-cognitive training in Parkinson's disease [^df4d5c28]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish substantial clinical benefits (SCB) and minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for both the single-task and dual-task timed up and go (TUG) tests in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD).

Design

Prospective pre-post intervention study evaluating the effects of combined motor-cognitive training.

Setting

Rehabilitation centers.

Participants

One hundred fifteen PwPD, with a mean age of 61.33 ± 13.01 years.

Interventions

Dual-task motor-cognitive training.

Main Outcome Measures

Time taken to complete the single-task and dual-task TUG tests, recorded both before and after the intervention. MCIDs were calculated using the anchor-based and distribution-based methods. SCB was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Results

The anchor-based MCIDs for the single-task and dual-task TUG tests ranged from -0.71 to -1.27, and-0.82 to -1.81, respectively. The distribution-based MCIDs for the single-task and dual-task TUG tests ranged from -1.07 to -1.14, and-1.65 to -1.98, respectively. The SCB for both the single-task and dual-task TUG tests was determined to be less than -2.04.

Conclusion

This investigation provides critical insights into interpreting changes in functional mobility in PwPD, facilitating informed clinical interventions and enhancing research planning initiatives.

### Minimal clinically important differences in measuring treatment effects in CIDP: history, current use, limitations, and prospects [^25a9760d]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Llauradó et al. conducted a study of 20 subjects with CIDP to determine the MCID of gait evaluations including time up and go (TUG), 10‐metre walk test (10MWT) and 30‐s chair stand (30SCS). With receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and using clinical status judged through attainment of MCIDs of 4 centile points for I‐RODS, 1 point for INCAT, 4 points for MRCSS, or 8 kPa for grip strength, optimally sensitive and specific cut‐offs for each gait scale were ascertained. Besides the optimal cut‐offs reported being only 1 s for TUG and 10MWT and 1 repetition for 30SCS, and therefore intuitively subject to errors of measurement, the reliance on other scales with debatable MCIDs as anchors raises methodological issues that may have impacted the results.

### Guidelines for adult stroke rehabilitation and recovery: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^8af904c1]. Stroke (2016). Medium credibility.

Appendix 2 — Balance and mobility measures in stroke — Balance tools include the Berg Balance Scale, a criterion-based assessment of static and dynamic balance widely used in multiple settings, and the Functional Reach Test, a single-item test measuring how far one can reach in standing with normative data available. Mobility tools include walking speed with categories < 0.4 m/s = household ambulation, 0.4–0.8 m/s = limited community ambulation, and > 0.8 m/s = community ambulation; the Timed Up and Go, which quantifies more than straight walking including sit/stand and a turn and is scored by time to complete; the 6-Min walk test quantifying walking endurance with normative and criterion values for community ambulation distances; the Functional ambulation category, a 6-point scale with higher equals better walking ability suitable for people who are not independent ambulators; and observational gait analysis, commonly used with standardized formats and appropriate in conjunction with more quantifiable measures.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^f4ac872c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — exercise performance and field walking tests note that the most established is the self-paced 6-minute walk test (6MWT), which has been used in many trials in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is recognized in other conditions. For COPD, the minimal important difference (MID) was previously considered to be 54 m (95% CI, 37–71 m), with other studies reporting 25 to 35 m; average improvements after pulmonary rehabilitation are approximately 30 m, and the test requires a 30-m or greater walking course. There are sources of variability and a learning effect, and using the established, recommended protocol is critical to obtaining reliable, valid, and reproducible results. Externally paced tests include the incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) and endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT), performed over a 10-m course; practice walks are required. The ISWT is a symptom-limited maximal exercise capacity test with distance relating strongly to peak aerobic capacity, and post-rehabilitation improvements are consistently between 40 and 95 m, exceeding the MID of 47.5 m. For ESWT, there is some evidence it may be more responsive to intervention than the 6MWT for bronchodilator therapy; with pulmonary rehabilitation, ESWT increases by at least 180 seconds (or 80–90% of baseline), and the MID has been suggested to be between 60 and 115 seconds with bronchodilation.

### The minimal clinically important difference of six-minute walk in Asian older adults [^ee59757c]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

A small change in 6MWD (17.8 m) was perceived as minimally and clinically important by moderately frail Asian older adults with declining fall efficacy. Further research in this area is required as there are other methods of establishing the MCID value.

### Smartphone-based sit-to-stand analysis for mobility assessment in middle age [^96be6ce4]. Innovation in Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Mobility can decline in middle age and growing evidence highlights the importance of assessing mobility at this stage of life. Smartphone-based accelerometry during sit-to-stand has been shown to identify mobility impairments, but its utility in detecting subtle mobility deterioration in middle age has not been tested. This study aimed to examine whether smartphone-based accelerometry data measured during sit-to-stand tests performed on a regular chair and a cushioned sofa could be useful for detecting subtle changes in mobility in middle age.

Research Design and Methods

Twenty-three young (25.0 ± 2.5 years), 25 middle-aged (52.0 ± 5.2 years), and 17 older adults (70.0 ± 4.1 years) performed the 5-times sit-to-stand test on both a standard chair and a sofa. A smartphone attached to the participants' lower back was used to measure lower-limb muscle power, maximal vertical velocity (MVV) during rising, the duration of the total task and the subphase of transition from sitting to standing (SiToSt), and repetition variability using the dynamic time warping method.

Results

Middle-aged adults had reduced lower-limb muscle power compared to young adults (5.25 ± 1.08 vs 6.19 ± 1.38 W/kg, p = .034), being more pronounced on the sofa (6.23 ± 1.61 vs 8.08 ± 2.17 W/kg, p = .004). Differences between middle-aged and young adults in terms of MVV (p = .011) and SiToSt duration (p = .038) were only detected on the sofa, and the middle-aged adults showed less variability compared to the older adults on the chair (p = .018). There was no difference in total task duration between the middle-aged group and the young or older adults in either condition.

Discussion and Implications

Most common tests are limited in their ability to detect early mobility deterioration in midlife due to a ceiling effect. Our results, which show the potential of smartphone-based sit-to-stand assessment in detecting subtle mobility decline in midlife, could serve as a screening tool for this purpose.

### A further step toward meaningful trial outcomes for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: minimal important difference in 6-minute-walk distance [^469e492e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
The arrow from top to bottom signifies the timeline over the last 40 years. The ovals linked to the timeline contain important studies on the implementation of the 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) in respiratory medicine, especially in the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension (green), the concept of MID to address meaningful outcome measures for patients (blue), and published studies on minimal important difference of the 6MWD in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (purple). FDA = Food and Drug Administration; MCID = minimal clinically important difference; MID = minimal important difference; NYHA = New York Heart Association; PAH = pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Over the past several years, many more tests, including different imaging, assessments of exercise capacity, or physiological measures, became available in respiratory medicine and were proposed as markers of risk and trial endpoints. With every measure, the question arose to which degree a change over time would be perceived by patients as meaningful, and the term "minimal clinically important difference" (MCID) was introduced by Guyatt and colleagues. MCID is preferentially determined if well-validated instruments to assess a patient's quality of life were integrated into clinical trials to anchor changes of specific tests to changes of patient-reported outcomes. MCID defined by these anchor-based methods integrating patients' perceptions are clearly preferred to distributional methods, which calculate MCID from statistical variance. The MCID of endpoints should be integrated in sample size calculation and thus should have a direct implementation in trial design. It was later suggested that the "C" in MCID should be abandoned because it is not the "clinical" view that is the important measure but the health-related quality of life as a pure patient-centered outcome measure, but this request was not followed by a majority of publications. Thus, the M(C)ID was defined as the smallest difference in score in the outcome of interest that patients were likely to perceive as important, as either beneficial or harmful, and that leads, together with caregivers, to consideration of a change in disease management. It was this patient-centeredness that was claimed in the subsequent 2009 U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance for industry and that directed medical research and many clinical trials toward inclusion of patient-reported outcome measures, which also allow definition of MCID.

### Is displacement of the lesser trochanter associated with functional outcome in older adults with intertrochanteric fractures? [^5cbbac5c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lesser trochanter displacement in intertrochanteric fractures has been linked to fracture instability and altered hip biomechanics, with evidence suggesting that proximal or medial displacement of the fragment by ≥ 10 mm may lead to poorer clinical outcomes. However, whether such displacement is associated with multidomain functional outcomes and patient performance remains unclear.

Questions/Purposes

In older adults with intertrochanteric fractures treated with internal fixation using a cephalomedullary nail, we asked: (1) Were functional outcome measures, including the Harris hip score (HHS), de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI), and the Barthel Index, negatively associated with lesser trochanter displacement of ≥ 10 mm? (2) Was lesser trochanter displacement of ≥ 10 mm associated with a decreased ability to complete tasks during performance assessments and inferior performance scores on the Functional Reach Test (FRT), Timed Up and Go test (TUG), and 5 Times Sit-to-Stand (5TSTS) test?

Methods

Between January 2021 and October 2023, four fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons at a Level I trauma center treated older adults with intertrochanteric hip fractures. Short cephalomedullary nails were used in approximately 90% of patients, typically for displaced fractures, including both stable and unstable types. Of the 123 patients treated with a cephalomedullary nail, 7% (9) were lost to follow-up before 1 year, 9% (11) died within 1 year, and 12% (15) were excluded based on predefined criteria, leaving 72% (88) of patients for analysis in this retrospective comparative study. There was no evidence of differential loss to follow-up or mortality between the displacement groups. Patients were divided into two groups based on postoperative lesser trochanter displacement: patients with < 10 mm of proximal or medial displacement, including an intact lesser trochanter (n = 44), and patients with displacement of ≥ 10 mm (n = 44). Baseline characteristics, including demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and preinjury Barthel Index, did not differ between the groups. Functional outcomes, including the HHS, the DEMMI (which assesses mobility across a range of physical tasks), and the Barthel Index (which measures independence in activities of daily living) were assessed at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. All three scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function. These capture different domains of recovery, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of patient outcomes. Performance tests (FRT, TUG, 5TSTS) were assessed at the same time points by experienced orthopaedic surgeons, and the groups were compared on those endpoints. The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) or minimal detectable change at 95% confidence (MDC95) values were: HHS (MCID = 16 to 18), DEMMI (MCID = 10), Barthel Index (MCID = 8.4), FRT (MDC95 = 6.4 to 8.2 cm), TUG (MCID = 2.9 to 4.9 seconds), and 5TSTS (MCID = 3.6 seconds).

Results

We found no clinically important difference in HHS at either 3 months or 1 year. Patients whose fractures had < 10 mm of displacement showed higher DEMMI scores at 3 months (50 ± 15 versus 37 ± 13, mean difference 13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7 to 19]; p < 0.001) and a borderline meaningful difference at 1 year (52 ± 17 versus 42 ± 15, mean difference 10 [95% CI 3 to 16]; p = 0.01). Barthel Index scores were also higher at 3 months (85 ± 14 versus 68 ± 20, mean difference 17 [95% CI 9 to 24]; p < 0.001) but not at 1 year. Patients with lesser trochanter displacement of < 10 mm also demonstrated better performance in the TUG test at both 3 months (48 ± 31 versus 68 ± 31 seconds, mean difference -20 [95% CI -34 to -5]; p = 0.01) and 1 year (37 ± 27 versus 52 ± 32 seconds, mean difference -15 [-29 to -1]; p = 0.03). No meaningful differences were observed in the FRT or the 5TSTS test at either time point. A higher percentage of patients with < 10 mm of displacement completed the tests (93% [41 of 44] versus 73% [32 of 44]; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Intertrochanteric fractures with ≥ 10 mm of lesser trochanter displacement were associated with some poorer short-term functional and patient performance outcomes compared with patients with less displacement, although these differences diminished over time. The possible clinical benefit of surgically addressing the displaced fragment should be carefully weighed against the risks associated with a more extensive procedure. Further studies are warranted to address this issue.

Level Of Evidence

### Feasibility of performance-based and self-reported outcomes in self-managed falls prevention exercise interventions for independent older adults living in the community [^1f275fc8]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Associations between performance-based measurements and self-reported scales

At pre-assessment, the performance-based tests SPPB, gait speed, balance, and 30s CST all had significant low to moderate correlations with self-reported scales, with the exception of poorer correlations between balance and Icon-FES (Table 4). For the 5TSTS significant poor correlations with all the self-reported scales ABC, Icon-FES, and LLFDI-FC was shown.

Change scores, between pre- and post-assessment, showed no significant correlations between performance-based measurements and self-reported scales (Table 5). There were also no significant associations between self-rated perceived improvements in balance or leg strength and changes in gait speed, balance, leg strength, self-reported falls-efficacy and functional ability. However, the change in self-reported scales ABC, Icon-FES, and LLFDI-FC all correlated significantly with each other as did the performance-based measurements gait speed, balance, 5TSTS, and 30s CST with the total SPPB score.

### Challenges for defining minimal clinically important difference (MCID) after spinal cord injury [^1b085f86]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is a review article.

Objectives

This study discusses the following: (1) concepts and constraints for the determination of minimal clinically important difference (MCID), (2) the contrasts between MCID and minimal detectable difference (MDD), (3) MCID within the different domains of International Classification of Functioning, disability and health, (4) the roles of clinical investigators and clinical participants in defining MCID and (5) the implementation of MCID in acute versus chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) studies.

Methods

The methods include narrative reviews of SCI outcomes, a 2-day meeting of the authors and statistical methods of analysis representing MDD.

Results

The data from SCI study outcomes are dependent on many elements, including the following: the level and severity of SCI, the heterogeneity within each study cohort, the therapeutic target, the nature of the therapy, any confounding influences or comorbidities, the assessment times relative to the date of injury, the outcome measurement instrument and the clinical end-point threshold used to determine a treatment effect. Even if statistically significant differences can be established, this finding does not guarantee that the experimental therapeutic provides a person living with SCI an improved capacity for functional independence and/or an increased quality of life. The MDD statistical concept describes the smallest real change in the specified outcome, beyond measurement error, and it should not be confused with the minimum threshold for demonstrating a clinical benefit or MCID. Unfortunately, MCID and MDD are not uncomplicated estimations; nevertheless, any MCID should exceed the expected MDD plus any probable spontaneous recovery.

Conclusion

Estimation of an MCID for SCI remains elusive. In the interim, if the target of a therapeutic is the injured spinal cord, it is most desirable that any improvement in neurological status be correlated with a functional (meaningful) benefit.
