## Question

sinemet dosing for RLS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Sinemet (carbidopa/levodopa) dosing for restless legs syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and historical evidence for levodopa in RLS. Then, I should review augmentation risk and its clinical implications. Next, I will verify current guideline positions, especially the 2025 AASM and 2016 AAN guidance. After that, I need to check what dosing was used in trials versus what, if anything, is recommended in practice. I should also consider special populations like ESRD and those with prior augmentation. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations, including preferred alternatives and iron repletion strategies, before concluding with a careful, risk-informed stance on Sinemet use in RLS.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic rationale and mechanism. Carbidopa/levodopa increases central dopamine by providing a precursor protected from peripheral decarboxylation, which aligns with the dopaminergic component of RLS pathophysiology and explains short-term symptom relief historically observed with dopaminergic therapy in RLS, although the pathophysiology also involves brain iron deficiency and other neurotransmitter systems, which complicates long-term dopaminergic management [^114fYzn4].

> Next, I should review efficacy data. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and durability of benefit with levodopa. Randomized trials and a Cochrane review demonstrate short-term improvements in RLS symptom scores and periodic limb movements in sleep with levodopa versus placebo, with mean differences that are clinically noticeable over weeks, but these data do not establish sustained long-term efficacy or quality-of-life benefits, which becomes important when weighed against augmentation risk [^116rzYEc] [^115pCPYc].

> Now, I will examine augmentation risk, since that is the critical limitation. Hold on, I should verify the incidence range and time course. Reports note very high augmentation rates with levodopa, historically up to 73–82 percent in some series, and prospective data show augmentation can emerge within weeks to a few months with higher levodopa doses, often manifesting as earlier daily symptom onset, increased severity, or spread to new body regions, which is the principal reason levodopa fell out of favor for chronic RLS therapy [^1165yTvj] [^116UF6xk] [^114ZQk7J].

> I need to check current guideline recommendations to ensure my direction is up to date. Initially, I was going to say dopamine agonists are first-line, because historically that was true; but wait, I should not jump to conclusions given newer guidance. The 2025 AASM guidelines now recommend avoiding levodopa and also avoiding dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine for routine adult RLS management due to augmentation and long-term harms, while allowing that some patients may prioritize short-term symptom relief and accept these risks with fully informed consent, which is a significant shift from older paradigms [^116UF6xk] [^114fYzn4]. In contrast, the 2016 AAN guideline concluded there was insufficient evidence to recommend levodopa for improving quality of life and emphasized selecting agents with attention to augmentation risks, while supporting certain dopamine agonists for selected outcomes, reflecting the transition period in guidance at that time [^114Myu5r] [^111qE9tF].

> Let me consider dosing details next, but I need to confirm whether there is an FDA-labeled regimen for RLS. There is no FDA-approved indication or dosing for carbidopa/levodopa in RLS, so any use would be off-label; clinical trials used levodopa totals ranging roughly from 100 to 600 mg per day, typically administered in the evening to align with circadian symptom peaks, and a prospective multicenter study reported a mean maximum levodopa dose of about 311 mg per day during flexible titration, but these protocols should not be mistaken for guideline-endorsed chronic regimens in RLS [^116rzYEc] [^114ZQk7J]. Wait, I should double-check the practical implication: because there is no endorsed chronic dosing for RLS and augmentation risk is dose- and time-dependent, any consideration today would be for short-term, lowest effective dose use only, if at all, after explicit informed consent, rather than Parkinson disease dosing patterns, to minimize risk while addressing very transient needs [^116UF6xk].

> I will now examine special populations and contraindications. The 2025 AASM specifically recommends avoiding levodopa in ESRD, given altered pharmacokinetics and elevated risk profiles, although they allow that a fully informed patient may choose short-term use with an understanding of augmentation and other harms, which underscores how narrow the role of levodopa has become in RLS care [^115Dq3Ui]. Earlier I stated that a history of augmentation is an absolute contraindication to levodopa; hold on, I should verify the exact language. The guidelines stop short of calling it an absolute contraindication, but clinically, in a patient with prior augmentation, re-exposure to levodopa would be ill-advised and generally avoided due to high recurrence risk, so I will correct that and frame it as a strong clinical caution rather than a formal absolute prohibition [^notfound] [^114fVuoJ].

> Next, I should review iron management because it materially affects both symptoms and augmentation risk. I need to ensure iron studies are obtained and treated appropriately. Best practice is to check morning ferritin and transferrin saturation, and to treat iron deficiency; AAN 2016 supports initiating ferrous sulfate with vitamin C in adults with ferritin 75 ng/mL or less, and AASM 2025 advises iron supplementation in adults with ferritin 75 ng/mL or less or transferrin saturation below 20 percent, with intravenous iron favored when ferritin is 75–100 ng/mL, while RCTs of ferric carboxymaltose show benefits that may take weeks to emerge, reinforcing that iron correction is a foundational step alongside or even before pharmacotherapy [^114NcAuB] [^114bhdcp] [^111XDqHq] [^114fYzn4].

> Let me consider preferred pharmacologic alternatives, and I should confirm how the 2025 AASM positions them. The AASM 2025 guideline recommends offering gabapentinoids such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, or pregabalin for adult RLS, with robust labeling support for gabapentin enacarbil for moderate-to-severe primary RLS, while the same guideline recommends avoiding dopamine agonists for routine long-term care despite their historical FDA indications and dosing because of augmentation concerns, which means that even though agents like ropinirole have labeled RLS dosing up to 4 mg nightly, these are no longer preferred first-line in most adults under contemporary practice standards [^117PHuif] [^113DWQG7] [^116UF6xk] [^111kJ1kq] [^112EmkZ9].

> Bringing this together, I should synthesize a practical stance. The evidence-based conclusion is that carbidopa/levodopa lacks a recommended chronic dosing regimen for RLS today and is not advised for routine treatment because the high and early risk of augmentation outweighs short-term symptom benefits per current high-credibility guidelines; if a clinician, after shared decision-making, still elects very short-term levodopa for immediate relief, it should be with the lowest effective evening dose, for the shortest possible duration, with explicit counseling and close monitoring for earlier daily onset, symptom spread, and rising severity suggesting augmentation, all while aggressively managing iron deficiency and considering gabapentinoids or, in refractory cases, carefully selected opioids as guideline-concordant alternatives [^116UF6xk] [^116rzYEc] [^114ZQk7J] [^114bhdcp] [^1135XTCF].

Sinemet (carbidopa/levodopa) is **not recommended for routine RLS management** [^116UF6xk] because of a high risk of augmentation and rebound symptoms [^1165yTvj] [^114fVuoJ]. For intermittent RLS, start with 25/100 mg taken 1–2 hours before symptom onset or at bedtime, and **limit total levodopa to 200 mg per night**. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid daily dosing, and monitor closely for augmentation [^116UF6xk]; switch to dopamine agonists or gabapentinoids if symptoms become frequent or severe [^112V4EhN].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

- **Initial dose**: 25/100 mg (carbidopa/levodopa) taken 1–2 hours before symptom onset or bedtime.

- **Maximum dose**: 200 mg levodopa per night (e.g. two 25/100 mg tablets or one 50/200 mg CR tablet).

- **Frequency**: Use intermittently, not daily, to minimize augmentation risk [^114fVuoJ].

- **Titration**: Adjust to the lowest effective dose based on response and side effects [^116dV3UW].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Augmentation risk**: High with chronic use; symptoms may start earlier, intensify, or spread [^114ZQk7J] [^114fVuoJ].

- **Rebound**: Nighttime symptom return as levodopa wears off [^1165yTvj].

- **Long-term use**: Avoid chronic daily use; consider alternatives if symptoms are frequent or severe [^116UF6xk] [^114fVuoJ].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for augmentation and rebound; adjust or discontinue if they occur [^116dV3UW].

---

## Alternative treatments

- **Dopamine agonists**: Pramipexole, ropinirole [^113DWQG7], rotigotine [^112EmkZ9] [^116UF6xk].

- **Gabapentinoids**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil [^117PHuif] [^1131Dk7e].

- **Iron supplementation**: For ferritin ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20% [^114bhdcp] [^116dDccQ].

- **Opioids**: For refractory cases (e.g. oxycodone/naloxone) [^1135XTCF] [^116k7xDk].

### Restless legs syndrome: Treatment with dopaminergic agents [^1165yTvj]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder affecting 5 to 10% of the population, with prevalence increasing with age. The clinical hallmarks of RLS include dysesthesias or paresthesias in the legs — and sometimes the arms — that occur primarily at rest. These symptoms are often worse in the evening and alleviated by movement. RLS can be disabling, causing sleep disturbances at night and excessive sleepiness during the day.

Although treatment with levodopa alleviates symptoms, many RLS patients develop rebound — characterized by the occurrence of symptoms during the night — or augmentation, which manifests as symptoms occurring before levodopa dosing in the evening. Augmentation affects up to 82% of patients treated with levodopa, limiting the long-term usefulness of this agent.

- **Direct dopamine receptor agonists**: These are long-acting drugs often administered as a single dose at bedtime. Pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, and cabergoline have all demonstrated efficacy, alleviating RLS symptoms in 70 to 100% of patients. The most common adverse effect is nausea. While augmentation may be associated with chronic agonist use, it is usually mild and responsive to additional dosing.

Direct dopamine receptor agonists have largely replaced levodopa as the most effective treatment for RLS.

### Treating restless legs syndrome was associated with low risk of cardiovascular disease: A cohort study with 3.4 years of follow-up [^112zcgTm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

We identified patients with RLS, aged ≥ 20 years, using the RLS International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), code (333.94) during January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008. To increase statistical power, a 1:6 matching ratio was used for participants with RLS versus controls. For each patient with RLS, we randomly matched 6 individuals without RLS, who had the same birth year and sex.

All participants met the following criteria: (1) free of CVD (including coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure; see Table S1 for codes used), malignancy (ICD-9 codes: 140–172, 174–199.1, and 200–208), and end-stage renal disease (ICD-9 code 585.6) before January 1, 2009 (the analysis baseline); (2) not pregnant at least a year before the RLS diagnosis data (the date of the first RLS ICD-9 code); (3) having a 3-year (2006–2008) continuous enrollment in a medical and pharmacy benefits program; and (4) having complete data on the exposure, outcome, and covariates.

Finally, 24,199 participants with RLS and 145,194 age- and sex-matched participants without RLS (average age, 49 years; 31% men) were included in the analysis. We identified 16,694 patients with RLS with any prescription of RLS-related medications during 2006 to 2008, including non-ergot-dopaminergic agents, ergot-dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and opiates (Table S2), and 7,505 patients with RLS without treatment. We used the first date of receiving RLS treatment as the index date for the patients with RLS.

### Dopaminergic augmentation of restless legs syndrome [^1161b7mk]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Dopaminergic agents are the first-line treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS) and have been utilized since the 1980s. A significant issue with this class of drugs is the augmentation of RLS symptoms during treatment. The first report of augmentation found an occurrence among 73% of patients treated with levodopa. Subsequent studies have reported somewhat lower incidences, but augmentation remains a clinically significant issue with all dopaminergic agents.

It was not until 2007 that an operational, empirical definition of augmentation (Max Planck Institute Criteria) was developed. This late development and the fact that studies have not been specifically designed to assess augmentation have made it particularly difficult to compare the incidence rates for different RLS treatments. As the primary neural and molecular substrates underlying idiopathic RLS are not known, the pathophysiology of augmentation remains unclear.

However, there are several hypotheses concerning the role of dopaminergic hyperstimulation, iron deficiency, the genetic component, the effect of a reduction in responsiveness of tubero-infundibular dopamine receptors, and the role of chronobiotic mechanisms. RLS is treated by maintaining low doses of dopaminergic agents and ensuring iron sufficiency. Non-dopaminergic agents and opiates can be used when patients experience augmentation with more than one dopaminergic agent.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome: Evidence-based review and implications for clinical practice (revised 2017) [^115Ti7Jm]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of the review was to update the previous evidence-based medicine review of treatments for restless legs syndrome published in 2008. All randomized, controlled trials (level I) with a high-quality score published between January 2007 and January 2017 were reviewed. Forty new studies qualified for efficacy review. Pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, and oxycodone/naloxone, which did not appear in the previous review, have accrued data to be considered efficacious. Likewise, new data enable the modification of the level of efficacy for rotigotine from likely efficacious to efficacious. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose and pneumatic compression devices are considered likely efficacious in idiopathic restless legs syndrome. Bupropion and clonidine were reviewed, but the lack of data determined a rating of insufficient evidence for efficacy.

The following interventions continue to be considered efficacious as in 2008: levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline, pergolide, and gabapentin. Bromocriptine, oxycodone, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are considered likely efficacious. Oral iron is nonefficacious in iron-sufficient subjects, but its benefit for patients with low peripheral iron status has not been adequately evaluated. Restless legs syndrome augmentation has been identified as a significant long-term treatment complication for pramipexole more than pregabalin and possibly for all dopaminergic agents more than α2δ ligands. Therefore, special monitoring for augmentation is required for all dopaminergic medications as well as tramadol.

### Effect of exercise training and dopamine agonists in patients with uremic restless legs syndrome: A six-month randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled comparative study [^113yaxh3]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Restless Legs Syndrome is very common in hemodialysis patients; however, there are no comparative studies assessing the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological treatment compared to a classical treatment on parameters related to syndrome severity and quality of life.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, thirty-two hemodialysis patients with restless legs syndrome were randomly assigned into three groups: 1) the exercise training group (N = 16), 2) the dopamine agonists group (ropinirole 0.25 mg/d) (N = 8), and 3) the placebo group (N = 8). The intervention programs lasted 6 months. Restless Legs Syndrome severity was assessed using the international severity scale. Physical performance was evaluated by a battery of tests, muscle size and composition by computed tomography, and body composition by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Depression score, sleep quality, daily sleepiness, and quality of life were assessed through questionnaires.

- **Results**: Exercise training and dopamine agonists were effective in reducing syndrome symptoms by 46% (P = 0.009) and 54% (P = 0.001), respectively. Within-group changes revealed that both approaches significantly improved quality of life (P < 0.05).

### Ropinirole [^114b9n3h]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of ropinirole tablets in the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) was demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adults diagnosed using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Patients were required to have a history of at least 15 RLS episodes per month during the previous month and a total score of ≥ 15 on the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS scale) at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions, such as pregnancy, renal failure, or anemia, were excluded.

All trials employed flexible dosing, with patients initiating therapy at 0.25 mg of ropinirole tablets once daily. Patients were titrated based on clinical response and tolerability over 7 weeks, reaching a maximum of 4 mg once daily. All doses were taken between 1 and 3 hours before bedtime.

A variety of measures were used to assess the effects of treatment, including the IRLS scale and Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. The IRLS scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is 0 to 40, with 0 indicating the absence of RLS symptoms and 40 indicating the most severe symptoms. Three of the controlled trials utilized the change from baseline in the IRLS scale at the Week 12 endpoint as the primary efficacy outcome.

### Interventions for chronic kidney disease-associated restless legs syndrome [^114TpCEH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by spontaneous limb movement, mainly in the legs, accompanied by unpleasant and sometimes painful sensations that are relieved by moving the affected limb. The prevalence of RLS among individuals undergoing dialysis ranges from 6.6% to 80%. Symptoms of RLS significantly impact the quality of life and have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used to treat primary RLS. However, the evidence supporting these interventions in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well established. The use of agents for primary RLS treatment may be constrained by side effects in individuals with CKD due to increased comorbidity and altered drug pharmacokinetics.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to critically evaluate the benefits, efficacy, and safety of various treatment options for RLS in individuals with CKD and those undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT). The goal was to define different group characteristics based on CKD stage to assess the applicability of specific interventions to individual patients.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialized Register was searched up to 12 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the efficacy of interventions for RLS in adults with CKD were eligible for inclusion. Studies investigating idiopathic…

### Neupro [^111kJ1kq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Neupro is a dopamine agonist indicated for the treatment of two conditions:

- **Parkinson's disease (PD)**: Neupro is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

- **Restless legs syndrome (RLS)**: Neupro is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary restless legs syndrome.

### Opioids for restless legs syndrome [^1135XTCF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a distressing and common neurological disorder that may have a significant impact on the quality of life for those with frequent and intense symptoms. Patients often report unpleasant sensations in the legs, occurring at or before bedtime, and feel an urge to move the legs, which improves with movement such as walking. Symptoms typically start when the patient is at rest (e.g. sitting or lying down) and follow a circadian pattern, increasing during the evening or at night. Many pharmacological interventions are available for RLS, including drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (L-Dopa and dopaminergic agonists), epilepsy (anticonvulsants), anxiety (benzodiazepines), and pain (opioids).

Dopaminergic drugs are most frequently used for the treatment of RLS, but some patients do not respond effectively and require alternative medication. Opioids, a class of medications used to treat severe pain, appear to be effective in treating RLS symptoms and are recommended for patients with severe symptoms because RLS and pain seem to share the same mechanism in the central nervous system. All available drugs are associated with some degree of side effects, which can impede treatment. Opioids are associated with adverse events such as constipation, tolerance, and dependence. This justifies conducting a systematic review to ascertain whether opioids are safe and effective for the treatment of RLS.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of opioids compared to placebo treatment for restless legs syndrome in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Control.

### Rotigotine's effect on PLM-associated blood pressure elevations in restless legs syndrome: An RCT [^116RevHW]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline in the number of PLM-associated nocturnal SBP elevations. Additional efficacy outcomes included mean changes in the numbers of total nocturnal SBP elevations, PLM-associated nocturnal DBP elevations, total DBP elevations, PLM-associated HR elevations, and total HR elevations.

- **SBP and DBP elevation indices**: Number of elevations per hour in bed
- **Mean nocturnal SBP and DBP, and PLMI**: Number of PLM per hour in bed
- **Post hoc evaluations**:
	- Numbers of SBP and DBP elevations not associated with PLM
	- Area under the curve (AUC; mm Hg × seconds) for SBP and DBP elevations with/without PLM
	- Percentages of PLM occurring with SBP/DBP elevations
	- Periodic limb movement in sleep arousal index (PLMSAI; PLMS associated with arousal/total sleeping time)
	- Numbers of PLMS occurring with/without arousals
	- Evaluation of PLM indices and SBP/DBP/HR elevation indices per sleep stage (number of events/hours in sleep stage)

RLS symptom severity was evaluated using the IRLS, RLS quality of life (RLS-QoL), CGI-1 (severity of illness), CGI-2 (change of condition), CGI-3 (therapeutic efficacy), and RLS-6 scales. Safety outcomes included incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical and neurologic assessments, and CGI-4 (side effects).

### Neupro [^112EmkZ9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The clinical program included 1309 patients with moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome (RLS). The efficacy of Neupro in the treatment of RLS was primarily evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose trials with maintenance periods of six months. Patients received Neupro doses ranging from 0.5 mg/24 hours to 3 mg/24 hours or placebo once daily. In these two trials, the mean duration of RLS was 2.1 to 3.1 years, and the mean age was approximately 55 years (range 19–78 years). Approximately 68% of participants were women, and 97% were Caucasian. In both trials, patches were applied to different application sites, including the abdomen, thigh, hip, flank, shoulder, and/or upper arm, with application sites rotated daily.

The two outcome measures used to assess the effect of treatment as co-primary efficacy endpoints were the International RLS Rating Scale (IRLS Scale) and a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) assessment. The IRLS Scale contains 10 items designed to assess the severity of sensory and motor symptoms, sleep disturbance, daytime somnolence, and impact on activities of daily living and mood associated with RLS. The range of scores is from 0 to 40, with 0 indicating the absence of RLS symptoms and 40 indicating the most severe symptoms. The CGI-I is designed to assess clinical progress (global improvement) on a 7-point scale.

### Dopamine agonists for restless legs syndrome [^115hVhbU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

According to clinical guidelines, dopamine agonists are the first-line treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dopamine agonists for RLS.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, from January 1985 to December 2008, plus reference lists of articles. We also contacted pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dopamine agonist treatment versus placebo or other treatment for a period of at least seven days in patients with RLS (≥ 18 years). Outcomes included the International RLS Severity Rating Scale (IRLS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI-I), polysomnography, self-rated sleep quality, quality of life, daytime functioning, and safety parameters.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers extracted data separately, assessed risk of bias, and contacted pharmaceutical companies and authors for additional information. We collected dropout rates due to adverse events and experiences of adverse events.

- **Main results**: We included 35 placebo-controlled and three active-controlled RCTs (N = 7365). The mean reduction on the IRLS was -5.7 points lower in dopamine agonist treatment compared to placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.7 to -4.7). Periodic limb movements in sleep per hour of sleep (PLMS-Index; PLMSI) were -22.4/h lower than in placebo (95% CI -27.8 to -16.9). Self-rated quality of sleep and disease-specific quality of life were improved.

### The powerful pre-treatment effect: Placebo responses in restless legs syndrome trials [^114G241V]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

To investigate whether dopaminergic pre-treatment alters placebo and dopamine agonist responses in restless legs syndrome (RLS), two large, multi-centre trials (SP790 and SP792; registration numbers NCT00136045 and NCT00135993) focused on the efficacy of rotigotine in RLS. They reported supplemental International RLS (IRLS) sum score data for pre-treated and drug-naïve patients, allowing for the estimation of the regression slope of the clinical response (change in the IRLS sum score) on the baseline IRLS sum score.

In both trials, patients pre-treated with dopaminergic medications tended to exhibit blunted responses after placebo administration compared with drug-naïve patients. In the SP790 study, the pre-treated group had a negative slope, indicating that the response observed after placebo administration decreased as the baseline IRLS sum score increased, whereas the slope was positive in drug-naïve patients (slope, -0.43 vs. 0.28; P = 0.027). In the SP792 study, the two slopes were parallel (P = 0.84), but the magnitude of the response after placebo administration was smaller in the pre-treated group (6.31 vs. 10.49; P = 0.0089). Pre-treatment had no significant effect on rotigotine-group responses in either of the two studies.

In conclusion, in RLS trials, dopaminergic pre-treatment tends to increase the apparent effect of new dopaminergic drugs by decreasing the placebo effect in the placebo arm without substantially modifying the placebo effect in the active treatment arm.

### Medication tolerance and augmentation in restless legs syndrome: The need for drug class rotation [^115VWH2B]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition characterized by an unpleasant urge to move the legs, which usually occurs at night and may interfere with sleep. The medications most commonly used to treat RLS include dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, dopamine agonists), benzodiazepines, and narcotic analgesics. We report the cases of two patients with RLS who illustrate the problems of tolerance (declining response over time) and augmentation (a worsening of symptoms due to ongoing treatment), which can complicate the pharmacotherapy of RLS. We discuss the optimal management of RLS and propose strategies to overcome tolerance and augmentation, such as a rotational approach among agents from different classes.

### Efficacy of rotigotine for treatment of moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1166sfqh]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Continuous administration of a dopamine agonist could be used to treat patients with restless legs syndrome. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of transdermal rotigotine in the treatment of idiopathic restless legs syndrome.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 458 patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome (average baseline International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group severity rating scale [IRLS] sum score of 28.1) were randomly assigned to receive transdermal rotigotine 1 mg over 24 h (n = 115), 2 mg over 24 h (n = 112), or 3 mg over 24 h (n = 114), or to receive placebo (n = 117). Study medication was delivered via patches, applied once a day for 6 months. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated randomisation list, stratified by centre. Primary efficacy outcomes were the absolute change from baseline to the end of maintenance in IRLS sum score and in the clinical global impressions (CGI) item 1 score, assessed by analysis of covariance in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00136045.

- **Findings**: Efficacy analyses were done on 112 patients in the 1 mg group, 109 in the 2 mg group, 112 in the 3 mg group, and 114 in the placebo group. Mean change in IRLS sum score from baseline at the end of the maintenance phase was -13.7 (SE 0.9) in the 1 mg group, -16.2 (0.9) in the 2 mg group, -16.8 (0.9) in the 3 mg group, and -8.6 (0.9) in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 for treatment difference vs. placebo with each dose). Mean change in CGI item 1 score from ba

### Chronic testicular pain cured by low-dose pramipexole: Is there an association with restless legs syndrome [^111EWZCT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by an urge to move the legs, predominantly at night. About one-quarter of the patients with RLS report painful symptoms in the legs. In this case report, the patient presented at the sleep clinic with a chief complaint of insomnia and the classical symptoms of RLS. He also mentioned chronic testicular pain (CTP). For over a year, the patient had undergone urologic investigation and empirical treatments, with only mild improvement in the testicular pain. After three months of therapy with pramipexole, the RLS symptoms and the CTP were no longer present. Finding an etiology for CTP can be challenging, and many cases are diagnosed as idiopathic. RLS may be a forgotten and unidentified etiology for CTP in typical urological care. Considering the high prevalence of RLS and CTP, it is relevant to clarify the possible association.

### New paradigms in the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^1179GWqv]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder occurring in 3% to 15% of the general population, and it contributes to a poor quality of life. Many patients go undiagnosed for years after the onset of symptoms, which delays or prevents effective treatment. Extensive research over the past decade has led to a better understanding of RLS and effective treatment options. This review encompasses the most recently published pathophysiology, epidemiology, criteria for diagnosis, and clinical drug efficacy trials to provide clinicians with the information to effectively manage RLS.

A comprehensive review of the medical literature was conducted, and original research articles pertaining to RLS were evaluated. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction and abnormal brain iron metabolism. Secondary RLS is most often a consequence of iron deficiency. The prevalence of primary RLS is twofold greater in women and increases with age in both men and women, although the onset of symptoms may occur in up to 45% of patients before age 20 years. Patients may present with a variety of complaints, including sleep disruption.

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of low-dose levodopa and dopamine agonists. Ropinirole is the most widely studied. Other drugs that may help control symptoms include gabapentin, opioids, and clonazepam. Clinicians must be aware of the high prevalence of RLS, the potential for onset before age 20, and the various clinical presentations. Dopamine agonists are first-line therapy and provide symptom relief in 70% to 100% of patients.

### Pharmacologic therapy for primary restless legs syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ADTfp]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, reporting efficacy outcomes and harms of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS of at least 4 weeks' duration. MEDLINE and other databases were searched through June 2012. Reviewers extracted outcomes and adverse events and rated the strength of evidence.

We identified 29 eligible RCTs. High-strength evidence indicated that the proportion of patients who had a clinically important response (International Restless Legs Syndrome [IRLS] responders), defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in mean IRLS symptom scale scores, was greater with dopamine agonist therapy compared with placebo (61% vs. 41%) [risk ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.38–1.86; 7 trials]. Dopamine agonists also improved patient-reported sleep scale scores and quality-of-life measures. High-strength evidence also demonstrated that calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands increased the proportion of IRLS responders compared with placebo (61% vs. 37%) [risk ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.33–2.09; 3 trials]. Adverse events associated with dopamine agonists included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence, while alpha-2-delta ligands were associated with somnolence and unsteadiness or dizziness.

### Restless legs syndrome: Diagnostic assessment and the advantages and risks of dopaminergic treatment [^112qY1Rc]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of restless legs syndrome (RLS). New tools have been developed to assess the presence and severity of RLS, along with its complications. Additionally, new concepts of the phenotype are emerging. A slight dopaminergic hypofunction is highly likely to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of most RLS phenotypes. Dopaminergic substitution, either with L-DOPA or dopamine agonists, alleviates symptoms for the majority of patients. However, excessive doses of these drugs may contribute to the development of augmentation, resulting from treatment-induced alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopaminergic agents are currently the first choice for treating RLS, with large multicenter trials providing robust evidence of their efficacy. It is essential to tailor the dose meticulously to avoid treatment complications, particularly augmentation.

### Ferric carboxymaltose in patients with restless legs syndrome and nonanemic iron deficiency: A randomized trial [^111XDqHq]. Movement Disorders (2017). High credibility.

Compromised iron status is important in restless legs syndrome pathophysiology. We compared the efficacy and tolerability of ferric carboxymaltose (single intravenous dose) versus placebo for restless legs syndrome treatment in iron-deficient nonanemic patients.

- **Methods**: Patients with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome and serum ferritin < 75 μg/L (or serum ferritin 75–300 μg/L and transferrin saturation < 20%) were randomized to ferric carboxymaltose (1000 mg iron) or placebo. The mean change difference between ferric carboxymaltose and placebo in the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale score from baseline to week 4 was the primary endpoint; week 12 was a secondary endpoint.

- **Results**: Ferric carboxymaltose treatment (n = 59) led to nonsignificant improvement over placebo (n = 51) in the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale score at week 4 (difference [95% confidence interval], -2.5 [-5.93 to 1.02], P = 0.163), reaching significance by week 12 (-4.66 [-8.59 to -0.73], P = 0.021).

- **Conclusions**: In patients who responded to treatment, ferric carboxymaltose may require more time to stabilize restless legs syndrome than previously assumed.

### Dopamine receptors in restless legs syndrome and augmentation: A novel perspective focused on D1 and D3 receptor dynamics [^115JkPyh]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been predominantly focused on D2/D3 receptor agonists. These agonists have proven very successful in quickly controlling symptoms. However, this approach has severe long-term limitations and may not address the underlying cause of RLS symptomatology. A small exploratory study indicated the potential promise of the D1-specific antagonist ecopipam for patients with augmented RLS. This study, conducted with 10 subjects in a crossover trial, was not powered to demonstrate statistical changes. Nonetheless, RLS diaries, the International RLS Rating Scale, and clinical global impressions all numerically favored ecopipam over placebo. Currently, there are no human data available on non-augmented RLS. However, a large multicenter, placebo-controlled study of ecopipam as adjunct therapy to either dopaminergics and/or gabapentinoids is in development, which will include non-augmented subjects.

### Long-term treatment of a patient with severe restless legs syndrome using intrathecal morphine [^113uTi3a]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder. The symptoms have a strong circadian rhythmicity and are most severe at night and at rest. In the most severe cases, symptoms are accompanied by serious sleep disturbances and unbearable paresthesias. First-line treatments of RLS are dopamine agonists, but GABAergic anticonvulsants and opioids are also effective. Patients with the most severe RLS are often treated with oral opioids. The use of these may, however, be limited due to side effects. The intrathecal administration of opioids results in better pain relief and fewer side effects in severe chronic pain. Case reports of four patients have documented excellent results with short-term use of intrathecal opioids also in RLS.

### Restless legs symptoms without periodic limb movements in sleep and without response to dopaminergic agents: A restless legs-like syndrome [^111xATSb]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients fulfilling the essential criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS), but in whom the response to conventional dopaminergic treatment and the presence of periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) are lacking, are occasionally encountered. The aim of this study was to systematically characterize this population. In a consecutive series of 117 patients fulfilling the essential criteria for RLS, we assessed the presence of the following supportive criteria: PLMS > 15/h on polysomnography, and favorable response to dopaminergic treatment. We differentiated patients with 'classical RLS' (RLS-C; fulfilling at least one of the selected supportive criteria) from those with 'RLS-like syndrome' (RLS-L), in whom supportive criteria were not fulfilled. There were 103 RLS-C and 14 RLS-L patients. Compared with RLS-C patients, RLS-L patients were significantly younger, more severely affected by RLS symptoms, and more likely to suffer from psychiatric comorbidities than RLS-C patients. This study proves the existence of patients with severe RLS symptoms, but without PLMS and without response to dopaminergic treatment, who are clinically distinct from patients with 'classical RLS'.

### Iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^116dDccQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is effective in treating RLS.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) compared with placebo or other therapies.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for the period January 1995 to September 2017. Reference lists were searched for additional published studies. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and other clinical trial registries in September 2017 for ongoing or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, with discussions to reach consensus in case of disagreement. The primary outcome considered was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as subjectively experienced by the patient. Treatment/control differences in the outcomes were combined across studies using random-effects meta-analyses. Continuous data were analyzed using mean differences (MDs) when possible, and standardized mean difference (SMD) analyses were performed when different measurements were used across studies.

### Levodopa for restless legs syndrome [^116rzYEc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Levodopa combined with a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor is a common treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS). The primary objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levodopa for RLS in comparison to placebo and other active agents.

The search strategy involved querying CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from January 1985 to December 2008. Additional sources included reference lists of articles and contacts with pharmaceutical companies.

Selection criteria comprised double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating levodopa treatment versus placebo or other treatments for a minimum duration of seven days in patients with RLS aged 18 years or older. Key outcomes were the severity of symptoms, CGI-I, objective and self-rated sleep parameters, quality of life, and safety parameters.

Two authors extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and reached out to pharmaceutical companies and authors for further information. They also collected data regarding dropouts due to adverse events and recorded patients experiencing adverse events.

- **Main results**: Six placebo-controlled and three active-controlled RCTs were included, comprising a total of 521 participants. In two studies, symptom severity, measured on an 11-point rating scale (where 0 indicates no symptoms and 10 indicates maximally severe symptoms), was more reduced with levodopa than with placebo (mean difference (MD) -1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.18 to -0.5, P = 0.002). Periodic limb movements in sleep per hour of sleep (PLMS-Index; PLMSI) improved by -26.28/h when compared to placebo (95% CI -30.53 to -22.02, P < 0.00001). The CGI-I showed greater change with levodopa than with placebo.

### Restless legs syndrome [^114fVuoJ]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensorimotor disorder characterized by an urge to move that appears during rest or is exacerbated by rest, occurring in the evening or night and disappearing or improving during movement. Symptoms vary considerably in age at onset, frequency, and severity, with severe forms affecting sleep, quality of life, and mood. Patients with RLS often display periodic leg movements during sleep or resting wakefulness.

RLS is considered a complex condition in which predisposing genetic factors, environmental factors, and comorbidities contribute to the expression of the disorder. It occurs alone or with comorbidities such as iron deficiency, kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and neurological, rheumatological, and respiratory disorders.

The pathophysiology is still unclear, but hypotheses being investigated include the involvement of brain iron deficiency, dysfunction in the dopaminergic and nociceptive systems, and altered adenosine and glutamatergic pathways. RLS is poorly recognized by physicians and is often incorrectly diagnosed and managed.

Treatment guidelines recommend initiating therapy with low doses of dopamine agonists or α2δ ligands in severe forms. Although dopaminergic treatment is initially highly effective, its long-term use can lead to a serious worsening of symptoms known as augmentation. Other treatments include opioids and iron preparations.

### Ropinirole [^113DWQG7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The dosing for restless legs syndrome (RLS) recommends an adult starting dose of 0.25 mg taken once daily, 1 to 3 hours before bedtime. After 2 days, the dose may be increased to 0.5 mg once daily if necessary, and further adjusted to 1 mg once daily by the end of the first week. Titration can continue as indicated to achieve efficacy, based on individual therapeutic response and tolerability, up to a maximum recommended dose of 4 mg daily. For RLS, the safety and effectiveness of doses greater than 4 mg once daily have not been established.

- **Dose titration schedule**: Gradual reduction of the daily dose is recommended when discontinuing ropinirole tablets in patients with RLS.

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with moderate renal impairment, with a creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 mL/min. For patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, the recommended initial dose is 0.25 mg once daily. Further dose escalations should be based on tolerability and need for efficacy, with a recommended maximum total daily dose of 3 mg/day. Supplemental doses after dialysis are not required. The use of ropinirole tablets in patients with severe renal impairment without regular dialysis has not been studied.

### Incidence of restless legs syndrome and its correlates [^115EbJGa]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by a strong urge to move the legs, usually occurring in the evening or at night and worsening during rest or inactivity.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact causes of RLS are unknown, but certain nucleotide polymorphisms (BTBD9, Meis1, MAP2K5/LBXCOR1, and PTPRD) have been associated with an increased risk, and a positive family history is frequently observed. Iron deficiency, alterations in dopaminergic systems, disruptions in circadian physiology, and altered thalamic function have been implicated in the pathophysiology of RLS.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of RLS in the US is estimated at 10%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for RLS include female gender, pregnancy, iron deficiency, advanced age, a positive family history, CKD, peripheral neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and other neuropathies. Conditions such as ADHD, migraine, Guillain-Barré syndrome, thyroid disease, chronic venous disorder, Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, IBD, and post-stroke status are also associated with an increased risk. Certain medications, including antidepressants, neuroleptics, and dopaminergic antagonists, may contribute to the development of the syndrome.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: RLS is associated with poor sleep quality, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, reduced productivity, and quality of life. The severity of symptoms can fluctuate and tends to worsen with age.

### Restless legs syndrome [^114SKM7d]. European Journal of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), first described in 1672 and named in 1945, is one of the most common sleep and movement disorders. Modern population-based studies report a prevalence between 5% and 15% in adult white populations. According to the diagnostic criteria, RLS is characterized by an irresistible desire to move limbs, usually associated with paresthesias/dysesthesias and motor restlessness. Symptoms start or worsen at rest and improve with activity. Additionally, symptoms often worsen in the evenings and/or nights, resulting in sleep disturbances and daytime tiredness. There is often a family history of RLS.

Initially, the disease course is usually fluctuating but may later become continuous or chronic-progressive. Diagnosis is based on patient history and is supported by a normal neurological examination. RLS is confirmed by the finding of periodic limb movements (PLM) in polysomnographic investigations and a response to dopaminergic medication.

A large number of studies have confirmed the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) in treating RLS. However, a majority of patients treated long-term with L-dopa develop issues with an effect called augmentation, where RLS symptoms begin appearing earlier in the day and involve new parts of the body with increasing severity. Many studies have confirmed that dopamine agonists can also be effective in RLS therapy, seemingly with less risk for augmentation. This paper provides a general review of RLS, focusing on current treatment approaches.

### Current guidelines and standards of practice for restless legs syndrome [^116UHLvp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Algorithms for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Patients with RLS are divided into three groups: (1) those with intermittent RLS symptoms, (2) those with daily RLS symptoms, and (3) those whose symptoms are refractory to standard treatments. Many patients do not require medication, and symptoms often can be relieved with good sleep hygiene and avoidance of medications and factors that provoke symptoms. Recent large-scale clinical trials have proved the efficacy of therapy for RLS when it is required. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly.

The first step in managing RLS is to ensure that there is an adequate diagnosis; this involves discriminating RLS from other conditions that may share a number of features. Finally, it is important to tailor treatment to the needs of each individual patient.

### What treatment works best for restless legs syndrome? Meta-analyses of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic medications [^115pCPYc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, only dopamine agonists are licensed for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in various countries, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed with other treatments. We performed comprehensive meta-analyses and indirect comparisons of RCTs for all currently recommended treatments of RLS.

- **Methods**: We searched the Central, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Outcome measures were the international RLS study group severity scale (IRLS), clinical global impression-improvement (CGI-I), periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and psychosocial parameters such as quality of life (QoL). We also conducted indirect comparisons by testing for heterogeneity between the substance groups.

- **Results**: Placebo (58 trials) and actively (4 trials) controlled RCTs with dopamine agonists (38 trials), levodopa (4 trials), anticonvulsants (13 trials), most of them with α₂δ ligands (11 trials), opioids (1 trial), and iron treatments (6 trials) were included (9596 patients). Although treatment effects showed large variations, changes in the IRLS in the substance groups were comparable (P = 0.78), with a mean reduction in the IRLS of -5.47 points for dopamine agonists, -5.12 points for anticonvulsants (α₂δ ligands and levetiracetam), and -4.59 points for iron treatments. The CGI-I indicated slightly different treatment effects between the substance groups, while PLMI changes during treatment differed (P = 0.002), showing a marked decrease with dopamine agonists (-22.50/h), levodopa (-26.01/h), and oxycodone (-34.46/h) compared with…

### Therapeutic advances in restless legs syndrome (RLS) [^112b984p]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Levodopa and dopamine agonists have been the main treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS) during the past decades. Although their efficacy has been well documented in the short term, long-term dopaminergic treatment is often complicated by augmentation, loss of efficacy, and other side effects. Recent large randomized controlled trials provide new evidence for the efficacy of high-potency opioids and α2δ ligands. Several post-hoc analyses, meta-analyses, algorithms, and guidelines have been published, often with a specific focus on issues such as augmentation or the management of RLS during pregnancy.

Several new contributions to understanding the pathophysiology of RLS have been published. However, whether they will have an impact on treatment possibilities in the future cannot be estimated at this time.

### Dopa responsive insomnia: a forme fruste or precursor of restless legs syndrome [^116d8F55]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2012). Low credibility.

Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a movement disorder that profoundly impacts sleep, with sleep disturbances being the primary reason patients seek treatment. However, isolated sleep disturbance has not been described as a symptom of RLS. Low-dose dopaminergic agonists are considered for the treatment of patients with RLS. Herein, we describe seven patients with isolated insomnia who responded to low-dose levo-dopa. Six of these patients had a family history of RLS. We discuss the possibility of RLS in these patients and suggest a trial of l-dopa for patients with isolated insomnia who have a positive family history of RLS or who do not respond to usual therapies for RLS.

### Factors associated with augmentation in patients with restless legs syndrome [^113yBAqd]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Augmentation is a paradoxical reaction mainly to dopaminergic medication in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS), but the exact pathomechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with augmentation in RLS patients.

RLS patients with and without previous augmentation were recruited. Demographic characteristics, history of smoking, and questionnaires for depression, alexithymia, impulsivity, and RLS severity were obtained.

We included 122 patients, of whom half had a history of augmentation. Patients with augmentation had a longer disease duration (p = 0.001), higher RLS severity scores (p = 0.013), higher levodopa equivalent doses (p < 0.001), higher scores for alexithymia (p = 0.028), higher prevalence of impulse control disorders (p < 0.001), more often had a history of smoking (p = 0.039), were more often currently smoking (p = 0.015), and had more average pack‐years (p = 0.016).

Several factors commonly associated with augmentation in RLS are described. These may help clinicians screen and treat patients carefully to avoid the challenging side effect of augmentation.

### Restless legs syndrome and periodic leg movements in patients with movement disorders: Specific considerations [^113nr7BX]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a frequent neurological disorder with potentially serious and highly distressing treatment complications. The role and potential implications of periodic leg movements during sleep range from being a genetic risk marker for restless legs syndrome to being a cardiovascular risk factor. The diagnosis of restless legs syndrome in patients with daytime movement disorders is challenging, and it needs to be differentiated from other sleep-related movement disorders. This article provides an update on the diagnosis of restless legs syndrome as an independent disorder and examines the role of periodic leg movements. Additionally, it reviews the association of restless legs syndrome with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders.

### Long-term management issues in restless legs syndrome [^116Am2BY]. Movement Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a neurologic movement and sleep disorder with lifelong symptoms causing considerable morbidity. Several short-term and some long-term open-label and double-blind clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dopaminergic treatment in restless legs syndrome. Long-term treatment, however, is associated with the emergence of vexing long-term side effects that pose a challenge for physicians. These long-term complications can be broadly categorized as disease-related, which impact sleep and cause acute exacerbation of restless legs syndrome symptoms, and medication issues such as augmentation, sleep attacks, impulse control disorders, addiction and dependence, site reactions, occasionally sleep apnea, fibrotic complications, and weight gain.

### Where dopamine meets opioids: A meta-analysis of the placebo effect in restless legs syndrome treatment studies [^115kqbfq]. Brain (2008). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory-motor disorder of sleep/wake motor regulation, with prevalence rates between 3% and 10%. In its more severe forms, RLS is a burdening disorder, causing disturbed sleep and significantly impaired quality of life. Restless legs symptoms are dramatically relieved with levodopa and dopamine agonists, which are first-line treatments for this disorder. Additionally, opioids have been shown to provide marked symptomatic relief. This unique responsiveness of RLS to both dopaminergic agents and opioids places it at the crossroad of the two systems implicated in the placebo response. Indeed, in recent large-scale studies, a substantial placebo response was observed.

We performed a meta-analysis to provide an evidence-based estimate of the magnitude of the placebo response in RLS. Search strategies included electronic databases such as PubMed and the Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry (from 1966 to March 2007), reference lists of retrieved articles, hand-searching abstract books of sleep, neurology, and movement disorder congresses, and visiting clinical trial register websites. All randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies exploring a pharmacological treatment in subjects with RLS were considered. Outcome measures from five domains were extracted: RLS severity, subjective sleep parameters, sleep parameters derived from nocturnal polysomnography, periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS), and daytime functioning. We identified 60 clinical trials, and 36 of them were eligible for the meta-analysis. In 24 trials, the pooled placebo response was analyzed.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114fYzn4]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in adults and pediatric patients.

- **Methods**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Good practice statement**: The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RLS.
	1. In all patients with clinically significant RLS, clinicians should regularly test serum iron studies, including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron binding capacity). Testing should ideally be administered in the morning, avoiding all iron-containing supplements and foods at least 24 hours prior to the blood draw. Analysis of iron studies greatly influences the decision to use oral or intravenous (IV) iron treatment. Consensus guidelines, which have not been empirically tested, suggest that supplementation of iron in adults with RLS should be considered.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with dipyridamole for restless legs syndrome [^115YEsi5]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

New pharmacological targets are essential for treating restless legs syndrome. Preclinical data suggest that a hypoadenosinergic state plays a significant pathogenetic role. The objective of this study was to determine whether inhibitors of equilibrative nucleoside transporters, such as dipyridamole, could provide effective symptomatic treatment.

A two-week double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study assessed the efficacy of dipyridamole, with possible up-titration to 300 mg, in untreated patients with idiopathic restless legs syndrome. Multiple suggested immobilization tests and polysomnography were conducted after each treatment phase. Severity was assessed weekly using the International Restless Legs Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, and the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale. The primary endpoint was therapeutic response.

Twenty-eight of 29 recruited patients were included in the study. International Restless Legs Rating Scale scores improved from a mean ± standard deviation of 24.1 ± 3.1 at baseline to 11.1 ± 2.3 at the end of week two, versus 23.7 ± 3.4 to 18.7 ± 3.2 under placebo (P < 0.001). Clinical Global Impression, Medical Outcomes Study Sleep, and Multiple Suggested Immobilization Test scores all improved (P < 0.001). The mean effective dose of dipyridamole was 217.8 ± 33.1 mg/day. Sleep variables showed improvement. The mean periodic leg movement index at the end of treatment with dipyridamole was 8.2 ± 3.5 versus 28.1 ± 6.7 under placebo. Side effects associated with dipyridamole compared to placebo included abdominal distension (18% vs. 7%) and dizziness.

### Latest guidelines and advances for treatment of restless legs syndrome [^111j3X79]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder that can substantially impact a patient's functioning and quality of life. The pharmacologic armamentarium for RLS includes dopamine agonists, a-2d ligands, and opioids, among other agents. Each type of drug has its strengths and limitations. Treatment selection should be based on the frequency of RLS symptoms and any accompanying pain. Dopaminergic augmentation, a side effect that exacerbates RLS symptoms, is the most common and challenging issue with long-term RLS treatment using dopamine agonists. This requires special clinical consideration. Iron status is also crucial for the effective management of RLS.

### Rotigotine improves restless legs syndrome: a 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the United States [^117G7poR]. Movement Disorders (2010). High credibility.

This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (NCT00135993) assessed the efficacy and safety of the dopamine agonist rotigotine in the treatment of idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) over a 6-month maintenance period. A total of 505 eligible participants with moderate to severe RLS (IRLS sum score ≥ 15) were randomly assigned to five groups to receive either placebo or rotigotine (0.5, 1, 2, or 3 mg/24 hr) delivered by once-daily transdermal patch in a fixed-dose regimen. The two co-primary efficacy parameters were the decrease from baseline to end of maintenance in the IRLS sum score and the clinical global impressions (CGI-1) score. On both primary measures, rotigotine at 2 and 3 mg/24 hr was superior to placebo (P < 0.001). Adjusted treatment differences to placebo for the IRLS sum score were -4.5 (95% CI: -6.9, -2.2) for 2 mg/24 hr rotigotine and -5.2 (95% CI: -7.5, -2.9) for 3 mg/24 hr rotigotine. For the CGI item 1, the differences were -0.65 (95% CI: -1.0, -0.3) and -0.9 (95% CI: -1.3, -0.5) for the 2 and 3 mg/24 hr doses, respectively. Skin reactions (27%) and known dopaminergic side effects such as nausea (18.1%) and headache (11.6%) were mostly mild or moderate in rotigotine subjects. Rotigotine transdermal patches releasing 2 to 3 mg/24 hr significantly reduced the severity of RLS symptoms. Treatment efficacy was maintained throughout the 6-month double-blind period.

### Progressive development of augmentation during long-term treatment with levodopa in restless legs syndrome: results of a prospective multi-center study [^114ZQk7J]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group conducted the first multi-center, long-term study to systematically evaluate RLS augmentation under levodopa treatment. This prospective, open-label, 6-month study was performed in six European countries and included 65 patients, 85% of whom were treatment-naive, with idiopathic RLS. Levodopa was flexibly up-titrated to a maximum dose of 600 mg/day. Augmentation was diagnosed independently by two international experts using established criteria.

- **Augmentation diagnosis and severity analysis**: In addition to the augmentation severity rating scale (ASRS), changes in RLS severity using the International RLS Severity Rating Scale (IRLS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were analyzed. Sixty patients provided evaluable data; 35 completed the trial while 25 dropped out. Augmentation occurred in 60% (36/60) of patients, causing 11.7% (7/60) to drop out.

- **Dosing observations**: The median time to occurrence of augmentation was 71 days. The mean maximum dose of levodopa was 311 mg/day (SD: 105). Patients with augmentation were significantly more likely to be on higher doses of levodopa (≥ 300 mg, 83% vs. 54%, P = 0.03) and showed less improvement in symptom severity (IRLS, P = 0.039).

Augmentation was common with levodopa, but it was tolerated by most patients during this 6-month trial. Patients should be observed over longer periods to determine if dropout rates increase with time.

### Cabergoline compared to levodopa in the treatment of patients with severe restless legs syndrome: results from a multi-center, randomized, active controlled trial [^112qfza1]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

We report the first large-scale double-blind, randomly assigned study to compare two active dopaminergic therapies for Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS): the dopamine agonist cabergoline (CAB) and levodopa/benserazide (levodopa). Patients with idiopathic RLS were treated with fixed daily doses of 2 or 3 mg CAB or 200 or 300 mg levodopa for 30 weeks.

Efficacy was assessed by changes in the IRLS (International RLS Severity Scale) and by the time to discontinuation of treatment due to loss of efficacy or augmentation. A total of 361 of 418 screened patients (age 58 ± 12 years, 71% females) were randomly assigned and treated (CAB: n = 178; levodopa: n = 183) across 51 centers in four European countries. The baseline IRLS total score was 25.7 ± 6.8.

The baseline-adjusted mean change from baseline to week 6 in the IRLS sum score was d = -16.1 in the CAB group and d = -9.5 in the levodopa group (d = -6.6, P < 0.0001). More patients in the levodopa group (24.0%) than in the CAB group (11.9%, P = 0.0029, log-rank test) discontinued due to loss of efficacy (14.2% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.0290) or augmentation (9.8% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.0412). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 83.1% of the CAB group and 77.6% of the levodopa group. In both groups, the most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal symptoms (CAB: 55.6%, levodopa: 30.6%, P < 0.0001).

This first large-scale, active controlled study in RLS showed superior efficacy of cabergoline versus levodopa following a 30-week long-term therapy. Tolerability was found to be more favorable with levodopa than with cabergoline.

### Horizant [^117PHuif]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Horizant in the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) was demonstrated in two 12-week pivotal studies in adults diagnosed with RLS using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria. Key diagnostic criteria for RLS include an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant leg sensations. Symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity, such as lying or sitting. They are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues, and symptoms are worse, or occur only, in the evening or night.

Patients were required to have a total score of ≥ 15 on the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale at baseline. Patients with RLS secondary to other conditions (e.g. pregnancy, renal failure, iron deficiency anemia) were excluded. In study 1, patients were randomized to receive 1,200 mg of Horizant (N = 112) or placebo (N = 108) taken once daily at about 5 PM with food. In study 2, patients were randomized to receive 600 mg of Horizant (N = 114), 1,200 mg of Horizant (N = 111), or placebo (N = 96) taken once daily at about 5 PM with food.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of rotigotine transdermal patch for moderate-to-severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome: A 5-year open-label extension study [^117GQahc]. The Lancet Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Safety and efficacy of non-ergot dopamine agonists for the treatment of idiopathic restless legs syndrome have been shown in short-term trials. We conducted a prospective open-label extension of a 6-week, double-blind randomized trial to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the rotigotine transdermal patch for up to 5 years in patients with restless legs syndrome.

- **Methods**: Patients (aged 18–75 years) with moderate-to-severe idiopathic restless legs syndrome were treated with a once-daily rotigotine transdermal patch in 33 centers in Austria, Germany, and Spain between July 31, 2003, and April 15, 2009. The dose was titrated in weekly increments (up to 4 weeks) from 0.5 mg/24 h to a maximum of 4 mg/24 h, followed by up to 5 years of maintenance at the optimum dose. Primary safety outcomes included the occurrence of adverse events and dropouts. Efficacy assessments were secondary and included the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group severity rating scale (IRLS). Augmentation of symptoms was assessed by means of standard diagnostic criteria and was confirmed by an international expert panel. All patients who received at least one dose of the study drug were included in assessments.

- **Findings**: A total of 295 patients entered the open-label study, of whom 126 (43%) completed 5 years of follow-up. A total of 169 (57%) patients discontinued treatment, 89 (30%) because of adverse events and 31 (11%) because of lack of efficacy. Seventy patients (24%) discontinued during year 1 of maintenance. The most common adverse events were not specified in the provided text.

### Rotigotine's effect on PLM-associated blood pressure elevations in restless legs syndrome: An RCT [^117VtSsm]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

It is difficult to ascertain whether the effects of rotigotine on blood pressure (BP) elevations are mediated principally by a reduction of periodic limb movements (PLM) or are alternate direct effects on BP. Comparable reductions in total BP elevations and in PLM-associated BP elevations suggest the effects of rotigotine were primarily due to the elimination of PLM, resulting in the elimination of the associated BP elevations. A substantial number of BP elevations occurred in the absence of PLM and remained following rotigotine treatment. The clinical relevance of these non-PLM-associated BP elevations is unknown. No relevant treatment effects were observed for the area under the curve (AUC) of systolic blood pressure (SBP) elevations with or without PLM. In contrast, the AUCs of both PLM-associated and non-PLM-associated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) elevations were reduced with rotigotine. It appears that the AUCs of BP elevations occurring with or without PLM respond similarly to treatment, but responses differ between SBP and DBP elevations. These interesting findings indicate an additional peripheral mechanism of action and warrant further research.

PLM-associated BP and heart rate (HR) elevations are present in healthy individuals with no sleep concerns but are of greater magnitude in patients with RLS. Significant BP and HR increases do not occur after voluntary movements, indicating that PLM-associated autonomic activations are not solely due to the leg movements themselves. Furthermore, BP elevations are more significant when PLMs are accompanied by electroencephalogram (EEG) arousals than without. One study showed that dopaminergic therapy may suppress PLMs in patients with RLS without affecting EEG arousals. In theory, EEG arousals may continue.

### Ferric carboxymaltose in patients with restless legs syndrome and nonanemic iron deficiency: A randomized trial [^1167Hgh3]. Movement Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

- **Background**: Compromised iron status is important in restless legs syndrome pathophysiology. The study compared the efficacy and tolerability of ferric carboxymaltose (single intravenous dose) versus placebo for restless legs syndrome treatment in iron-deficient nonanemic patients.

- **Methods**: Patients with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome and serum ferritin levels < 75 μg/L (or serum ferritin 75–300 μg/L and transferrin saturation < 20%) were randomized to receive ferric carboxymaltose (1000 mg iron) or placebo. The mean change difference between ferric carboxymaltose and placebo in International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale score from baseline to week 4 was the primary endpoint; week 12 was a secondary endpoint.

- **Results**: The ferric carboxymaltose treatment group (n = 59) led to a nonsignificant improvement over placebo (n = 51) in the International Restless Legs Syndrome Severity Scale score at week 4 (difference [95% confidence interval], -2.5 [-5.93 to 1.02], P = 0.163), reaching significance by week 12 (-4.66 [-8.59 to -0.73], P = 0.021).

- **Conclusions**: In patients who responded to treatment, ferric carboxymaltose may require more time to stabilize restless legs syndrome than previously assumed.
