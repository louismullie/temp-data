## Question

Can babies have honey

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether babies can have honey and, if not, what the rationale and exceptions are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the age cutoff and authoritative guidance. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of infant botulism and why infants are uniquely vulnerable. Next, I will review epidemiologic and case-based evidence linking honey to infant botulism. After that, I need to check for any legitimate exceptions, including topical or medical-grade honey use, and distinguish them from ingestion. Finally, I will consider cultural practices and practical counseling points to ensure the advice is actionable and safe.

> Let me first confirm the age threshold and the strength of guidance. Multiple authoritative sources converge on the same message: infants under 12 months should not be given honey in any form, including added to foods, water, formula, or pacifiers, due to the risk of infant botulism; this is stated by the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and echoed in clinical guidelines and expert reviews, so I should anchor on that 12‑month cutoff as the standard of care [^117938xS] [^1136Zhq9] [^11111c2z] [^116MyVeg].

> Wait, let me verify the biological rationale before drawing conclusions. Infant botulism results from ingestion of Clostridium botulinum spores that germinate in the immature infant gut, colonize, and produce botulinum neurotoxin; infants are uniquely susceptible because their intestinal microbiota and defenses are not mature enough to suppress spore outgrowth, unlike older children and adults, which explains the strict under‑1‑year prohibition on honey ingestion [^116Ekykf] [^112nDXTJ] [^117R8r6k].

> I should confirm the evidentiary link between honey and disease. Case reports document culture-confirmed infant botulism with isolation of C. botulinum from both the infant and the implicated honey jar, and surveillance summaries note that honey exposure accounts for a meaningful fraction of cases outside the U.S., with spores detected in a substantial minority of honey products; importantly, even small exposures can be consequential in this age group, so "just a taste" is not risk-free [^1143EhJq] [^114pr7iy] [^111Ks7wR] [^114UcY1z].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all honey exposures being equal. I need to distinguish ingestion from topical or medical-grade uses. Medical-grade honey (e.g. Manuka, Leptospermum) is used externally for neonatal wound care and has supportive case series and reports, but this is non-systemic and not the same as eating honey; similarly, barium products labeled "honey" are radiopaque contrast agents for swallowing studies and are not absorbed systemically, so they do not pose a botulism risk from ingestion, though they still carry age-related labeling and contraindications unrelated to botulism [^112t4tp1] [^114Xzy8M] [^117Sqsnp] [^114ZjbVu] [^114D8pZc].

> But wait, what if parents ask about cultural or traditional practices like prelacteal honey or honey-dipped pacifiers. I should double-check prevalence and counseling needs. Studies and reports document that honey is commonly used as a prelacteal feed in several regions and that honey pacifiers are used by a notable minority of families, often without awareness of risk; this underscores the need for anticipatory guidance at discharge and during early visits, with clear messaging that no honey should be given before 12 months, including in rituals, pacifiers, or home remedies [^1167FuLm] [^1157k7b9] [^1116nXEb] [^11111c2z].

> I need to ensure the counseling is practical and covers hidden sources. Families should avoid not only plain honey but also foods and products containing honey, such as certain cereals, baked goods, cough syrups, and pacifiers, and they should be advised that cooking or processing does not reliably destroy spores; if parents are concerned about cough, I should confirm that honey may be used only in children aged 1 year and older, and that infant cough medicines are not recommended under 4 years due to lack of benefit and potential harm, so safer nonpharmacologic measures should be prioritized for younger infants [^11111c2z] [^115y4QHi] [^112SmqmY] [^116MyVeg].

> Let me reconsider whether any ingestion scenario is acceptable before 12 months. I should confirm that no guideline or study supports giving honey orally to infants under 1 year for any indication, including cough, hypoglycemia, or ritual feeding; indeed, pediatric diabetes guidance explicitly advises against using honey to treat hypoglycemia in infants, reinforcing that the botulism risk outweighs any perceived benefit in this age group [^116MuDyA].

> In summary, I need to be clear and consistent: babies under 12 months should not be given honey to eat or drink, including added to foods, water, formula, or pacifiers, because of the risk of infant botulism; topical medical-grade honey for wound care and nonabsorbable barium "honey" contrast products are separate, non-systemic uses and do not carry the same ingestion risk, though they still require clinical judgment and age-appropriate precautions [^117938xS] [^114ZjbVu] [^112t4tp1] [^117Sqsnp].

Babies should not have **honey before 12 months** because it can contain Clostridium botulinum spores, which infants cannot suppress, leading to infant botulism — a rare but serious illness with constipation, weak sucking, floppy tone, and respiratory failure [^117938xS] [^113hYsZZ]. The risk is real even with small amounts, and **no safe quantity exists for infants under 1 year** [^111Ks7wR]. After 12 months, honey is generally safe, but avoid added sugars and maintain good oral hygiene [^11293AJL] [^113iAVPi].

## Risks associated with honey consumption in infants

### Infant botulism

- **Cause**: C. botulinum spores in honey germinate in the immature infant gut, producing neurotoxin that causes descending flaccid paralysis, constipation, weak suck, poor feeding, and respiratory failure [^113hYsZZ] [^116Ekykf].

- **Incidence**: Rare but serious; median age 16.8 weeks, with 19.7% of cases linked to honey exposure outside the US vs 3.8% in the US [^111Ks7wR].

- **Severity**: Can require prolonged ventilation and ICU care; mortality ~1% in hospitalized infants [^117R8r6k].

---

### Dental health concerns

Honey is **highly cariogenic** due to its sugar content and acidity, increasing early childhood caries risk if introduced early or used on pacifiers [^115PDHnh] [^113iAVPi].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **WHO/UNICEF**: Strongly advise against honey for infants under 12 months due to botulism risk [^1167FuLm].

- **AAP**: Recommends no honey before 12 months; avoid honey in foods, water, formula, or pacifiers [^11111c2z].

- **CDC**: Explicitly states honey before 12 months can cause botulism; do not add to food, water, formula, or pacifiers [^117938xS] [^1136Zhq9].

---

## Evidence from case reports and studies

Multiple case reports document **infant botulism linked to honey ingestion**, including culture-confirmed cases and severe courses requiring ventilation and antitoxin [^114pr7iy] [^1143EhJq]. Surveillance data show **honey exposure is a recognized risk factor**, particularly outside the US, underscoring the need for consistent counseling [^111Ks7wR].

---

## Safe alternatives and recommendations

- **Breast milk or formula**: Exclusive feeding until 6 months, then continued with complementary foods to 12 months and beyond [^115d8Wwk].

- **Solid foods**: Introduce at ~6 months; avoid honey and added sugars [^117938xS].

- **Oral hygiene**: Clean gums and teeth after feeds; no honey on pacifiers or bottles [^113iAVPi].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Babies should not have **honey before 12 months** because of the risk of infant botulism, which can be life-threatening; there is no safe amount for infants under 1 year [^117938xS]. After 12 months, honey is generally safe, but limit added sugars and maintain good oral hygiene [^11293AJL] [^113iAVPi].

### Discharge procedures for healthy newborns [^1116nXEb]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Physicians should use a checklist to facilitate discussions with new parents before discharging their healthy newborn from the hospital. The checklist should include information on breastfeeding, warning signs of illness, and ways to keep the child healthy and safe. Physicians can encourage breastfeeding by giving parents written information on hunger and feeding indicators, stool and urine patterns, and proper breastfeeding techniques. Physicians also should emphasize that infants should never be given honey or bottles of water before they are one year of age. Parents should be advised of treatments for common infant complaints such as constipation, be aware of signs and symptoms of more serious illnesses such as jaundice and lethargy, and know how to properly care for the umbilical cord and genital areas. Physicians should provide guidance on how to keep the baby safe in the crib (e.g., placing the baby on his or her back) and in the car (e.g., using a car seat that faces the rear of the car). It is also important to schedule a follow-up appointment for the infant.

### Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment for acute cough associated with the common cold: CHEST expert panel report [^116MyVeg]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

CHEST Expert Panel — honey for pediatric cough due to the common cold — in pediatric patients (aged 1–18 years) with cough due to the common cold, we suggest honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). Supporting trials included a comparison of honey to diphenhydramine with 40 subjects in each group, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which honey was probably better than no treatment in 154 participants, and a third RCT of 300 pediatric patients indicating honey may be better than placebo; infants < 1 year of age should not be administered honey, and children < 2 years of age should not be administered dextromethorphan for cough symptoms.

### Infant botulism following honey ingestion [^114pr7iy]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

An apparently well baby girl born at term was presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute onset of generalised floppiness at the age of 3 months. Clinically, the baby had lower motor neuron type of muscle weakness; detailed investigation lead to the diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disorder secondary to botulism toxicity. Further tests confirmed the botulism toxicity secondary to honey ingestion. The baby was treated with specific anticlostridium antibodies; she recovered remarkably, now growing and developing normally.

### Infant botulism [^112nDXTJ]. Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Infant botulism results from the absorption of heat-labile neurotoxin produced in situ by ingested Clostridium botulinum. Honey and environmental exposure are the main sources of acquisition of the organism. Clinical manifestations are owing to progressive neuromuscular blockade, initially of muscles innervated by cranial nerves and later of the trunk, extremities and diaphragm. Presynaptic autonomic nerves are also affected. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and is confirmed by recovery of the organism or by detection of toxin in the stool. Management includes meticulous supportive intensive care that may include mechanical ventilation and administration of human botulinum immunoglobulin in severe cases.

### Clinical experience with leptospermum honey use for treatment of hard to heal neonatal wounds: case series [^112t4tp1]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Preterm, critically ill neonates represent a challenge in wound healing. Many factors predispose infants to skin injuries, including decreased epidermal-dermal cohesion, deficient stratum corneum, relatively alkaline pH of skin surface, impaired nutrition and presence of multiple devices on the skin. We present a case series describing the use of medical-grade honey-Leptospermum honey (Medihoney), for successful treatment of slowly healing neonatal wounds, specifically stage 3 pressure ulcer, dehiscent and infected sternal wound, and full-thickness wound from an extravasation injury.

### Infant botulism [^116Ekykf]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Although the worldwide incidence of infant botulism is rare, the majority of cases are diagnosed in the United States. An infant can acquire botulism by ingesting Clostridium botulinum spores, which are found in soil or honey products. The spores germinate into bacteria that colonize the bowel and synthesize toxin. As the toxin is absorbed, it irreversibly binds to acetylcholine receptors on motor nerve terminals at neuromuscular junctions. The infant with botulism becomes progressively weak, hypotonic and hyporeflexic, showing bulbar and spinal nerve abnormalities. Presenting symptoms include constipation, lethargy, a weak cry, poor feeding and dehydration. A high index of suspicion is important for the diagnosis and prompt treatment of infant botulism, because this disease can quickly progress to respiratory failure. Diagnosis is confirmed by isolating the organism or toxin in the stool and finding a classic electromyogram pattern. Treatment consists of nutritional and respiratory support until new motor endplates are regenerated, which results in spontaneous recovery. Neurologic sequelae are seldom seen. Some children require outpatient tube feeding and may have persistent hypotonia.

### Flaccid paralysis in an infant associated with a dirty wound and application of honey [^113DgJwZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In infants, botulism may present with constipation, drooling, poor feeding and weak sucking and in extreme cases, loss of muscle tone which may progress to bilateral cranial nerve palsies, flaccid paralysis and diaphragmatic weakness. Infants are more susceptible due to the immaturity of the gut flora.

Honey has been used as a biological wound dressing with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and high osmolality. In this case, the infant presented with infected wound treated with the application of medicated honey raised a high index of suspicion of infantile botulism. There have been case reports associating the ingestion of honey in infants with botulism.

If C. botulinum can be present in ingested honey, it can certainly be present in honey dressings. However, there is no reported case of infant botulism associated with application of medicated honey.

Botulinum toxin is readily detected in stool sample and would confirm the diagnosis. However, this test is currently unavailable in Malaysia.

In 2003, US Food and Drug Administration approved the Orphan Drug Baby BIG R for the treatment of infant botulism which acts by neutralising free botulinum toxin. Treatment should be ideally given as soon as possible after hospital admission and should not be delayed for confirmatory test.

Learning points

This case report highlights the unusual presentation of infant botulism.
To have a high index of suspicion of botulism in an infant who presents with flaccid paralysis in association with a contaminated wound.
Unfamiliarity with the presentation could result in misdiagnosis.
The authors would also like to caution the use of medicated honey for infants.

### Do various types of prelacteal feeding (PLF) have different associations with breastfeeding duration in Indonesia? A cross-sectional study using Indonesia demographic and health survey datasets [^1167FuLm]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Moreover, unlike formula, honey is often given for traditional or religious purposes, rather than as a designated nutritional replacement. For example in Indramayu, West Java, prelacteal honey was given with the intention to bless the baby and make him/her behave sweetly in the future and prevent the throat from drying up. More recently, the practice persists based on advice from parents, neighbours and older people in the family. It is often only a ritual that has been practised throughout generations and the amount of honey given may be so low that it has very little disruptive effect on breastfeeding.

Common religions in Indonesia (Islam, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism) are generally supportive towards breastfeeding, but both breastfeeding and honey are particularly valued in Islam, which constitutes 87% of all religions in Indonesia. In Islam's holy book, Al-Quran, there are verses that specifically mention the importance of honeyand the advice to breastfeed for 2 years. A number of studies report the use of honey as 'tahnik' or 'tahneek', a tradition practised by several groups of Muslims, which involves putting a sweet substance to a newborn baby's mouth. While dates are used more often for this, honey can also sometimes be used for 'tahnik'or other Islamic-related rituals to celebrate birth such as 'aqiqah'.

Despite no link between prelacteal honey and shorter breastfeeding duration, it is important to acknowledge other potential health risks of honey. To date, WHO still warns against giving honey to infants under 1-year old due to the risk of botulinum toxin. Although rare, the consequences can be life-threatening, thus avoiding unnecessary exposure remains the most sensible action.

### Medically graded honey supplementation formula to preterm infants as a prebiotic: a randomized controlled trial [^112pFY7y]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of medically graded enteral honey supplementation on the intestinal microbiota, immune response, and somatic growth of preterm infants.

Methods

A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted on preterm infants with gestational age ≤ 34 weeks and postnatal age > 3 days. After reaching 1/2 goal enteral feeds, medically graded bee honey was added to milk at a dose of 5, 10, 15, and 0 g/day for 2 weeks in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Anthropometric measurements, CD4 and CD8 cytokines, stool cultures, and stool polymerase chain reaction assays for molecular detection of microbiomes were performed at 0, 7, and 14 days of intervention. Analysis of variance test was used to detect differences among the 4 groups.

Results

A total of 40 subjects were enrolled; 10 in each arm of the study. Compared with group D, all 3 intervention groups demonstrated significant increase in weight (P < 0.0001). Head circumference increased in groups B and C (P = 0.0056). There were no changes in CD4 or CD8 cytokines (P = 0.24 and P = 0.11, respectively). Enterobacter stool colonization decreased in groups A and B (P = 0.002), whereas Bifidobacterium bifidum colony counts increased in groups A, B, and C (P = 0.002) and lactobacilli colony counts increased in group B (P < 0.0001). Applying real-time polymerase chain reaction, B bifidum and lactobacilli increased in group C (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Supplementation of milk formula with medically graded honey was associated with changes in physical growth and colonic microbiota of preterm infants. Further studies are needed to examine the sustainability of these effects and associated long-term outcomes.

### The role and requirements of digestible dietary carbohydrates in infants and toddlers [^1116zdx4]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The EU Directive 2006/125/EC of 5 December 2006 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children has established the composition of products intended for infant weaning. For cereals, if sucrose, fructose, glucose, glucose syrups or honey are added to products mentioned, then the amount of added carbohydrates from these sources shall not exceed 7.5 g/100 kcal and the amount of added fructose shall not exceed 3.75 g/100 kcal. If sucrose, fructose, glucose syrups or honey are added to baby foods, then the amount of added carbohydrate from these sources shall not exceed 5 g/100 kcal and the amount of added fructose shall not exceed 2.5 g/100 kcal. In baby foods for infants and young children, the quantities of total carbohydrate shall not exceed 10 g/100 mL for vegetable juices and drinks based on them, 15 g/100 mL for fruit juices, nectars and drinks based on them, 20 g/100 g for fruit-only dishes, 25 g/100 g for desserts and puddings and 5 g/100 g for other non-milk-based drinks.

### Determinants of given anything other than breast milk for neonates in Ethiopia: a multilevel modeling complex sample survey data analysis [^112L8Q4Q]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding contextual region, respondents from Pastoralists had 6.39 [AOR = 6.39; 95%CI: 3.00, 11.62] times higher odds of having given anything other than breast milk for neonates as compared to respondents from Agrarian types of region categories. This outcome is consistent with the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey secondary data analysis findings.

One possible explanation for this is that the majority of pastoralist communities did not have permanent inhabitants. In turn, it can be hard for these communities to obtain an equitable distribution of basic health services, particularly those that pertain to maternal and child health, along with adequate access to information and resources. This may also contribute to a mother's declined understanding of the risks associated with giving other than breast milk her newborn child. Despite these potential explanations, in pastoralist communities, newborns are typically given boiled water, clean water, goat's or cow's milk, honey, and butter on breastfeeding practices that may encourage or allow mothers to practice giving anything other than breast milk.

Strengths and limitations of the study

As a population-based study, bias may have been less common but the findings may not generalize to other child age groups. Hence, the study is cross-sectional, does not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship, and only employs one outcome measurement technique. However, the study aimed for local policymakers and responsible bodies.

### Do various types of prelacteal feeding (PLF) have different associations with breastfeeding duration in Indonesia? A cross-sectional study using Indonesia demographic and health survey datasets [^116wHrbR]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Prelacteal formula and breastfeeding duration

Prelacteal formula comprised the largest component of PLF types in all survey years, hence the pattern of association with breastfeeding duration was similar to that of any PLF. These findings suggest that prelacteal formula may affect breastfeeding duration through a mechanism that is different from other feeds such as prelacteal honey or water. Compared with these other feeds, formula has the closest features to breastmilk and is most likely given for nutritional purposes, rather than cultural or religious reasons. Hence, the chance of disrupting breastfeeding by making the baby feel full and decreasing the frequency of breastfeeding as well as stimulation for milk productionis more plausible in this context. Consequently, supplementing with formula due to breastfeeding difficulties in the first few days can lead to more problems. In addition to disrupting the baby's natural hunger and satiety, prelacteal formula is often given using bottles and teats which can affect the baby's ability to suckle at the breast. Despite unclear causal evidence, the baby's inability to suckle at the breast may contribute to maternal psychological stress, which may negatively affect the mother's milk production. A combination of maternal stress and decreased frequency of baby's suckling may create a vicious cycle of suboptimal breastfeeding.

### The hazards of honey: infantile botulism [^1143EhJq]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Infantile botulism is a rare cause of neuromuscular weakness resulting from ingestion of Clostridium botulinum-an anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus found universally in soil. The only definite food source known to cause infantile botulism is honey; previously, links to formula milk have been postulated but not definitely sourced. We present an interesting case report of a 2-month-old infant with this rare condition, including the diagnostic difficulties that ensued. A brief overview of the condition follows. This is the first case in the UK in which C botulinum was successfully isolated from both the patient and the suspected source-a jar of honey. The importance of food labelling as a public health message is highlighted.

### Comparison of the cariogenicity of cola, honey, cow milk, human milk, and sucrose [^115PDHnh]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the cariogenicity of various fluids that are frequently fed to infants and toddlers. We chose to examine sucrose, cola drink, honey, human milk, cow milk, and water because some of these have been associated with development of early childhood caries, although direct experimental evidence is lacking.

Methods

We used our desalivated rat model because the approach mimics the situation found in infants, whereby the flow of saliva is interrupted through mechanical effects of a nipple. The animals received basic nutrition by gavage, and the fluids being tested were available ad libitum. Thus, the only substances that came in contact with teeth were the test fluids. The investigation continued for 14 days.

Results

Cola, sucrose, and honey were by far the most cariogenic. In addition, cola and honey induced considerable erosion. Human milk was significantly more cariogenic than cow milk probably because of its lower mineral content and higher level of lactose.

Conclusions

Our data show that the use of honey, cola, and sucrose water in nursing bottles should be discouraged. Although human milk is more cariogenic than cow milk, it is no more cariogenic than are common infant formulas. Protracted exposure to human milk or formula through allowing an infant to sleep on the nipple should be discouraged, and the need for oral hygiene after tooth eruption should be emphasized.

### Global occurrence of infant botulism: 2007–2021 [^111Ks7wR]. Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

We sought to summarize the worldwide occurrence and epidemiology of infant botulism (IB) from 2007 to 2021. Data were collected through active and passive surveillance, via hospital inquiries to the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program regarding Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous for patients with suspected IB, by contact with epidemiologists in countries with historically high case counts and by searching the medical literature. A case was defined as an infant with laboratory-confirmed botulism that was not due to ingestion of food containing botulinum toxin. Eighteen countries reported their first cases between 2007 and 2021. Of the 2943 cases recognized from 2007 to 2021, 1587 were type A, 6 type Ab or A&B, 1 type Af, 1254 type B, 9 type Ba, 26 type Bf, 1 type Bh, 8 type E, 15 type F, and 36 of unknown toxin type. Median age at onset was 16.8 weeks and 48.4% of patients were female. Patients in the rest of the world (ROW) were more likely to be intubated than US patients (50.3% ROW vs 21.2%), have longer hospital stays (median 27.0 days ROW vs 12.0 days), and have consumed honey (19.7% ROW vs 3.8%). In conclusion, the distribution of IB cases worldwide does not reflect the detection of Clostridium botulinum spores in soil, suggesting IB is underrecognized in certain countries. To improve recognition of IB, physicians should consider IB when an infant presents with cranial nerve palsies, hypotonia, constipation, and/or poor feeding. Pediatricians globally should continue to educate parents about honey ingestion as one risk factor for IB.

### Traditional practices during the first 1, 000 days of life in southest region of Türkiye: a qualitative study [^116xHNCZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

H9: "They think that colostrum is unhealthy due to its yellow color and so they milk it and throw away this milk".

H1: " Some mothers wait for 3 prayer times and then breastfeed. They think that if she waits for 3 prayer times, the baby will be a righteous child".

H3: "Some mothers did not give their first milk to their babies. They discarded it, considering it harmful due to its yellow color. They perceive it as unclean and fear it may lead to a buildup of diseases in the body. Despite our explanations, some individuals persist in this practice, influenced by their surroundings".

H14: "During a training session, I encountered a pregnant woman who mentioned that she did not give colostrum to any of her eight children. She believed it was not beneficial and feared it might cause skin rashes and gas due to its oily nature. However, after the training, she had a change of heart, expressing deep regret and acknowledging her mistake".

According to pregnant women and healthcare professionals, sugar water was the first food given to the baby other than breast milk in the first three days. Some pregnant women gave honey to the baby before the first milk.

P12: "I do not think it is right to give sugary water to the baby. But my mother and mother-in-law gave it to my baby. They gave it despite my objections. They said, "We grew 10 babies with sugar water as first feed and nothing happened, you don't know since this is the first baby". So, I gave up on persisting against it".

H12: "They feed the baby with sugar water after birth. They say they do this for jaundice. We provide education and say that only breast milk is sufficient for the first 6 months. But here they give babies too much sugar water".

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of VARIBAR THIN HONEY did
not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine
whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between
the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an
elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end
of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased
hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or
other drug therapy.

fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease for bowel obstruction after use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

8.5 Geriatric
Use

Clinical
studies of VARIBAR HONEY did not include sufficient numbers of subjects
aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from
younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified
differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious,
usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function,
and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Exomphalos major: conservative management using manuka honey dressings and an outreach surgical nursing team [^114Xzy8M]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Controversy exists over the best dressing for conservative management of exomphalos major. Here we describe our experience of using Manuka Honey.

Methods

Our regimen involved covering the sac with Manuka honey (Advancis Medical™) wrapped with gauze and crepe bandage. Initially, dressings were changed 3 times a week and then twice weekly until full epithelialisation. Babies went home after reaching full feeds, with our outreach nurses continuing dressings in clinic until the parents were trained to do them alone. Only patients needing management of co-morbidities were transferred to our unit. Patients would be reviewed by video consultation. Data was prospectively collected.

Results

From 2011–2019, 24 consecutive patients (11:13 M:F; median gestation 37 weeks, birth weight 3.1 kg) with exomphalos major were managed with honey dressings. Fourteen babies had significant associated anomalies of which 10 died of problems unrelated to the exomphalos. Time to full feeds 6 (2–58) days; time to discharge 21(7–66) days if no associated anomalies; time to epithelialisation 73 (27–199) days. Dressings were well tolerated. Definitive closure occurred at 17(11–38) months and was uneventful. No patient required fundoplication and all patients were orally fed. Only one patient developed a clinically significant infection.

Conclusion

This is the largest report of using Manuka honey for the management of exomphalos major. Benefits include early feeding, early discharge and a 'normalisation' of the neonatal period. Key to our success was the surgical outreach service supporting parents doing the dressings, first at the local hospital and then at home.

### Global occurrence of infant botulism, 1976–2006 [^111Gwrrz]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the worldwide occurrence of reported infant (intestinal toxemia) botulism cases since first recognition of the disease in 1976.

Patients and Methods

We collected information on infant botulism cases by active and passive surveillance, by provision of therapeutic Human Botulism Immune Globulin to suspected cases, and by searching the medical literature. We defined a case as laboratory-confirmed botulism that occurred in an infant ≤ 12 months of age that was not caused by the ingestion of botulinum toxin in food.

Results

Twenty-six countries representing 5 continents reported the occurrence of at least 1 case of infant botulism among their residents. The United States, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Italy, and Japan, in this order, reported the largest number of cases. A history of honey exposure was significantly more common among case subjects hospitalized outside of the United States than among those who were recently hospitalized in California.

Conclusions

Most countries have not yet reported cases of infant botulism. This limited reporting of the disease to date contrasts with the known global occurrence of Clostridium botulinum spores in soils and dust and suggests that infant botulism may be under-recognized, underreported, or both. When bulbar palsies, hypotonia, and weakness are present, physicians should consider the possibility of infant botulism even if the patient has not been fed honey. Publication of additional case reports and surveillance summaries will enhance understanding of the occurrence and extent of this under-recognized disease.

### Sugar in infants, children and adolescents: a position paper of the European society for paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition committee on nutrition [^11293AJL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The consumption of sugars, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs; beverages or drinks that contain added caloric sweeteners (ie, sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice concentrates), in European children and adolescents exceeds current recommendations. This is of concern because there is no nutritional requirement for free sugars, and infants have an innate preference for sweet taste, which may be modified and reinforced by pre- and postnatal exposures. Sugar-containing beverages/free sugars increase the risk for overweight/obesity and dental caries, can result in poor nutrient supply and reduced dietary diversity, and may be associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, and other health effects. The term "free sugars", includes all monosaccharides/disaccharides added to foods/beverages by the manufacturer/cook/consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey/syrups/unsweetened fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. Sugar naturally present in intact fruits and lactose in amounts naturally present in human milk or infant formula, cow/goat milk, and unsweetened milk products is not free sugar. Intake of free sugars should be reduced and minimised with a desirable goal of < 5% energy intake in children and adolescents aged ≥ 2 to 18 years. Intake should probably be even lower in infants and toddlers < 2 years. Healthy approaches to beverage and dietary consumption should be established in infancy, with the aim of preventing negative health effects in later childhood and adulthood. Sugar should preferably be consumed as part of a main meal and in a natural form as human milk, milk, unsweetened dairy products, and fresh fruits, rather than as SSBs, fruit juices, smoothies, and/or sweetened milk products. Free sugars in liquid form should be replaced by water or unsweetened milk drinks. National Authorities should adopt policies aimed at reducing the intake of free sugars in infants, children and adolescents. This may include education, improved labelling, restriction of advertising, introducing standards for kindergarten and school meals, and fiscal measures, depending on local circumstances.

### Honey for acute cough in children [^112vaDZr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cough causes concern for parents and is a major cause of outpatient visits. It can impact on quality of life, cause anxiety and affect sleep in parents and children. Several remedies, including honey, have been used to alleviate cough symptoms.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of honey for acute cough in children in ambulatory settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1950 to October week 4, 2014), EMBASE (1990 to November 2014), CINAHL (1981 to November 2014), Web of Science (2000 to November 2014), AMED (1985 to November 2014), LILACS (1982 to November 2014) and CAB abstracts (2009 to January 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing honey given alone, or in combination with antibiotics, versus nothing, placebo or other over-the-counter (OTC) cough medications to participants aged from one to 18 years for acute cough in ambulatory settings.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results for eligible studies and extracted data on reported outcomes.

Main Results

We included three RCTs, two at high risk of bias and one at low risk of bias, involving 568 children. The studies compared honey with dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, 'no treatment' and placebo for the effect on symptomatic relief of cough using a seven-point Likert scale. The lower the score, the better the cough symptom being assessed. Moderate quality evidence showed that honey may be better than 'no treatment' in reducing the frequency of cough (mean difference (MD) -1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to -0.62; I(2) statistic 23%; two studies, 154 participants). High quality evidence also suggests that honey may be better than placebo for reduction of cough frequency (MD -1.85; 95% Cl -3.36 to -0.33; one study, 300 participants). Moderate quality evidence suggests that honey does not differ significantly from dextromethorphan in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.07; 95% CI -1.07 to 0.94; two studies, 149 participants). Low quality evidence suggests that honey may be slightly better than diphenhydramine in reducing cough frequency (MD -0.57; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.24; one study, 80 participants). Adverse events included mild reactions (nervousness, insomnia and hyperactivity) experienced by seven children (9.3%) from the honey group and two (2.7%) from the dextromethorphan group; the difference was not significant (risk ratio (RR) 2.94; 95% Cl 0.74 to 11.71; two studies, 149 participants). Three children (7.5%) in the diphenhydramine group experienced somnolence (RR 0.14; 95% Cl 0.01 to 2.68; one study, 80 participants). When honey was compared with placebo, four children (1.8%) in the honey group and one (1.3%) from the placebo group complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (RR 1.33; 95% Cl 0.15 to 11.74). However, there was no significant difference between honey versus dextromethorphan, honey versus diphenhydramine or honey versus placebo. No adverse event was reported in the 'no treatment' group.

Authors' Conclusions

Honey may be better than 'no treatment', diphenhydramine and placebo for the symptomatic relief of cough, but it is not better than dextromethorphan. None of the included studies assessed the effect of honey on 'cough duration' because intervention and follow-up were for one night only. There is no strong evidence for or against the use of honey.

### Knowledge, attitude, and practice among mothers about newborn care in sindh, Pakistan [^113s3aZG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Distribution of respondents by knowledge, attitude and practices among mothers about newborn care

N (%): NA Not applicable

Study participants were assessed on their attitude about newborn care, out of total sample unit, 59.5% perceived that skin to skin contact is a preventive method from getting cold to a baby. Most of the respondents 61.0% did not accept delaying bathing of their newborns babies. Majority of the participants 88.4% preferred to use a new blade for cord cutting. Around 68.1% believed that prelacteal feeding should not be administered and 41.1% had a negative attitude on regarding colostrum feeding as shown in Table 2.

More than half of the respondents stated that they bathed their newborns within six hours of delivery. Around 50% of subjects breastfed newborns after one hour of their birth. 44.8% stated that they did not feed colostrum to their newborns. Approximately 45% of the mothers reported that they gave pre-lacteal feed to their newborns. Among these, 15.4% of respondents gave animal/formula milk, 24.5% gave honey/sugar and 5.2% gave fresh butter/ghee. Majority of mothers 65.1% breastfed their babies on demand. (Table 2).

### Is essential newborn care provided by institutions and after home births? Analysis of prospective data from community trials in rural south Asia [^1165KT3u]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

There will be inevitable differences in what an institutional and SBA delivery actually constituted between study areas. While the definitions are broadly the same, the training of the clinical staff and the equipment available is likely to differ by context.

Finally, many of the estimates have large confidence intervals due to a combination of genuine large variability in coverage and the effect of using cluster-level analysis techniques. These estimates should be considered as a guide to where certain practices have higher or lower coverage rather than as precise measurements.

Overall, coverage of protective care practices was highest for institutional deliveries, although coverage was considerably lower than 100% for all but a few practices. Potential messages for institutions across all study areas might be to improve immediate thermal care for the newborn and to encourage immediate and exclusive breastfeeding. The scarcity of skin-to-skin contact in institutional deliveries is consistent with a study of medical personnel in India. A pilot study of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist program in Karnataka, India found much lower baseline rates of sterile cord cutting and appropriate hand hygiene than in our study, but this study was carried out in a different state to ours, practices were recorded by independent observers and did not rely on mothers' recollection. Thus our estimates of ENC coverage in institutions may be overly optimistic. Further work to understand why some of these practices are relatively uncommon in institutions is critical given recent increases in institutional deliveries in South Asia.

Home non-SBA deliveries show much variation both between study areas and care practices, but there is potential for large improvement in coverage of hand washing (Eastern India, Makwanpur (Nepal)) and simple thermal care (all study areas). Recent Demographic and Health Surveys for Nepal and Bangladesh show that there is still much room for improving the coverage of essential newborn care practices. Promoting these relatively simple practices further could have great impact, given that most South Asian women in rural areas still give birth at home without an attendant and this is likely to remain the case for the near future. The variation between clusters within study areas suggests that health messages have been received differently in different communities. Low levels of immediate breastfeeding in Dhanusha (Nepal) are likely a result of cultural tradition to delay a baby's first feed. Here, and in Eastern India, newborn infants are traditionally provided with a pre-lacteal feed of sugar water, honey or animal milk, while colostrum is discarded. Breastfeeding by the mother is frequently delayed until the third day of life.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: managing diabetes in preschoolers [^116MuDyA]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

The fear of a hypoglycemic event, rather than the frequency of hypoglycemic events, is associated with higher HbA1c and lower HRQoL, suggesting the role of fear cannot be underestimated for caregivers of young children with T1D. Fear of nocturnal hypoglycemia is a particular challenge. Emerging evidence supports that behavioral interventions may reduce caregivers fear and there is evidence that consistent CGM use can reduce time in hypoglycemia in young children. Asking in a clinic visit about typical frequency and severity of hypoglycemia is encouraged. It may also be helpful to use validated surveys that ask about thoughts and feelings during and after the hypoglycemic event to identify caregivers who might benefit from treatment.

15.1 Treatment of mild hypoglycemia in infants and preschool children

Oral glucose as tablets, gel, or a drink is the preferred method of hypoglycemia treatment. The dose of glucose should be easily accepted and quickly ingested by the child. The recommended dose (0.3 g glucose/kg bodyweight) will raise plasma glucose approximately 2.5–3.6 mmol/L (45–64 mg/dL) (guidelines chapter 12 on hypoglycemia). In young children 5–7 g carbohydrate is usually adequate, and it is important not to give too much carbohydrate when treating hypoglycemia to avoid subsequent hyperglycemia. This risk is high in young children with a small body size.

To treat hypoglycemia in breast‐ or formula‐fed infants, carbohydrate gel, diluted juice, or a glucose polymer from a spoon or bottle can be offered. Honey should not be given to infants younger than 1 year due to risk of botulism.

Giving something that contains fat (i.e. milk and chocolate) will slow gastric emptying and cause a slower rise in plasma glucose. Sucrose sweetened confectionary should not be routinely used to treat hypoglycemia, as it can lead to increased risk of dental caries.

### Newborn care practices among slum dwellers in dhaka, Bangladesh: a quantitative and qualitative exploratory study [^111GVNkC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding

In the baseline survey, 64% of women reported first feeding their baby something other than breastmilk (colostrum). Forty percent of women reported first giving their baby honey, while 16% of women gave sugar water, and 4% gave mustard oil. Half of women reported breastfeeding within one hour of birth, 35% reported breastfeeding within one day of birth, and 14% reported breastfeeding after one day of birth.

These findings were supported by the in-depth interviews. The majority of women first gave their babies either honey or sugar water, followed with breastmilk three to five days after birth. There are two dominant reasons for this practice. First, there is a preference for first giving the baby water or sweet food (honey). It is perceived that these foods will influence the child's personality and protect it from diseases like mukhe gha (oral thrush). Secondly, women perceived having insufficient milk until three to five days post-delivery. To ensure that their baby had sufficient food, they often supplemented with cow's milk, powdered milk, or sweet water. Some women mentioned putting mustard oil in the baby's mouth to clean bizla bizla (mucus) before feeding the baby honey.

I learned this from seniors that the mouth of the baby remains dry after birth. If you give honey it works like moisturizer. The baby can take a gulp easily. If you feed the baby something sweet first then the baby will speak sweetly. (Woman from Korail)

For the first three days after birth there was no milk in my breasts. The baby sucked a lot but got no milk. The baby cried in hunger. Then I gave the baby tal misri water [sugar water] and had it suck my breasts. After three days there was sufficient breast milk and I did not feed anything except breast milk. (Woman from Korail)

Women widely knew about colostrum and its benefits; however few women reported feeding colostrum to their babies. One woman explicitly mentioned that she threw away the colostrum and gave breast milk to her baby one and a half days after birth.

### Honey pacifier use among an indigent pediatric population [^1157k7b9]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Use of honey pacifiers by infants presenting to a pediatric clinic at a county hospital in Houston, Texas, was observed by several of our staff members. Although we could not find any published studies linking the use of honey pacifiers to infant botulism, we also could not find any studies assessing the prevalence of honey pacifier use in general.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive study using a novel survey that had 19 items. The survey was administered to the parents of children up to age 12 months presenting to a county hospital pediatric clinic for well-child care in Houston, Texas, from February 2010 to April 2011.

Results

There were 397 respondents. Approximately 11% of the respondents reported using honey pacifiers with their infant children. Reasons for use included tradition, infant preference, and perceived health benefits (eg, helps with constipation or colic). Approximately 20% of the honey pacifier users and 23% of the entire group reported knowledge of honey potentially causing an illness in children < 12 months of age. Nearly 40% of all respondents also reported using herbal or folk remedies.

Conclusions

Honey pacifier use was relatively common among this population, seen in ∼1 out of 10 respondents. A majority of the mothers surveyed (∼80%) were unaware of the potential dangers of giving honey to infants under age 12 months. Herbal medicine use was also common.

Table 5
Type of prelacteal food and reasons for prelacteal feeding

Regarding the reasons for providing honey, all mothers believed that applying something sweet, such as honey, would bring good fortune to the child. Approximately 97% of these mothers also mentioned that giving honey to their newborn would boost their immune system, and 47.9% mentioned that applying honey kept their baby's lips moist and naturally turned their lips pink. Likewise, for honey, all mothers who applied sugar to their baby's lips believed that sugar would bring the child good fortune.

In addition, mothers who gave coffee to their newborns believed it could prevent convulsions in the child. In terms of reasons for feeding drinking water to their newborns, mothers believed that it could clean the newborn's intestine, throat, and mouth after breastfeeding, and 37 (57.8%) of these mothers also mentioned that giving drinking water kept the baby's lips moist. Interestingly, 29 (6.3%) mothers gave rice water to their newborns because it has a texture similar to that of breast milk and to help the child grow.

Reasons for incomplete vaccination

Table 6 presents the reasons for incomplete basic vaccination among children. The results showed that 139 children (19.7%) in the total study sample had incomplete basic vaccinations. Incomplete basic vaccination was higher among children with stunting (n = 93, 66.9%) than among children without stunting (n = 46, 33.1%).

Table 6
Reasons for incomplete vaccination

Most mothers (86.3%) reported that their child would have fever as a side effect of vaccination, and they did not want the child to become sick. In addition, 82.7% of the mothers believed that their child did not need to receive vaccines because their body can produce natural immunity. Approximately 17% of the mothers in the study sample missed the scheduled PHCU vaccinations, resulting in incomplete vaccination.

As expected, certain religious beliefs, including that vaccines contain porcine-derived ingredients that are not allowed according to religion (10.1%) and religious teachings not supporting vaccination (7.2%), were the other reasons given for incomplete vaccination. In addition, 6.5% of incomplete vaccinations were due to the unavailability of the vaccine, as the COVID-19 pandemic affected the availability and distribution of basic vaccines for children under 9 months of age. Furthermore, the government focused more on providing the COVID-19 vaccine.

### A qualitative study exploring newborn care behaviours after home births in rural Ethiopia: implications for adoption of essential interventions for saving newborn lives [^114s9iqd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

"… I gave birth on the street on my way to hospital, we returned back home and my family gave a bath to the baby while I sat down waiting for the placenta to come… " [First time mother, literate]

However, some mothers claimed that they had had health education from health professionals and community health extension workers about delaying bath. As a result, they no longer bathed newborns immediately after birth.

"She only dried and wrapped the baby in a clean towel soon after birth, that's the first thing she did. She said we don't bath babies any more. I also heard this in trainings from the health professionals before" [Mother of 5, illiterate]

In the focus group discussions, all mothers agreed that immediate bathing of newborn babies was the norm when a mother gives birth at home. A few mothers, who argued for changing this behaviour, made reference to the information they heard from community health extension workers or recent health education sessions they attended about delaying bathing. However, there were discrepancies as to how long these mothers thought bathing should be delayed for, with responses ranging from 2 hours to 24 hours after birth. Therefore, despite their awareness about delaying bathing, mothers were not clear about for how long bathing babies should be delayed.

C. Lanka Mansat

This is not part of the essential interventions and is not a recommended practice to save newborn lives. However, it was reported that while the mother waits for the placenta to be delivered, the TBAs or family members who attended the birth perform a traditional practice on the newborn baby which they refer to as 'Lanka Mansat'. 'Lanka mansat' is a local traditional practice whereby the TBA applies mild pressure inside the baby's mouth on the soft palate using her index finger which is made wet using a mixture of warm water and a local herb called 'ersho' or honey. Some mothers preferred to do 'Lanka mansat' just after tying the cord and before immediate bathing.

"After birth, she picked the baby up and applied Ersho [local herb] to his Lanka [soft palate]. She then gave the baby a mixture of water and sugar using a spoon [pre-lacteal feeding] before letting him sleep a bit. The placenta came out and after they gave me some food to eat, I got my baby to breastfeed" [Mother of 2, literate]

### Newborn care practices among slum dwellers in dhaka, Bangladesh: a quantitative and qualitative exploratory study [^112Ew2s4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Urbanization is occurring at a rapid pace, especially in low-income countries. Dhaka, Bangladesh, is estimated to grow to 50 million by 2015, with 21 million living in urban slums. Although health services are available, neonatal mortality is higher in slum areas than in urban non-slum areas. The Manoshi program works to improve maternal, newborn, and child health in urban slums in Bangladesh. This paper describes newborn care practices in urban slums in Dhaka and provides program recommendations.

Methods

A quantitative baseline survey was conducted in six urban slum areas to measure newborn care practices among recently delivered women (n = 1,256). Thirty-six in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore newborn care practices among currently pregnant women (n = 18) and women who had at least one delivery (n = 18).

Results

In the baseline survey, the majority of women gave birth at home (84%). Most women reported having knowledge about drying the baby (64%), wrapping the baby after birth (59%), and cord care (46%). In the in-depth interviews, almost all women reported using sterilized instruments to cut the cord. Babies are typically bathed soon after birth to purify them from the birth process. There was extensive care given to the umbilical cord including massage and/or applying substances, as well as a variety of practices to keep the baby warm. Exclusive breastfeeding was rare; most women reported first giving their babies sweet water, honey and/or other foods.

Conclusion

These reported newborn care practices are similar to those in rural areas of Bangladesh and to urban and rural areas in the South Asia region. There are several program implications. Educational messages to promote providing newborn care immediately after birth, using sterile thread, delaying bathing, and ensuring dry cord care and exclusive breastfeeding are needed. Programs in urban slum areas should also consider interventions to improve social support for women, especially first time mothers. These interventions may improve newborn survival and help achieve MDG4.

An infant, who was born preterm at 36 weeks, presented with fever and ulcer at umbilical region which progressed to necrotising fasciitis of anterior abdominal wall. He was treated with intravenous penicillin, intravenous cloxacillin and local application of medicated honey. Subsequently, he required wound debridement. Postoperatively, he required prolonged invasive ventilation due to poor respiratory effort which was associated with hypotonia and areflexia. Nerve conduction study revealed absent responses. The diagnosis of infant botulism was made based on the clinical presentation, nerve conduction study and his clinical progress. Botulinum immunoglobulin was not available. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and oral pyridostigmine. He was successfully extubated after 37 days, and currently the patient is doing well.

### Breastfeeding practices within the first six months of age in mid-western and Eastern regions of Nepal: a health facility-based cross-sectional study [^115d8Wwk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary feeds up to 2 years of age or beyond. The complementary feeding should be initiated in a child, no later than 26 weeks and not before 17 weeks of age. The benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and proper weaning in the growth, development, and prevention of illness in young children are undisputable. The frequency, timing, and duration of breastfeeding, as well as the frequency, type, and amount of complementary feeding, have been crucial aspects of infant feeding practice. Better breastfeeding practices were shown to have a significant impact on the survival of infants in a limited resource setting of southern Nepal. Moreover, feeding honey as pre-lacteal feed and animal milk or formula as a substitute for human milk pose a risk to these vulnerable infants. These other feeds might increase the risk of infection in the infants; by damaging the immature gut wall of the infants and making it more susceptible to infection transmission. There is also an increased risk of infection if the water used to prepare the feed is unsafe, particularly in low resource settings. As per Nepal Demographic Health Survey 2016, infant and young child feeding practices are sub-optimal, with about 65% exclusive breastfed under 6 months and about 55% colostrum fed within an hour of birth. Only 41% of children aged 4–5 months were exclusively breastfed compared to 80% in 0–1 months and 72% in 2–3 months. However, all infants had received at least some breast milk by 4–5 months of age. In addition to breast milk, 13.7% received water, 4.7% received non-milk liquid, 11.5% received non-human milk or formula milk, and 29.2% received other semi-solid or solid feed. Prelacteal feeding, withholding of colostrum, and being a first-time mother were associated with a significantly higher rate of partial breastfeeding in a study done in eight countries, including Nepal. Thus, there is a room for improvement in reducing partial breastfeeding and sustaining exclusive breastfeeding until the recommended 6 months of age. And, this needs a better understanding of breastfeeding pattern and determinants of partial breastfeeding in the context of Nepal.

Hence this study was conducted to assess the breastfeeding practices in the eastern and mid-western regions of Nepal. We aimed to determine full (exclusive or predominant) and partial breastfeeding rates in these two regions. We also aimed to identify factors associated with partial breastfeeding in Nepal.

### Maternal perceptions of breastfeeding and infant nutrition among a select group of maasai women [^1151PrL2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations to support breastfeeding

To guide program planning at the MKSHI Clinic, mothers were asked what could be done to better support mothers in their breastfeeding efforts. One mother alluded to gender roles in articulating that "good care should be provided by the husband". Most responded that a healthy and sufficient maternal diet was the most critical factor in supporting EBF, and that this was lacking.

"Balanced diet and taking heed over the doctor's advice".

"Meat, fat, soup from goat and sheep".

"Only balanced diet will help".

Supplementation and complementary foods

Supplemental liquids given

Mothers were asked if their baby was receiving anything other than mother's milk. None of the twenty infants under six months of age were EBF since all were receiving a liquid (including semi-solids) in addition to breastmilk. Butter (semi-solid) and goat/cow's milk were the most common supplements provided to the infants at the time of the interview. Honey, juice, and water were also given with most infants receiving more than one supplemental liquid.

"My baby receives milk, honey and butter".

"I give milk and butter"

"Milk and juice"

Introduction of solid foods

To discern compliance with infant feeding recommendations related to the introduction of complementary solid foods at six months of age, mothers were asked "At what age will/did you start giving your baby solid food?" Few of the six month old infants were receiving any solid food. Most mothers of infants five months and younger intended to delay introduction of solids until eight to nine months of age. It was common to introduce more than one food once they began complementary feeding of solids, with ugali (maize porridge) identified as the most common first solid food.

"At 8 months old I will start giving beans, meat and other soup".

"When he has teeth, like when he is 9 months old, ugali and beans".

The baby's decision

One mother in Sisattanak district explained that at about one year her baby "stopped sucking milk itself. It had front teeth above and below and could bite food. The baby just did not want to suck". (IDI-1). However, another mother found that allowing her baby to decide resulted in a longer BF period than she had initially planned. "[I] wanted to stop at 7 months to go back to work but the baby would not drink breast milk from the bottle". (IDI-3)

Family experiences and influences of community elders and others

Two mothers said they were influenced by the BF experiences of their mothers and relatives and had BF for the same time as their own mothers. In both districts, key informants suggested that elders often advocate for the early introduction of complementary foods despite this being contradictory to health professional advice. One mother said that her mother had secretly given honey mixed with water to her baby because she was scared the baby was not receiving enough nutrients (IDI-2). Whilst another mother agreed that doctors' advice to EBF for six months was good, she said she had followed the advice of her mother who had told her "when you give food to the baby [it] is happy, this means it is right". (IDI-4). Some of the elders also felt it was acceptable to give water to babies under six months, as one person explained "if the baby needs water but mothers do not give it, the baby will lose water from the brain, little by little". (KI-elder) She went on to say:

"When the baby cries, what should do to make the baby sleep? After the mother tries to give something, the baby stops crying. Additional food makes the baby full, it sleeps. Not enough from breast milk". (KI-elder)

Two of the mothers also reported being influenced by the advice of friends or neighbours. One woman for example, on the advice of a neighbour, started giving formula food at five months. (IDI-6). Mothers also mentioned the concerns about BF including fear of shrinking breasts and feeling embarrassed about BF at social events as reasons for stopping BF.

### Infant botulism, Israel, 2007–2021 [^114avgRL]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The main strength of our study is its national reach. Because only 1 national laboratory for diagnosis of IB exists, we were able to access all the diagnosed case-patients' medical records. The main limitation of our study, which derives from the rarity of IB, is the small sample size of only 8 cases. Another limitation is the retrospective nature of our study, which means some details are unrecorded or unknown.

In summary, although IB is still a rare disease, IB incidence may have increased in Israel during our study period, 2007–2021, and especially during the past 3 years of that period. We also found that honey consumption is less prominent as a risk factor compared with environmental exposures. Clinicians should be aware of the possible changing epidemiology and risk factors of this rare but serious disease in Israel.

### Perceptions and practices on newborn care and managing complications at rural communities in Bangladesh: a qualitative study [^1158GgDy]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Practices during neonatal care and complications

The group of female guardians were found to practice traditional methods for treating the neonates during complications. They mainly depended on the Kabiraj or traditional healers for immediate treatment. If the traditional healers were unable to cure the neonates, they preferred to seek help from the traditional birth attendants and the village doctors. Lastly, they went to the health facilities for treatment of the neonates. They followed the traditional practice of applying mustard oil on the umbilicus of the neonates for healing purpose. They also preferred to bath the babies immediately after birth and shaving of hair for proper cleaning. Also, they even advised the mothers to remove the colostrum before providing milk to the babies. It was also a common practice to feed the babies, honey, before providing milk. The groups of male guardians and husbands believed that neonatal care was the women's responsibility in the family. They were also not actively involved in emergency treatment during neonatal complications.

During FGD, one of the female guardians said, "We worked a lot during pregnancy, but nowadays, the women always take rest. That is why the neonatal complications occur in the mother's womb. We used to bathe our babies immediately after birth, but no problem used to occur. Nowadays, a new rule is followed: the baby should not be allowed to bathe before seven days of birth. After birth, we feed honey to the baby at first".

During IDI, one of the female guardians said, "I heard that there are two types of pneumonia, one occurs from hot and the other occurs from cold. We did not practice to provide breast milk to baby up to three days of birth, as we did not know about the importance of colostrum. However, nowadays, mothers provide the first colostrum to babies".

During FGD, one of the recently delivered mothers said, "My mother arranged clean clothes and blankets before my delivery and she cleaned my baby with the dry cloth immediately after birth. I also provided breast milk to my baby within one hour of delivery. I did not shave my baby's hair as pneumonia might occur due to the baby's baldness. Moreover, I did not bathe him for the first three days after birth".

During IDI, a female guardian mentioned, "Neonatal complications usually occur when the parents disobey the religious rules and in such cases, it is difficult to cure the baby".

### A qualitative study exploring newborn care behaviours after home births in rural Ethiopia: implications for adoption of essential interventions for saving newborn lives [^112rRjTV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

"… no one eats meal in the house until 'Lanka Mansat' is done and the baby is given bath, dried and wrapped up in a towel" [Mother of 2, illiterate]

"… the way they [TBAs] do it is, first they put some honey in to a small cup and then immerse their index finger in to the cup and apply mild pressure in the baby's mouth [soft palate] using their index finger lifting it [soft palate] upwards… " [Mother of 4, illiterate]

Mothers believed this helps the baby to have a 'better voice' and 'be able to speak clearly' when he or she gets older.

"I don't know how it works but in our tradition people believe children will have better voice when they grow up and can be listened to from distance if they had 'Lanka mansat' done" [Mother of 2, literate]

"… because, if 'Lanka mansat' is not done, babies cannot talk properly when they grow up" [Mother of 3, literate]

A total of 16 out of 26 mothers confirmed that their last child had Lanka mansat performed, but all multiparous mothers said this was a practice performed with their older children. In the focus group discussions, there was a broad consensus among mothers in practising 'Lanka mansat' as part of their culture or tradition in their community. A few mothers argued they no longer practise it because of advice from health professionals and community health extension workers about not giving anything to the newborn baby other than breastmilk. However, there was no mention of health workers advising them against practising 'Lanka Mansat' specifically. We also noted during these discussions that some mothers strongly believed in the tradition and, despite hearing the advice from the professionals, they were keen to continue practising it.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115zzkPj]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypoglycemia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (glycemic targets, T1DM), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider setting more stringent HbA1c goals (such as < 6.5%; < 48 mmol/mol) in selected individual patients if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia, excessive weight gain, negative impacts on well-being, or undue burden of care, or in patients having nonglycemic factors decreasing HbA1c (such as lower erythrocyte life span). Consider setting lower goals during the honeymoon phase.

### Infant botulism, Israel, 2007–2021 [^1125m8L8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential Risk Factors

We found several potential risk factors and hazardous exposures. Most (7/8) cases occurred during March–July (spring and summer), and the last case was in a patient from the Negev Desert, characterized by a hot and dry climate year-round. Three infants lived near construction areas and had a history of traveling outside near the construction sites a few days before symptoms began. Two case-patients had a history of being given a homeopathic or plant-based traditional medicine (yannsoon [anise leaves], a common traditional medicine for infantile colic among Bedouin populations, and a nonrecognized mixture). Two patients were breastfed only. One infant was exposed to the contents of a vacuum cleaner. The father of 1 patient was an agriculturist and was therefore exposed to soilborne pathogens. In 1 case, a sample taken from a honey cake that the infant had eaten tested positive by culture and MLB (raw honey was poured over the topping of the cake after baking). No potential risk factors were found for 1 of the patients.

### Traditional practices during the first 1, 000 days of life in southest region of Türkiye: a qualitative study [^111RajWz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Traditional practices regarding baby feeding

In the study, pregnant women avoided giving colostrum due to its color, as they believed it might harm the baby and because of the influence of their mother and mother-in-law's perceptions. It was also noted that some pregnant women delayed breastfeeding for up to 3 days or until three adhan times, opting instead to provide sugar water or honey before initiating breastfeeding. Similar practices of avoiding colostrum have been observed in other countries, as evidenced by studies conducted in Peru and various other locations. However, colostrum holds significant nutritional value, aiding in intestinal maturation and providing antibodies against enteric pathogens. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) emphasize the importance of initiating breastfeeding within the first hour after birth and exclusively breastfeeding for the first 6 months to prevent neonatal deaths.

Our findings underscore a lack of awareness among pregnant women regarding breastfeeding, breast milk, and colostrum. Inadequate prenatal care contributes to this deficiency in breastfeeding education, leading individuals to rely on traditional beliefs and practices passed down from previous generations. Research indicates that maternal education and proper prenatal care are positively correlated with early breastfeeding initiation and exclusive breastfeeding rates.

Traditional practices used in baby care

In our study, we found that substances like kohl, coins, and ash were employed to induce premature detachment of the baby's umbilical cord. Across the globe, a wide array of materials — ranging from ointments, food items, and oils to herbs, spices, and even animal manure — are utilized to expedite the healing process of the umbilical cord. These cord care practices exhibit significant diversity based on geographical location, cultural norms, and regional traditions. For instance, in southern Zambia, ash is utilized similarly to our findings for hastening the navel's detachment. Other examples include Vaseline in Nigeria, turmeric in Bangladesh, butter in Ethiopia and saliva in Tanzania, all employed for umbilical care. However, it's crucial to note that inappropriate management of umbilical cord care may lead to infections, ultimately resulting in preventable neonatal deaths. As a fundamental aspect of cord care, it is strongly advised to keep the cord open, clean, and dry.

### Infant and young child feeding practices differ by ethnicity of Vietnamese mothers [^1146S79v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, IYCF practices were suboptimal and differed by ethnicity. Previous studies in Vietnam combined all ethnic minority groups and did not tease out differences among them. For example, a previous assessment in Vietnam showed that ethnic minority mothers had a higher prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding than the Kinh majority (55% vs. 37%). Our study indicates that this may be the case in only some ethnic groups (eg, Thai-Muong) and not others (eg, Tay-Nung and E De-Mnong). Similar to previous studies, we found that professional breastfeeding advice and support during pregnancy and after birth were associated with higher early initiation of breastfeeding practice. In addition to building capacity for health workers and improving baby-friendly environments at health facilities, building capacity of village health workers and traditional birth attendants who can provide breastfeeding advice and support is needed because a large portion of ethnic minority mothers did not give birth at health facilities.

Prelacteal feeding practices also differed by ethnicity. Infant formula was the main prelacteal food for the newborn, which was found in previous studies in Vietnam and other low-income countries. Feeding infant formula in the 3 days after birth was common not only among the Kinh but also among some ethnic minority groups (eg, the Tay-Nung and E De-Mnong) who had very low food security, suggesting that formula companies might have expanded their reach to low-income and disadvantaged families in rural and mountainous areas. Previous studies with Vietnamese mothers in the country or who had migrated to high-income countries reported a perception that mothers after delivery need to rest, and thus would prefer having the newborn fed infant formula if available. Herbal solutions and chewed rice were the main prelacteal foods among the Thai-Muong while honey was common among the Tay-Nung. Feeding chewed rice to the newborn among the Thai-Muong has been reported previously in Vietnam and Laos to keep the newborn full. For certain ethnic groups in low- to high-income countries, herbal solutions are fed to enhance digestion or reduce fussiness, and honey is fed to avoid thrush and provide energy regardless of serious health risks such as botulism and lead poisoning. It is important to improve knowledge and self-efficacy through appropriate prenatal counseling and support. The messages should be consistently provided from the central to village level to shape beliefs and social norms toward more optimal IYCF practices.

### Alternative therapies for chronic rhinosinusitis: a review [^114W9yDy]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The use of alternative medicine in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) continues to increase in popularity, for the most part without meeting the burden of being based on sound clinical evidence. New and emerging treatments, both natural and developed, are numerous, and it remains a challenge for otolaryngologists as well as general practitioners to keep up to date with these therapies and their efficacy. In this systematic review, we discuss a number of alternative therapies for CRS, their proposed physiologic mechanisms, and evidence supporting their use. This analysis is based on our review of the English-language literature on alternative therapies for CRS (we did not include any therapies that are already recommended by accepted professional bodies). Data collection was performed using the PubMed database (not restricted to MEDLINE due to the nature of the subject matter), the Cochrane databases, and bibliography searches. We found that while many of the alternative therapies we reviewed might have a firm basis in science, they lack any clinical evidence to support their use specifically for CRS. Some emerging therapies, such as therapeutic ultrasonography and phonophoresis, show some promise, based on a growing body of positive evidence. In addition, the use of baby shampoo, thyme honey, and bromelain additives to saline lavage in CRS are all supported by clinical evidence, as is Sinupret, an oral preparation that contains echinacea. However, higher levels of evidence gleaned from large, well-designed, prospective, randomized, controlled trials are needed before any of these therapies can be recommended.

### Flaccid paralysis in an infant associated with a dirty wound and application of honey [^113dHW5F]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The infant was born preterm at 36 weeks gestation via spontaneous vertex delivery with birth weight of 2.52 kg to non-consanguineous parents. He was initially admitted and treated with intravenous penicillin and gentamycin for presumed sepsis as he was born prematurely. His initial blood culture was negative, and he was discharged well.

However, at day 10 of life, he was re-admitted for fever and ulcer at the umbilical region. Otherwise, he was active, febrile with a temperature of 38°C and other vital signs were stable with no respiratory distress. He was treated with intravenous penicillin and cloxacillin in addition to local application of medicated honey.

At day 30 of life, his wound condition worsened (figure 1) and he needed wound debridement for necrotising fasciitis of the anterior abdominal wall under general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, he required re-intubation as he was noted to have poor respiratory effort, generalised hypotonia and areflexia.

Figure 1
Picture of the abdominal wound postmedicated honey application and diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis of the anterior abdominal wall was made.

Blood culture was negative, and swab culture showed mixed growth. Nerve conduction study revealed predominantly axonal neuropathy (figure 2). Ultrasound scan of the cranium and lumbar puncture were normal. Primary immunodeficiency screening was negative.

Figure 2
Limited nerve conduction study was performed over left ulnar and tibial nerves. The compound motor action potential was reduced with prolonged distal latency. This nerve conduction study was abnormal suggestive of predominantly axonal neuropathy.

The diagnosis of infant botulism was made based on the clinical presentation, nerve conduction study and his clinical progress. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and oral pyridostigmine.

### Infant botulism, Israel, 2007–2021 [^114UcY1z]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we describe cases of IB in Israel during 2007–2021. We found a possible increase in incidence in the last 3 years of the study period, especially in 2020, compared to the previous 2 decades. We also noted older ages of the infant patients at illness onset compared with those described previously. Honey consumption was reported in only 1 infant, whereas we observed an apparently stronger link to environmental factors as source of infection.

The age of diagnosis in our study (6.5 months) is much older than that found in other studies. Previous studies found that age at illness onset in 90% of IB cases was 1–6 months, with a median age of 91 days. A reasonable assumption is that around this age, the infant undergoes a sharp transition from breastfeeding-only or formula-fed only to exposure to different foods. All those changes can cause a sharp shift of the bowel microbiome and optimize conditions for colonization and proliferation of C. botulinum. In addition, around this age, the infant is exposed to other external factors, such as daycare environments, solid foods, and other environmental factors, that may expose them to C. botulinum.

Previous research has shown that the connection between honey consumption and IB in the United States is considerable; honey consumption accounts for ≈15%–20% of all IB cases, and up to 25% of honey products were found to be positive for C. botulinum spores. In Europe, 59% of the IB cases are related to exposure to honey before symptom onset. In our study, honey consumption was reported in only 1 case (a honey-cake that was later found to be C. botulinum contaminated). This modest link is notable, given that people in Israel are known to be avid consumers of both local honey and honey imported from Europe and the United States; further, honey consumption increases during some of the Jewish holidays, around September–October. In fact, we found no cases of IB during those months. Many case series show that IB cases linked to honey consumption were in patients who were positive for BoNT B. In our study, the infant who consumed honey was also positive for BoNT B. A possible explanation might be an early and mandatory parental education program in outpatient infant clinics in Israel that forbids honey products until the infant is 1 year of age.

### Perception and experiences of adolescent mothers and communities in caring for their preterm babies: findings from an in-depth study in rural Bangladesh [^116WS9gR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Feeding

Participants in our study widely shared the view that for under-nourished and weak preterm babies to grow healthy and regain their strength they must be fed well. For extremely preterm babies, who were not able to suckle, the practice was to express milk and feed with a dropper or spoon. For other preterm babies, feeding practices varied and some participants also mentioned pre-lacteal and non-exclusive breastfeeding. Honey and warm water ("to clear the stomach") were the two common pre-lacteal feeds mentioned. The common reason for non-exclusive breastfeeding with formula or cow or goat's milk was that the mother was not producing enough milk. On the other hand, mothers with hospital deliveries also recollected instances where they were told off by doctors for pre-lacteal feeding or had to stop feeding babies formula milk based on the doctor's advice. One mother mentioned, "I started feeding after a day… the doctor scolded us a lot for feeding the baby some warm water (IDI27 Adolescent mother of a preterm baby)" while another mother mentions, "… we used a dropper to feed the baby powder milk (formula milk)… everyone else was feeding so we thought it would be okay… but the doctor told us that it is not good for baby, so we stopped (IDI22 Adolescent mother of a term baby). " In terms of interval or frequency, most participants mentioned that they fed their babies when they cried while some mentioned that they fed at regular intervals.

Weight monitoring

Although service providers were aware of the importance of weight monitoring, none of the interviewed participants was aware of the need to regularly monitor the weight of preterm babies. Birth weight was measured only for babies born in health facilities or when care was sought from formal health care providers.

### Infant botulism, Israel, 2007–2021 [^117Resia]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Infant botulism (IB) is an intestinal toxemia that manifests as descending paralysis, constipation, and, in some cases, respiratory failure. Laboratory-confirmed IB cases are rare, and recent data in Israel are lacking. We conducted a national multicenter retrospective study of laboratory-confirmed IB cases reported in Israel during 2007–2021. A total of 8 cases were reported during the study period. During 2019–2021, incidence may have increased because of a cluster of 5 cases. Infant median age for diagnosis was 6.5 months, older than previously reported (3 months). Most cases occurred during March-July. Honey consumption was reported in 1 case, and possible environmental risk factors (living nearby rural or construction areas, dust exposure, and having a father who works as a farmer) were reported in 6 cases. Although IB is rare, its incidence in Israel may have increased over recent years, and its epidemiology and risk factors differ from cases reported previously in Israel.

### Flaccid paralysis in an infant associated with a dirty wound and application of honey [^1137nFgR]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Infantile botulism is a rare neuromuscular disorder resulting from toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum. There are seven distinct serotypes named A–G. Only subtypes A, B, E and F cause disease in humans. Infant botulism occurs when the clostridial spores of the C. botulinum release botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) into the bloodstream which irreversibly binds to cholinergic receptors in the presynaptic cell membrane preventing the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.

Infantile botulism was first recognised in 1976 in Californiaand is most commonly reported in the United States with 128 cases reported to the Center of Disease Control in 2014. However, infantile botulism appears to be uncommon in Malaysia. We are not aware of any previous case report.

### "The midwife helped me… otherwise I could have died": women's experience of professional midwifery services in rural Afghanistan-a qualitative study in the provinces kunar and laghman [^115rmcCv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Appreciating life-saving care

Most of the women in our study appreciated the quality of the midwifery services, as regards both the professional and the interpersonal care they received. They expressed that the midwives' expertise, in particular in emergency situations, their resultant ability to save lives and their care and kindness combined to create important reasons why they decided to give birth in clinics. This stance was supported by the women who were initially sceptical of birth in a health facility. A study from Ethiopia shows that women value giving birth in a clinic, since this includes medical interventions and the ability to deal with complications. Also, in a study from Nigeria women expressed that the availability of knowledgeable and caring staff who could handle complications were important reasons for giving birth in clinics.

… and care promoting early closeness between mother and neonate.

A study from five different provinces in Afghanistan representing the country's major ethnic, religious and language groups showed that a common tradition is for the baby to be given a bath immediately after birth, and for the mother to have a bath after 3 days. In this tradition a woman should not start breastfeeding before her breasts are clean, thus delaying the first breastfeeding by 3 days. Another study confirms this custom, and describes a widespread Afghan practice whereby the neonate is fed with dates and honey before breastfeeding starts. The fact that the baby is not put to the breast immediately may affect the success of breastfeeding, and may turn out to be an unfortunate norm when it comes to preventing malnutrition and optimising the child's development. In our study the women highlighted the fact that the midwives promoted immediate skin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding as being particularly positive per se, thus demonstrating successful, empowering and health-promoting communication between the women and the skilled midwives.

The advantage of a familiar professional midwife

In cases such as in our study, where midwives are recruited from the local environment, and among local women, this might increase women's and their families' experience of safety and security. Midwives who operate within communities are furthermore able to provide a continuum of care through pregnancy and childbirth, as well as during the postnatal period, which is known to improve the utilisation of such services. In fact, as observed in the villages included in the study, midwives in many communities of Afghanistan are the only professional health-care providers.

### Next-generation biomonitoring of the early-life chemical exposome in neonatal and infant development [^111JUmdS]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) is the major metabolite of dibutyl phthalate with proven estrogenicity. A TDI of 10 µg kg −1 body weight per day is defined for the parent compound (namely, 3.3 µg kg −1 body weight per day for infants), but not yet determined for the metabolite. Even if a similar TDI were assumed for MBP, our hUBI of 1.1 µg kg −1 body weight per day would not exceed this recommendation. Similarly, TDI of BPA (1.3 µg kg −1 body weight per day) was not exceeded in our model. Even the cumulative hUBI of all detected bisphenols would only result in a cumulative hUBI of 0.08 µg kg −1 body weight per day for bisphenols. However, EFSA proposed in 2021 to significantly reduce the TDI for BPA which would result in exceedances.

Except for the widespread and potent representative scopolamine, research on the risk assessment of tropane alkaloids is scarce. Here, the TDI is not exceeded. For pyrrolizidine alkaloids the EFSA does not define any TDIs or ADIs currently. Due to a lack of data, the risk assessment for these food contaminants is based on the calculation of a cumulative 70 µg kg −1 body weight per day benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL 10) for a 10% excess cancer risk. From a public-health perspective, the EFSA panel concluded that a margin of exposure (MoE) above 10,000 is of low concern for this group of phytotoxins. For jacobine-N-oxide, our data suggest that contaminated breast milk may substantially contribute to this pyrrolizidine alkaloid burden resulting in a MoE of 5000. More conservative guidelines, such as a TDI defined by the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment of 0.1 µg kg −1 body weight per day would indicate a MoE of 1.8 after age correction for infants (0.033 µg kg −1 body weight per day). These findings demonstrate that there is a potential health risk for infants of mothers that consume high quantities of pyrrolizidine alkaloids via honey or herbal remedies.

### Differences in infant feeding practices between Chinese-born and Australian-born mothers living in Australia: a cross-sectional study [^115kUj3u]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Australia is a multicultural country with a population of almost 25 million; and a large immigrant population (28.2%). In 2016, Chinese were the third largest immigrant group in Australia and represented 2.2% of the total Australian population. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Australian children is high (27.4% of children aged 5–17 years were overweight or obese), however little is known about the prevalence or predictors in ethnic subgroups. In Australia, ethnic backgrounds (such as Asian, North African; Middle Eastern; Southern, South Eastern and Eastern European) have been demonstrated to increase the risk of overweight and obesity and adverse weight-related behaviours (e.g. physical activity, fitness, diet) in Australian primary-school aged children. In a sample of Australian preschoolers (4–5 year olds), 15.2% were reported to be overweight and 5.5% obese; however in those who spoke a language other than English at home, the prevalence was higher with 16.9% overweight and 8.4% obese. Evidence about the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children of Chinese-born immigrants is scarce. One study reports primary school-aged low socioeconomic Asian boys to be more likely to be overweight/obese compared to their English-speaking counterparts. It is important to expand these findings and investigate obesity promoting behaviours in immigrant populations to identify opportunities to establish health promoting behaviours early in life.

Disparities in weight status between ethnic and racial groups are thought to be influenced by complex interactions between genetics, physiology, culture, socioeconomic status, and the environment. Cultural factors including language, religions, health beliefs, values, and behaviours may influence the propensity for child and adult obesity. An example is the common cultural misconception that a fat baby is a healthy baby. Additionally, grandparent attitudes, indulging behaviours and poor health knowledge when caring for their grandchildren may contribute to risk of childhood obesity. Our own qualitative work with Chinese-immigrant mothers in Australia has highlighted that Chinese grandparents give mothers advice that goes against dietary guidelines. For example, grandparents may advise mothers to give water, honey and rice porridge water to their infants prior to 4 months of age for extra nutrients. They also promote the use of formula at night so that the mother can rest as this is believed to promote higher breast milk production.

### Exposure to a slightly sweet lipid-based nutrient supplement during early life does not increase the level of sweet taste most preferred among 4-to 6-year-old Ghanaian children: follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^113iaTZf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence suggests that all children are born with the ability to detect sweet tastes, and that children prefer higher levels of sweetness than adults. The degree to which early exposure modulates sweetness preferences later in life remains largely unknown. The few studies that have examined the long-term impact of early exposure to sweetness on later sweet taste preferences have been observational. Compared with little or no history of feeding sugar water, the feeding of water or teas sweetened with table sugar, Karo syrup, or honey during early infancy has been associated with a greater preference for sweetened water at age 6 mo and 2 y, and for more concentrated sucrose solutions at age 6–10 y. However, the continued feeding of other sweet foods and beverages beyond early infancy may confound these observed associations.

Various types of supplements have been evaluated as part of strategies to address undernutrition during the first 1,000 days of life. One category of such supplements is small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS), which are made from vegetable oil, milk powder, peanut paste, sugar, and multiple micronutrients (MMN), and have been shown to have the potential to improve child growth and development in some contexts. They have a slightly "sweet" taste due to the added sugar (e.g. ∼1.6 g/20 g LNS) and milk sugar they contain, and acceptance and reported adherence have been good. There is no evidence that this small amount of sugar consumption by the mother would alter the sweetness of amniotic fluid or breastmilk, and it is also unlikely that it would affect the taste preferences of the offspring when given directly to the child. Nonetheless, given that LNS are novel products, any potential consequences with regard to sweet taste preferences need to be investigated. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the long-term impact of providing sweet-tasting supplements early in life, during sensitive periods of flavor learning, on sweet taste preference during later childhood. Examining this question in lower-middle-income countries is important because many of them are undergoing a nutritional transition involving the increased intake of foods/beverages high in added sugar and a rise in obesity rates, including among children.

### Early factors related to carbohydrate and fat intake at 8 and 12 months: results from the EDEN mother-child cohort [^116qDPtM]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Few studies have examined the factors explaining the variability in fat and carbohydrate intake during infancy. We aimed to describe infants' fat and carbohydrate intake and analyse the associations with infant and maternal characteristics and feeding practices.

Subjects/Methods

This study included 1275 infants aged 8 months from the French EDEN mother-child cohort. Carbohydrate intake, fat intake, added fat (vegetable oils and animal fats) and added sugar (honey, white sugar, brown sugar, jam and sweetened beverages) consumption were calculated at 8 and 12 months. Associations between these variables and infant and maternal characteristics as well as maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy, breast-feeding duration and age at complementary feeding introduction were analysed using multivariable linear and logistic regressions.

Results

Less than 5% of non-breast-fed infants reached the recommendation of consuming at least 40% of total energy from fat, whereas more than 95% of them reached 45% of energy from carbohydrates. Overall, infant and maternal characteristics and maternal diet during pregnancy were marginally associated with both carbohydrate/added sugar and fat/added fat intake. Nevertheless, age at complementary feeding introduction was associated with all outcomes.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that only a small proportion of non-breast-fed infants at 8 and 12 months reached the recommendations for fat intake, whereas a majority of them reached the recommendations for carbohydrate intake. As subgroups of infants with a higher risk of inadequate diet were not identified, the present results call for an improved dissemination of information regarding infant-specific dietary fat needs in the entire population.

### Impact of honey on post-tonsillectomy pain in children (BEE PAIN FREE trial): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^113YfLdv]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

All children stayed at least one night in hospital and were monitored with pulse oximetry, reflecting the normal course in the institutions. The treating team had the final discretion on discharge medications with the prescribed regimen: oral paracetamol 15 mg.kg ‐1 four times daily for 7 days, then as required; oral ibuprofen 10 mg.kg ‐1 three times daily for 7 days, then as required; and oral oxycodone between 0.05 and 0.1 mg.kg ‐1 6‐hourly as required. At least one dose of oral oxycodone had to be tolerated safely before discharge. Parents recorded medications in a medication diary. Compliance with simple analgesia was defined as taking three of the four available doses of paracetamol and two of the three available doses of ibuprofen on a given day. Once on the ward and tolerating food, each child received a test dose of either honey or placebo as per their assigned group. Children assigned to the honey or placebo groups were asked to take 5 mL of honey or placebo six times daily, preferably before eating. Children could continue with honey/placebo beyond the 7‐day intervention period.

### Vegan diet and nutritional status in infants, children and adolescents: a position paper based on a systematic search by the ESPGHAN nutrition committee [^116QjuTS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Exclusively plant‐based diets (PBDs) have become increasingly popular, and many parents adopting PBD are choosing the same dietary pattern for their children. Whilst some people are concerned about animal welfare, the carbon footprint of greenhouse gas emissions by livestock, and/or loss of rainforest for animal grazing, others are vegan for cultural and religious reasons. There is a growing perception that avoiding animal products may have health benefits in adults and that a PBD diet might be superior to an omnivorous diet, that is, a diet that includes both plant‐based and animal‐based foods.

There are various types of PBDs and exclusion diets (Figure 1) that may have different impacts on health. Vegetarians exclude meat, meat‐derived foods, and, to different extents, other animal‐derived products. Some vegetarian diets are classified according to the animal‐derived food source still consumed. For example, pesco‐vegetarians, consume fish and seafood, along with eggs and milk products, and ovolactovegetarians, consume eggs and milk, but avoid meat and fish/seafood(Figure 1). Vegans follow an even stricter diet in that they exclude all animal‐derived food, for example, honey, animal milk products and eggs. There are subgroups of veganism that are even more restrictive: for example, a raw food diet is based on unprocessed or uncooked plant‐based foods and avoids food heated > 50°C, and a fruitarian diet is purely fruit‐based. Breastfeeding is considered an essential part of early nutrition in vegan infants because, although it is not plant‐based, it does not harm animals. However, plant‐based beverages are gaining popularity amongst vegan parents who are seeking alternative options to traditional cow's milk and dairy‐based infant formulas or drinks. According to a survey by Euromonitor International, 3.4% of Europeans reported following a vegan diet in 2021. The percentage may vary from 1.8% to 4.5% of the population in Western Europe, the United States, and Australia; however, it is not known how strictly the paediatric age group adheres to a vegan diet.

### Impact of honey on post-tonsillectomy pain in children (BEE PAIN FREE trial): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^111BxJCX]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical re‐presentations were common (26%) and peaked around day 6, an improvement on our previous cohort but more frequent than in some centres in the United States. In line with previous work, re‐presentations with pain (11%) remained the most common, suggesting the need for ongoing high‐quality research to tackle post‐discharge pain at home. Only two of the 29 hospital readmissions were for pain only. Though the numbers are too small to be definitive, there was no signal of any increased infection or bleeding with re‐presentations (Table 2, online Supporting Information Appendix S4, Table S1).

There was significant dropout and missing data. Diaries were given in paper form and electronic questionnaires sent daily, with reminders if needed. Surveys were completed at home, and our research staff were unable to ensure consistent daily completion or validate medication use. Missing data are common in longitudinal studies, and restricting analysis to only complete cases is generally inappropriate. Due to the daily questionnaires and longitudinal design of the study, only 29% of patients had complete data; this is comparable with a study of Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure in a similar cohort.

Previous studies of honey on post‐tonsillectomy pain do not discuss missing data, apart from some excluding incomplete cases. Our analysis reduced biases associated with survey non‐response, therefore contributing higher quality evidence. Measuring pain scores at rest and with eating twice daily over 14 days, while more onerous for parents, gave us the best examination of recovery trajectory. Post‐tonsillectomy pain is worst in the mornings, worse with swallowing and lasts about 10–14 days, and honey could have potentially altered any of these. Of the eight previous studies with children using honey and examining pain, only two used both resting and swallowing discomfort; four monitored for 5 days or less; only one had 14 days of data; and two used scores only every 3–4 days. For example, reviewing pain in our cohort at day 7, without considering the days immediately before and after, one might erroneously conclude that honeys were significantly better according to parents (Fig. 3a).

### Perceptions and understandings of pregnancy, antenatal care and postpartum care among rural lao women and their families [^113TP135]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

It was also reported that fish net is put on the ceiling in the room where the newly delivered woman lies in order to prevent spirits from taking the souls of mothers and newborns.

Commonly husbands bury the placenta deep down in the earth under the floor of the house. It is considered dirty and therefore cannot simply be thrown away. A fire is lit around the place where the placenta is buried in order to prevent spirits and animals from reaching it. If spirits and animals touch the placenta, it is believed that it may cause the lochia to dry up, may inflict diarrhoea on the child, or even cause neonatal death. One husband said:

I buried the placenta under the floor near the stairs and made a fire near the place. It is believed that if we bury the placenta far from a house, the child will move away. Making the fire is [also] related to the belief that the umbilical cord will fall off quickly.

In fear that the placenta might be dragged out of its burial place by some scavenging animals, some people buried the placenta in a hilly place and did not turn left or right when they buried the placenta.

Some TBAs said that they encouraged mothers to nurse their newborns right after delivery and to give them colostrum. One said,

After delivery I did not suggest that they give any food or drink to the baby, but I suggested that they let the baby nurse at the mother's breast in order to stimulate lactation and make the uterus contract.

More commonly, however, women practiced the traditional custom of not giving the newborn colostrum, and waiting to nurse until breast milk comes in. They gave the newborn water to quench its thirst instead, sometimes boiled. One TBA said,

After delivery I suggested that they give water or honey to the baby to drink by using clean cotton soaked in water or honey and softly pressed to the mouth of baby because the breastfeeding was not ready from mother yet.

It was also thought that if a baby did not get water soon after birth, it could get jaundice and conjunctivitis. Some informants explained that if you give a newborn water, he will grow up to be clever.

### Esophageal button battery impactions in children: an analysis of 89 cases [^113s3NMf]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines in 2021 recommend administering honey (1 g) and/or sucralfate suspension (10mL) at home for cases of BB ingestion, as esophageal perforation is less likely to occur within the first 12 h after ingestion. However, this advice is applicable only in cases where there is a history of witnessed BB ingestion and in children older than 1 year old, as there is a small risk for infant (< 1 year old) botulism after honey intake. It's important to note that referring institutions may not provide honey or sucralfate while awaiting transfer due to lack of experience or unavailability of these substances.

Numerous animal experiments have explored therapeutic approaches to mitigate rapid tissue damage following BB ingestion. Previous research demonstrated that using an acidic solution, such as acetic acid, in cadaveric piglet esophageal tissue could help minimize esophageal damage. Irrigation with 0.25% acetic acid after BB removal was shown to neutralize tissue pH from 12 to 6. Additionally, various acidic drinks, including coke, orange juice, honey, and sucralfate, were found to decrease pH levels and reduce esophageal injury. Based on these findings, some authors suggest the potential benefits of administering a weakly acidic solution orally immediately after ingestion to reduce esophageal damage before emergent endoscopic BB removal. However, this intervention poses several controversial issues that require further research. For instance, it may not be safe to administer anything orally if esophageal perforation or tracheoesophageal fistula is suspected, as it could increase the risk of tracheal aspiration due to the BB being impacted in the esophagus. Overall, while these experimental findings are promising, additional research is needed to address safety concerns and determine the optimal timing and method of administration for acidic solutions in cases of BB impactions.

### Infant botulism, Israel, 2007–2021 [^111uU69J]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

We used other diagnostic tools, such as an electromyographic test that showed characteristic findings for botulism (e.g. a repetitive stimulation leading to an incremental response), stool PCR, and EndoPep-MS assay. The EndoPep-MS assay was conducted by the Israeli Institute for Biologic Research (Ness Ziona, Israel), as described by Rosen et al.

We retrieved clinical information about the patients from medical records in 6 hospitals. To evaluate the number of IB cases per live births in Israel, we used data from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics on live births during the study period. For each case, we collected the following information: demographic data (age, sex, place of residence, hospital where the patient was treated; clinical data (perinatal information, underlying conditions, and breast feeding vs. formula); information on environmental exposures (agricultural occupation of parents or living nearby construction areas), positive toxin test results or clostridial spore presence (as determined by culture or MLB) in honey, formula, soil, and dust from habitant samples; and clinical manifestations. Laboratory results included the toxin type found (A, B, or E), electromyographic features, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid test results. We also collected information on treatment protocols (e.g. use of antibiotics, supportive care only, and administration of antitoxin) and prognosis.

### Eating soup with nails of pig: thematic synthesis of the qualitative literature on cultural practices and beliefs influencing perinatal nutrition in low and middle income countries [^111uLoHd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Prelacteal feeds were particularly common in South Asia and were believed to have healing and religious properties. Whether in rural India "hot water, sugar-water, honey, mustard oil, tea, or goat/cow milk", or "sugar water (misri pani) and banana" in Bangladesh or 'Ghutti' (honey, butter mixed with sugar, glucose and other liquids) across northern India and Pakistan. In Pakistan for example mothers will not breastfeed till an elderly pious person gives the baby ghutti; believed to transfer their qualities to the baby. In Uganda, younger mothers tended to "give glucose", whereas older mothers tended to give "water, sugar, salt or tea".

Beliefs about maternal behaviour influencing the quality of breast milk are illustrated in this quote from elderly women in rural Nigeria, "in the past, a breastfeeding mother could not sleep with her husband because it would cause diarrhoea in her baby.but these days there are drugs everywhere". Prolonged breastfeeding while generally supported in traditional societies, can co-exist with abrupt weaning, as in the Tarok in Nigeria, who believe that pregnancy affects breastmilk making it unhealthy for the child:

In a traditional setting, the child should be up to one year, eighteen months, or two years plus before you stop breastfeeding. When you stop before then it attracts a lot of stories in the community. that you want to spoil your child, you want to start sleeping with your husband, and so on". (Older Tarok woman)

Traditional practices to see if breastmilk is good enough may still be practised in parts of Africa; for example "an ant was placed in the milk and if the ant died, the milk was considered unwholesome" (Ghana).

We found that colostrum was routinely rejected by most traditional societies, although change has been slowly occurring. Colostrum in Turkish dialect was referred to as mawu (new milk) or fro (dense milk); Turkish women believe that it should not be given to newborns as it caused "stomach ache". Indeed some women even felt "that colostrum can kill the baby because it is dense, dirty, old milk stored in the breast for 9 months".

### Content analysis of nutritional information in paediatric oral health education leaflets [^113CvDGY]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

There were some discordance between the informational content across paediatric dental health promotion leaflets and dietary and infant feeding guidelines in Australia. In addition, some dietary and infant feeding messages and imagery lacked clarity. Inconsistencies in similar pieces of information also occurred across leaflets; and few leaflets contained most or all of the pertinent dietary and infant feeding information messages to help prevent dental decay and erosion in children. Government Health Departments and other relevant agencies should ensure that advisory messages regarding diet and infant feeding, are clear, complete and consistent across all dental educational leaflets in Australia.

The core diet-related messages that should be included in ideal paediatric oral health leaflets are:
Infants should be exclusively breastfed until around 6 months of age followed by the introduction of solid foods; and breastfeeding should be continued until 12 months of age and beyond;
If infants are not breastfed, infant formulas should be used as an alternative to breast milk until 12 months of age;
Infants should not go to bed with a bottle of milk, soft drink or fruit juice;
The frequent consumption of added sugars in foods and drinks, and in particular sticky foods with meals should be limited;
The consumption of acidic drinks, in particular fruit juices and carbonated beverages, should be limited;
Drink fluoridated tap water;
Introduce a sipper cup from age 6 months;
Pacifiers should not be dipped in honey, jam or any other sugary substance;
Do not share spoons or other eating utensils such as forks and chopsticks;
Eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables daily.

### Infant botulism, Israel, 2007–2021 [^117R8r6k]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Clostridium botulinum is a gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacterium. It is ubiquitous in the environment, such as soil and marine sediment, and can be easily isolated from the surfaces of vegetables, fruits, and seafood. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) secreted by C. botulinum bacteria are among the most potent toxins in nature. BoNTs target motor neurons, and block the cholinergic neuromuscular innervation of striated and smooth muscles in multiple tissues. BoNTs are classified into 7 antigenic serotypes (A to G). Types A, B, and, rarely, E and F, are linked to infant botulism (IB). IB can occur when an infant ingests C. botulinum spores because of exposure to contaminated soil or agricultural products, notably honey, when the bacteria develop and release BoNTs into the intestine.

IB is a rare disease with a peak incidence among infants 2–8 months of age. IB is classically described as a flaccid descending symmetric paralysis, and recovery can take several weeks. The disease manifests in a wide clinical spectrum, from mild symptoms to life-threatening conditions, and often leads to a late diagnosis. The standard and the most sensitive and specific in vivo method used to confirm IB is by mouse lethality bioassay (MLB). Treatment includes monitoring, supportive management, and administration of antitoxin. In the United States, the mortality rate among hospitalized infants is ≈1%.

Since 1976, at least 3,350 cases of IB have been reported worldwide, 90% of them in the United States, the highest reported incidence in California. Many cases probably are unrecognized or unreported. The average incidence in the United States is 2.1 cases/100,000 live births, corresponding to ≈75–100 cases yearly.

Israel is a developed country with a high-quality and universally available healthcare system, and botulism diagnosis is conducted in a single centralized reference laboratory. Recent data on IB in Israel are lacking. The main goals of our study were to evaluate the current incidence of infant botulism in Israel and examine national epidemiologic and clinical data from the past 2 decades. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Rabin Medical Center (approval no. RMC 20–0972).

### Dry and dusty outback: infant botulism [^116dnhAw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Infant botulism is a rare but life-threatening neuroparalytic syndrome caused by intestinal colonisation of Clostridium botulinum resulting in a symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis. This gram-positive, rod-shaped anaerobic bacillus is universally found in soil with previous links to ingestion of honey and dust contaminated with C. botulinum spores. We present a case of a baby boy with this rare condition eventually linked to dust on a rural outback property. This young patient was ventilated for 90 days. Initial serology for botulism toxin was negative, although C. botulinum spores were eventually grown in the stool. The patient did not receive early treatment with Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (BIG-IV) as there was a low index of suspicion and a delay in obtaining a stool sample for nearly 6weeks due to constipation. This case highlights the importance of early treatment with BIG-IV when clinical features and environmental conditions in the remote Australian outback favour persistence of C. botulinum spores in soil without awaiting confirmatory tests.

### Notes from the field: infant botulism caused by Clostridium baratii type F-Iowa, 2013 [^111rDirj]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

The parents reported feeding the newborn ready-to-feed and powdered formula from the same brand. No other solid or liquid foods or homeopathic remedies or supplements were given before symptom onset. No classic risk factors for infant botulism were reported, such as exposure to honey or soil. The parents reported strong winds and minor construction in the area surrounding their home. Pets present in the home included cats, turtles, fish, geckos, sugar gliders, and a mouse.

Environmental samples were collected from 1) feces from all animals in the home, 2) food and water from the turtle enclosure, 3) dust from the vacuum cleaner bag and the windowsill and ceiling fan closest to where the child slept, and 4) potting soil from the only indoor plant in the home. Although Clostridium species were isolated in several of the samples, none produced botulinum toxin.

Through 2012, only 13 cases of C. baratii type F infant botulism have been reported in the United States; this is the third confirmed case in Iowa. Extensive investigations for an environmental source of toxigenic C. baratii have been undertaken, including for all three cases in Iowa. Unlike typical infant botulism caused by C. botulinum, no source has been identified and prevention strategies remain unknown for C. baratii. While C. baratii infant botulism remains a rarely diagnosed disease, health care providers should maintain a high index of suspicion especially in very young infants who present with new onset floppiness or progressive respiratory failure.

### Content analysis of nutritional information in paediatric oral health education leaflets [^113iAVPi]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Although dental caries has a multifactorial aetiology, dietary sugars play a significant role in caries initiation and development. In recent years there has been a call for oral health promotion to utilise the common risk factor approach as diets high in sugar have been linked to both obesity and dental caries. Although both of these chronic conditions are preventable, their prevalence in young children has been on the rise since mid-1990s raising concern over the consumption of foods high in sugar and fat.

Free sugars, which include added sugars and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices are cariogenic. The WHO recommends that both adults and children should reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, however the results of the 2011–2012 Australian Health Survey identified that 52.2% of children aged 2–3 years old and 68.5% children aged 4–8 years exceeded this recommendation. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest the cariogenic potential of different children's food and snack items. In particular, items such as confectionery, cookies/biscuits, cake, sugar-sweetened beverages, and dried fruit are considered to be highly cariogenic. On the other hand, fresh fruit is considered to be low in cariogenicity and items such as nuts, vegetables, and cheese and other dairy products are considered to be non-cariogenic. In light of this evidence, the key dental-related dietary messages in the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines and the 2012 Infant Feeding Guidelines are:
Infants should be exclusively breastfed until around 6 months of age followed by the introduction of solid foods and breastfeeding should be continued until 12 months of age, and beyond if desired;
If the infant is not breast-fed, infant formulas should be used as an alternative to breast milk until 12 months of age and putting the infant to bed with a bottle of milk should be discouraged;
Limit the frequent consumption of added sugars in foods and drinks, in particular sticky foods;
Limit the consumption of acidic drinks, in particular fruit juices;
Encourage the consumption of fluoridated tap water;
From 6 months of age milk and water should be offered in a cup rather than a feeding bottle;
Pacifiers should not be dipped in honey, jam or any other sugary substance;
Discourage sharing of spoons to limit the spreading of bacteria.
Encourage the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.

### Determinants of the introduction of prelacteal feeds in the Maldives [^115bBg9f]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study identified the determinants of the introduction of prelacteal feeds in the Maldives.

Subjects and Methods

A cohort of 458 mothers was recruited from antenatal clinics at two major hospitals in Malé, the Maldives. The mothers were followed up after birth at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. The child's birth, the type of infant delivery, the time breastfeeding was initiated, gender of the infants, types of prelacteal feeds, and feeding method were recorded.

Results

After birth, 4.1% of infants received infant formula from the hospitals, whereas 10.6% and 7.4% of them received honey and dates, respectively, as prelacteal ritual feeds. Factors associated with introduction of ritual feeds as prelacteal feeds included the infant being a boy (p = 0.05; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–2.98), attitude toward prelacteal feeds (p = 0.01; AOR = 2.87; 95% CI, 1.48–5.58), and maternal employment (p = 0.01; AOR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4–3.9). Higher maternal age was inversely associated with introduction of ritual feeds as a prelacteal feed (p = 0.05; AOR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.9). Introduction of infant formula as the prelacteal feed was positively associated with birth by cesarean section (p = 0.01; AOR = 4.6; 95% CI, 1.6–13.3) and inversely associated with maternal mother's feeding method being breastfeeding (p = 0.05; AOR = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04–0.6). Prelacteal feeding was associated with cessation of breastfeeding before 6 months (p = 0.01; AOR 6.0; 95% CI, 1.64–21.80).

Conclusions

Health professionals need to distinguish between religious and cultural practices in order to develop appropriate health education programs to reduce the unnecessary use of early additional feeds. Understanding the barriers related to the initiation of breastfeeding after cesarean section is also important.

### Infant botulism type Ba: first culture-confirmed case in the United Arab Emirates [^112LGzUk]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

We report on a 3-month-old girl with culture-confirmed infant botulism caused by a rare double toxin-producing Clostridium botulinum type Ba. This case was not related to honey-feeding. The clinical course was prolonged, with minimal spontaneous improvement at onset, and a period of fluctuating motor weakness and nasogastric feeding dependence afterward. Neurophysiologic studies produced normal results. Human botulism immune globulin was administered empirically on day 23 of presentation, with rapid full recovery. This case highlights the importance of pursuing diagnoses of infant botulism despite normal results of neurophysiologic testing and no history of honey-feeding. Our case also demonstrates a favorable response to human botulism immune globulin, despite the relatively late treatment.

### Patterns of complementary feeding introduction and associated factors in a cohort of Brazilian infants [^116RW3nE]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2 shows that, in ascending order, the median age at which complementary feeding (CF) was introduced varied, ranging from 60 to 330 days for infant formula and simple infant food/noodles/powdered soup/ready-made seasonings, respectively. Water/tea constituted the second-earliest group of foods to be introduced (median = 120 days). Sweet foods, such as powdered chocolate/flours and yoghurts, were introduced around 180 days, along with legumes and meat. The median age at which cow milk was introduced was 180 days (Table 2).

### The impact of propolis on catheter exit site infection and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients: a clinical trial [^111uT338]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Honey, is a promising preventive and therapeutic agent, especially against resistant organisms, thanks to its broad-spectrum antibacterial coating. The safety of honey as a medical agent has been confirmed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Honey is known to have antibacterial effects (when honey is diluted with water, the enzyme glucose oxidase produces hydrogen peroxide, which is an effective antimicrobial substance), favorably low acidity (pH of honey is between 3.2 and 4.5, which prevents the growth of microorganisms), and osmotic effect (honey is a supersaturated sugar solution, which leaves very few water molecules for the growth of microorganisms), and also to contain antioxidants and hydrogen peroxide (the presence of various antioxidants in honey including flavonoids, phenols, polyphenols, and vitamin C, give honey an anti-inflammatory effect). These features make honey an effective natural ointment for wound dressing. According to a systematic review by Saikaly et al. most of the studies conducted in the 5 year period have shown that honey is effective in healing various skin wounds. In a study by Israili in the United States, the antimicrobial benefits of honey, its use in treating burns, cuts and wounds (venous, arterial, diabetic, malignancies), bedsores, postoperative infections in adults and infants, and the effectiveness of honey compounds in preventing infection at the catheter exit site in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis has been extensively discussed.

### Impact of honey on post-tonsillectomy pain in children (BEE PAIN FREE trial): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^111bL5SZ]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical technique in tonsillectomy studies can also be a confounder. Previous honey studies used cold steel dissection predominantly; most did not state if electrocautery was used for haemostasis. The reduced tissue damage of a cold technique allows quicker healing and perhaps allowed honey to have a bigger impact in these studies.

Honey could also have a coating effect. Placebo had a comparable ingestion rate to the honeys and was similar to standard care for swallow discomfort, medication compliance and pain behaviours. However, the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure item ' eating less than usual ' was better in honey and placebo groups on several days. This may be evidence supporting a small demulcent effect. Any coating effect might have been diminished by low compliance, limited contact time due to swallowing, as well as the dilutional effects of saliva. Parents rated placebo less helpful for pain relief than honey on days 6 and 7 and the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure item ' refusal to eat ' was less in the honey groups. This may have come at the cost of increased post‐discharge nausea and vomiting and re‐presentations (Table 2 and online Supporting Information Appendix S4, Table S1). Though it did not lead to increased re‐presentations overall, increased early vomiting is a potential concern, as it may lead to dehydration and may increase bleeding risk.

Compliance with round‐the‐clock medications has long been an issue for children post‐tonsillectomy and, despite its sweet taste, parents struggled to reach the requested daily doses of honey or placebo. Most children in the honey/placebo groups took at least two doses per day, and only 15–20% complied with the suggested dosing of six times a day over the 7 days (online Supporting Information Appendix S4, Figure S2). However, even in those with better compliance (at least two recorded doses every day), no difference was seen in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. The amount of honey required to show an effect is unknown and dosing frequency was highly variable in previous studies. Two doses per day of honey may be insufficient to produce sufficient biological effect during the critical peak inflammatory days, when swallowing is most painful and children were less compliant. A higher number of doses taken may have produced a positive result, but in general these were motivated parents keen to use honey and children who had tolerated doses before discharge.

### Impact of honey on post-tonsillectomy pain in children (BEE PAIN FREE trial): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^111REFUf]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tonsillectomy remains one of the most common childhood surgical procedures. Recovery is often difficult with pain (particularly on swallowing), poor oral intake and risk of haemorrhage and infection. For many children, pain after tonsillectomy represents the worst part of the experience. Studies report medical representations as high as 50–70% for pain. Factors including the risk of haemorrhage or an increased risk of respiratory events complicate post‐tonsillectomy pain management. Medication compliance is a contributing factor to poor pain management, due to misperceptions of parents and reluctance of children to take medications, often exacerbated by poor palatability or adverse effects.

Honey is a natural product with antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory bioactivities. Its medical use dates to the ancient Egyptians. Antimicrobial properties of honeys are associated with their high osmolarity (up to 21% water content and 60–85% sugar content) and low pH. Honeys derived from certain floral sources exceed these baseline effects, for example in peroxidase honeys due to hydrogen peroxide and in non‐peroxide honeys (e.g. Manuka) due to methyl glyoxal.

A recent review reported that six of eight randomised controlled trials showed improved pain scores in children using honey post‐tonsillectomy. A systematic review of 64 studies found that honey reduced pain and analgesic use, but the grade of the evidence was 'low' to 'very low'. Furthermore, in many of these studies, paracetamol was the only analgesic. Many centres include anti‐inflammatories and/or opioids as part of their discharge medications. Therefore, there is a need to study honey in the setting of multimodal analgesia post‐discharge. Another question, unaddressed in previous studies, is whether the observed beneficial effect of honey stems from its inherent bioactivity or is simply due to its demulcent or coating effect.

We designed a multicentre, double‐blinded, randomised controlled trial investigating the impact of two different honeys administered for 7 days on postoperative pain scores and the recovery trajectory in children following tonsillectomy compared with placebo (a sugar syrup with similar sugar content and consistency to honey) and standard care.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^112GkSs5]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

The BAT package insert states that no data are available to assess the presence or absence of BAT in human milk, the effects on breastfed children, or the effects on milk production or excretion. BAT's molecular weight (150,000 daltons) might prevent BAT from entering breast milk. Few infants have received BAT. One study found that an infant aged 10 days was treated with BAT without any known adverse events, and another study found that a neonate developed a low-grade fever within 1 hour of receiving BAT that continued intermittently for 72 hours.

Recommendations

Treat breastfeeding women in accordance with recommendations in the treatment section of these guidelines (see Treatment Considerations).
If the mother continues to breastfeed, monitor the infant closely for signs and symptoms of botulism and for adverse events from BAT.
Although the risk for acquiring botulism from the breast milk of mothers who have botulism and do not receive antitoxin treatment is unknown, clinicians and family members should be aware that botulism is a life-threatening illness and that the delay between a request for antitoxin to administration of the antitoxin is typically 1–2 days. Interruption of breastfeeding for this period would have minor to no consequences for the child but could affect maternal milk supply and lead to a serious breast infection. If the decision is made to temporarily stop breastfeeding, the mother should express her milk and throw it away until administration of the antitoxin. This should be done with support from a lactation specialist.

### Impact of honey on post-tonsillectomy pain in children (BEE PAIN FREE trial): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^113ek8F8]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

A modified version of the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure score was used, by omitting the 11th item which made little sense for tonsillectomies. Due to this amendment, the reference cut‐off values used (6/14 and 9/14 rather than 15) may be less valid and potentially under‐reported numbers with moderate and severe pain. In one study validating the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure in children following tonsillectomy, items 11 and 15 were missing most frequently and authors suggested dropping them in a reduced item score. In that study, for every point increase in the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure total score the FPS‐R increased by about 0.4. In addition, due to high rates of missing data and high number of items, only total Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure scores were imputed and used. It is generally recommended that individual item scores be imputed. Daily re‐presentations were not imputed and were likely under‐reported due to dropouts.

Sample size calculations assumed a mean clinically significant difference of 1 point in the FPS‐R; thus, this study was underpowered to detect the actual differences in FPS‐R scores. This indicates a broader problem with assessing postoperative pain; the variation, even within treatment groups, is too large to detect small differences, unless the sample size is increased substantially. Previous studies in acute pain have suggested a minimum clinically significant difference of 2/10 for the FPS‐R scale; thus, we concluded that there was no clinically important difference on any day. Parents and children were instructed on the FPS‐R scale as part of discharge education, but comprehension was not assessed. Additionally, for children aged < 6 y, parent reported pain scores were used.

The study was performed using a standardised surgical technique to achieve haemostasis, standardised post‐surgical analgesia and the honeys used were from Western Australia. These may limit the generalisability to those using different surgical techniques, honey or analgesia regimes but the study is larger than previous studies, was performed across three centres and the analgesic regime chosen is in line with international recommendations. We had a low response rate to our follow‐up questionnaire; these were sent out, in error, only at the end of the study, which may have affected recollection and compliance. All parents were asked about honey, which in the control group added to the low response rate.

Parents/guardians documented pain scores using a paper diary for 14 days postoperatively (online Supporting Information Appendix S1). Self‐reported pain scores were determined four times daily using the Face Pain Scale Revised (FPS‐R), twice to assess the background or 'at rest' pain intensity and twice with swallowing. Pain scores were collected in the morning around breakfast (AM rest and AM swallow), then repeated around the evening meal (PM rest and PM swallow). Parental proxies were used for children aged < 6 y. Parents were also asked to complete a slightly modified Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure daily, with question 11, ' Try not to bump the sore area of his/her body ' excluded as it was not relevant to the postoperative course following tonsillectomy. The 15‐item observational Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure tool has been validated following tonsillectomy, with a score of 6 signifying important pain (equivalent to FPS‐R of 2.8/10) and a score of 9 signifying significant pain (FPS‐R score of 6/10). Details of analgesic use and unplanned medical presentations were recorded for 14 days or until the child was pain‐free without analgesia. Parents were sent a REDCap link each evening to transfer data from their diary. If 2 days in succession were missed, research staff would collect responses by telephone. One week following the daily questionnaires, carers were provided with a survey that recorded a global satisfaction score for treatment (using a numerical rating scale NRS‐11) and asked to evaluate which honey group they thought they were in and if honey had helped.

Bee and wasp stings — background and risks note that "Stings from bees, wasps, and hornets commonly result in small local reactions consisting of pain, swelling, and itching", yet "Stinging bees, wasps, and hornets result in ≈60 deaths per year in the United States". "Most deaths are due to anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that may include rapid development of difficulty breathing, tongue or throat swelling, lightheadedness (a possible symptom of low blood pressure), vomiting, and disseminated hives". Death can also occur "from massive envenomation, generally from at least 20 stings by large hornets or hundreds of stings from honeybees". "The honeybee has a barbed stinger that often remains in the skin after the sting and can continue to deliver venom for up to 60 seconds", whereas "Other species of bees, wasps, and hornets have smooth stingers and can sting multiple times". Many with prior anaphylaxis carry autoinjectors, and "First aid providers may be called on to assist people experiencing anaphylaxis to self-administer this medication", while "Intranasal and sublingual formulations of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis were not available in the United States or Canada at the time of guideline development".

B. pseudomallei

Melioidosis is also not a notifiable disease in the Netherlands. However, Birnie et al. identified 33 returning travelers who had this disease over the past 25 years. During 2009–2019, the average annual incidence was 1.1 cases/10 million persons (range 0‒5 total cases/year) in the Netherlands.

C. botulinum Toxin

The incidence of botulism ranged from 0 to 2 cases/year, resulting in an average annual incidence of 0.2 cases/10 million persons. In 2012, two unrelated cases of infant botulism were reported, 1 possibly related to honey consumption and 1 that did not have a suspected source. In 2016, two additional case-patients were given diagnoses of autochthonously acquired botulism in the Netherlands. The first case-patient was a young man from eastern Europe who had no confirmed exposure. The second case-patient had suspected foodborne botulism, possibly related to the use of glass jars for home preservation of food, which is associated with botulism.

C. burnetii

During 2007‒2010, an epidemic of Q fever occurred in the Netherlands that was related to goat farming and had a peak of 2,424 cases in 2009. This epidemic was the largest recorded outbreak globally. Since then, preventative measures have been taken, and the annual incidence has decreased to preoutbreak levels. For the total 2009–2019 period, the average annual incidence of C. burnetii was 171.2 cases/10 million persons. However, during the last 5 years of the study period (2015–2019), the average incidence was 10.8 cases/10 million persons (14 to 26 cases/year).

### Dirty and 40 days in the wilderness: eliciting childbirth and postnatal cultural practices and beliefs in Nepal [^1141cHbN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The majority of women in the qualitative interviews reported that they discarded their colostrum, which they felt was inadequate in nutritional value. Whilst this is contrary to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation that breastfeeding should commence in the first hour after birth; it is significant because it indicates that women were actively expressing colostrum. This is vital in terms of stimulating their breast-milk supply. This may be why the practice of discarding colostrum as done in South-East Asia is not as detrimental as previously thought. Although, this is less than ideal in terms of the beneficial constituents of colostrum and definitely harmful if other substances are given, such as honey, butter or unclean water. Breastfeeding rates are high in Nepal (although not necessarily exclusively breastfeeding) when compared with UK rates at 6 weeks and 6 months, but not on the first day or two, as is common in South Asia. Some authors have suggested that women in South Asia generally do not breastfeed on the first or second day; but they do stimulate their breasts for the milk supply. Breastfeeding statistics for the UK show reasonably high initiation rates (81%) but at 6 to 8 weeks the prevalence is down to only 47.2%. Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of infection (colostrum contains elevated concentrations of multiple antimicrobial proteins), prevention of dehydration and hypoglycaemia in babies and reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer in mothers and increased mother-baby bonding. Breastfeeding has short and long-term health benefits for both baby and mother. Potential long-term health benefits in children include reduced blood pressure, cholesterol concentrations, and obesity.

The literature illustrates that alcohol plays an important role in both birth and the postpartum period. In Nepal the Tamang mothers drink jad during their pregnancy and post-pregnancy, similar to the 'god-sips'. The term 'god-sips' is thought to have arisen because when a woman went into labour, her 'gossips' were sent forth to gather for merriment and to partake in a drink at the labour. Indeed the drinking midwife is mentioned in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night: "like aqua vitae with a midwife". In the Tamang community jad, an alcohol, is taken during pregnancy and post-pregnancy to celebrate the birth, and Gurung women may drink it to put the child to sleep during breastfeeding as alcohol will certainly pass into the breast-milk.

### Impact of honey on post-tonsillectomy pain in children (BEE PAIN FREE trial): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^1174gKcM]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Between November 2019 and July 2021, 749 children were screened for inclusion, of which 400 were recruited and allocated randomly to a treatment group (Fig. 1); nine children were subsequently removed from the intention‐to‐treat analysis. Of the 391 children included, 97% (n = 381) received a flexible supraglottic airway and 3% (n = 10) had a tracheal tube. Inhalational induction was used for 86% (n = 338). Patient characteristics and intra‐operative factors were reasonably uniform across groups (Table 1). The characterisation of the honeys was as expected (online Supporting Information Appendix S3), with the two natural honeys showing additional antibacterial and antioxidant activity to placebo.

Table 1
Patient characteristics and intra‐operative details children allocated to different treatment groups after tonsillectomy. Values are median (IQR[range]), number (proportion) or mean (SD).

Twenty percent of children withdrew or were lost to follow‐up, with the highest loss (n = 25, 26%) in the placebo group and the lowest (n = 14, 14%) in the Manuka group. The mean number of daily doses of honey or placebo taken in each intervention group dropped from three to two doses per day, over the 7 days (online Supporting Information Appendix S4, Figure S1). Most children taking honey or placebo did not take it on at least one of the 7 days (see online Supporting Information Appendix S4, Figure S2 for the proportion of patients who reported taking honey or placebo each day). Over half of each group continued taking honey or placebo after day 7 (n = 49, 51% in the Marri honey group; n = 51, 53% in the placebo group; and n = 58, 59% in the Manuka honey group). When conducting the as‐treated analysis, we defined compliance as at least two documented doses of honey/placebo each day in the first 7 postoperative days. This reduced the sample size to n = 97 (n = 32 in the Marri honey group, n = 32 in the placebo group and n = 33 in the Manuka honey group). Younger children were less compliant with honey.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guidelines 2022: assessment and management of hypoglycemia in children and adolescents with diabetes [^1157MTnb]. Pediatric Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of carbohydrate source is an important consideration for hypoglycemia treatment. In clinical practice, glucose‐containing products are recommended for immediate treatment because of their rapid absorption from the intestine. It is important to review the amount of glucose in the product to ensure adequate treatment is provided. When glucose tablets are not available, dietary sugars can be used. Glucose tablets result in a higher rate of relief of symptomatic hypoglycemia 15 min after ingestion compared with dietary sugars (hard candy, table sugar, jelly beans, fruit juice). If available, glucose‐based treatment should be the first choice when treating symptomatic hypoglycemia.

Although 15 g of "carbohydrates" are recommended for first‐line treatment by ADA, it is essential to note that the dose required for dietary sugars is not established and may be higher than glucose. For example, 40 g of carbohydrate in the form of juice results in approximately the same rise as 20 g in the form of glucose tablets. Likewise, sucrose requires a greater amount to provide the same increase in blood glucose concentration compared to oral glucose. Husband et al reported that glucose‐ and sucrose‐based hypoglycemia treatments resulted in timely resolution of hypoglycemia, although fructose‐based treatment (fruit juice) was less effective. Honey and fruit juice have been reported to be more effective than one sugar cube (sucrose) for treatment of hypoglycemia. Honey contains nearly 70% fructose and glucose as main sugars although composition differs depending on the geographical origin which may lead to variability in response. Jelly beans contain glucose syrup and although they cause glucose levels to rise, the resolution of hypoglycemia is slower. If a soft drink is used for treatment, ensure regular and not sugar‐free/diet forms is used for treatment.

### Developing the 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema in infants and children: key reflections on processes and methods [^117M3TDr]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

WHO standards and methods for guideline development

The 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema was prepared in accordance with WHO's standards and methods for guideline development underpinned by collaborative and transparent decision-making. These best practice standards and methods include the use of high-quality systematic reviews, diverse representation in GDGs, disclosure and management of competing interests and the use of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).GRADE is an explicit, systematic approach for assessing the certainty of evidence when conducting systematic reviews, and for translating evidence into recommendations, where the latter is supported by the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework. These frameworks help guideline development panels use evidence in a structured and transparent way to inform decisions when developing recommendations. The frameworks make explicit the domains used to assess interventions or options, the judgements made and the research evidence and additional considerations used to inform judgements. As one of WHO's normative products, a guideline and the recommendations it contains have clear definitions (box 1).

Box 1
What is a WHO guideline?

A WHO guideline is an information product developed by WHO containing one or more recommendations for clinical practice or public health policy.

A recommendation: is a clear, actionable statement.

This tells the intended end-user of the guideline what he or she can or should do in specific situations to achieve the best health outcomes possible, individually or collectively. This offers a choice among different interventions or measures having an anticipated positive impact on health and implications for the use of resources. This helps the user of the guideline to make informed decisions on whether to undertake specific interventions, clinical tests or public health measures and on where and when to do so. This helps the user to select and prioritise across a range of potential interventions.

Guideline development at WHO encompasses clear processes across three broad stages related to (1) planning and organisation, (2) development and (3) publishing and updating of guidelines, outlined in figure 1. Detailed guidance is provided on all elements of the process across the stages that should be done and who should be involved. Some elements of the three stages are iterative and require returning to preceding elements or looking ahead to anticipate, plan and make pragmatic but transparent and justified decisions to move processes forward. Details around the methods and approaches used for all stages of developing the 2023 WHO guideline on wasting and nutritional oedema are provided in the published guideline, which contains 21 recommendations and 12 good practice statements.

### Early exposure to sugar sweetened beverages or fruit juice differentially influences adult adiposity [^116wjoRJ]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Diet

When the children were two years of age, the carer was asked if between 15 months and 2 years the child drank cola, other fizzy drinks, apple juice, other fruit juices or fruit squash (a drink containing some fruit juice to which sugar was added), eliciting a yes/no response, although the amount consumed was not recorded. For the purposes of the present analysis, 'early exposure' was defined as any consumption of the above drinks before 2 years of age.

The child's diet at age 3 years was assessed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire completed by the mother or partner. From the foods available, to gain a general impression of the dietary style, various foods were examined as falling into the following groups. The choice of food items was based on an analysis of dietary patterns in this cohort that establish a processed food and healthy pattern of consumption.
Fatty foods: Burger and sausages; French fries; Fried food.
Sweet tasting foods: Chocolate; Sweets; Biscuits; Cakes; Puddings.
Fruit and vegetables: Fresh fruit; Green vegetables; Root vegetables; Salad.
Other foods; Fish; Meat; Pizza.

Each food item was rated as having been eaten 'never/rarely', 'once in 2 weeks', '1–3 times/week', '4–7 times/week', or 'more than once a day'. These responses were modified to reflect weekly consumption: never/rarely was given a score of zero; once in two weeks scored 0.5; 1–3 a week scored 2; 4–7 a week scored 5.5; more than once a day scored 10.

Subsequently parents completed a three-day dietary diary (one weekend day and two weekdays), when the child was 4 and 7 years of age. At 11 and 13 years of age the child kept a similar record. The records were checked with the parents or children, and were used to calculate the daily mean intakes using the McCance and Widdowson's Food Tables. Free sugars reflected any monosaccharides or disaccharides that had been added to foods, plus sugars occurring naturally in honey, syrups, and fruit juices. Misreporting of dietary data was assessed at age 11 and 13-years using estimates of energy requirement based on age, sex and body weight, and the ratio between the reported intake and estimated need.

### Taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomes [^112a571P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Definition of 'unprocessed sugar' and 'sugar‐added foods'

Consumption of unprocessed sugars and sugar‐added foods contribute substantially to overweight and obesity (WHO 2018). We define 'unprocessed sugar' for the purpose of this review ‐ on the basis of the definitions of 'sugars' and 'free sugars' given below‐ as monosaccharides (such as glucose, fructose, and galactose), disaccharides (such as lactose, maltose, and sucrose) and higher saccharides (such as cellulose).

Traditionally, the term 'sugars' describes mono‐ and disaccharides (FAO/WHO 1998). Monosaccharides include fructose, galactose, and glucose. Disaccharides include lactose, maltose, sucrose, and trehalose. Some sweeteners, such as corn syrups, also consist of higher saccharides. In 2002, the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Expert Consultation introduced the term 'free sugars' (Amine 2002). In 2015, the definition of the term was elaborated for the WHO guideline on sugar intake for adults and children. 'Free sugars' are defined as mono‐ and disaccharides (such as lactose, maltose, and sucrose) that are added to foods (WHO 2015a).

We define 'sugar‐added foods' for the purpose of this review ‐ on the basis of the following definitions ‐ as non‐liquid food products (i.e. this review does not include drinks, including SSBs) that contain artificially‐added sugar in various quantities, where sugar refers to monosaccharides, disaccharides, and higher saccharides (as defined above).

Based on the definition of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), added sugars are either pure sugars or natural products with high sugar content (e.g. honey) that are added to food during processing or preparation. In the preparation of a food product, sugars can be processed in any way, e.g. baked or cooked. Added sugar mainly appears in cakes, cookies, desserts, pies, and candy. "Specifically, added sugars include white sugar, brown sugar, raw sugar, corn syrup, corn‐syrup solids, high‐fructose corn syrup, maple syrup, pancake syrup, fructose sweetener, liquid fructose, honey, molasses, anhydrous dextrose, and crystal dextrose. Added sugars do not include naturally occurring sugars such as lactose in milk or fructose in fruits" (USDA/HHS 2000).

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^1136Sybk]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Guidance is lacking for key population subgroups

Evidence to inform recommendations is particularly scarce in certain subgroups, such as those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, who widely consume non-sugar sweeteners. This is concerning because recent evidence in humans shows that non-sugar sweeteners are transferred through amniotic fluid and breast milk to fetuses and infants. While the effects of early life exposure to non-sugar sweeteners on health are not well understood, this represents an important area for future research, especially given the potential for lasting impacts on taste preferences, dietary patterns, and metabolic risk factors.

There is also a dearth of available evidence in children, who may be more susceptible to the effects of non-sugar sweeteners because of greater relative exposure in terms of intake per kilogram of body weight and the fact that they are still developing. Exposure to non-sugar sweeteners early in life is associated with increased body fat and cardiometabolic risk factors in observational studies, although consumption of non-sugar sweetened beverages resulted in less weight gain relative to beverages with added sugar among children in a randomised controlled trial. In the absence of strong scientific evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics advocated for manufacturers to disclose amounts of non-sugar sweeteners on food packages and reinforced that more data are needed, especially related to long term intake.

### Non-sugar sweeteners: helpful or harmful? The challenge of developing intake recommendations with the available research [^117UTYF8]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Is there enough evidence to make conclusive recommendations?

Additional research is needed to inform more conclusive recommendations. We further propose that recommendations should carefully consider, when possible, how individual types of non-sugar sweeteners are, or should be, used among specific population subgroups. Additionally, we argue that the precautionary principle should be applied, which emphasises caution in the absence of conclusive scientific evidence, particularly regarding use in specific populations, such as pregnant and lactating women, young children, and those with diabetes. This is particularly important because evidence of potential harm exists; and, as highlighted in the WHO guideline, non-sugar sweeteners are not essential dietary components.

There are two points of view. At one extreme are those who rely on evidence from randomised controlled trials demonstrating favourable effects of non-sugar sweeteners on energy intake and body weight, while disregarding accumulating evidence demonstrating undesirable effects of non-sugar sweeteners from observational analyses, mechanistic studies, and small trials in humans. At the other extreme are those who rely on findings of animal models, or observational analyses or small mechanistic studies in humans showing potentially adverse effects on health and posit that non-sugar sweeteners should be entirely avoided. Given that both experimental and observational studies have important limitations, we intend to offer a more nuanced approach. We propose that while non-sugar sweeteners may offer a tool for weight management and glycaemic control in some people under certain conditions of use, widespread replacement of added sugars with non-sugar sweeteners may have unintended negative consequences, especially in some subgroups. As different types of non-sugar sweeteners may have divergent impacts on health, however, caution and further research are warranted.

Cow's milk before 12-months old Giving cow's milk to your baby before 12 months may put them at risk for intestinal bleeding. Cow's milk also has too many proteins and minerals for your baby's kidneys to handle easily. In addition, cow's milk does not have the right amount of nutrients your baby needs. Juice before 12 months Children younger than 12 months should not drink any fruit or vegetable juice.

Juice after 12 months is unnecessary, but 4 ounces or less of 100% juice daily can be provided. Check the Nutrition Facts Label to make sure the juice is 100% juice. Fruit drinks, fruit-flavored drinks, and juice drinks have added sugars and should be avoided. Whole fruits are healthier options for your child than fruit juices.

### Honey in infant feeding… [^114tFGSJ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION HONEY was extensively used in ancient times as a supplement in infant feeding, particularly with newborn babies. 1 In more modern times it has in large part been displaced as a source of carbohydrate by other sugars except in some countries of the Middle East and Asia, particularly Japan. In these countries, for practical reasons, honey has always enjoyed considerable popularity, and the science of apiculture is highly developed. This is readily understandable, since honey is found free in nature, is easily produced, and requires no treatment or preparation before use. In this country, honey has been used chiefly in rural areas and, even in these areas, only in a sporadic fashion. There were many reasons for this, but among the most important were the lack of uniformity in the product and our inability to produce honey in adequate quantities. In recent years, however, the beekeeping industry has been. VIGNEC AJ, JULIA JF. HONEY IN INFANT FEEDING. AMA Am J Dis Child.

### Remind families: honey can cause infant botulism… [^11111c2z]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

Recent reports of infant botulism serve as a reminder to counsel families on the risks of feeding honey to children under age 12 months. The AAP advises against putting honey in food, water or formula that is fed to infants. Processed foods containing honey also should not be given to infants. Honey contains. Clostridium botulinum spores which can grow and release toxins in an infant's intestines, causing infant botulism. It is the most common category of botulism, affecting 150 infants in 29 states and the District of Columbia, according to 2016 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Botulism Surveillance summary. Families cite a variety of reasons why they offer honey to infants, including tradition, infant preference and perceived health benefits. Honey-filled pacifiers have been implicated as a source of illness for four infants in Texas.

The Food and Drug Administration is now warning families not to use or purchase honey-filled or honey-dipped pacifiers. The pacifiers containing honey had been sold online and in Mexico. Honey pacifier use has been observed among indigent pediatric populations in Texas, with 80% of mothers reporting that they didn't know of the dangers to infants, according to a 2013 Pediatrics study. The Red Book outlines the following symptoms of infant botulism: constipation, followed by "decreased movement, loss of facial expression, poor feeding, weak cry, diminished gag reflex, ocular palsies, loss of head control, and progressive descending generalized weakness and hypotonia". Recovery can take weeks to months, according to the Red Book. Human botulism immune globulin administered immediately can reduce days of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay.

Administered through state public health officials, Baby BIG is an FDA-licensed antitoxin and the first-line therapy for naturally occurring infant botulism. If you suspect that a patient has botulism, contact your state health department as soon possible.

### Honey for acute cough in children… [^115y4QHi]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is honey an effective treatment for acute cough in children. Evidence-Based Answer For patients one to 18 years of age, providing honey for cough symptoms can reduce the frequency and severity of cough, as well as improve sleep for patients and parents, when compared with placebo or no treatment. Honey is no better than dextromethorphan for symptom control. 1 However, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of OTC or prescription medications for cough in patients younger than four years. These treatments often include dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine, which have potential adverse effects such as respiratory depression, hallucinations, dry mouth, and tachycardia. The authors of this review set out to determine whether honey is a safe and effective treatment for acute cough in children. Cough frequency was reduced with honey vs.

no treatment and placebo. The groups were not stratified by age, making it difficult to establish effectiveness among different ages of children. Cough duration was not included in the analysis because the studies examined only one night of symptoms for participants. Use of honey was associated with some adverse effects, such as nervousness, insomnia, and hyperactivity, although these occurrences were not statistically significant. Because of a lack of immunity against. Clostridium botulinum, infants younger than one year should not be given honey. In 2006, the American College of Chest Physicians recommended that children, especially those younger than two years, should not receive OTC cough medication because there were no clear benefits and definite potential harms. 2 This was later supported by the U. S.

Food and Drug Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics, both of whom recommended raising the minimum safe age for cough medications to four years. 3, 4 The findings in this study support honey as an alternative to the standard cough medications.
