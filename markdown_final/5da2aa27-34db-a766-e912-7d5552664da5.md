## Question

Corticosteroids for crohns flare

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of corticosteroids in Crohn's disease flares, including when to use them, which agents to choose, dosing and duration, what to avoid, and how to transition safely to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity classification. Then, I should verify the evidence for corticosteroids in induction versus maintenance. Next, I will compare conventional systemic steroids versus budesonide by disease location and severity. After that, I need to check dosing, tapering, and monitoring. Finally, I should confirm strategies to prevent steroid dependence and outline special scenarios like pregnancy, infection, and perioperative care, ensuring each point is supported by guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because treatment hinges on this. Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease is typically defined by significant abdominal pain and/or diarrhea with objective inflammation, whereas mild-to-moderate disease has less severe symptoms and often ileocecal localization; I should double-check that this aligns with contemporary guidelines and that objective assessment with CRP, fecal calprotectin, endoscopy, or cross-sectional imaging is emphasized to guide decisions and avoid treating symptoms alone [^4bfebf96] [^da6d6c41] [^5fee3572].

> Now, I need to verify the core principle: corticosteroids are for induction only, not maintenance. Multiple high-credibility guidelines consistently recommend corticosteroids for short-term induction in moderate-to-severe flares but advise against their use for maintenance due to lack of efficacy and substantial toxicity; I should confirm that this applies to both conventional steroids and budesonide, and yes, both ACG and BSG explicitly discourage maintenance corticosteroids, including budesonide, for this reason [^4bfebf96] [^b66a58eb] [^a0228267].

> Next, I will examine conventional systemic corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe flares. Prednisone or prednisolone 40–60 mg daily is standard, with clinical improvement expected within 2–4 weeks and a planned taper over about 8 weeks total; I should confirm that guidelines cap continuous use at 3 months and emphasize early introduction of steroid-sparing agents, which they do, and I should also remember the 5-fold increased VTE risk during steroid exposure and the high rates of steroid dependence without steroid-sparing strategies [^4bfebf96] [^2ce7b539] [^8cc7a525].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about budesonide being interchangeable with prednisone. I need to check where budesonide fits. Controlled ileal-release budesonide 9 mg daily for 8 weeks is recommended for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease because it achieves remission rates comparable to prednisolone in that phenotype but with fewer steroid-type adverse effects; however, it is less effective than conventional steroids in severe disease or colonic involvement and should not be used for maintenance, so I should be precise about patient selection here [^d62f6951] [^0ed1517e] [^3f6c0e10] [^a0228267].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy data so I don't overstate budesonide's role. Meta-analytic data show budesonide is superior to placebo for induction in active Crohn's disease but inferior to conventional steroids overall, with the caveat that budesonide's advantage in side-effect profile is most relevant in ileocecal disease; this supports using budesonide selectively rather than broadly substituting it for prednisone in moderate-to-severe or colonic disease [^6f3174b0] [^e78acb3f].

> I should confirm dosing and tapering specifics to avoid common pitfalls. A typical prednisone course is 40–60 mg daily until clinical response, then taper by about 5 mg weekly as tolerated to complete an 8-week total course; budesonide 9 mg daily for 8 weeks with a 1–2 week taper is standard, and I need to ensure we do not extend steroids beyond 3 months without a steroid-sparing plan in place, as guidelines advise [^4bfebf96] [^2ce7b539] [^3f6c0e10].

> Next, I should review how to prevent steroid dependence and transition to maintenance. Steroid dependency occurs in roughly 36–45% of responders within a year, so I need to initiate a steroid-sparing agent during the steroid taper; thiopurines or methotrexate are appropriate options, with thiopurines requiring TPMT testing and methotrexate given parenterally for better bioavailability; I should double-check that guidelines also support early consideration of advanced therapies in high-risk patients to reduce steroid exposure and complications [^0e79945c] [^34b8dd19] [^321f35f2] [^4f099672].

> But wait, what if the patient is high risk or has a complicated phenotype. I need to ensure I consider early advanced therapy in patients with stricturing, penetrating disease, perianal involvement, extensive disease, or young age at diagnosis, because step-up strategies with repeated steroids increase risks without altering long-term outcomes; trials like REACT and CALM, along with contemporary guidelines, support earlier biologic therapy to reduce major adverse outcomes and improve endoscopic healing, even though symptom control may appear similar initially [^055cf853] [^0fcccb56] [^4c91b83c] [^25a0cd33].

> I will now examine special scenarios that modify steroid decisions. In pregnancy, systemic corticosteroids can be used short term for flares when necessary, but risks such as gestational diabetes and hypertension should be weighed and steroid exposure minimized; in the setting of C. difficile infection, I should delay steroid escalation until infection treatment is underway and reassess immunosuppression case-by-case; perioperatively, I should attempt to wean steroids to reduce infectious complications; and in COVID-19, high-dose systemic steroids increase severity risk, so taper or switch to budesonide when feasible while continuing biologics that do not worsen outcomes [^94742246] [^b39e9c9b] [^b014110c] [^dc25648d] [^236d14ac] [^de2041a8].

> Hold on, I should verify inpatient management nuances. For severe or fulminant flares requiring hospitalization, intravenous methylprednisolone 40–60 mg daily is appropriate while arranging steroid-sparing therapy; infliximab can be initiated in the inpatient setting for severe disease, and I need to ensure we do not prolong IV steroids unnecessarily without a maintenance plan [^4a157b3f] [^98f06874].

> Let me reconsider the practical flow to ensure nothing is missing. Assess severity objectively, choose prednisone for moderate-to-severe or budesonide for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease, limit total steroid duration to about 8 weeks with a taper, and start a steroid-sparing agent during the taper; in high-risk patients, consider early advanced therapy; monitor for adverse effects including infection, metabolic effects, bone health, and VTE risk; and avoid using steroids for maintenance or for perianal fistulas without source control, where they are ineffective and may mask sepsis [^4bfebf96] [^b66a58eb] [^98f06874].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: corticosteroids remain effective for short-term induction of remission in Crohn's flares, but they are not disease-modifying and should not be used for maintenance; budesonide is a safer, phenotype-specific alternative for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease; and the overarching goal is timely steroid-sparing maintenance to prevent dependency and complications, with early advanced therapy considered in appropriate patients [^4bfebf96] [^b66a58eb] [^0ed1517e] [^4c91b83c].

Corticosteroids are **effective for short-term induction of remission** in Crohn's flares, with prednisone 40–60 mg/day for 8 weeks and budesonide 9 mg/day for 8 weeks as standard regimens [^4bfebf96] [^3f6c0e10]. They are **not for maintenance** because of high risks of dependency and adverse effects; steroid-sparing agents (thiopurines, methotrexate, or biologics) should be started during taper to maintain remission [^b66a58eb] [^e75f80e1] [^321f35f2]. Budesonide is preferred for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease due to fewer systemic effects, but is less effective in severe or colonic disease [^d62f6951] [^3f6c0e10]. Monitor for infections, metabolic effects, and bone loss, and limit total steroid exposure to ≤ 3 months when possible [^4bfebf96] [^db8cd7e5].

---

## Indications and clinical scenarios

Corticosteroids are indicated for **induction of remission** in acute flares of Crohn's disease, particularly in moderate-to-severe disease activity [^4bfebf96]. They are not recommended for maintenance of remission due to lack of efficacy and significant adverse effects [^b66a58eb] [^e778caf4].

---

## Recommended corticosteroid regimens

| **Corticosteroid** | **Indication** | **Dosage and duration** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Prednisone/prednisolone | Moderate-to-severe flares | 40–60 mg/day orally for 8 weeks, then taper | - First-line for induction <br/> - Not for maintenance [^4bfebf96] [^b66a58eb] |
| Budesonide (controlled ileal release) | Mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease | 9 mg/day orally for 8 weeks, then taper | - Fewer systemic effects <br/> - Not for maintenance [^d62f6951] [^a0228267] |
| Methylprednisolone | Severe/fluminant flares | 40–60 mg IV daily until improvement, then switch to oral | For hospitalized patients [^4a157b3f] |

---

## Efficacy of corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are **highly effective for short-term induction** of remission, with clinical response rates of 60–80% within 2–4 weeks [^d4572542]. However, they do not maintain remission, and relapse is common once therapy is discontinued [^e778caf4].

---

## Limitations and risks

- **Steroid dependency**: Occurs in 20–36% of patients, necessitating prolonged therapy and increasing adverse effects [^0e79945c] [^8cc7a525].
- **Adverse effects**: Include mood changes, insomnia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, infections, and adrenal suppression [^db8cd7e5].
- **Increased infection risk**: Particularly with opportunistic infections, including C. difficile and tuberculosis [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with alternative therapies

- **Budesonide**: Effective for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease with fewer systemic effects but less effective in severe or colonic disease [^d62f6951] [^3f6c0e10].
- **Immunomodulators**: Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate are effective for maintenance of remission and steroid-sparing [^e75f80e1] [^321f35f2].
- **Biologics**: Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab) and newer agents (ustekinumab, vedolizumab) are effective for induction and maintenance, particularly in steroid-dependent or refractory disease [^98f06874] [^4c91b83c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **ACG 2025**: Recommends oral corticosteroids for short-term induction in moderate-to-severe flares, with early introduction of steroid-sparing agents [^4bfebf96] [^556adbad].
- **BSG 2025**: Recommends systemic corticosteroids for induction, not exceeding 8 weeks, and avoidance of corticosteroids for maintenance [^2ce7b539] [^b66a58eb].
- **ECCO 2024**: Emphasizes treat-to-target strategies and early introduction of immunomodulators or biologics to minimize steroid exposure [^5fee3572] [^a4e00c6f].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess response, detect adverse effects, and guide tapering. This includes clinical assessment, **laboratory tests** (CBC, liver function, glucose, electrolytes), and **bone density monitoring** with long-term use. Objective assessment with endoscopy or cross-sectional imaging helps confirm remission and guide maintenance therapy [^da6d6c41].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Corticosteroids are considered safe for short-term use, but prolonged use increases risks of gestational diabetes and hypertension [^b39e9c9b].
- **Pediatric patients**: Exclusive enteral nutrition is preferred for induction; corticosteroids are reserved for refractory cases [^72b7a2ec].
- **Perianal disease**: Corticosteroids are ineffective and contraindicated without drainage and antibiotics [^cd6098f5].

---

Corticosteroids are effective for **short-term induction** of remission in Crohn's flares but are not for maintenance. Budesonide is preferred for mild-to-moderate ileocecal disease, while prednisone is used for moderate-to-severe flares. Early introduction of steroid-sparing agents is essential to maintain remission and minimize adverse effects.

### Corticosteroids in Crohn's disease [^2aa22007]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a lifelong illness characterized by chronic recurrent flares. The precise etiology of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, it appears to involve an enhanced systemic immune response and intensified local intestinal mucosal inflammatory activity, mediated through various inflammatory cells and an array of proinflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment of Crohn's disease. The controlled trials of the National Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study and the European Cooperative Crohn's Disease Study established that corticosteroids were effective for the induction of remission in Crohn's disease for the duration of the studies (6–17 wk). However, corticosteroids have not been shown to have an impact on the maintenance of long term remission in patients with Crohn's disease. In addition, they are associated with a high potential for dependence and serious toxic side effects. Alternative classes of medical therapy for Crohn's disease, including modified corticosteroids and a group of new biological therapies, have proven to be efficacious in the management of active and/or quiescent Crohn's disease.

Background

Corticosteroids continue to play a central role in induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. However, their use comes at a price of significant adverse effects when used repeatedly or for extended periods. Newer corticosteroid agents with limited systemic bioavailability offer a tantalizing option, if they can be shown to be efficacious and safer than conventional corticosteroids. Budesonide is the main alternative corticosteroid currently available in an enteric formulation.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of oral budesonide for the treatment of acute flares of Crohn's disease. A secondary but important endpoint was to evaluate the adverse effect profile.

Search Strategy

The following sources were used to search the literature for potentially relevant papers and trials. 1. A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE from 1986 onwards. 2. Hand searching the reference lists of trials and review articles identified by means of the computer- assisted search. 3. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings were manually searched from 1990 onwards. 4. Contact with the relevant pharmaceutical companies that have been involved in the development of budesonide.

Selection Criteria

Potentially relevant articles were reviewed in an independent unblinded fashion by two authors to determine if they met the criteria specified below: 1) STUDY POPULATION: Patients of any age with acutely active Crohn's disease, as defined by a CDAI > 150. 2) METHODOLOGY: Randomized double blind controlled trials comparing budesonide to a control treatment. Patients in the control arm may have received placebo, conventional corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid or sulfasalazine. 3) OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical remission was the outcome measure of interest. The definition of remission was usually a CDAI < 150 by 8 to 16 weeks of therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible articles were reviewed in duplicate and the results of the primary research trials were abstracted onto specially designed data extraction forms. The proportion of patients achieving remission in the active treatment and control groups of each study were derived from the data provided in the original research papers. Where possible, data were broken down based on site of disease or other strata used by the individual trials.

Statistical Analysis

Data extracted from the original research articles were converted, where necessary, into individual 2 x 2 tables (remission versus no remission x budesonide versus control) for each of the individual studies. Where available, individual 2 x 2 tables for strata within studies were also used. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested for using the chi-square test. Because this is a relatively insensitive test for the presence of heterogeneity, a p-value of 0.10 was regarded as statistically significant. Where p < 0.10 the data from the individual studies were still combined but the pooled results were interpreted with caution. The 2 x 2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel. A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data. The analysis was performed initially by combining data from all trials to estimate the response rate to budesonide therapy. The analysis was also performed by combining only studies with comparable control groups.

Main Results

Eight studies were deemed eligible for review.

Efficacy

Budesonide was superior to placebo for induction of remission with a pooled odds ratio for the two placebo-controlled trials of 2.85 (95% CI 1.67–4.87). A single trial comparing budesonide with mesalamine demonstrated an odds ratio of 2.80 (95% CI 1.50–5.20) in favour of budesonide over mesalamine for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. However, budesonide was inferior to conventional corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) for induction of remission with a pooled odds ratio for the five trials of 0.69 (95% CI 0.51–0.95).

Safety

The two trials comparing budesonide versus placebo (Greenberg 1994; Tremaine 2002) showed no difference between study groups for proportion of reported corticosteroid-related adverse effects with the pooled odds ratio for both trials of 0.98 (95% CI 0.58–1.67). Five trials comparing budesonide versus prednisone showed the budesonide study group had fewer reported corticosteroid-related adverse effects than the prednisone study group (pooled odds ratio was 0.38 (95% CI 0.28–0.53).

Authors' Conclusions

With disease in the ileum or ascending colon, budesonide offers an effective therapy which is somewhat less efficacious but with fewer adverse effects than conventional corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, or 6-methylprednisolone).

### Approach to corticosteroid-dependent and corticosteroid-refractory Crohn's disease [^0e79945c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are considered a drug of choice for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD), an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic recurrent flares of disease activity. However, among patients receiving corticosteroid therapy for induction of remission, 20% have corticosteroid-refractory disease and 36% of those with an initial response develop corticosteroid dependency within 1 year. Chronic corticosteroid exposure in patients who are corticosteroid dependent increases the risk for serious drug-related adverse effects. Withdrawal or reduction of corticosteroid therapy without exacerbation of symptoms is therefore recognized as an important goal of treatment. Therapies that have been shown to facilitate "steroid sparing' include the immunomodulators azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate and the antitumor necrosis factor-alpha monoclonal antibody infliximab. In corticosteroid-dependent patients, budesonide may be substituted for conventional corticosteroid therapy without loss of response and with less risk for toxicity, but its long-term efficacy requires further evaluation. A preliminary controlled study suggests that the investigational anti-TNF monoclonal antibody CDP-571 may also be clinically beneficial as a corticosteroid-sparing agent. This review summarizes the clinical evidence that supports consideration of these agents as alternatives in patients with CD who are dependent on, refractory to, or intolerant of conventional corticosteroid therapy.

Moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease — corticosteroids: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Prednisone-equivalent dosing for active disease ranges from 40 to 60 mg/d, and the use of corticosteroids should not exceed 3 continuous months without attempting to introduce corticosteroid-sparing agents. Even short-term use may be accompanied by adverse events including venous thromboembolic events (5-fold increased risk). Despite effectiveness for symptom control, nearly 1 in 4 patients will have prolonged exposure to corticosteroids (greater than 6 months) with approximately 15% of patients becoming steroid-dependent.

Introduction

Crohn's disease is a chronic, relapsing form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by recurrent flares that can lead to progressive bowel damage. Conventional management involves treatment of acute flares with corticosteroids and, where required, addition of immunomodulators and advanced therapies to achieve sustained remission. However, the disease course and clinical outcomes for a newly diagnosed patient are highly uncertain. The frequency and severity of flares, likelihood of response to any particular treatment, and rate of progression to complications requiring surgery, including the intestinal strictures and fistulae that characterise Crohn's disease, are all unpredictable. The advent of biologic treatments, including anti-TNF therapy, has helped mitigate adverse outcomes but surgical resection is still required in 17–25% of patients within 5 years of diagnosis.

Ideally, a safe and affordable treatment strategy would be available that was effective in all patients from diagnosis. Thiopurines appear ineffective in this context and the efficacy of advanced therapies from diagnosis remains largely unstudied. Indeed, Crohn's disease trials usually enrol patients years after diagnosis and typically show benefit of active comparator over placebo of only 10–20%. However, one consistent observation based on both post-hoc clinical trial analyses and retrospective cohorts is that the earlier patients receive advanced treatments the more effective they are. Notably, D'Haens and colleaguesrandomised 133 patients within 4 years of Crohn's diagnosis to either infliximab induction followed by azathioprine or conventional step-up care. Remission at week 52 was significantly higher in patients receiving early combined immunosuppression. Similarly, the CALM and REACT trials, which enrolled patients with established Crohn's disease in flare, found that earlier escalation to anti-TNF therapy resulted in fewer major adverse outcomes than treatment with conventional step-up strategies.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory, relapsing-remitting, and progressive gastrointestinal disorder with an often-negative impact on the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Over the past two decades, the medical compendium for the treatment of Crohn's disease has increased significantly, enabling treatment beyond symptoms. Indeed, early and timely use of effective medical therapy has been reflected by improved outcomes with reduction in surgery and ability to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission, reduce corticosteroid dependance, and prevent long-term complications in more patients. In this review, we discuss the key milestones in the medical management of Crohn's disease.

Regarding medical management for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to induction of remission, mild-to-moderate disease, corticosteroids, ECCO 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate budesonide for induction of clinical remission in patients with active mild-to-moderate CD limited to the ileum and/or ascending colon.

### Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease with corticosteroids [^8de02caa]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are a mainstay in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Administered topically, orally, or intravenously corticosteroids rapidly and consistently improve moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, although they are ineffective in the maintenance of remission in either illness. The beneficial effects of corticosteroid therapy are counterbalanced by their many side effects. A better understanding of the mechanism of steroid action and toxicity has led to the development of novel corticosteroids that offer the promise of continued efficacy with minimal toxicity. This article reviews the role of conventional and novel corticosteroids in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

### Crohn's is not a 6-week disease: lifelong management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease [^0c2a4a2c]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract with heterogeneous clinical presentations. Crohn's is currently not a curable disease, and patients are faced with a lifetime of recurrent disease flare-ups and remissions. Management strategies for Crohn's must therefore be targeted toward lifelong management, taking into consideration not only the short-term but also the long-term aspects of the disease. With this in mind, here we review the classifications and natural history of Crohn's disease and discuss possible predictive factors for the disease evolution in a patient. Here we also evaluate the current preferable treatment practices, based on scientifically valid research and collective clinical experience, for the management of mild to moderate Crohn's disease.

4.3 Initial treatment of moderate to severe ileocolonic Crohn's disease

4.3.1 Corticosteroids

Statement 37. We recommend that moderate to severely active uncomplicated luminal Crohn's disease should be treated initially with systemic corticosteroids (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), but we suggest that those with extensive disease or other poor prognostic features should be considered for early introduction of biological therapy (GRADE: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.7%).

Systemic corticosteroids are still an effective initial therapy for moderate to severely active Crohn's disease, regardless of disease location, but every effort should be made to limit exposure. For less severe symptoms in those with ileocaecal disease location, ileal-release budesonide may be tried initially, but if ineffective, prednisolone may be required. For teenagers, particularly where growth has not completed, and for patients with diabetes or steroid intolerance, alternatives can be considered, including EEN.

4.3.2 Early use of biological therapy

In patients with an aggressive disease course or 'high-risk' poor prognostic factors, the early introduction of biologics may be considered. High-risk features include: complex (stricturing or penetrating) disease at presentation; perianal fistulising disease; age under 40 years at diagnosis; and need for steroids to control the index flare. The predictive power of these features is limited. There is great interest in biomarkers that identify a Crohn's disease subgroup at high risk of an aggressive disease course. A gene expression signature from peripheral CD8 T cells in active untreated IBD has been identified, and is now being tested using a whole blood assay in randomised controlled trials of a 'top-down' versus accelerated 'step-up' therapy.

The decision to start biological therapy should also consider factors such as stage of life, work absence and availability of other treatment options. Discussion in a multidisciplinary team meeting can be helpful. As well as anti-TNF therapy, vedolizumab and ustekinumab can be considered as first-line biologics.

Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease — steroids and thiopurines for induction: We recommend oral corticosteroids for short-term induction of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). We recommend against azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for induction of remission in moderately to severely active CD (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for articles in any language published up to Sept 17, 2023, with the search terms "Crohn's disease", "early disease", "combined immunosuppression", "treatment algorithm", and "biomarker-stratified". This produced no results. Dropping the requirement for "biomarker-stratified" yielded abstracts for three high quality interventional clinical trials. The Step-Up/Top-Down trial recruited 133 immunosuppressant and anti-TNF-naive patients with moderate to severely active Crohn's disease within 4 years of diagnosis. Patients were randomised to early combined anti-TNF and immunosuppressant induction followed by intermittent anti-TNF treatment to control disease flares, or conventional step-up therapy. At week 52, 61% and 42%, respectively, were in corticosteroid-free symptomatic remission (p = 0.028), with no differences in serious adverse events between groups. The CALM trial randomised 244 adults with Crohn's disease (mean duration 1 year) and endoscopic activity to tight control (treatment escalation for elevated CRP or calprotectin as well as symptoms) versus conventional management (treatment escalation for symptomatic flares). More patients in the tight control group achieved the primary endpoint of mucosal healing at week 48 (46% vs 30%), with no difference in adverse events. Although REACT was framed as testing early combined immunosuppression with a TNF antagonist and antimetabolite, its participants had an average disease duration of over 12 years. The primary endpoint of steroid-free remission (using a symptom-based score alone without corroboration by objective evidence of inflammation) at 12 months, was similar between the 921 patients treated with early combined immunosuppression and the 806 treated conventionally (66% vs 62%; p = 0.52). However, the composite secondary outcome of serious adverse events (complications, hospitalisation, surgery) was lower at 24 months in the early combined immunosuppression group. Although previous trials support earlier use of anti-TNF therapy, typically in combination with an immunomodulator, an accelerated step-up approach to the management of Crohn's disease, where treatment is escalated in intensity until the tendency to relapse is controlled, remains the most common strategy in the UK and globally. Under this strategy, the course of Crohn's disease, including the frequency of disease flares, varies substantially between patients and is unpredictable. To better understand the basis of these heterogeneous outcomes and enable personalised therapy in IBD a blood-based biomarker derived from transcriptional signatures in T-cell subsets was developed and shown in observational datasets to be associated with need for future treatment escalation. Testing its utility, however, would require a biomarker-stratified randomised controlled trial.

### Is top-down therapy a more effective alternative to conventional step-up therapy for Crohn's disease? [^49f481c2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease remains a challenge for practitioners to treat, and top-down therapy will be a continued area of research in the coming years. As advances are made in the field of monoclonal antibodies, the development of newer biologic immunosuppressing drugs will continue. However, given the costs and potential side-effects of the long-term use of immunosuppression, care should be taken in designing trials to ensure that well-designed treatment regimens with appropriate disease stratification and objective outcome measures can provide good evidence for future treatment.

In its current state, nevertheless, the mainstay of therapy continues to be based largely on imprecise treatment using either "step-up" or newly proposed "top-down" approaches. Research and evidence supporting top-down therapy remain limited. Combined therapy showed promising results over both early biologic and early immunomodulatory treatment and may be a recommended area for further study. Drug combinations, timing, and dosage are all areas that should be addressed. Considering this, we recommend that the most desirable treatment for a newly diagnosed Crohn's disease patient should be a personalized and tailored approach and that the disease should be stratified for each patient, taking into consideration the location, extent, previous disease course and severity of their Crohn's disease, as well as their comorbidities and the patient's personal preferences. Combined ("top-down") therapy should be considered for patients with complicated disease, with poor prognostic factors (e.g. diagnosis as pediatric patient, recurrent flare-up, steroid dependent, multiple failed steroid treatments), and extensive disease suggestive of an aggressive disease course (e.g. perianal disease, evidence of severe bowel damage and/or need for surgical intervention). Patients undergoing top-down therapy must be place under close monitoring to ensure their safety prior to their intensive treatment. Further research will need to focus on investigation into the genetics and pathophysiology of Crohn's disease. Only with proper understanding of the nature of Crohn's disease can one truly develop precision therapy that targets relevant pathologic pathways. If precise medications can be identified to achieve specific outcomes, a more personalized and targeted treatment may be possible.

### Crohn's disease: diagnosis and management [^d3de389b]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause lesions from mouth to anus and may result in extraintestinal complications. The prevalence of Crohn's disease is increasing in adults and children. Genetic predispositions to Crohn's disease have been identified, and specific environmental factors have been associated with its development. Common presenting symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Physical examination should identify unstable patients requiring immediate care, include an anorectal examination, and look for extraintestinal complications. Initial laboratory evaluation identifies inflammation and screens for alternative diagnoses. Measurement of fecal calprotectin has value to rule out disease in adults and children. Endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging are used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease. Treatment decisions are guided by disease severity and risk of poor outcomes. Patients commonly receive corticosteroids to treat symptom flare-ups. Patients with higher-risk disease are given biologics, with or without immunomodulators, to induce and maintain remission. For children, enteral nutrition is an option for induction therapy. All patients with Crohn's disease should be counseled on smoking avoidance or cessation. Patients with Crohn's disease are at increased risk of cancer, osteoporosis, anemia, nutritional deficiencies, depression, infection, and thrombotic events. Maximizing prevention measures is essential in caring for these patients.

4.4 Maintenance treatment in ileocolonic Crohn's disease

Statement 38. We recommend that systemic or locally acting corticosteroids should be avoided as maintenance therapy in Crohn's disease due to toxicity and lack of efficacy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Irrespective of whether remission is induced surgically or medically, corticosteroids are not effective in maintaining remission in Crohn's disease compared with placebo (see Section 5.2.8.1: Overuse of corticosteroids). Systematic reviews and pooled trial data show that budesonide does not reduce relapse rates over a 12-month period. One systematic review did show a modest reduction in CDAI scores, but this was outweighed by a significant increase in adverse events and adrenocortical suppression compared with the placebo groups.

4.4.1 Immunomodulator therapy

Statement 39. We recommend that for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease responding to prednisolone, early introduction of maintenance therapy with thiopurines (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or methotrexate (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) should be considered to minimise risk of flare as prednisolone is withdrawn (Agreement: 93.3%).

Relapse of Crohn's disease is common on corticosteroid withdrawal, particularly in moderate to severe disease, and early initiation of corticosteroid-sparing therapy is appropriate. Immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine or methotrexate are effective in the maintenance of remission of Crohn's disease.

4.4.1.1 Thiopurine therapy

Statement 40. We recommend that azathioprine or mercaptopurine can be used as monotherapy in the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Thiopurines should not be used for induction of remission in active Crohn's disease. Thiopurines are more effective than placebo in maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease but the Cochrane analysis reports low quality evidence (NNT = 9). A systematic review and network meta-analysis also showed the benefit of azathioprine/mercaptopurine compared with placebo in remission maintenance (OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3 to 2.6)), although anti-TNF therapy was significantly more effective than thiopurines.

### Management of active Crohn disease [^0e81ee2f]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Treatment of Crohn disease is rapidly evolving, with the induction of novel biologic therapies and newer, often more intensive treatment approaches. Knowing how to treat individual patients in this quickly changing milieu can be a challenge.

Objective

To review the diagnosis and management of moderate to severe Crohn disease, with a focus on newer treatments and goals of care.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE was searched from 2000 to 2011. Additional citations were procured from references of select research and review articles. Evidence was graded using the American Heart Association level-of-evidence guidelines.

Results

Although mesalamines are still often used to treat Crohn disease, the evidence for their efficacy is lacking. Corticosteroids can be effectively used to induce remission in moderate to severe Crohn disease, but they do not maintain remission. The mainstays of treatment are immunomodulators and biologics, particularly anti-tumor necrosis factor.

Conclusion and Relevance

Immunomodulators and biologics are now the preferred treatment options for Crohn disease.

5.2.8.1 Overuse of corticosteroids

Statement 98. We recommend that prolonged corticosteroid therapy is harmful and should be minimised by specialist intervention and involvement with the multidisciplinary team to explore other treatment options (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Corticosteroids are effective agents at inducing clinical remission, but do not have a role in preventing relapse. Steroid dependency is generally defined as an inability to wean below 10 mg of prednisolone or 3 mg of budesonide within 3 months of starting, or disease flare within 3 months of stopping steroids; steroid refractory disease is active disease despite taking up to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone for 4 weeks. Steroid excess is considered to be two or more courses of steroid over 1 year. A recent audit found that 14.9% of IBD patients had steroid dependency or excess in the UK, more commonly in UC than Crohn's disease. Prolonged steroid use (often defined as continuous therapy for more than 3 months) is associated with numerous side effects including increased infection risk, osteoporosis, suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, diabetes, weight gain and cardiovascular disease. There is evidence of increased mortality in IBD patients on long-term steroids, with a study in USA Medicare and Medicaid patients showing that prolonged steroid use (more than 3000 mg prednisolone equivalent in 1 year) carries greater mortality (significant for Crohn's, non-significant for UC) compared with patients starting anti-TNF therapy, with data from the TREAT registry also showing that prednisolone use was an independent risk factor for mortality. In an audit excessive steroid use was avoidable in nearly half of patients, was more likely to be avoided if patients attended a dedicated IBD clinic, and if there was a local multidisciplinary IBD team. Steroid use in the previous year is an important disutility included in the ICHOM dataset, and documenting assessment of alternative therapies and discussion with the patient is important for all patients on long-term steroids.

### A review of the therapeutic management of Crohn's disease [^ec3c9805]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In 1994, a newer glucocorticoid formulation, budesonide, was shown to have equal efficacy to prednisolone, with a 15 times greater affinity for glucocorticoid receptors, such that 5 mg of budesonide is equivalent to 12 mg of prednisolone. Budesonide has an added advantage of a high first pass liver metabolism and rapid elimination, resulting in minimal systemic absorption and thereby reducing the risk of steroid-induced side effects. While budesonide 9 mg once daily has been shown to be superior than placebo in inducing remission for patients with mild to moderate ileocaecal CD (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.52–5.39), budesonide was inferior to prednisolone for the induction of clinical remission in severe ileocaecal CD or in colonic CD (relative risk (RR): 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28–0.95).

Corticosteroids remained the mainstay for induction therapy until the late 1990swhen evidence began showing that they only induce complete clinical remission in 48% and partial clinical remission in 32% of patients with active CD. However, 20% of patients were found to be resistant from the onset, and at 1-year follow-up, 45% of the patients who responded initially became steroid-dependent with only 32% of patients maintaining a prolonged clinical response. It became rapidly apparent that corticosteroids were ineffective at maintaining remission, reducing flares, or disease recurrence.– The French GETAID study provided further proof that corticosteroids were not disease-modifying agents with limited evidence in their ability to achieve endoscopic mucosal healing or preventing endoscopic relapse. In this study, patients were given prednisolone 1 mg/kg for 7 weeks, and only 29% achieved endoscopic and clinical remission, with 71% showing active endoscopic lesions. In fact, 9% of patients had worsening endoscopic lesions despite symptomatic improvement. All of the above limitations associated with prolonged corticosteroid use make a compelling case for using newer safer therapies that maintain remission without exposing patients to unwanted side effects.

### An international consensus on appropriate management of corticosteroids in clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease [^278f1a3a]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Approval of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires rigorously designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Corticosteroids remain a cornerstone of IBD induction therapy and many patients in trials are enrolled while taking corticosteroids. Despite this, approaches to corticosteroid management in RCTs have been highly heterogeneous, often differing from clinical practice. This negatively impacts patients' willingness to participate due to prolonged corticosteroid exposure and may potentially bias outcomes in the clinical trial. Our aim is to provide comprehensive standardized recommendations on key aspects of corticosteroid use in IBD clinical trials through a multi-phase, international expert consensus, with a goal to help inform and standardize practice in future RCTs.

Methods

The consensus was informed by a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, which determined the corticosteroid management rules used in placebo-controlled trials of advanced therapies in IBD. International expert consensus recommendations for all aspects of corticosteroid management in RCTs were then developed using a modified Delphi process with two rounds of survey questions and a ratification meeting.

Results

These recommendations propose management of corticosteroids during screening, induction, and maintenance phases of pharmacologic trials in IBD, and define corticosteroid-related endpoints. We emphasize the need for minimizing corticosteroid exposure through expedited tapering and shorter fixed-dosing periods that more closely reflect clinical care, and provide recommendations for standardized definitions of corticosteroid-free remission.

Conclusions

These recommendations will serve to optimize trial design and facilitate appropriate, acceptable, and standardized RCT corticosteroid handling practices.

### Corticosteroids for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease [^e778caf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of corticosteroids in the setting of maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease has never been clearly demonstrated. It would be important to determine, based upon the currently available data from controlled trials, if the use of chronic corticosteroid therapy is of benefit in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease or if there is an identifiable subgroup of Crohn's disease patients, such as those in whom therapy cannot be successfully tapered, who might benefit from such treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of conventional systemic corticosteroid therapy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease.

Search Strategy

A computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic database MEDLINE of studies published in English, French, Spanish, Italian and German between 1966 and July, 2003. Manual searches of the reference lists from the potentially relevant studies were performed in order to identify additional studies that may have been missed using the computer-assisted search strategy. Proceedings from major gastrointestinal meetings were also manually searched from 1985 to 2003 in order to identify unpublished studies. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Review Group Specialized Trials Register were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving patients of any age with Crohn's disease in clinical remission as defined by a CDAI < 150 or by the presence of no symptoms or only mild symptoms at the time of entry into the trial. The experimental treatment consisted of oral conventional corticosteroid therapy (excluding budesonide, fluticasone, etc). Clinical disease relapse was used as the outcome measure of interest.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligible studies were selected by 4 reviewers and data were extracted onto standardized data extraction forms. Disagreements in eligibility or data extraction were resolved by consensus. Data were converted into individual 2x2 tables for each study. The presence of significant heterogeneity among studies was tested using the chi-square test. The 2x2 tables were synthesized into a summary test statistic using the pooled odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals as described by Cochran and Mantel and Haenszel (the 'odds ratio' in MetaView). A fixed effects model was used for the pooling of data.

Main Results

Four studies were initially judged as being eligible for inclusion. After obtaining additional information on one of the studies it was excluded because it was not double-blind. The total number of subjects included in the analysis at the time points of 6, 12 and 24 months were 142, 131 and 95 for the corticosteroid group and 161, 138 and 87 for the control group. The odds ratios for relapse on active treatment and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were 0.71 (0.39, 1.31), 0.82 (0.47, 1.43) and 0.72 (0.38, 1.35) at 6, 12 and 24 months.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The use of conventional systemic corticosteroids in patients with clinically quiescent Crohn's disease does not appear to reduce the risk of relapse over a 24 month period of follow-up. This review updates the existing review of corticosteroids for maintaining remission of Crohn's disease which was published in the Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2003).

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline for the management of luminal Crohn's disease [^510070f7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong illness with substantial morbidity, although new therapies and treatment paradigms have been developed. We provide guidance for treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active luminal CD.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to identify published studies of the management of CD. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a group of specialists.

Results

The consensus includes 41 statements focused on 6 main drug classes: antibiotics, 5-aminosalicylate, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologic therapies, and other therapies. The group suggested against the use of antibiotics or 5-aminosalicylate as induction or maintenance therapies. Corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide) can be used as induction, but not maintenance therapies. Among immunosuppressants, thiopurines should not be used for induction, but can be used for maintenance therapy for selected low-risk patients. Parenteral methotrexate was proposed for induction and maintenance therapy in patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD. Biologic agents, including tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab, were recommended for patients failed by conventional induction therapies and as maintenance therapy. The consensus group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressant therapies in initiation of treatment with a biologic agent.

Conclusions

Optimal management of CD requires careful patient assessment, acknowledgement of patient preferences, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### AGA reviews the use of corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and… [^cd6098f5]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are used for treating patients with a moderate to severe relapse of IBD. Topical agents like suppositories or foam have been used to treat proctitis, and enemas have been effective for patients with disease up to the splenic flexure. Budesonide, which has limited bioavailability and is poorly absorbed, can provide therapeutic benefit with reduced toxicity in patients with ileocecal Crohn's disease. For patients with moderate to severe IBD, corticosteroids are effective in managing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; however, they are not effective in treating perianal fistulas. Hospitalization for parenteral corticosteroids is needed for patients with severe and fulminant IBD who do not respond to oral corticosteroids and for those with severe IBD with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

RECOMMENDATIONS Parenteral methotrexate is used for inducing remission in persons with active Crohn's disease and for maintenance of remission in those with inactive Crohn's disease. It also can be used to initiate remission with corticosteroid withdrawal in corticosteroid-dependent patients with Crohn's disease. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support its use for inducing or maintaining remission in persons with active ulcerative colitis. Intravenous cyclosporine is effective for managing fistulizing Crohn's disease and should be followed with azathioprine or 6-MP therapy for maintenance of fistula closure. RECOMMENDATIONS An initial dose of 5 mg per kg, given by intravenous infusion over two hours, with three doses at weeks 0, 2, and 6 is recommended. It should be followed by maintenance therapy every eight weeks in those persons who are responsive.

A health care practitioner should supervise treatment and observe the patient for approximately one hour after treatment. In patients with Crohn's disease who initially respond to treatment and then lose responsiveness, 10 mg per kg of infliximab may be tried. Infliximab can be used to manage moderately to severely active Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in persons who do not respond to adequate corticosteroid or immunosuppressive treatment. Those who respond to induction therapy should continue with maintenance therapy every eight weeks. If the patient is nonresponsive after three infusions, treatment should be discontinued. If the patient achieves remission with infliximab, any concomitant corticosteroid should be withdrawn or tapered.

### Managing IBD in the COVID-19 era [^de2041a8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

IBD management in patients with COVID-19

Medical management

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it an ever-changing climate, with new lessons constantly developing. Consequently, this state of flux provides a difficult context for providers to guide patients without a wealth of available data. The optimal medical management of IBD patients found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 must be personalized depending on a variety of factors. To accommodate a personalized approach, multiple societies and experts provided consensus recommendations regarding a framework to approach COVID-19 in the IBD patient. The IOIBD, AGA, and European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) have recommended that infusions and therapy should be continued, with the exception of corticosteroids. Ungaro et al. provided updated data from over 6000 patients finding biologics to have no association with an increased risk of worsened COVID-19 outcomes and are safe to continue during the pandemic. Switching from intravenous formulations of anti-TNF therapy to subcutaneous routes is not recommended. Systemic corticosteroids (especially prednisone > 20 mg/day) have steadily been associated with severe-COVID19 in the IBD population, and expert consensus suggests that when appropriate, patients should be tapered off or switched to budesonide. However, the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 includes high dose steroids to combat the progression to ARDS. The RECOVERY trial found patients treated with dexamethasone to have a lower mortality compared to standard care in mechanically ventilated patients (29.3% versus 41.4%; rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.51–0.81). The effect of steroids is most likely related to the phase of the COVID-19 disease course. Early in infection, during viral replication, steroids appear to be harmful compared to a potentially beneficial impact later in severe COVID-19 when a more inflammatory response is present. Patients who present with an acute severe UC (ASUC) flare are typically also treated with parenteral steroids.

Corticosteroid response patterns in Crohn's disease — in the absence of immunomodulator or biologic treatment, corticosteroid dependency and/or resistance occurs in up to half of patients; population-based data from Denmark and Minnesota indicate that between 43% and 56% received corticosteroids in the prebiologic era and overall half were steroid-dependent, steroid-refractory, or required surgical resection within the subsequent year; in a Minnesota study in the biologic era, 1-year outcomes after corticosteroids were prolonged remission in 60%, steroid dependency 21%, and resection 19%.

### Managing steroid-dependent Crohn's disease… [^30458022]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease are those who respond to steroid therapy but cannot taper the treatment. Steroid-refractive patients are those who fail to respond to adequate treatment dosages of up to 1 mg per kg of prednisone within four weeks. Steroid dependency is common in patients with Crohn's disease who respond to prednisone treatment. Contributing factors associated with steroid dependency include cigarette smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. Clostridium difficile infection, and concurrent irritable bowel or chronic pain syndrome. Hanauer reviews the management of patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease. Symptoms should be evaluated to rule out visceral hypersensitivity or malabsorption, which can masquerade as inflammatory disease. Initial investigation should include a complete blood count; determination of sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level; and stool examination for leukocytes or lactoferrin, enteric pathogens, and.

The author concludes that patients with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease are best helped by reassessing the causes of the symptoms, eliminating potential exacerbating factors, employing surgery in select patients with localized disease, and using azathioprine or mercaptopurine. With the latter therapy, once patients are weaned from steroids, the purine antimetabolite is continued for an indefinite period while the physician monitors white blood cell count and liver enzymes. 1 discuss the management of Crohn's disease in adults. Presenting symptoms of Crohn's disease can include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. The differential diagnosis includes other inflammatory or idiopathic bowel disorders and irritable bowel syndrome. The impact of stress on symptoms is unclear. Disease activity is ranked depending on symptoms and the negative impact on a patient's quality of life.

Therapy should consider treating the disease first and then keeping the patient in remission. Patients with moderate to severe disease can be treated with prednisone in a dosage of 40 to 60 mg daily until symptoms resolve and weight gain resumes. Infliximab is a useful adjunct or alternative to corticosteroid therapy when the latter cannot be used or is ineffective. Because of the negative effects of chronic steroid use, an alternative agent should be used to maintain long-term remission. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine can be helpful after remission has been achieved with steroid therapy. In patients who have had ileocolonic resection, mesalamine, azathioprine, or mercaptopurine may help decrease the incidence of recurrence. — R. S.

Trial designs included both strategies: "In 4 of these trials, the primary intervention compared withdrawing an immunomodulator to continued combination therapy, and in 2 trials the primary intervention was TNF-antagonist withdrawal. One trial included 3 arms, comparing immunomodulator withdrawal, TNF-antagonist withdrawal, and continued combination therapy". Populations were largely in sustained remission: "Most patients enrolled in these studies were in corticosteroid-free remission for at least 6 months, with the average duration of remission exceeding 2 years", and follow-up intervals were substantial: "Follow-up time ranged from 12 to 24 months".

Severe/fulminant Crohn's disease — inpatient management key concepts and therapies are stated as follows: For hospitalized patients presenting with severe to fulminant CD, intravenous corticosteroids may be used to control inflammation and burden while evaluating steroid-sparing treatment options. Anti-TNF agents are effective for severe active CD and infliximab may be administered in the inpatient setting for patients with severe to fulminant disease. Intravenous corticosteroids, dosed at methylprednisolone 40–60 mg/d or equivalent, are effective for severe to fulminant disease in the hospitalized patient. Pivotal trials of infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol included patients with moderate-to-severe disease activity as indicated by the CDAI; patients with the most severely symptomatic disease, generally with CDAI scores greater than 450, were excluded. Clinical experience suggests that some patients with the most severely symptomatic inflammatory CD may respond to TNF inhibition, and for more fulminant cases infliximab may be effective, whereas the efficacy of adalimumab and certolizumab pegol in such cases is uncertain.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which is the 2 major forms of inflammatory bowel disease, are chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. During the last 30 years, the therapy for patients with refractory inflammatory bowel diseases is still challenging despite the fact that morbidity and mortality rates have been obviously reduced. The conventional management with corticosteroids has been modified by the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors and biologics. In this review, we focus on role in calcineurin inhibitors for patients with inflammatory bowel disease in the currently clinical practice.

Management of relapse under optimal therapy with immunosuppressives

The appropriate choice of treatment of a particular flare of CD is influenced by previous response to this treatment. This is especially true when patients relapse on optimal therapy to which patients strictly adhere. The panelists strongly endorsed the concept that biological agents should be initiated when there is relapse of CD in patients who adhere to optimal therapy with conventional immunosuppressives (100% agreement). The expert panel recommended that patients who have a severe relapse of CD within 6 months after a course of steroids should be considered for biologic therapy, because early administration of anti-TNF-α therapy is more effective than AZA monotherapy. However, it was also recommended that if a patient experiences a relapse of moderate severity, after long-term remission on immunosuppressives, restarting steroids may be appropriate; the response should be further assessed and, if the patient relapses again, initiation of biologic therapy should be considered (Clinical statement 3).

Clinical statement 3
Indications for early administration of biological therapy in newly diagnosed patients with moderate Crohn's disease

For patients either refractory to or intolerant of thiopurines, available options are to switch to MTX or biologic therapy. The panel reached consensus (100% agreement) regarding the initiation of biologic agents in patients who fail to respond to or are intolerant of or have contraindications to thiopurines. In this case, biological agents may be considered as a treatment option and MTX may be an alternative. Adding MTX to the biologic agent was also recommended to minimize immunogenicity.

The panel agreed that ECCO's working definition of severe CD as indicated by a CDAI score higher than 450 and persistent symptoms despite treatment with steroids is valid although again it is difficult to apply CDAI in routine clinical practice.

There was general agreement among panelists that the main difference between patients with newly diagnosed moderate or severe CD is that the later have more pronounced symptoms and require immediate hospitalization and more aggressive treatment whereas the former can be treated as outpatients. The panelists also agreed that outpatients recently diagnosed with moderate CD who have symptoms refractory to treatment with adequate doses of oral steroids should also be treated as patients with severe CD (Clinical statement 4).

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^2a46a912]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Crohn's disease — natural history and risk factors indicate progression risks and monitoring needs: Most patients initially present with nonpenetrating, nonstricturing behavior, but up to half develop an intestinal complication within 20 yr of diagnosis, particularly with ileal, ileocolonic, or proximal gastrointestinal involvement, extensive anatomic involvement, or deep ulcerations. High-risk features for progressive burden include young age at diagnosis, initial extensive bowel involvement, ileal/ileocolonic involvement, perianal/severe rectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis, and penetrating or stenosis phenotype. Over long observation, only 20%–30% have a nonprogressive or indolent course. Symptoms do not correlate well with active inflammation and therefore should not be the sole guide for therapy; objective evaluation by endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging should be used periodically. In the absence of immunomodulator or biologic treatment, corticosteroid dependency and/or resistance occurs in up to half of patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^da6d6c41]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — general management principles and objective assessment — are based on disease location, severity, disease-associated complications including extraintestinal manifestations, and factors affecting future prognosis, and the goal is to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission without significant adverse effects; objective evaluation by endoscopic, sonographic, or cross-sectional imaging is recommended, with improvement evident within 4–12 weeks and maximal treatment effect by 12–16 weeks, after which patients achieving response or remission are transitioned to steroid-sparing maintenance therapy; for continued active symptoms despite optimized therapy, evaluation with an objective study is recommended, and if symptoms or inflammation persist, assessment for medication optimization, addition of other agents, or transition to a different medical or surgical strategy is warranted; biomarkers such as CRP and FC can be assessed but should not exclusively serve as a treatment endpoint, and mimickers such as C. difficile, cytomegalovirus infection, and medication-related adverse effects should be excluded, noting that risks of C. difficile infection may be up to 5-fold higher among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

### Early administration of azathioprine vs conventional management of Crohn's disease: a randomized controlled trial [^489557b3]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Immunomodulator therapy is effective for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) but has not been shown to affect disease progression, presumably because it is given too late after diagnosis. We compared the efficacy of early treatment (within 6 months after diagnosis) with azathioprine versus conventional management of patients at high risk for disabling disease.

Methods

We performed an open-label trial of adults with a diagnosis of CD for less than 6 months who were at risk for disabling disease. From July 2005 to November 2010, patients at 24 French centers were randomly assigned to treatment with azathioprine (2.5 mg ∙ kg⁻¹ ∙ day⁻¹, n = 65) or conventional management (azathioprine only in cases of corticosteroid dependency, chronic active disease with frequent flares, poor response to corticosteroids, or development of severe perianal disease) (n = 67). The primary end point was the proportion of trimesters spent in corticosteroid-free and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-free remission during the first 3 years after inclusion.

Results

During the 3-year follow-up period, 16 patients in the azathioprine group were switched to mercaptopurine or methotrexate therapy because of intolerance or poor efficacy. Forty-one patients in the conventional management group required immunosuppressant therapy (61%; median time to first prescription, 11 months). In the azathioprine group, a median 67% of trimesters were spent in remission (interquartile range, 11%-85%) compared with 56% in the conventional management group (interquartile range, 29%-73%) (P = 0.69). Among secondary outcomes, a higher cumulative proportion of patients in the azathioprine group were free of perianal surgery than in the conventional management group (96% ± 3% and 82% ± 6% at month 36, respectively; P = 0.036). The cumulative proportion of patients free of intestinal surgery and anti-TNF therapy did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Based on results from a clinical trial, administration of azathioprine within 6 months of diagnosis of CD was no more effective than conventional management in increasing time of clinical remission. Clinicaltrials.gov, Number NCT00546546.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^aeadeeed]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Medical management of UC

The treatment recommendations are based on the guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the joint guidelines produced by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). These guidelines provide very useful and comprehensive algorithms, which cover most common clinical eventualities.

Most patients with UC can be treated on an outpatient basis, but with hospitalisation necessary for ASC. The main aim of treatment of UC in children is to achieve maximum possible symptomatic control with minimal side effects, while allowing children to function as normally as possible. The target for treatment increasingly is also looking at intestinal healing beyond simple symptomatic control to try and reduce the risk of long-term complications and surgery. Treatments can be broadly considered as those used to induce remission (at diagnosis or for a subsequent flare), such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, corticosteroids and biologics, and those used for long-term maintenance of remission such as 5-ASA agents, biologics and thiopurines.

### Common instances of low-value care in inflammatory bowel diseases [^bd5949b2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Value-based care focuses on improving the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care while controlling costs. Low-value care implies services or interventions that provide little or no benefit to patients, have the potential to cause harm, incur unnecessary cost to patients, or waste limited health care resources. In this review, we discuss common instances of low-value care along the spectrum of management in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These include low value care in: (1) diagnosis and monitoring of IBD: utilization of serological markers to screen and diagnose IBD, over-reliance on symptoms for monitoring disease, failure to employ treat-to-target strategies in symptomatic patients with IBD, and annual surveillance colonoscopies in patients at low risk of developing dysplasia; (2) treatment of IBD: use of 5-aminosalicylates in Crohn's disease, continuation of 5-aminosalicylates after escalation to immunosuppressive therapy, chronic corticosteroid use without steroid-sparing strategies, step therapy for Crohn's disease, failure to optimize tumor necrosis factor antagonists in patients with active disease and subsequently de-intensification of therapies in those who have achieved stable remission; and (3) management of hospitalized patients with IBD: routine cross-sectional imaging for patients with IBD presenting to the emergency department, withholding pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in patients hospitalized with IBD flare, and prolonged use of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis. This review is meant to bring attention to value-based care in IBD and provide guidance to treating practitioners. Future studies on systematic evaluation of high- and low-value care in patients with IBD are warranted.

### The toronto consensus statements for the management of inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy [^94742246]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses a particular challenge during pregnancy because the health of both the mother and the fetus must be considered.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of IBD during pregnancy. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Results

Consensus was reached on 29 of the 30 recommendations considered. Preconception counseling and access to specialist care are paramount in optimizing disease management. In general, women on 5-ASA, thiopurine, or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monotherapy for maintenance should continue therapy throughout pregnancy. Discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy or switching from combination therapy to monotherapy may be considered in very select low-risk patients. Women who have a mild to moderate disease flare while on optimized 5-ASA or thiopurine therapy should be managed with systemic corticosteroid or anti-TNF therapy, and those with a corticosteroid-resistant flare should start anti-TNF therapy. Endoscopy or urgent surgery should not be delayed during pregnancy if indicated. Decisions regarding cesarean delivery should be based on obstetric considerations and not the diagnosis of IBD alone, with the exception of women with active perianal Crohn's disease. With the exception of methotrexate, the use of medications for IBD should not influence the decision to breast-feed and vice versa. Live vaccinations are not recommended within the first 6 months of life in the offspring of women who were on anti-TNF therapy during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Optimal management of IBD before and during pregnancy is essential to achieving favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### Factors affecting outcomes in Crohn's disease over 15 years [^33dd051d]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) progression is marked by the occurrence of stricturing complications or intestinal and perianal penetrating complications, typically requiring surgery. We previously reported three factors at the time of diagnosis that increased the chance of disabling disease during the 5 years following: (1) age < 40 years old, (2) presence of perianal lesions and (3) the requirement for steroids to control the first flare. However, as the median age of diagnosis is 27 years, the course of CD may last more than 50 years in the Western world, where the life expectancy of patients exceeds 70 years. Therefore, identifying predictive criteria throughout such a long period remains challenging. We believe the assessment of CD severity should not be skewed by only taking into account occasional disease events. For example, one patient may be operated on once and then experience a long period of quiescent disease. CD manifestations are often quite active during the early few years before subsequently resolving and becoming more stable. One may consider a CD complication as an acute phenomenon without recurrence, and, in the absence of significant sequelae, such an event should therefore not be regarded as a marker of severe disease. Notably, most therapeutic strategies aim to avoid short-term complications; however, CD is a chronic disease requiring lifelong monitoring. Very little is known about the long-term evolution of CD. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify predictable factors associated with a mild-to-moderate, long-term CD course; for this purpose, we prospectively analysed a large cohort of patients with CD over 15-year period.

### Appropriate use and complications of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease: a comprehensive review [^d7960d4d]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroids are one of the most frequently prescribed medications for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. While corticosteroids have a critical role for select cases for induction of remission, there is a notable risk of over-use and miss-use of corticosteroids. This narrative review updates the evolving use of corticosteroids in the management of inflammatory bowel disease. The review focuses on the appropriate use, route of administration and duration for the use of corticosteroids. Additionally, this review summarizes the side effects, use of steroids in special populations (e.g. geriatrics, pregnancy, underrepresented minorities), and their use in the peri-operative setting.

### Early use of immunosuppressives or TNF antagonists for the treatment of Crohn's disease: time for a change [^182e84df]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that follows a progressive and destructive course. Ultimately, uncontrolled inflammation leads to bowel damage from disease-related complications such as strictures, fistulas and abscesses and surgical resection. Conventional 'step-care', whereby corticosteroids and immunosuppressives are prescribed sequentially, is an incremental approach to treatment that does not prevent disease progression and conveys an important risk of adverse events from repeated courses of corticosteroids. Although the immunosuppressives azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate are corticosteroid-sparing, they are not highly effective for inducing mucosal healing or preventing disease progression. Tumour necrosis factor antagonists induce and maintain mucosal healing and reduce surgery and hospitalisation rates. This holds out the possibility that long-term use of these agents may prevent bowel damage. Combination therapy with immunosuppressives and tumour necrosis factor antagonists is likely the best strategy for achieving optimal outcomes in patients at high risk of disease progression. However, accurate prognostic markers must be identified to guide patient selection. Long-term prospective studies with robust outcomes are still needed to establish definitively the efficacy and safety of early combination therapy to prevent bowel damage, loss of gastrointestinal tract function and permanent disability.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on the pharmacologic management of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease [^afe09fe5]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA guideline — Immunomodulator withdrawal in Crohn's disease on combination therapy: Meta-analysis data (404 individuals; 5 studies) found no significant difference in overall relapse risk with immunomodulator withdrawal versus continued combination therapy (16.8% vs 14.9%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.75–1.76). In the included RCTs (randomized controlled trials), 6 studies examining serious adverse events found no significant difference, with follow-up limited to 12–24 months. The certainty of evidence was judged to be low, and the panel suggested in favor of withdrawal of immunomodulators in patients in clinical remission on combination therapy. Clinical trial evidence suggests that clinical outcomes are similar when withdrawing immunomodulators in corticosteroid-free remission, though in 3 trials infliximab trough concentrations at the end of follow-up were lower and antibodies to infliximab were higher with immunomodulator withdrawal. Observational cohorts have demonstrated an increased risk of adverse events with combination therapy in relation to monotherapy, contextualizing potential benefits of withdrawal.

Treatment

Disease flares were treated with mesalamine (3–4 g daily) or steroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg per day, or budesonide 9 mg per day, each progressively tapered after 4 weeks), according to their clinical severity. When steroid treatment failed or was contraindicated, patients seen before 1999 were given enteral or parenteral nutrition; those seen after June 1999 received Infliximab. Adalimumab was used as a second-line anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment after 2006. Metronidazole or ciprofloxacine were used in symptomatic perianal disease.

Patients with asymptomatic or moderately active forms of the disease were treated with aminosalicylates (1.6–3 g daily). Immunosuppressive drugs were used in patients that were steroid dependent or poorly responsive to steroids. Azathioprine (2 mg/kg per day) was preferentially used as the immunosuppressive drug, and increased to 2.5–3 mg/kg per day if needed. Intramuscular methotrexate (15–25 mg, weekly) was used in patients unresponsive or intolerant to azathioprine. In cases of controlled CD, methotrexate was tapered after 3–6 months to 10–15 mg, weekly. In cases of poor responses to classical immunosuppressants, anti-TNF therapies were used for maintenance.

Although the overall strategy remained mostly unchanged, there was a distinct tendency to initiate immunosuppressants earlier in the disease course. Surgery was performed for stenotic complications, extraparietal complications, or intractable forms of CD after well conducted medical management.

The maximum treatment received by one patient during each calendar year was codified prospectively at each visit/hospitalisation, according to a pre-established gradation (0–5 (table 1)). All treatment(s) were taken into account, even in cases of short duration.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^34b8dd19]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease — immunomodulator maintenance and testing: We suggest azathioprine (at doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at doses of 0.75–1.5 mg/kg/d) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). We recommend thiopurine methyltransferase testing before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to treat patients with CD (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). We suggest methotrexate (up to 25 mg once weekly intramuscular or subcutaneous) for maintenance of remission in patients with moderately to severely active CD who had induction of remission with corticosteroids (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

Purpose Of Review

This article describes why this review is timely and relevant. The medical management of Crohn's disease is complex, and is changing rapidly with the introduction of novel therapeutic agents and management strategies.

Recent Findings

We have summarized and synthesized up-to-date evidence and opinion on the proper role and composition of combined immunosuppressive therapy in the management of Crohn's disease, the optimal time for introduction of immunomodulator and/or biologic therapies, and the benefits of therapeutic drug monitoring for biologic therapies. We also discuss the evidence supporting the benefits of the novel agents vedolizumab and ustekinumab, and discuss where they will fit into the therapeutic landscape.

Summary

The review will provide evidence to support decision making in patients with Crohn's disease requiring biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy.

Maternal risks and management

The risk of maternal complications is higher among women with Crohn's disease who are pregnant, particularly if the disease is not well-regulated. Heightened Crohn's disease activity elevates the risk of complications, including anemia, venous thromboembolism (VTE), malnutrition, and the development of pregnancy-specific conditions such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Moreover, pregnancy-related exacerbations may require corticosteroid treatment, increasing the chances of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and premature membrane rupture.

The primary goal of addressing maternal risks is to maintain the disease in a state of remission. Throughout gestation, the majority of treatments for Crohn's disease, such as aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants like azathioprine, and biologic therapies such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, are generally regarded as safe. Infliximab and adalimumab, which are biological agents, are commonly used and effectively reduce flare-ups without significantly raising the risk of congenital anomalies. However, corticosteroids should be reserved for short-term management of acute flare-ups due to the potential risks they present to both the mother and fetus. It's important to carefully monitor iron supplementation, as anemia and iron deficiency are common due to both disease-related malabsorption and increased iron needs during pregnancy. For women with moderate to severe disease activity, VTE prophylaxis should be considered, given the increased risk of thromboembolic events in this population.

### Effects of prednisolone tapering on effectiveness of infliximab in patients with ulcerative colitis: data from a retrospective cohort [^13e98614]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing-remitting immune-mediated disorder affecting the large intestine and caused by a dysregulated immune response to the microbiome in environmentally and genetically susceptible subjects. Although colectomy in principle removes the diseased organ, medical treatment remains the cornerstone of treatment. Corticosteroids, due to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, are effective in inducing remission and constitute a first line of therapy at moderate to severe flares. Biologics such as the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor infliximab are commonly used in steroid-refractory patients or in those with repeated frequent flares. More than 50% of patients with UC receive corticosteroids in the first 5 years after their diagnosis and more than 10% receive biologic agents in the same period. Furthermore, patients with steroid-refractory acute severe UC (ASUC) are treated with infliximab or cyclosporine. Thus, steroids are often used concomitantly when infliximab therapy is initiated and then tapered. However, the role of concomitant steroids, and influence of different tapering regimens, during initiation of infliximab remains unknown, leaving the question whether a longer exposure to corticosteroids will provide an additive effect on infliximab's immunosuppressive effectiveness or even improve its pharmacokinetics as is the case with conventional immunosuppressives.

However, improvement in inflammatory markers has been reported in patients with only a partial clinical response to systemic glucocorticoids. Combined glucocorticoid and anti-TNF-α could thus be superior to anti-TNF-α alone in the setting where corticosteroids were initially considered necessary. On the other hand, double immunosuppression is prone to increase risk of infections and other serious adverse events, which favours a rapid tapering regimen.

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found no significant difference in the rate of clinical remission between anti-TNF-α monotherapy and anti-TNF-α plus concomitant steroids in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). However, it should be noticed that all patients in the mentioned study were corticosteroid refractory prior to receiving biologics. The way corticosteroids affect outcomes of infliximab treatment in UC remains unreported in clinical trials making a similar study design impossible in UC.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^98f06874]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) — biologic therapies and severe disease management detail that biosimilar infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab are effective treatments for patients with moderate-to-severe CD and can be used for de novo induction and maintenance therapy, and there are data to support the safety and efficacy of transitioning or switching to biosimilar infliximab or adalimumab for patients with CD in stable disease maintenance. Biologic therapy (including anti-interleukin-12/23 therapy, anti-TNF therapy, and anti-integrin therapy) dose optimization may be considered for patients with inadequate or loss of response to that specific biologic agent's induction and maintenance. For hospitalized patients presenting with severe to fulminant CD, intravenous corticosteroids may be used to control inflammatory burden while evaluating steroid-sparing treatment options. Anti-TNF agents are effective for severely active CD and infliximab may be administered in the inpatient setting for patients with severe to fulminant disease. Antibiotics (imidazoles) can be considered for patients with simple perianal fistulas as a primary therapy, and drainage of perianal abscesses with appropriate placement of setons to facilitate drainage should be undertaken before treating perianal fistulizing disease with advanced therapy to increase treatment effectiveness.

Corticosteroids remain an important tool for inducing remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but they have no role in maintenance of remission. The significant adverse side effect profile of these drugs means their use should be avoided where possible or measures taken to reduce their risk. Despite an expanding array of alternative therapies, corticosteroid dependency and excess remain common. Appropriate steroid use is now regarded a key performance indicator in the management of IBD. This article aims to outline indications for corticosteroid use in IBD, their risks and strategies to reduce their use and misuse.

5.2.7.2 Stopping anti-TNF therapy

Statement 96. We suggest that anti-TNF therapy may be withdrawn in patients with prolonged corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing. Retreatment in the event of relapse is usually successful, but there is insufficient evidence about which clinical factors predict relapse after withdrawal and decisions should be individualised (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.2%).

From studies assessing outcomes of stopping therapy after at least 12 months of anti-TNF therapy, the estimated relapse rate at 1 year was 39% for Crohn's and 35% for UC/IBD-U. The estimated relapse rates at 2 years were 54% for Crohn's disease and 42% for UC/IBD-U. Among patients relapsing and retreated with anti-TNF, the estimated chances of success were 88% for Crohn's disease and 76% for UC/IBD-U. Various models to predict chance of relapse have been proposed. The clinical factors associated with relapse, however, vary between studies. Younger age, smoking, longer disease duration, fistulising perianal Crohn's disease, anaemia, raised CRP and raised faecal calprotectin are linked with increased risk of relapse. Mucosal healing (and in some studies low serum drug levels) are associated with a lower risk of relapse. Patients receiving escalated dosages of anti-TNFs or for the indication of postoperative recurrence in Crohn's disease had a > 75% risk of relapse on drug withdrawal. Persistent abnormalities on MRE in Crohn's disease patients in endoscopic remission also makes relapse more likely. Decisions regarding withdrawal should be taken in the context of the individual patient, their disease history and the consequences of relapse. Patient profiles favouring treatment withdrawal include: older patients without previous complications, surgery and with no evidence of active inflammation, those with comorbidities increasing their infection risk, those with undetectable trough drug levels and other practical reasons mitigating against continuing injections or infusions. There is no safe minimum period of corticosteroid-free remission, but at least 1–2 years seems reasonable. The concept of cyclical biologics use (stopping when deep remission is established and restarting in the event of pre-clinical relapse) has been introduced, but there is no evidence as yet that this is safe or cost-effective. All the published data so far come from prospective and retrospective cohort studies such as the STORI study. Data on outcomes after withdrawal of newer biologics are awaited.

Conclusion

Managing CD in pregnancy is multifaceted, requiring pre-conception counseling, maintenance of remission, careful pharmacological management, and coordinated follow-up across specialties. Advances in biological therapies have significantly improved pregnancy outcomes, but challenges remain, particularly in predicting postpartum flares and managing drug safety in breastfeeding. Ongoing research and long-term studies are essential to optimizing care for both mother and child in this unique patient population.

RECOMMEND using any of the following, over no treatment: infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, mirikizumab, or upadacitinib* (Strong recommendation, moderate to high certainty of evidence). SUGGEST using any of the following, over no treatment: certolizumab pegol, vedolizumab (Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Implementation considerations include that biosimilars of infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab can be considered equivalent to the originator in efficacy for therapy selection; subcutaneous infliximab and vedolizumab have shown comparable efficacy to intravenous maintenance doses; extended induction or dose escalation may be beneficial in some patients with suboptimal response; and there are two dosing options for maintenance therapy for risankizumab, guselkumab, and upadacitinib, with higher maintenance doses potentially preferred in patients with higher inflammatory burden, more severe disease, or prior TNF antagonist failure.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^02b6db9a]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids for Crohn's-like disease of the pouch — evidence and considerations: The guideline notes that no studies were identified on the effectiveness or safety of corticosteroids specifically for Crohn's-like disease of the pouch; based on indirect data in moderate to severe luminal Crohn's disease, very low certainty evidence suggests corticosteroids would be effective, with improvement in symptoms being an important benefit that can serve as interim therapy to bridge to advanced treatments, but benefits should be weighed against potential harms with repeated and/or prolonged systemic courses; given extensive experience with systemic steroids and controlled ileal release budesonide in luminal Crohn's disease, these medications are likely to be effective in management of Crohn's-like disease of the pouch.

### Patients with stricturing or penetrating Crohn's disease phenotypes report high disease burden and treatment needs [^2c87efc2]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

What You Need to Know

Background: There are limited real-world data describing the characteristics, treatment needs, and disease burden of patients with complicated (stricturing and/or penetrating) Crohn's disease phenotypes.

Findings: Patients with complicated Crohn's disease phenotypes have a higher disease burden, despite greater use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and corticosteroids, than patients with inflammatory Crohn's disease.

Implications for patient care: Early recognition and optimized management of Crohn's disease are necessary to prevent progression to complicated phenotypes and, consequently, improve health outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease.

### Early combined immunosuppression or conventional management in patients with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease: an open randomised trial [^e3ff51f7]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most patients who have active Crohn's disease are treated initially with corticosteroids. Although this approach usually controls symptoms, many patients become resistant to or dependent on corticosteroids, and long exposure is associated with an increased risk of mortality. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of early use of combined immunosuppression with conventional management in patients with active Crohn's disease who had not previously received glucocorticoids, antimetabolites, or infliximab.

Methods

We did a 2-year open-label randomised trial at 18 centres in Belgium, Holland, and Germany between May, 2001, and January, 2004. We randomly assigned 133 patients to either early combined immunosuppression or conventional treatment. The 67 patients assigned to combined immunosuppression received three infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg of bodyweight) at weeks 0, 2, and 6, with azathioprine. We gave additional treatment with infliximab and, if necessary, corticosteroids, to control disease activity. 66 patients assigned to conventional management received corticosteroids, followed, in sequence, by azathioprine and infliximab. The primary outcome measures were remission without corticosteroids and without bowel resection at weeks 26 and 52. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00554710.

Findings

Four patients (two in each group) did not receive treatment as per protocol. At week 26, 39 (60.0%) of 65 patients in the combined immunosuppression group were in remission without corticosteroids and without surgical resection, compared with 23 (35.9%) of 64 controls, for an absolute difference of 24.1% (95% CI 7.3–40.8, p = 0.0062). Corresponding rates at week 52 were 40/65 (61.5%) and 27/64 (42.2%) (absolute difference 19.3%, 95% CI 2.4–36.3, p = 0.0278). 20 of the 65 patients (30.8%) in the early combined immunosuppression group had serious adverse events, compared with 19 of 64 (25.3%) controls (p = 1.0).

Interpretation

Combined immunosuppression was more effective than conventional management for induction of remission and reduction of corticosteroid use in patients who had been recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Initiation of more intensive treatment early in the course of the disease could result in better outcomes.

Crohn's disease — operative indications for medically refractory disease state that patients who demonstrate an inadequate response to, develop complications from, or are nonadherent with medical therapy "should typically be considered for surgery", with "Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C". The goals of medical treatment of CD are to achieve remission with endoscopic mucosal healing and avoid relapse; with glucocorticoids, clinical improvement is usually evident "within days of initiation of intravenous therapy and within 2 to 4 weeks of treatment with oral glucocorticoids", whereas with immunomodulators used as monotherapy a plateau in symptom improvement is often demonstrated "within 12 to 16 weeks".

### The importance of monitoring the postpartum period in moderate to severe Crohn's disease [^bf04fc29]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior research demonstrates Crohn's disease patients often do well in pregnancy; however, less is known about the risk of flare in the postpartum period.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary care inflammatory bowel disease center. All pregnant women with Crohn's disease who were followed in the postpartum period, defined as 6 months after delivery, were included. Statistical analysis included χ2 analysis, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic regression analysis. The primary outcome of interest was rate of flare in the postpartum period.

Results

There were 105 patients included in the study, with a majority (68%) on biologic medication during pregnancy. Thirty-one patients (30%) had a postpartum flare at a median of 9 weeks (range 2–24 weeks). Twenty-five patients (81%) had their postpartum flare managed in the outpatient setting with medications (only 4 of these patients required prednisone). 6 of 31 patients (19%) were hospitalized at a median of 4 weeks (range 2–26 weeks) after delivery, requiring intravenous corticosteroids or surgery. In multivariable regression, there was no significant increase in risk of postpartum flare with increasing maternal age, flare during pregnancy, or steroid or biologic use during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy increased risk of postpartum flare (odds ratio, 16.2 [1.72–152.94], P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In a cohort of Crohn's disease patients, 30% experienced a postpartum flare despite being on medical therapy, but most were able to be managed in the outpatient setting.

### Managing inflammatory bowel disease in patients receiving cancer-associated chemotherapy and beyond [^a7362f1b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Recommendations for IBD-related medications in patients with active or prior cancer

Our review also examined the management of IBD in patients with active cancer. Diagnosing an IBD flare during cancer treatment is challenging because of the overlapping symptoms of IBD, infections, and side-effects of cancer therapies. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including endoscopic evaluation to rule out infection, is essential prior to initiating treatment for an IBD flare. Although corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment for flares, their potential impact on tumor immunosurveillance should prompt multidisciplinary discussions with oncologists. Biologics, such as anti-TNFs, vedolizumab and ustekinumab, are effective second-line options, with early studies suggesting comparable safety profiles. Mild flares can often be managed with 5-ASA in ulcerative colitis, and enteral nutrition can be considered in Crohn's. Coordinating IBD care in cancer patients requires close collaboration between oncologists and gastroenterologists to balance IBD control and cancer management. Treatment decisions should consider both IBD factors (disease activity, severity and flare risk) and malignancy characteristics (cancer type, stage, prognosis and treatment-related immunosuppression), with oncological management often taking precedence.

Our review suggests that cytotoxic chemotherapy has a dual role in managing cancer and suppressing IBD activity, as suggested by studies showing lower rates of IBD relapse during treatment. In contrast, hormonal therapies are associated with a greater risk of IBD flare-ups. As ICI therapies are increasingly used across various cancers, IBD flares should be expected, with a pooled estimate of 33–40%. Currently, no data or consensus support treating high-risk IBD patients proactively before starting ICIs, though this remains an area for future study. Targeted therapies, such as bevacizumab, appear to be generally safe in patients with quiescent or moderately active IBD, although rare complications, such as mesenteric ischemia, have been reported.

Despite some uncertainty, our scoping review aligns with the current ECCO 2023 guidelines and the recent AGA clinical practice update, which state that, with a few exceptions, most IBD-related medications can generally be continued or initiated in patients with active or prior cancer (Table 3).

### Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline for the medical management of pediatric luminal Crohn's disease [^72b7a2ec]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

We aim to provide guidance for medical treatment of luminal Crohn's disease in children.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of publication databases to identify studies of medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on them.

Results

The consensus includes 25 statements focused on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of oral 5-aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the role of aminosalicylates in treatment of patients with mild disease, antibiotics or vedolizumab for induction or maintenance therapy, or methotrexate for induction therapy. Patients in clinical remission who are receiving immunomodulators should be assessed for mucosal healing within 1 year of treatment initiation.

Conclusions

Evidence-based medical treatment of Crohn's disease in children is recommended, with thorough ongoing assessments to define treatment success.

### Glucocorticosteroid therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e78acb3f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The use of glucocorticosteroids to treat both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is widespread, but no systematic review and meta-analysis has examined the issue of efficacy of these agents in its entirety.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials were searched (through December 2010). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting adults with active or quiescent CD comparing standard glucocorticosteroids or budesonide with placebo or each other, or comparing standard glucocorticosteroids with placebo in active UC, were eligible. Dichotomous data were extracted to obtain relative risk (RR) of failure to achieve remission in active disease, and RR of relapse of activity in quiescent disease, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Adverse events data were extracted where reported.

Results

The search identified 3,061 citations, and 20 trials were eligible. Only one trial was at low risk of bias. Standard glucocorticosteroids were superior to placebo for UC remission (RR of no remission = 0.65; 95% CI 0.45–0.93). Both trials of standard glucocorticosteroids in CD remission reported a statistically significant effect, but because of heterogeneity between studies, the overall effect was not significant (RR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.17–1.28). Budesonide was superior to placebo for CD remission (RR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.63–0.84), but not in preventing CD relapse (RR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.83–1.04). Standard glucocorticosteroids were superior to budesonide for CD remission (RR = 0.82; 95% CI 0.68–0.98), but glucocorticosteroid-related adverse events were commoner (RR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.34–2.00).

Conclusions

Standard glucocorticosteroids are probably effective in inducing remission in UC, and may be of benefit in CD. Budesonide induces remission in active CD, but is less effective than standard glucocorticosteroids, and is of no benefit in preventing CD relapse.

### Use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs in inflammatory bowel disease: clinical practice guidelines of the Italian group for the study of inflammatory bowel disease [^6c1db556]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2017). Low credibility.

The two main forms of intestinal bowel disease, namely ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are not curable but can be controlled by various medical therapies. The Italian Group for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IG-IBD) has prepared clinical practice guidelines to help physicians prescribe corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs for these patients. The guidelines consider therapies that induce remission in patients with active disease as well as treatment regimens that maintain remission. These guidelines complement already existing guidelines from IG-IBD on the use of biological drugs in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

### Conventional medical management of inflammatory bowel disease [^afaf3e63]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conventional therapies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. A time-structured approach is required for appropriate management. Traditional step-up therapy has been partly replaced during the last decade by potent drugs and top-down therapies, with an accelerated step-up approach being the most appropriate in the majority of patients. When patients are diagnosed with CD or ulcerative colitis, physicians should consider the probable pattern of disease progression so that effective therapy is not delayed. This can be achieved by setting arbitrary time limits for administration of biological therapies, changing therapy from mesalamine in patients with active ulcerative colitis, or using rescue therapy for acute severe colitis. In this review, we provide algorithms with a time-structured approach for guidance of therapy. Common mistakes in conventional therapy include overprescription of mesalamine for CD; inappropriate use of steroids (for perianal CD, when there is sepsis, or for maintenance); delayed introduction or underdosing with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate; and failure to consider timely surgery. The paradox of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy is that although it too is used inappropriately (when patients have sepsis or fibrostenotic strictures) or too frequently (for diseases that would respond to less-potent therapy), it is also often introduced too late in disease progression. Conventional drugs are the mainstay of current therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases, but drug type, timing, and context must be optimized to manage individual patients effectively.

### Corticosteroid-sparing treatments in patients with Crohn's disease [^f09d199a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Conventional corticosteroid therapy effectively induces remission of Crohn's disease (CD) across a range of disease severity. However, alternative treatments are needed for patients with disease unresponsive to corticosteroids, patients requiring maintenance therapy (for which corticosteroids are ineffective), corticosteroid-dependent patients, and patients with corticosteroid-related toxicities. Thus, corticosteroid-sparing effects are an important clinical endpoint for treatments of CD. Budesonide offers comparable efficacy with less short-term toxicity than conventional corticosteroids (prednisone, prednisolone); this agent has also demonstrated short-term remission maintenance efficacy, while potentially enabling withdrawal of more toxic corticosteroids in corticosteroid-dependent patients. However, budesonide has not shown long-term maintenance benefit in clinical studies, and the risk for and implications of budesonide dependency need further evaluation. The immunomodulators, azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, are most effective for maintenance of remission in quiescent disease, but may be useful in conjunction with other therapies in inducing remission in active CD; methotrexate may be considered an alternative because of its efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission. In clinical trials, treatment with azathioprine/6-methotrexate has enabled corticosteroid withdrawal in 55% of patients, and methotrexate, in 39% of patients with corticosteroid-dependent CD, while maintaining clinical response. Monitoring for infrequent hematological or hepatic toxicity is recommended during use of these immunomodulators. Infliximab is effective for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with refractory CD participating in randomized placebo-controlled studies and, in open-label experience, has enabled corticosteroid withdrawal in approximately three quarters of patients. This biological agent is generally well tolerated. Infusion reactions are the most commonly occurring side effects; such reactions may require adjustment of infusion rate and/or treatment with an antihistamine or acetaminophen. The investigational biological agent CDP-571 has also shown corticosteroid-sparing efficacy in patients with CD. In conclusion, recent research has helped identify corticosteroid-sparing treatments that can provide benefit in patients with corticosteroid-dependent and/or corticosteroid-refractory CD or patients at risk for corticosteroid-induced toxicities.

### Traditional corticosteroids for induction of remission in Crohn's disease [^6c66875d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, corticosteroids have been the most commonly used class of medication for induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD). Corticosteroids down regulate production of inflammatory cytokines and interfere with NF-kappaB production, thereby blunting inflammatory response.

Objectives

The primary objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of traditional corticosteroids (given orally or intravenously) for induction of remission in CD.

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders (IBD/FBD) Group Specialized Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials.gov. No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of trials and review articles, as well as recent proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings were manually searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, controlled clinical trials of traditional, systemic corticosteroids for the induction of remission of active CD were included in this review. Control groups included patients receiving either placebo or 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA). The study population included patients of any age with active CD (as defined by the study authors or validated clinical activity indices), receiving any formulation of systemically available corticosteroid by any oral or parenteral methods of delivery. The primary outcome was induction of remission of CD. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, change in mean CDAI, adverse events and the proportion of patients withdrawing due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent investigators reviewed studies for eligibility, extracted the data and assessed study quality using Jadad's criteria. A random or fixed effects model was chosen based on an assessment of heterogeneity, and studies were weighted using the DerSimonian & Laird or the Mantel-Haenszel method accordingly. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 4.2.10 software.

Main Results

Two studies compared corticosteroids to placebo and six studies compared corticosteroids to 5-ASA. Corticosteroids were found to be significantly more effective than placebo at inducing remission in CD (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.64; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids were found to be more effective than 5-ASA at inducing remission in studies with long follow-up duration (i.e. > 15 weeks; RR 1.65; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.03; P < 0.00001). Corticosteroids induced adverse events in a higher proportion of patients than placebo (RR 4.89; 95% CI 1.98 to 12.07; P = 0.0006), or low-dose 5-ASA (RR 2.38; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.25; P = 0.003). No difference existed in the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events when steroids were compared to high-dose 5-ASA. Steroids did not induce more study withdrawals due to adverse events than either placebo or 5-ASA.

Authors' Conclusions

Corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission in patients with CD, particularly when used for more than 15 weeks. Although corticosteroids cause more adverse events than either placebo or low-dose 5-ASA, these adverse events did not lead to increased study withdrawal in the included studies. Further information is required to determine the optimal duration of treatment and tapering protocol to maximize the efficacy of treatment with corticosteroids. Additionally, further study is required to determine whether corticosteroids are more effective in patients with certain phenotypes or when administered intravenously.

4.2.1 Budesonide in ileocaecal Crohn's disease

Statement 32. We recommend that mild to moderate ileocaecal Crohn's disease can be treated with ileal-release budesonide 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks to induce remission (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In a randomised double-blind trial, ileal-release budesonide 9 mg once daily for 8 weeks was as effective as prednisolone (40 mg daily tapering to 5 mg at 8 weeks) at inducing remission in patients with mild-to-moderate ileocaecal Crohn's disease with treatment efficacy (CDAI score < 150) of 51% on budesonide at 8 weeks compared with 52.5% for prednisolone, and significantly fewer side effects. Multiple meta-analyses have also demonstrated the efficacy of budesonide 9 mg/day over placebo in inducing remission. A once-daily 9 mg dose is as effective as 3 mg three times daily. In the context of more severe disease (CDAI > 300) budesonide is inferior to prednisolone (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95). When remission has been achieved, budesonide should be tapered over 1–2 weeks.

4.2.2 Corticosteroids in colonic Crohn's disease

Statement 33. We recommend that active Crohn's colitis can be treated with an 8-week course of systemic corticosteroids to induce remission (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In mild, moderate and severe colonic Crohn's disease, systemic corticosteroids such as prednisolone are effective in inducing remission. A starting dose of 40 mg tapering by 5 mg weekly is often used, but should be tailored to disease severity and patient tolerance. Ileal-release budesonide does have benefit in Crohn's disease affecting the proximal colon, but there is no evidence of benefit in more distal colonic inflammation. There are no trials of colonic-release budesonide-MMX in Crohn's disease at present.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^4f099672]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Thiopurines in Crohn's disease — onset, roles, and pharmacogenetics: Because of their relatively slow onset of action of 8–12 weeks, thiopurines are not effective agents for induction of remission among patients with active, symptomatic disease. Thiopurines can be used with an anti-TNF agent to reduce the risk of development of antibodies and improve pharmacokinetic parameters, and azathioprine (at maximal doses of 1.5–2.5 mg/kg/d) and 6-mercaptopurine (at maximal doses of 1–1.5 mg/kg/d) may be used as a steroid-sparing maintenance agent. TPMT testing should be checked before initial use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to identify patients at increased risk for thiopurine-associated myelosuppression. Variants in the NUDT15 gene have been demonstrated to affect thiopurine metabolism with increased medication-related toxicity particularly among people of East-Asian, Latino, and Native American ancestries, and testing for NUDT15 genetic variants should be considered if available.

### Methotrexate for induction of remission in refractory Crohn's disease [^fab27d2f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although corticosteroids are effective for induction of remission of Crohn's disease, many patients relapse when steroids are withdrawn or become steroid dependent. Furthermore, corticosteroids exhibit significant adverse effects. The success of methotrexate as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis led to its evaluation in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Methotrexate has been studied for induction of remission of refractory Crohn's disease and has become the principal alternative to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine therapy. This systematic review is an update of previously published Cochrane reviews.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of methotrexate for induction of remission in patients with active Crohn's disease in the presence or absence of concomitant steroid therapy.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and the Cochrane IBD/FBD group specialized register from inception to June 9, 2014 for relevant studies. Conference proceedings and reference lists were also searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of methotrexate compared to placebo or an active comparator for treatment of active refractory Crohn's disease in adult patients (> 17 years) were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was failure to enter remission and withdraw from steroids. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, serious adverse events and quality of life. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The GRADE approach was used to assess the overall quality of evidence supporting the primary outcome.

Main Results

Seven studies (495 patients) were included. Four studies were rated as low risk of bias. Three studies were rated as high risk of bias due to open label or single-blind designs. The seven studies differed with respect to participants, intervention, and outcomes to the extent that meta-analysis was considered to be inappropriate. GRADE analyses indicated that the quality of evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to sparse data and inadequate blinding. Three small studies which employed low dose oral methotrexate showed no statistically significant difference in failure to induce remission between methotrexate and placebo or between methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. For the study using 15 mg/week of oral methotrexate 33% (5/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 11% (2/18) of placebo patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.31). For the study using 12.5 mg/week of oral methotrexate 81% (21/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 77% (20/26) of placebo patients (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.39). This study also had an active comparator arm, 81% (21/26) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 59% (19/32) of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.92). For the active comparator study using 15 mg/week oral methotrexate, 20% (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 6% of 6-mercaptopurine patients (RR 3.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 27.49). This study also had a 5-ASA arm and found that methotrexate patients were significantly more likely to enter remission than 5-ASA patients. Twenty per cent (3/15) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 86% (6/7) of 5-ASA patients (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.67). One small study which used a higher dose of intravenous or oral methotrexate (25 mg/week) showed no statistically significant difference between methotrexate and azathioprine. Forty-four per cent (12/27) of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 37% of azathioprine patients (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.29). Two studies found no statistically significant difference in failure to enter remission between the combination of infliximab and methotrexate and infliximab monotherapy. One small study utilized intravenous methotrexate (20 mg/week) for 5 weeks and then switched to oral (20 mg/week). Forty-five per cent (5/11) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 62% of infliximab patients (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.69). The other study assessing combination therapy utilized subcutaneous methotrexate (maximum dose 25 mg/week). Twenty-four per cent (15/63) of patients in the combination group failed to enter remission compared to 22% (14/63) of infliximab patients (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.03). A large placebo-controlled study which employed a high dose of methotrexate intramuscularly showed a statistically significant benefit relative to placebo. Sixty-one per cent of methotrexate patients failed to enter remission compared to 81% of placebo patients (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93; number needed to treat, NNT = 5). Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly more common in methotrexate patients than placebo in this study. Seventeen per cent of methotrexate patients withdrew due to adverse events compared to 2% of placebo patients (RR 8.00, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.51). The incidence of adverse events was significantly more common in methotrexate patients (63%, 17/27) than azathioprine patients (26%, 7/27) in one small study (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.89). No other statistically significant differences in adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events or serious adverse events were reported in any of the other placebo-controlled or active comparator studies. Common adverse events included nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash and headache.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence from a single large randomized trial which suggests that intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg/week) provides a benefit for induction of remission and complete withdrawal from steroids in patients with refractory Crohn's disease. Lower dose oral methotrexate does not appear to provide any significant benefit relative to placebo or active comparator. However, these trials were small and further studies of oral methotrexate may be justified. Comparative studies of methotrexate to drugs such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine would require the randomization of large numbers of patients. The addition of methotrexate to infliximab therapy does not appear to provide any additional benefit over infliximab monotherapy. However these studies were relatively small and further research is needed to determine the role of methotrexate when used in conjunction with infliximab or other biological therapies.

How to manage medications for IBD

Public Health England noted in the 2019 British Society for Gastroenterology guidelines for adult IBD that stopping corticosteroid therapy during CDI therapy is not necessary for patients with acute severe UC. However, a study conducted by Solanky et al. showed that there was a higher risk of colectomy when escalated corticosteroid for IBD with CDI. During acute CDI, clinicians may delay upgrades of steroids until CDI is controlled.

It is confirmed that whether to stop the use of immunosuppressants or not in IBD patients with CDI has not been clarified in the current consensus of guidelines after a systematic review of the current publicly available literature. When being asked to comment on CDI management in IBD, 46% of 169 gastroenterologists (25% of respondents were IBD specialists) opted for a combination of immunosuppression and antibiotics, while the remaining 54% preferred antibiotics alone to treat the flare. In addition, Beniwal-Patel et al. suggested that new immunosuppressants should not be started and scheduled infusions should be suspended until the symptoms of C. difficile are resolved in the case of new CDI. While Krishna et al. pointed out that IBD patients with CDI should be treated with appropriate antibiotics immediately. If symptoms are not relieved in 48 h, starting/updating immunotherapy should be considered at the same time. The guidelines of the American Gastroenterology Association recommend that steroid or immunosuppressive therapy should be started 72–96 h after the use of antibiotics. With the escalation of immunosuppression, patients should be closely monitored for worsening symptoms and impending complications. The decision on whether or not to continue immunomodulator treatment should be made on an individual basis (including discussed surgery). Similarly, the 2021 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines on the management of IBD stated that the effect of immunosuppressive agents on CDI progression in IBD patients is not clear. For IBD patients with CDI, whether to maintain immunosuppressants should be carefully considered after risk–benefit assessment and clinical judgment.

### Early combined immunosuppression for the management of Crohn's disease (REACT): a cluster randomised controlled trial [^055cf853]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Conventional management of Crohn's disease features incremental use of therapies. However, early combined immunosuppression (ECI), with a TNF antagonist and antimetabolite might be a more effective strategy. We compared the efficacy of ECI with that of conventional management for treatment of Crohn's disease.

Methods

In this open-label cluster randomised controlled trial (Randomised Evaluation of an Algorithm for Crohn's Treatment, REACT), we included community gastroenterology practices from Belgium and Canada that were willing to be assigned to either of the study groups, participate in all aspects of the study, and provide data on up to 60 patients with Crohn's disease. These practices were randomly assigned (1:1) to either ECI or conventional management. The computer-generated randomisation was minimised by country and practice size. Up to 60 consecutive adult patients were assessed within practices. Patients who were aged 18 years or older; documented to have Crohn's disease; able to speak or understand English, French, or Dutch; able to access a telephone; and able to provide written informed consent were followed up for 2 years. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in corticosteroid-free remission (Harvey-Bradshaw Index score ≤ 4) at 12 months at the practice level. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01030809.

Findings

This study took place between March 15, 2010, and Oct 1, 2013. Of the 60 practices screened, 41 were randomly assigned to either ECI (n = 22) or conventional management (n = 19). Two practices (one in each group) discontinued because of insufficient resources. 921 (85%) of the 1084 patients at ECI practices and 806 (90%) of 898 patients at conventional management practices completed 12 months follow-up and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. The 12 month practice-level remission rates were similar at ECI and conventional management practices (66.0% [SD 14.0] and 61.9% [16.9]; adjusted difference 2.5%, 95% CI -5.2% to 10.2%, p = 0.5169). The 24 month patient-level composite rate of major adverse outcomes defined as occurrence of surgery, hospital admission, or serious disease-related complications was lower at ECI practices than at conventional management practices (27.7% and 35.1%, absolute difference [AD] 7.3%, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86, p = 0.0003). There were no differences in serious drug-related adverse events.

Interpretation

Although ECI was not more effective than conventional management for controlling Crohn's disease symptoms, the risk of major adverse outcomes was lower. The latter finding should be considered hypothesis-generating for future trials. ECI was not associated with an increased risk of serious drug-related adverse events or mortality.

### Effect of tight control management on Crohn's disease (CALM): a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial [^0fcccb56]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Biomarkers of intestinal inflammation, such as faecal calprotectin and C-reactive protein, have been recommended for monitoring patients with Crohn's disease, but whether their use in treatment decisions improves outcomes is unknown. We aimed to compare endoscopic and clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who were managed with a tight control algorithm, using clinical symptoms and biomarkers, versus patients managed with a clinical management algorithm.

Methods

CALM was an open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 study, done in 22 countries at 74 hospitals and outpatient centres, which evaluated adult patients (aged 18–75 years) with active endoscopic Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity [CDEIS] > 6; sum of CDEIS subscores of > 6 in one or more segments with ulcers), a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of 150–450 depending on dose of prednisone at baseline, and no previous use of immunomodulators or biologics. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to tight control or clinical management groups, stratified by smoking status (yes or no), weight (< 70 kg or ≥ 70 kg), and disease duration (≤ 2 years or > 2 years) after 8 weeks of prednisone induction therapy, or earlier if they had active disease. In both groups, treatment was escalated in a stepwise manner, from no treatment, to adalimumab induction followed by adalimumab every other week, adalimumab every week, and lastly to both weekly adalimumab and daily azathioprine. This escalation was based on meeting treatment failure criteria, which differed between groups (tight control group before and after random assignment: faecal calprotectin ≥ 250 μg/g, C-reactive protein ≥ 5mg/L, CDAI ≥ 150, or prednisone use in the previous week; clinical management group before random assignment: CDAI decrease of < 70 points compared with baseline or CDAI > 200; clinical management group after random assignment: CDAI decrease of < 100 points compared with baseline or CDAI ≥ 200, or prednisone use in the previous week). De-escalation was possible for patients receiving weekly adalimumab and azathioprine or weekly adalimumab alone if failure criteria were not met. The primary endpoint was mucosal healing (CDEIS < 4) with absence of deep ulcers 48 weeks after randomisation. Primary and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial has been completed, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01235689.

Findings

Between Feb 11, 2011, and Nov 3, 2016, 244 patients (mean disease duration: clinical management group, 0.9 years [SD 1.7]; tight control group, 1.0 year [2.3]) were randomly assigned to monitoring groups (n = 122 per group). 29 (24%) patients in the clinical management group and 32 (26%) patients in the tight control group discontinued the study, mostly because of adverse events. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the tight control group achieved the primary endpoint at week 48 (56 [46%] of 122 patients) than in the clinical management group (37 [30%] of 122 patients), with a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test-adjusted risk difference of 16.1% (95% CI 3.9–28.3; p = 0.010). 105 (86%) of 122 patients in the tight control group and 100 (82%) of 122 patients in the clinical management group reported treatment-emergent adverse events; no treatment-related deaths occurred. The most common adverse events were nausea (21 [17%] of 122 patients), nasopharyngitis (18 [15%]), and headache (18 [15%]) in the tight control group, and worsening Crohn's disease (35 [29%] of 122 patients), arthralgia (19 [16%]), and nasopharyngitis (18 [15%]) in the clinical management group.

Interpretation

CALM is the first study to show that timely escalation with an anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy on the basis of clinical symptoms combined with biomarkers in patients with early Crohn's disease results in better clinical and endoscopic outcomes than symptom-driven decisions alone. Future studies should assess the effects of such a strategy on long-term outcomes such as bowel damage, surgeries, hospital admissions, and disability.

4.4.3.7 Corticosteroid use and infection risk while on anti-TNF therapy

Statement 49. Patients with Crohn's disease treated with a biological therapy in optimal dose who remain corticosteroid-dependent (particularly if on triple immunosuppression with immunomodulator therapy) are at significant risk of opportunistic infections. We recommend that alternative medical treatments or surgery should be explored (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

The observational Crohn's Therapy, Resource, Evaluation, and Assessment Tool registry (TREAT) was established to compare infliximab safety with conventional non-biological therapy. Conventional immunomodulator therapies and anti-TNF therapies were associated with an increased risk of infection, including serious and opportunistic infections. Nonetheless the greatest risk of infection, and with it an associated increase in mortality, was seen in patients on corticosteroid therapy (see Section 5.2.1.2: Common Disease Considerations, Infection risk in patients on anti-TNF therapy). Requirement for continuous corticosteroid therapy or repeated short courses in patients on biologics suggests that treatment may be failing, and consideration should be given to switching to an alternative (see Section 5.2.4.6: Common Disease Considerations, Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF therapy) or considering other options, including surgery.

4.4.4 Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation

Despite the increasing range of drugs available, there are still a number of Crohn's disease patients with severe resistant disease or in whom surgical resection is not appropriate (usually due to extensive disease or incipient short bowel syndrome). For this group of patients, autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSTC) has been used. The ASTIC study, an RCT of autologous HSTC published in 2015, set a high bar for its primary end point (of sustained therapy-free clinical, endoscopic and radiological remission at 1 year) and failed to achieve it. One of the 23 patients undergoing HSTC died and serious adverse events (particularly infection) were common, especially in individuals with perianal Crohn's disease. Nonetheless in this treatment-refractory population there were, among the component parts of the composite primary outcome, suggestions of benefit in some patients and further trial data are needed.

Regarding specific circumstances for Crohn's disease, more specifically with respect to patients with C. difficile infection, withholding immunosuppressive therapy, AGA 2017 guidelines recommend to consider postponing the escalation of corticosteroids and other immunosuppression agents during acute C. difficile infection until therapy for C. difficile infection has been initiated. Decide on withholding or continuing immunosuppression in patients with IBD with C. difficile infection on an individual basis.
