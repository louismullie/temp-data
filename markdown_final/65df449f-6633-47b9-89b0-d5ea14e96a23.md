## Question

What tests are used to diagnose genital herpes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tests are used to diagnose genital herpes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial clinical assessment and why laboratory confirmation is necessary. Then, I should verify test selection based on whether lesions are present. Next, I need to examine direct viral detection methods versus serology and correct any outdated assumptions. After that, I should consider special populations such as pregnancy, HIV, and neonates. Finally, I will review screening recommendations, test performance nuances, and how to interpret results and outline a practical algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: clinical diagnosis of genital herpes based on appearance alone is often unreliable, so laboratory confirmation is recommended to avoid misclassification and to enable type-specific counseling and management. I need to ensure I incorporate guidance to obtain a thorough sexual history and complete genital and extragenital exam, because subtle or atypical lesions are common and the differential includes syphilis, chancroid, and noninfectious etiologies such as Behçet disease or fixed drug eruption. The AAFP 2024 rapid evidence reviews and European urology guidance both emphasize history, exam, and confirmatory testing as the standard approach, which aligns with best practice for STI evaluation and partner management [^115SCbDS] [^116zd5PJ] [^117W8KUa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — test choice hinges on whether lesions are present, so I should verify that branch point. When lesions are present, type-specific nucleic acid amplification testing from a lesion swab is the preferred first-line test because it detects active viral replication with high sensitivity and specificity; when no lesions are present, appropriately timed, type-specific serology can help establish past infection and support counseling, though it cannot localize the anatomic site. The AAFP 2024 guidance consistently recommends lesion PCR as preferred and serology when lesions are absent or testing windows require it, which frames the diagnostic algorithm accurately for most outpatient settings [^116zd5PJ] [^115SCbDS] [^1157fx7U].

> Wait, let me verify the hierarchy of direct tests for active lesions. NAAT/PCR is recommended over culture because of markedly higher sensitivity and faster turnaround, with several FDA-cleared lesion-swab platforms available and strong real-world performance data, while culture remains an option when NAAT is unavailable or when phenotypic susceptibility testing is needed in selected cases. I initially thought "viral culture is the gold standard", but that's outdated for genital lesions; that assertion traces largely to older or non-genital contexts such as ocular disease, whereas contemporary primary care guidance prioritizes lesion PCR for genital HSV confirmation. PCR detects substantially more positives than culture in head-to-head studies and is endorsed as preferred in AAFP 2024, whereas culture sensitivity falls as lesions heal and takes longer to result, though it is still useful when resistance testing is indicated in immunocompromised hosts [^116zd5PJ] [^117K7Udo] [^112YJe7Q].

> I need to check practical NAAT options and specimen considerations. Multiple commercial lesion assays perform well, for example the Aptima HSV assay shows approximately 95–96% positive agreement with strong negative agreement, and FDA-cleared assays exist for cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion swabs and CSF but notably not for blood, which is important if someone requests "HSV blood PCR" outside neonatal or CNS contexts. This means that for genital lesions, a swab-based type-specific NAAT is the evidence-based choice, while blood NAAT is generally not validated for routine adult diagnosis, aligning with regulatory status and clinical practice caveats [^113e1HQ3] [^1117xU57].

> Next, I should review when and how to use type-specific serology, and I need to ensure glycoprotein G–based assays are emphasized. Type-specific HSV-1 and HSV-2 serology is useful between outbreaks, in asymptomatic individuals with an HSV-positive partner, in selected high-risk STI clinic attendees, and when evaluating recurrent or atypical genital symptoms with negative lesion testing; however, I must confirm that only gG-based assays reliably distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 and that early testing can be falsely negative due to the 3–6 month seroconversion window. I should double-check assay performance differences because some automated platforms have lower specificity at low index values, making confirmatory testing or a two-tiered approach prudent to avoid false positives that can cause psychosocial harm, a point reinforced by recent comparative studies and AAFP testing guidance [^116izgFD] [^1121gRzg] [^1157fx7U] [^116D33iw] [^113Yxmpo] [^112UiWKn].

> Let me consider pregnancy-specific recommendations carefully, because timing and delivery planning matter. If a pregnant patient has no known HSV but has a partner with genital herpes, type-specific serology early in pregnancy with repeat testing at 32–34 weeks is reasonable to define risk; for those with a known history of recurrent genital HSV, suppressive acyclovir or valacyclovir beginning at 36 weeks reduces shedding and the likelihood of lesions at delivery; and if a first-episode occurs in the third trimester, I should confirm lesions with PCR or culture and counsel that cesarean delivery is typically offered due to prolonged shedding risk. I need to ensure that lesion management at labor prioritizes reducing neonatal exposure through cesarean when active lesions are present, consistent with SOGC and AAFP guidance [^112KeUzV] [^116LJZDg] [^111eK5yq] [^115SCbDS].

> For people with HIV, I should confirm the pathway if acyclovir resistance is suspected. Hold on, I should verify the correct reference identifier, which is DHHS ClinicalInfo 2025 [^116GuR8V]. In this setting, I need to obtain a viral culture from the lesion specifically to enable phenotypic susceptibility testing, because NAAT alone will not provide resistance data, and then tailor therapy accordingly based on results [^116GuR8V].

> Neonatal considerations require a separate, time-sensitive approach, so I will now examine what to do right after delivery. For infants born to mothers with active genital lesions, testing within 24–36 hours of life with whole-blood PCR and surface cultures is recommended in pediatrics practice, even though FDA-cleared HSV molecular assays are not available for blood; several labs use validated LDTs for this purpose, and early DNAemia can precede symptoms, underscoring the value of timely detection and treatment initiation in this high-risk population [^1117xU57] [^115Mezho] [^114NbMdv].

> Next, I should review population screening recommendations, and I need to ensure I don't overreach. The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for genital HSV in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, due to low positive predictive value in low-prevalence settings, false positives, and lack of demonstrated net benefit; however, targeted testing remains reasonable in specific higher-risk scenarios or for motivated patients with known HSV-positive partners. This balance between avoiding harm from false positives and addressing selected risk contexts is reinforced by both the USPSTF statement and specialty guidance on selective use [^114ENDwe] [^1157fx7U] [^11595pSj].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I should also summarize test performance so clinicians can select an optimal assay. Lesion NAATs generally demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity, with multiple platforms showing strong agreement compared with composite standards, and even isothermal methods like LAMP or LAMP-derived assays have shown acceptable performance in clinical evaluations; culture is less sensitive, particularly for healing lesions, and slower, but remains relevant when susceptibility testing is needed; importantly, there are no FDA-cleared blood assays for HSV-1/2 outside CSF and lesion swabs, limiting the role of blood PCR in adults with suspected genital HSV. These performance and regulatory details help avoid misapplication of assays in the wrong specimen types and support the primacy of lesion-swab NAAT in acute presentations [^117K7Udo] [^113e1HQ3] [^112YJe7Q] [^115ZBawD] [^1117xU57].

> I should double-check how to interpret results and plan next steps. A positive lesion PCR or culture confirms active HSV and provides type for counseling, with the caveat that HSV-1 genital infections recur and shed less over time than HSV-2, affecting transmission counseling; a positive type-specific serology indicates past infection but cannot specify anatomic site or timing, so results must be integrated with history; negative early serology after a suspected exposure should be repeated at 3–6 months; and regardless of symptoms, asymptomatic shedding is common in HSV-2 and lower but present in HSV-1, so counseling should emphasize transmission risk reduction. These points are supported by natural history and shedding studies and by primary care guidance on timing and counseling [^113XbwAr] [^114ZoUfW] [^1157fx7U] [^115SCbDS].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm and ensure it aligns with evidence. If lesions are present, obtain a type-specific NAAT from the lesion as the preferred test, reserving culture when NAAT is unavailable or when resistance testing is anticipated; if no lesions are present but suspicion remains, obtain type-specific serology with attention to the window period and assay selection; in pregnancy, add early and repeat serology if at risk, use suppressive therapy at 36 weeks for recurrent disease, and offer cesarean with active lesions or third-trimester first episodes; in people with HIV and suspected acyclovir resistance, perform culture with susceptibility testing; in exposed neonates, perform timely blood PCR via LDT and surface cultures within 24–36 hours. This stepwise approach reflects AAFP primary care guidance, obstetric society recommendations, and DHHS HIV guidance, and it balances diagnostic accuracy with patient-centered risk counseling and safety [^116zd5PJ] [^115SCbDS] [^112KeUzV] [^116LJZDg] [^116GuR8V] [^1117xU57].

Testing for genital herpes relies on **PCR from lesion swabs** [^116zd5PJ] as the preferred diagnostic method for its high sensitivity and specificity [^113e1HQ3] and its ability to distinguish HSV-1 from HSV-2 [^117K7Udo]. Serologic testing is **not recommended for routine screening** [^114ENDwe] in asymptomatic individuals because of the risk of false positives [^113Yxmpo] and limited clinical utility. Viral culture is less sensitive than PCR [^112V9ecq] and is mainly used when PCR is unavailable or for antiviral resistance testing [^116GuR8V]. In pregnancy, use type-specific serology [^112KeUzV] when there is no HSV history but a partner with HSV, and use PCR for active lesions [^1111TMiS]; consider suppressive therapy at 36 weeks [^116LJZDg] and cesarean delivery [^111eK5yq] to reduce neonatal risk [^112m6zVK].

---

## Clinical indications for testing

- **Symptomatic patients**: Patients presenting with genital ulcers, vesicles [^116zd5PJ], or other lesions suggestive of HSV infection [^117W8KUa].

- **Asymptomatic patients with high risk**: Patients with known exposure to HSV [^1157fx7U], such as sexual partners of individuals diagnosed with genital herpes [^11595pSj], or those with multiple sexual partners.

- **Pregnant women**: Particularly those without a history of HSV infection [^112KeUzV] but with partners known to have genital herpes, to assess the risk of neonatal transmission [^116LJZDg].

## Diagnostic methods

| **Method** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| PCR | PCR is the preferred diagnostic method for genital herpes due to its high sensitivity and specificity [^116zd5PJ]. It detects HSV DNA directly from lesion swabs, allowing for accurate identification and differentiation between HSV-1 and HSV-2 [^113e1HQ3] [^117K7Udo] | High sensitivity and specificity, rapid results, and ability to differentiate HSV-1 from HSV-2 | Requires specialized laboratory equipment and trained personnel [^11569rZ7] |
| Viral culture | Viral culture involves isolating the virus from lesion samples. While historically considered the gold standard, it has lower sensitivity compared to PCR [^112V9ecq], particularly in recurrent or healing lesions | Useful for antiviral susceptibility testing, particularly in cases of suspected acyclovir resistance [^116GuR8V] | Lower sensitivity, longer turnaround time, and requires viable virus samples |
| Serologic testing | Serologic tests detect HSV-specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) in blood samples. Type-specific serologic tests can differentiate between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections | Useful for identifying asymptomatic infections or confirming past exposure | Not recommended for routine screening [^114ENDwe] in asymptomatic individuals due to potential false positives [^113Yxmpo] and limited clinical utility |

---

## Recommended testing protocols

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended testing method** | **Additional considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Symptomatic patients with active lesions | PCR from lesion swabs [^116zd5PJ] | ∅ |
| Asymptomatic patients with known exposure | Type-specific serologic testing [^1157fx7U] | Confirmatory testing may be required [^112UiWKn] |
| Pregnant women without HSV history but with HSV-positive partner | Type-specific serologic testing [^112KeUzV] | Repeat testing at 32–34 weeks gestation [^112KeUzV] |
| Suspected antiviral resistance | Viral culture with susceptibility testing [^116GuR8V] | ∅ |

---

## Special considerations in pregnancy

- **Type-specific serologic testing**: Recommended [^112KeUzV] for pregnant women without a history of HSV infection but with partners known to have genital herpes.

- **Suppressive therapy**: Initiate suppressive antiviral therapy (acyclovir or valacyclovir) [^116LJZDg] at 36 weeks gestation to reduce the risk of clinical lesions and viral shedding at delivery [^115SCbDS].

- **Cesarean delivery**: Consider cesarean delivery in cases of active lesions or first symptomatic episodes during the third trimester [^111eK5yq].

---

## Limitations and challenges

- **Asymptomatic shedding**: HSV can be transmitted even in the absence of symptoms [^113XbwAr], complicating diagnosis and prevention efforts [^114ZoUfW].

- **False positives**: Serologic tests may yield false positives [^114ENDwe], particularly in asymptomatic individuals [^113Yxmpo], leading to potential psychological distress and unnecessary treatment.

- **Resource limitations**: PCR testing requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, which may not be available in all healthcare settings [^11569rZ7].

---

PCR from lesion swabs is the **preferred diagnostic method** [^117K7Udo] for genital herpes due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Serologic testing is not recommended for routine screening [^114ENDwe] in asymptomatic individuals, whereas viral culture is primarily used for antiviral susceptibility testing [^116GuR8V]. Pregnancy requires special considerations to prevent neonatal transmission [^116LJZDg].

### The spectrum of genital herpes simplex virus infection in men attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic [^112V9ecq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The spectrum of genital herpes (GH) has been understudied in men, particularly African American men. Consecutive men attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic were enrolled in a study of GH epidemiology. Consenting participants answered questionnaires detailing their sexual and social activities and underwent serological testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and collection of genital swabs for viral detection.

Of the 516 men enrolled, 465 (90%) were African American. Antibodies to HSV-1 were present in 315 (61%) of participants, and 233 (45%) had antibodies to HSV-2. Factors associated with HSV-2 infection included older age and African American race. HSV was detected in genital swabs from 52 men; 43 (82.7%) swabs were HSV-2 positive, and 9 (17.3%) were HSV-1 positive. The overall viral shedding rate among men (n = 247) with evidence of GH (HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection) was 21.1%, and the asymptomatic shedding rate in this same group was 5.2%. The sensitivities of culture for detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 0.22 and 0.58, respectively, compared with that of polymerase chain reaction.

Genital HSV infections are common and largely unrecognized among this segment of the population. HSV-1 infection constitutes a nontrivial proportion of GH in these men.

### Performance evaluation of the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay for the detection of HSV in cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesion specimens [^113e1HQ3]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Timely and precise laboratory diagnosis of Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) is required to guide clinical management.

- **Objectives**: The study evaluated the limit of detection (LOD) and performance characteristics of the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay in comparison to four assays.

- **Study design**: The multi-center study compared qualitative detection of HSV-1 and 2 by the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay (Hologic) to ELVIS culture, Lyra Direct (Quidel), AmpliVue (Quidel), and a laboratory-developed test (LDT). LOD was performed using VTM and STM diluted viral concentrations, and clinical performance was evaluated using 505 swab specimens.

- **Results**: The Aptima LOD studies performed showed a lower detection limit for STM specimens as 1450 copies/mL and 430 copies/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. The LOD for VTM specimens was 9370 copies/mL and 8045 copies/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. When the assays were analyzed based on the positive consensus result established, the Aptima had 95% percent positive agreement (PPA) and 100% negative percent agreement (NPA) for HSV-1. For HSV-2, the PPA and NPA for Aptima were 96% and 100%, respectively. AmpliVue had a 1.8% invalid rate, while Lyra had no invalid results but an inhibition rate of 0.8%. Aptima and LDT did not have any invalid or inhibited results.

- **Conclusion**: The results indicate that the Aptima HSV-1 and 2 assay is sensitive, and the performance characteristics of the Aptima assay are comparable to the assays analyzed for the detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and 2 from cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^1117xU57]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Various methods have been employed for the diagnosis of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, including conventional viral culture, serological tests, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). Among these diagnostic methods, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely utilized due to its high sensitivity and specificity, as well as its short turnaround time for detecting viral nucleic acid. However, it is important to note that FDA-cleared assays for HSV-1 and HSV-2 detection are currently limited to two specimen types: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesion swabs.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants born to mothers who test positive for genital HSV lesions undergo testing for HSV within 24–36 hours of birth, including PCR testing in whole blood and HSV cultures. Presently, no FDA-cleared molecular assays are specifically designed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 detection in blood as a specimen type. However, HSV NAAT laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) using blood are commonly used in clinical practice for the management of patients suspected of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections.

Previous studies have explored various sample types for HSV detection, including whole blood, dried blood spots, serum, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). However, there is a lack of standardization and consensus on the optimal specimen type for detecting bloodstream HSV infections. While whole blood is widely utilized, there is currently insufficient data to demonstrate its superiority over other blood compartments for the diagnosis and management of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections.

### Serological testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and HSV-2 infection [^116izgFD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Serological tests for herpes simplex virus (HSV) that can accurately distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are now commercially available. These tests detect antibodies to HSV glycoproteins G-1 and G-2, which evoke a type-specific antibody response. Focus Technologies produces the HerpeSelect-1 and HerpeSelect-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and the HSV-1 and HSV-2 HerpeSelect1/2 Immunoblot. Diagnology has marketed POCkit-HSV-2, a point-of-care test for HSV-2, allowing blood from a finger stick to be tested in a clinic.

These tests can be used to confirm a genital herpes diagnosis, establish a diagnosis of HSV infection in patients with atypical complaints, identify asymptomatic carriers, and identify persons at risk for acquiring HSV. Potential settings for the use of these tests include sexually transmitted disease clinics, prenatal clinics, and clinics that care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patient interest in HSV serological tests appears high.

### Genital herpes [^116Qqrpp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of herpes simplex virus from mother to neonate? What are the effects of antiviral treatment in people with a first episode of genital herpes? What are the effects of interventions to reduce the impact of recurrence? What are the effects of treatments in people with genital herpes and HIV? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2006. Clinical evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review. We included harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antivirals, caesarean delivery, condoms, oral acyclovir, psychotherapy, recombinant glycoprotein vaccines, serological screening, and counselling.

### Type-specific identification of anogenital herpes simplex virus infections by use of a commercially available nucleic acid amplification test [^117K7Udo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes infections are among the most common sexually transmitted infections (STI), but diagnostic methods for genital herpes have not kept pace with the movement toward molecular testing. Here, we describe an FDA-approved molecular assay that identifies and types herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections for use in routine clinical settings. Paired samples from anogenital lesions were tested using the BD ProbeTec HSV Q(x) (HSVQ(x)) system, HSV culture, and a laboratory-developed PCR assay. Family planning, obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN), or sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States served as recruitment sites. Sensitivity and specificity estimates, head-to-head comparisons, measures of agreement, and latent-class analyses were performed to provide robust estimates of performance.

A total of 508 participants (174 men and 334 women) with anogenital lesions were included; 260 HSV-2 and 73 HSV-1 infections were identified. No differences in test performance based on gender, clinic type, location of the lesion, or type of lesion were observed. The sensitivity of HSV-2 detection ranged from 98.4 to 100% depending on the analytical approach, while the specificity ranged from 80.6% compared to the less sensitive culture method, to 97.0% compared to PCR. For HSV-1, the sensitivity and specificity ranges were 96.7 to 100% and 95.1 to 99.4%, respectively. This assay may improve our ability to accurately diagnose anogenital lesions due to herpes infection.

### Seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 among persons aged 14–49 years — united States, 2005–2008 [^111vmqAe]. MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide and the primary cause of genital and neonatal herpes and genital ulcer disease. Multiple studies have shown that HSV-2 infection increases the risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by at least twofold. HSV-2 infection is lifelong, and serologic testing provides the best method to estimate HSV-2 prevalence.

Since 1976, the CDC has monitored HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). After increasing from 1976–1980 (NHANES II) to 1988–1994 (NHANES III), HSV-2 seroprevalence decreased, from 21.0% in 1988–1994 to 17.0% in NHANES 1999–2004. To determine whether HSV-2 seroprevalence in the United States has changed since 1999–2004 and to estimate HSV-2 seroprevalence by age, race/ethnicity, and reported lifetime number of sex partners, the CDC analyzed serologic test results from persons aged 14–49 years who participated in NHANES 2005–2008. The results indicated that HSV-2 seroprevalence was 16.2% overall, not statistically different from the seroprevalence in 1999–2004. Seroprevalence was highest among women (20.9%) and non-Hispanic blacks (39.2%). Of those infected with HSV-2, 81.1% had not received a diagnosis.

Clinicians, health departments, healthcare organizations, and community groups should promote measures that prevent HSV-2 transmission, including minimizing the number of sex partners, avoiding concurrent sexual partnerships, and using condoms consistently and correctly.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^113Yxmpo]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are among the most common and stigmatized infections, affecting over 4 billion people worldwide and more than 100 million Americans. Despite this, most people are unaware of their infection status, and antibody testing is not widely recommended due to poor test performance.

This study compared the test performance of three assays: Roche Elecsys HSV-1 IgG and HSV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON HSV-1/2 IgG, and Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG, against the gold-standard HSV western blot. A total of 1,994 individuals participated, including 1,017 with PCR or culture-confirmed HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 infection.

- **Test performance**:
	- The Bio-Rad and Roche assays exhibited similar performance metrics.
	- For HSV-1 IgG, both had low sensitivity (97%).
	- For HSV-2 IgG, they demonstrated high sensitivity (> 97%) and high specificity (> 98%).

- **DiaSorin assay performance**:
	- Showed higher sensitivity (92.1%) but much lower specificity (88.7%) for HSV-1 IgG.
	- Demonstrated poor sensitivity (94.5%) and specificity (94.2%) for HSV-2 IgG.
	- Performed poorly at low-positive index values; 60.9% of DiaSorin HSV-1 results and 20.8% of DiaSorin HSV-2 results with positive index values < 3.0 yielded false positives.

Based on an estimated HSV-2 seroprevalence of 12% in the United States, the positive predictive values for HSV-2 IgG were 96.1% for Roche, 87.4% for Bio-Rad, and 69.0% for DiaSorin, indicating that nearly one in three positive DiaSorin HSV-2 IgG results would be falsely positive.

### Genital herpes complicating pregnancy [^112m6zVK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 22% of pregnant women are infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2, and 2% of women will acquire HSV during pregnancy. Remarkably, up to 90% of these women are undiagnosed because they are asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms attributed to other vulvovaginal disorders. Diagnosis of genital herpes relies on laboratory confirmation with culture or polymerase chain reaction assay of genital lesions and type-specific glycoprotein G-based serologic testing. Neonatal herpes is the most severe complication of genital HSV infection and is caused by contact with infected genital secretions at the time of labor. Maternal acquisition of HSV in the third trimester of pregnancy carries the highest risk of neonatal transmission.

Despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal herpes, little change in the incidence or serious sequelae from this infection has occurred. As such, prevention of the initial neonatal infection is critically important. Obstetricians are in a unique position to prevent vertical HSV transmission by identifying women with genital lesions at the time of labor for cesarean delivery, prescribing antiviral suppressive therapy as appropriate, and avoiding unnecessary invasive intrapartum procedures in women with genital herpes. Enhanced prevention strategies include identification of women at risk for HSV acquisition during pregnancy by testing women and possibly their partners for HSV antibodies and providing counseling to prevent transmission to women in late pregnancy.

### Serologic detection of herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies among pregnant women using a point-of-care test from Focus Diagnostics [^112e4x5A]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

Serologic assays that identify herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) type-specific antibodies have been commercially available for more than a decade. Greater acceptance of these tests is hindered by uncertainty regarding their performance in real-world clinical settings.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to compare the test characteristics of the Focus HerpeSelect Express Assay (EA) versus the Focus HerpeSelect enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for detection of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies among pregnant women enrolled from three geographic sites with varying prevalences of HSV-2 infection. A second objective was to evaluate the performance of a HSV-2 testing strategy in which EA screens and ELISA confirms HSV-2 serodiagnosis.

- **Study design**: We enrolled 399 pregnant women from Atlanta, GA, Moorestown, NJ, and Pittsburgh, PA, into this cross-sectional investigation. Capillary whole blood was obtained from study participants and evaluated for the presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibodies using the EA. Serum samples were also obtained from all study participants for subsequent identification of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies using both ELISA and the Focus Immunoblot assays.

- **Results**: We observed 96.2% agreement between results obtained with EA and ELISA. Overall, when compared to ELISA results, the sensitivity of EA for detection of HSV-2 type-specific antibodies was 94.2%, and the specificity was 97.1%. Using Immunoblot results as our standard for performance calculations, the positive predictive value (PPV) of HSV-2 serodiagnosis increased from 91.7% to 98.2% when ELISA was employed.

### Rapid diagnosis of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 bloodstream infections utilizing a sample-to-answer platform [^115yvpAc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex viruses are among the most ubiquitous in human infections. In most cases, HSV infections in individuals with an intact immune system are relatively mild and can cause discomfort, but often go unnoticed. In rare instances, HSV can enter the bloodstream, leading to more severe manifestations affecting multiple regions of the skin, the viscera, and the central nervous system. This is especially true for neonates and individuals with an immunocompromised status, for whom HSV infections or reactivations can be life-threatening. Neonatal disseminated HSV infection, for example, can result in devastating outcomes, with an untreated mortality rate of approximately 80% and up to 30% even with antiviral therapy.

In solid organ transplantation recipients, HSV infection or reactivation can also lead to more severe manifestations, including esophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, and potential graft loss. Therefore, achieving a rapid, accurate, and definitive diagnosis of HSV bloodstream infections is crucial in clinical settings. Rapid diagnosis enables timely administration of antiviral treatment, influences patient management decisions for those at high risk, and can contribute to shorter hospital stays, thereby reducing healthcare costs.

### The global and regional burden of genital ulcer disease due to herpes simplex virus: A natural history modelling study [^1179eUbN]. BMJ Global Health (2020). Low credibility.

The genital ulcer disease (GUD) estimates build on published WHO estimates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, meaning that issues and assumptions affecting the infection estimates, such as data availability, generalizability, and quality, are carried forward to the GUD estimates. Furthermore, HSV-1 infection estimates were not produced separately by sex for all regions; hence, GUD estimates for HSV-1 may not fully capture differences by sex. However, the infection estimates were informed by systematic reviews up to August 2018 and represent the best attempt to quantify HSV-2 and genital HSV-1 prevalence and incidence globally by age and sex.

In some countries, such as the United States, an "epidemiological transition" has occurred whereby rates of oral HSV-1 infection during childhood have declined, and rates of genital HSV-1 infection have increased due to decreased immunity to HSV-1 on entering adulthood, possibly combined with increasing rates of oral sex. In the most recent prospective evaluation of GUD among women with new HSV infections in North America, 62% of HSV GUD first episodes were caused by HSV-1. Our estimate for the Americas was similar, with 55% of first episodes due to HSV-1. Such trends may be occurring elsewhere in the world. Although the potential for genital HSV-1 infection post-childhood is uncertain, our analyses suggest that genital HSV-1 contributes only modestly to all GUD globally, given the vastly greater number of HSV-2 recurrences.

Similarly, a third limitation concerns the availability, quality, and representativeness of natural history data. Studies differed on a number of factors…

### Future prospects for new vaccines against sexually transmitted infections [^117C1ALS]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus

HSV-2 is the most common cause of genital herpes, with an estimated 417 million people aged 14–49 infected worldwide. In addition, 140 million adults are estimated to have genital infection with HSV-1, which is often acquired orally in childhood but is now an important cause of genital herpes in many high-income countries (HICs).

Genital HSV infection leads to chronic infection with a lifelong reservoir in the sacral ganglia. Viral reactivation occurs frequently, particularly for HSV-2, leading to genital ulcers or asymptomatic viral shedding at the genital skin or mucosa, during which HSV can be transmitted. A major negative public health consequence of HSV-2 infection is its role in propagating the HIV epidemic, as chronic genital inflammation from HSV-2 increases HIV acquisition risk by two-fold to three-fold. In Kenya, the estimated population attributable fraction of HIV infection due to HSV-2 is 48%.

Mother-to-child HSV transmission causing neonatal herpes is rare but often leads to infant death or devastating neurologic damage. Prevention tools, including antivirals and condoms, can partially reduce HSV transmission risk for individuals, but no method provides adequate protection, and an HSV vaccine is a much-needed prevention strategy.

Two strategies are being pursued for HSV-2 vaccine development. The classic approach uses a prophylactic vaccine targeting people who are not infected to prevent HSV acquisition. Alternatively, a therapeutic vaccine is designed for people who already have HSV-2 infection to reduce shedding and recurrence.

### A rapid and simple isothermal nucleic acid amplification test for detection of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 [^115ZBawD]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

The simple and rapid IsoAmp HSV assay has been developed for the qualitative detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 from genital lesions. Sample preparation involves a simple dilution step, and the diluted specimens are directly added to the device and amplified by isothermal helicase-dependent amplification (HDA). Amplification products are then detected by a DNA strip embedded in a disposable cassette without any instrument. The total test turnaround time is less than 1.5 hours from specimen processing to result reporting.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the IsoAmp HSV assay as well as the robustness and reproducibility of the assay.

- **Study design**: The analytical sensitivity of the IsoAmp HSV assay was determined using both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Clinical performance was evaluated using 135 frozen specimens collected from patients with suspected HSV infection in the genital area.

- **Results**: The analytical sensitivity of the assays was 5.5 and 34.1 copies/reaction for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, with a 95% confidence interval. When the herpes viral culture was used as the reference standard, the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the IsoAmp HSV assay were 100.0% and 96.3%, respectively. The inter-laboratory reproducibility achieved an overall 97.5% agreement by testing a total of 80 blinded HSV-1 samples among five laboratories.

- **Conclusion**: Adequate analytical and clinical performance of the IsoAmp HSV assay was demonstrated. This assay is simple to perform and has acceptable inter-laboratory reproducibility.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112166oi]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

To further examine automated HSV serology assay performance, we took advantage of a unique cohort of 1,017 persons with genital HSV infection confirmed by PCR or culture through genital herpes studies at the UW VRC from 1981 to 2019. For this study, we included samples from persons with genital herpes with PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV infection who had serological testing using the WB at least 6 months (median 5.8 years, range 6 months to 50 years) after the initial episode of genital herpes. Given the focus on genital herpes, 886 (87%) people in this cohort had PCR- or culture-confirmed HSV-2 infections, and 131 (13%) people had PCR- or culture-confirmed genital HSV-1 infections. WB results were 100% concordant with the PCR or culture results. Of the 886 people with confirmed HSV-2 genital infections, 320 (36%) also had HSV-1 antibodies detected on the WB, most likely from a prior HSV-1 infection.

The VRC cohort was composed of 669 women (65.8%) and 348 men (34.2%) who provided samples between 1981 and 2019 (median 1989). Most people were white (86.3%), and the overall median age was 34.3 (range: 16–88 years).

### Multicenter evaluation of Meridian Bioscience HSV 1&2 molecular assay for detection of herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 from clinical cutaneous and mucocutaneous specimens [^112YJe7Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes acute and relapsing symptoms characterized by ulcerative lesions. Laboratory diagnosis of HSV in cutaneous or mucocutaneous lesions has historically been performed using viral cell culture systems; however, these tests are laborious and suffer decreased sensitivity for advanced-stage lesions. The recent availability of FDA-cleared moderately complex assays has resulted in the increased use of molecular diagnostics for the routine detection of HSV in superficial swab specimens.

We performed a clinical evaluation of the recently FDA-cleared illumigene HSV 1&2 loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay (Meridian Bioscience, Cincinnati, OH) for the detection and differentiation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in cutaneous and mucocutaneous swab specimens. A total of 1,153 clinical swab specimens were collected and tested at 7 different clinical centers. Each specimen was tested for the presence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 using the illumigene assay, and results were compared to those of the enzyme-linked virus-inducible system (ELVIS) as the reference method.

Overall, the illumigene assay demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 94.8% and 95.5%, respectively, for the detection of HSV-1. Detection of HSV-2 was similar, with a sensitivity of 98.9% and a specificity of 95.5%.

Discrepant analysis was performed using an alternative molecular test (AmpliVue HSV1+2 assay; Quidel Molecular, San Diego, CA) on 91 of 99 specimens that were recorded as false positive (FP) or false negative (FN) compared to the reference method. In total, 57 of 78 (73%) FP and 9…

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^111WQvTK]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

**Methods**: The participant had positive results from a type-specific HSV immunoblot assay. Swab specimens were collected every weekday for 4 weeks using a spatial grid of the female genital tract, as previously described. An aliquot of each swab specimen was used for column-based DNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis to detect HSV-1 genomes. The participant also experienced symptomatic genital HSV-1 recurrences before and after the swabbing study; specimens from associated lesions were collected for HSV-1 culture. This individual's virus is referred to hereafter as "v.29". The University of Washington Human Subjects Division approved the study, and the participant provided informed consent.

### Genital herpes: Insights into sexually transmitted infectious disease [^111dH5pm]. Microbial Cell (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent inflammation and lesions.

- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1, transmitted through sexual contact.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of mucous membranes presenting as bilateral clusters of macules and papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia. Symptoms include pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis (in women), and proctitis (in homosexual men). Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrent episodes may show prodromal symptoms such as paresthesia and pain in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

### Herpes simplex keratitis: Challenges in diagnosis and clinical management [^113GquDK]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Viral culture is considered the gold standard for identifying HSV. When compared to viral culture, clinical diagnosis is only 55%–65% accurate. Unfortunately, culturing HSV is time-consuming and can take a week or longer when few infectious viruses are in the sample and typically underestimates the number of patients whose disease is due to HSV. IFA has also been used to diagnose HSV and detects 33.3% more positive cases than viral culture. It also had a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 71.4%, positive predictive value of 63.6%, and negative predictive value of 81.8%. In other studies, the sensitivity of IFA in diagnosing HSV ranged from 77% to 86%. However, sample size and false-positive and false-negative results can unfavorably influence IFA.

HSK is a leading cause of corneal blindness. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is necessary to start the proper treatment and prevent further complications. Variation in different subtypes has posed a challenge to accurately diagnose HSK. This has also prevented a unified or specific test from properly diagnosing all of the different subtypes in a quick and effective manner.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^112SekEu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Here we present genomic and in vitro analyses of temporally separated episodes of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) shedding by an HSV-1–seropositive and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HSV-2–seronegative individual who has frequent recurrences of genital HSV-1. Using oligonucleotide enrichment, we compared viral genomes from uncultured swab specimens collected on different days and from distinct genital sites. We found that viral genomes from 7 swab specimens and 3 cultured specimens collected over a 4-month period from the same individual were 98.5% identical. We observed a > 2-fold difference in the number of minority variants between swab specimens from lesions, swab specimens from nonlesion sites, and cultured specimens. This virus appeared distinct in its phylogenetic relationship to other strains, and it contained novel coding variations in 21 viral proteins. This included a truncation in the UL11 tegument protein, which is involved in viral egress and spread. Normal immune responses were identified, suggesting that unique viral genomic features may contribute to the recurrent genital infection that this participant experiences.

### Genital ulcers: Differential diagnosis and management [^111dQMhd]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Genital ulcers may be located on the vagina, penis, and anorectal or perineal areas and may be infectious or noninfectious. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. A diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is made through physical examination and observation of genital lesions. The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease guidelines provide strategies for the management of patients with genital ulcer disease.

Specific testing includes a polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus; syphilis serology and darkfield microscopy or a direct fluorescent antibody test for Treponema pallidum; and/or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings where chancroid is highly prevalent. Rarely, cases of Epstein-Barr virus may present with genital ulcers. Syphilis and chancroid cause genital ulcers and are mandatory reportable diseases to the local health department.

In some cases, no pathogen is identified. It is important to consider noninfectious etiologies such as sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions. Genital ulcers are symptomatic by definition, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for syphilis infection for those at risk, early screening for syphilis infection in all pregnant women, and against routine serologic screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

### Herpes simplex virus DNA testing by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for accurate clinical diagnosis and detection of mucosal viral shedding [^1137Wmp5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) periodically forms characteristic blisters in the perioral and genital areas in a subset of people. Because of the lack of accurate tests for this common virus, various types of perioral/anogenital lesions are often misdiagnosed as herpes. Although asymptomatic HSV-positive people shed the virus, the precise time course of symptoms and viral shedding is unclear.

The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method amplifies target DNA sequences without thermal cycles, making it simpler and faster than the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To investigate the clinical-laboratorial correlation and whether HSV can be detected in the oral cavity during symptom occurrence, we collected 445 specimens from 211 patients who visited our clinic with suspected herpetic lesions or were non-symptomatic volunteers. DNA was extracted from swabs simultaneously taken from lesions (n = 219) and seemingly asymptomatic oral mucosa (n = 226). HSV-1 and HSV-2 DNA sequences were amplified by LAMP and validated by quantitative real-time PCR.

The LAMP method detected HSV DNA almost as sensitively (97%) as PCR. Positivity for HSV DNA was found in 54% (40/74) of specimens from the perioral/oral area. Review of clinical images of reHerpes labialis revealed that HSV DNA was detected only from lesions located on the perioral skin and/or the dry, vermilion part of the lip. No HSV DNA was found in immunocompetent patients with lesions confined to the oral mucosa except during primary infection. This observation may be an important principle for the clinical diagnosis of reHerpes.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing who priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^116Dw3bg]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

- **Areas for consideration for further research**: HSV-2 epidemiology has seen significant progress, with most research priorities identified in the workshop being addressed. However, some gaps remain:

	- Certain geographical areas have been neglected, such as North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Western Asia.
	- There are still unanswered questions about the causes of high HSV-2 incidence among younger persons and at-risk groups, particularly in the African region.
	- Further understanding is needed of the contribution of HSV-2 to genital ulcer disease (GUD) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).

- **HSV-2 diagnostics**: All the research priorities for HSV-2 diagnostics in LMICs identified in the workshop have been addressed. However, the priority to establish optimal genital sampling techniques for direct diagnostic methods was only partly addressed. Only six studies were published over the 20-year period, showing little repeatability and no definite conclusion. Furthermore, although four studies evaluated the performance of two different point-of-care assays for HSV-2, they reported poor accuracy.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112fMEv8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are important human pathogens that cause lifelong infections characterized by latent infection with cycles of viral mucosal replication. Classically, HSV infections present with episodes of recurrent, painful lesions of the oral or genital epithelium, but many infected persons remain asymptomatic. HSV is characterized by two types: HSV-1 is near-ubiquitous and infects an estimated 67% of the world's population and approximately 48% of adults in the United States of America. HSV-1 is associated with oral lesions but is an increasingly recognized cause of genital herpes. Conversely, HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes and infects approximately 13% of adults worldwide and around 12% of adults in the United States of America.

HSV infections can be diagnosed by detecting the virus itself — typically through culture or PCR — or detecting antibodies against viral proteins. The HSV lifecycle, which includes cycles of lytic and latent infection, complicates diagnosis and limits accurate PCR testing to episodes of active mucosal infection. Not all episodes of active mucosal infection are symptomatic, and high rates of asymptomatic shedding mean symptoms alone cannot be used to guide testing to prevent transmission. High-throughput, sensitive, and specific serological diagnostics are required for both clinical care and potential screening to diagnose the vast majority of HSV infections that currently go undetected.

### Effect of HSV-2 infection on subsequent HIV acquisition: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tLF4D]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) are two global health problems. In 2015, it was estimated that 36.7 million people were living with HIV/AIDS globally. In 2012, an estimated 417 million people aged 15–49 years had HSV-2 infection. Seventy percent of HIV infections are in sub-Saharan Africa, which also has the highest HSV-2 prevalence. HSV-2 causes genital herpes, which, when symptomatic, is characterized by periodic recurrences of painful genital ulcers. Although genital herpes is asymptomatic or unrecognized in about 80–90% of individuals, asymptomatic viral reactivation and shedding are common. Thus, although individuals with HSV-2 are most infectious when they are symptomatic, most transmissions are thought to occur when the source partner is asymptomatic. Genital HSV-2 infection can considerably affect relationships through feelings of shame and stigma and concerns about the risk of transmission.

HIV and HSV-2 are both lifelong sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are associated with similar risk factors (e.g. age, sex, partner change rate, condom use, male circumcision). Additionally, evidence exists of direct and reciprocal biological interactions between HIV and HSV-2. Active HSV-2 infection, regardless of symptoms, involves high concentrations of activated CD4-positive T cells, which are target cells for HIV in the genital area and can lead to breaks in the mucosal layer through which HIV can enter. Because genital ulceration and viral shedding occur most frequently in the first year of HSV-2 infection, the increase in HIV susceptibility might be highest for individuals in this early stage.

### Current thinking on genital herpes [^1172tkQw]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Genital herpes has a high global prevalence and burden of disease. This manuscript highlights recent advances in our understanding of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.

- **Recent findings**: Studies demonstrate a changing epidemiological landscape with an increasing proportion of genital herpes cases associated with HSV type 1. There is also growing evidence that the majority of infected individuals exhibit frequent, brief shedding episodes that are most often asymptomatic, which likely contribute to high HSV transmission rates. Given this finding, as well as readily available serological assays, some have proposed that routine HSV screening be performed. However, this remains controversial and is not currently recommended. Host immune responses, particularly local CD4 and CD8 T cell activity, are crucial for HSV control and clearance following initial infection, during latency, and after reactivation. Prior HSV immunity may also afford partial protection against HSV reinfection and disease. Although HSV vaccine trials have been disappointing and existing antiviral medications are limited, novel prophylactic and therapeutic modalities are currently in development.

- **Summary**: Although much remains unknown about genital herpes, improved knowledge of HSV epidemiology, pathogenesis, and host immunity may help guide new strategies for disease prevention and control.

### Genital herpes [^114DHpv7]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of herpes simplex virus from mother to neonate? What are the effects of antiviral treatment in people with a first episode of genital herpes? What are the effects of interventions to reduce the impact of recurrence? What are the effects of treatments in people with genital herpes and HIV? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antivirals, cesarean delivery, condoms, oral aciclovir, psychotherapy, recombinant glycoprotein vaccines, serological screening, and counseling.

### Genital herpes infection: Progress and problems [^114mNPeo]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2023). Low credibility.

Genital herpes (GH) is a sexually transmitted infection causing recurrent, self-limited ulcerations on the genital area, buttocks, and thighs. Symptoms vary, ranging from unrecognized or mild to severe, with frequent recurrences. Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type-1 or type-2 are responsible for GH. HSV establishes latency in sacral ganglia, resulting in a lifelong infection. Viral reactivation can lead to genital ulceration or asymptomatic shedding, which may result in transmission. HSV infection during pregnancy poses risks such as fulminant hepatitis and neonatal transmission. In immunocompromised individuals, severe and atypical manifestations are observed. Guanosine analogs are used to treat symptoms and to prevent recurrences, shedding, and transmission. Novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are currently in development.

### Therapeutic vaccine for genital herpes simplex virus-2 infection: Findings from a randomized trial [^115Ed4to]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common sexually transmitted pathogen that often causes genital lesions. Transmission occurs largely from asymptomatic genital tract virus shedding, making this a key target for a therapeutic HSV vaccine. Management of genital herpes currently includes episodic or daily suppressive therapy with nucleoside analogues, which abrogates most recurrences but only partly reduces viral shedding and transmission.

GEN-003 contains a transmembrane deletion mutant of glycoprotein D (gD2ΔTMR), a primary target antigen for neutralizing antibody and T cells, combined with a large fragment of infected cell protein 4 (ICP4.2), an HSV-2 T-cell antigen prioritized through human T-cell screens. This antigen was selected by comparing T-cell responses of HSV-2-seropositive but asymptomatic individuals and HSV-2-exposed seronegative individuals to those with recurrent disease, using high-throughput HSV-2 proteomic screens. GEN-003 is a combination of these two proteins with a novel adjuvant, Matrix-M2™. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that GEN-003 elicits antibody and T-cell responses in mice and is protective in a guinea pig model of recurrent HSV-2 infection.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation phase 1/2 study of GEN-003 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and effect on viral shedding of this candidate immunotherapy (clinical trials registration NCT01667341).

In 1997, we developed a PCR assay for the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA. Recently, we determined an optimal positivity criterion based on research specimens and a dilution study. We found that a cutoff of 50 HSV DNA copies/ml of swab specimen, a level 10-fold lower than our previous cutoff, minimizes misclassification.

Molecular biology/DNA detection

Sixteen studies evaluated molecular biology/DNA detection methods. All the DNA detection methods studied performed well and were deemed the preferred direct method of detecting HSV-2 in genital lesions. Most were commercial assays, and two were in-house assays. The four studies on multiplex PCR (testing more than one sexually transmitted infection (STI) simultaneously) found it to be a sufficiently accurate and reproducible method, which is rapid and has the potential to work in low-resource settings. Two of these used real-time PCR, and three used conventional PCR. All the studies on nested PCR (a more accurate modification of conventional PCR) found the technique to be more accurate than alternative direct methods. Studies focusing on real-time PCR, which is generally an even more accurate and rapid type of PCR, also found its performance to be superior to other direct methods. Alternative DNA detection methods studied were automated PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and electrochemical DNA biosensors. One study was identified for each, and they were all found to be accurate, rapid, and cost-effective means of detecting and typing HSV-2 DNA, especially in low-resource settings.

Syndromic diagnosis

Of the twelve studies that examined the accuracy of syndromic diagnosis of HSV-2 compared with biomedical testing, seven (58.3%) found this method to lack sufficient accuracy. In high-risk populations, such as clinic attendees and men who have sex with men (MSM), there was poor specificity for syndromic diagnosis, leading to overdiagnosis. In general populations, syndromic diagnosis was found to have limited effectiveness.

### Viral shedding 1 year following first-episode genital HSV-1 infection [^114ZoUfW]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is the leading cause of first-episode genital herpes in many countries.

- **Objective**: To inform counseling messages regarding genital HSV-1 transmission, oral and genital viral shedding patterns among persons with first-episode genital HSV-1 infection were assessed. The trajectory of the development of HSV-specific antibody and T-cell responses was also characterized.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A prospective cohort followed up for up to 2 years, with 82 participants followed up between 2013 and 2018. Participants were recruited from sexual health and primary care clinics in Seattle, Washington. Persons with laboratory-documented first-episode genital HSV-1 infection, without HIV infection or pregnancy, were referred for enrollment.

- **Exposures**: First-episode genital HSV-1 infection.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Genital and oral HSV-1 shedding and lesion rates at 2 months, 11 months, and up to 2 years after initial genital HSV-1 infection. Participants self-collected oral and genital swabs for HSV polymerase chain reaction testing for 30 days at 2 and 11 months and up to 2 years after diagnosis of genital HSV-1. Blood samples were collected at serial time points to assess immune responses to HSV-1. Primary HSV-1 infection was defined as absent HSV antibody at baseline or evolving antibody profile using the University of Washington HSV Western blot. HSV-specific T-cell responses were detected using interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot.

- **Results**: Among the 82 participants, the median (range) age was 26 (16–64) years.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^115JLQ2c]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first study to examine anatomically separated genital HSV-1 shedding patterns for a single participant over a multiday period (Figure 1). We present data from an individual with frequent genital HSV-1 lesions and a high rate of viral shedding, even several years into her infection. Recurrences of genital HSV-1 after the first year occur in only 5% of infected individuals. We found that v.29 had unique phylogenetic signatures and did not cluster with known HSV-1 genomes (Figure 2). V.29 also had a unique truncation in the UL11 viral tegument protein (Figure 3). We observed conservation in viral genomes — at the consensus level — between swab specimens collected over 3 days and cultured specimens collected over 4 months (Figure 4). However, at the level of MVs, we observed a > 2-fold decrease in the average number of MVs — and a 6-fold decrease in genic MVs — in nonlesion swab specimens and cultures relative to the lesion specimens (Figure 5). The available data indicate that this participant has a typical CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response (Figure 6), although it is possible that a quantitative or qualitative difference in these responses is causally associated with her clinical phenotype. These data suggest that viral genomic factors may be impacting the relatively severe clinical phenotype that this participant experiences. Alternatively, she may not have localized HSV-1–specific T-cells to the genital region either acutely, during recurrences, or chronically, as tissue-resident memory cells that locally persist after resolution of episodic infection.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing who priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^111deMyX]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

Higher HSV-2 prevalence was found in women compared with men. This gender discrepancy appears constant over different geographical areas and could be due to a higher biological susceptibility to HSV-2 infection in women than in men. As expected for a virus that causes lifelong infection, most studies found that HSV-2 prevalence is strongly associated with age.

The review's findings also draw attention to the limited research that explores the reasons for the high HSV-2 prevalence in young adults, with a mean age of 25 years, particularly among women from sub-Saharan Africa. The findings highlight the limited research that examines the contribution of HSV-2 to genital ulcer disease (GUD). Given that HSV-2 infection can lead to recurrent GUD, more studies are required.

There were no HSV-2 studies based in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe during the studied period. However, because we excluded non-English language records and could not use separate search terms for each developing country, we likely missed several relevant studies specific to those regions.

- **Research priorities**: All research priorities for HSV-2 diagnostics were addressed, at least in part. Substantial progress was made in DNA detection methods and in exploring the performance of existing serological assays in different African sera. More accurate and rapid DNA detection techniques continue to be researched, and many African countries have identified the most accurate ELISA for their populations. However, establishing the optimal genital sampling technique was a research priority that was only partially addressed.

### ACOG practice bulletin: Clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 57, November 2004. Gynecologic herpes simplex virus infections [^111orxW5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Both herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I and HSV type 2 can cause genital herpes. Because the infection is chronic, genital herpes has become the most common sexually transmitted disease among women. The prevalence of the HSV-2 antibody among women in the United States is 26%, although genital herpes has been diagnosed in only a small proportion (10–25%) of individuals with HSV-2 antibodies. Herpes simplex virus type I is becoming a more frequent cause of genital herpes, especially among young women. Overall, HSV-I seroprevalence in the United States is estimated at 67%, although serologic data do not provide information about the site of infection. Recent advances in diagnostic methods and therapeutic options are likely to change the management of genital herpes.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing who priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^116i9M77]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

In 2001, in response to the substantial burden of HSV-2 and a growing body of evidence linking HSV-2 to HIV prevalence and incidence, the WHO hosted a 3-day workshop to set research priorities for HSV-2 in LMICs. Setting health research priorities is essential for optimized use of research resources, particularly in resource-poor countries. Priorities are best developed through the application of defined methodologies by multiple stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, healthcare providers, and service users.

The workshop brought together a broad range of regional and disciplinary expertise. Participants were from Europe (n = 18), Africa (n = 10), North America (n = 7), and Asia (n = 1) and had expertise in biochemistry, clinical medicine, program interventions, and mathematical disease modeling. Most participants represented well-established global health research organizations and educational institutions. Most organizations present originated from high-income countries (HIC), such as the United States (6 institutes) and the UK (14 organizations and educational institutions). Eight institutions were based in LMICs: Zimbabwe (n = 3), Uganda (n = 3), South Africa (n = 1), and India (n = 1) (further described in a companion paper).

The workshop included expert presentations, plenary dialogues, and breakout discussion groups. On the final day, a list of recommendations made during the discussions was examined and prioritized in five key areas: HSV-2 epidemiology, HSV-2 diagnostics, HSV-2/HIV interactions, HSV-2 control measures, and HSV-2 mathematical modeling.

### Recommendations for the selective use of herpes simplex virus type 2 serological tests [^11595pSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type-specific serological tests are now widely available, but indications for their use have not been well defined. The California Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Controllers Association convened a committee of clinicians and researchers to make recommendations for the use of type-specific HSV type 2 (HSV-2) serological tests.

- **Methods**: By means of a systematic review of the literature, evidence to support screening in selected high-risk groups was compiled. Screening recommendations were developed by applying standard screening criteria to each specific population.

- **Results**: The committee concluded that, in addition to serological testing for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms, screening of asymptomatic patients is likely to be beneficial among the following groups: those at high risk for STDs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are motivated to reduce their sexual risk behavior, HIV-infected patients, and patients with sex partners with genital herpes. In contrast, universal screening for HSV-2 infection in pregnant women is unlikely to be beneficial.

- **Conclusions**: The targeted use of HSV-2 serological tests for specific diagnostic situations and selected populations should benefit patients, providers, and the community. Until more data become available, these recommendations provide justification for selective diagnostic and screening uses of HSV-2 serological tests.

### Targeted prenatal herpes simplex virus testing: Can we identify women at risk of transmission to the neonate [^113CZo4N]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Potential strategies to prevent neonatal herpes include herpes simplex virus (HSV) serologic testing and counseling of pregnant women, and rapid HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of maternal genital secretions at delivery. The cost-effectiveness of these interventions would be improved if high-risk pregnancies could be easily identified for targeted testing.

- **Study design**: Washington State birth certificate data for all singleton live births from 1987 through 2002 were linked with infant death and hospital discharge data for birth and subsequent hospitalizations in a population-based case-control study of risk factors for neonatal herpes. A case was defined as an infant with a discharge diagnosis of HSV infection (International Classification of Diseases 9th edition [ICD-9] code 054.X) from birth admission or readmission within 30 days of life. Five controls per case were frequency matched to cases by year of birth.

- **Results**: Ninety-one neonatal HSV cases were identified (8.4/100,000 live births). Risk factors for infection included maternal age younger than 25 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.3) and paternal age younger than 20 years or unknown (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.7–3.7). Testing couples with either risk factor would require testing 36% of couples and could potentially prevent up to 60% of cases. Maternal history of genital herpes, fever during labor, and premature rupture of membranes were also associated with neonatal disease. Using all risk factors identifiable at delivery would require screening 60% of pregnancies and identify cases accordingly.

### Performance characteristics of highly automated HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgG testing [^112UiWKn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrates that currently available HSV serologic diagnostics have limitations precluding widespread use for HSV-1 and HSV-2 testing. Our data support the CDC's currently recommended two-tiered algorithm for confirming HSV serological diagnoses, especially for specimens first tested with the DiaSorin assays due to their lower specificities. In our hands, the Roche HSV-2 assay performed the best compared to the WB, and overall, the Roche HSV assays would minimize potential harm from false positives as neither assay had any false positives among individuals seronegative for both HSV subtypes by WB.

In addition, the Roche assay does not have equivocal results and performs well across the index value range, as opposed to the DiaSorin and Bio-Rad assays, which have lower specificity at low index values and for which additional testing is required to resolve equivocal results. Overall, further work is required to adjudicate type-specific accuracy and reduce cross-reactivity among automated assays. Given the role that adsorption plays in resolving indeterminate results on the WB, it is notable that no adsorption reagents are available for automated HSV serology assays. Future work should examine how adsorption reagents could similarly resolve low-positive index values on automated assays. Further improvements and investments in HSV serological diagnostics remain necessary to support both clinical care and potential future screening.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^115SCbDS]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2. It affects at least 500 million people worldwide and is a lifelong condition involving initial infection and periodic reactivation with variable viral shedding. There are no vaccinations for the prevention of HSV, and routine serologic screening is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals. Practices that prevent or reduce transmission include the use of suppressive antiviral therapy in serodiscordant partners, avoiding sexual contact during outbreaks, and the use of condoms. A clinically apparent herpes outbreak is characterized by painful vesicles on the genitals, rectum, or perineum and may be accompanied by a flu-like syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis uses type-specific polymerase chain reaction, viral culture of active lesions, or type-specific serologic testing. Nucleoside analogue medications reduce viral shedding and are used to treat active outbreaks and prevent recurrences. Complications of genital herpes include encephalitis, meningitis, and urinary retention. During pregnancy, antiviral suppression is recommended starting at 36 weeks of gestation in patients with a known history of genital herpes. Elective cesarean delivery should be offered to patients with active lesions to reduce neonatal exposure to HSV.

### Inaccuracy of certain commercial enzyme immunoassays in diagnosing genital infections with herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2 [^1121gRzg]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Type-specific serologic results may be inaccurate if not based on glycoprotein G (gG). Commercial tests based on crude antigen (Zeus Scientific, Raritan, NJ; Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, NJ; DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN) and one using gG-1 and gG-2 (Focus Technologies, Cypress, CA) were compared with Western blot on serum samples from patients with culture-documented first symptomatic episodes of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (n = 17) or HSV-2 (n = 49) infection or recurrent genital episodes (HSV-1, 30; HSV-2, 49).

Concordance with Western blot results was 56% for Zeus, 63% for Wampole, 52% to 54% for DiaSorin, and 83% for Focus. Sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for HSV-1 were 77% and 53% (Zeus), 91% and 35% (Wampole), 98% and 8% (DiaSorin), 94% and 70% (DiaSorin predominant antibody), and 83% and 90% (Focus); for HSV-2, they were 88% and 81% (Zeus), 92% and 83% (Wampole), 96% and 54% (DiaSorin), 38% and 98% (DiaSorin predominant antibody), and 98% and 96% (Focus). Type-specific serologic testing for HSV should be performed with gG-based tests for accurate diagnosis of symptomatic genital herpes.

### Laboratory diagnosis of neonatal herpes simplex virus infections [^114NbMdv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common and often benign infection in humans; although it less commonly affects newborns, infection in this age group can be devastating. Newborns often present with nonspecific clinical findings, making timely and accurate diagnosis of infection critical. A wide variety of tests are available for detecting herpes simplex virus infection, but only a subset are useful and validated in the newborn population. The review summarizes available diagnostic testing for neonatal disease, including discussing limitations, unmet needs, and emerging data on molecular testing methods.

### Rapid polymerase chain reaction assay to detect herpes simplex virus in the genital tract of women in labor [^1111TMiS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to develop a rapid quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the genital secretions of women that may be used in labor.

- **Methods**: Samples of genital secretions from women in labor, swabs of active genital lesions, and swabs of buffer solution were analyzed using a newly developed rapid HSV PCR assay to detect HSV glycoprotein B gene and quantitate virion copy number. A previously validated TaqMan PCR to detect the HSV glycoprotein B gene was performed as the comparator gold standard. Positivity determination that optimized sensitivity and specificity was determined with receiver operating characteristic curves.

- **Results**: The median time to result for rapid HSV PCR was 2 hours (range 1.5–3.5 hours). A positivity determination rule that required both wells of the rapid test to detect 150 copies or greater of HSV per milliliter maximized specificity (96.7%) without appreciable loss of sensitivity (99.6%). Among positive samples, the correlation between the rapid test and TaqMan for the quantity of HSV isolated was excellent (R = 0.96, p < 0.001). The rapid test had a positive predictive value of 96.7% and a negative predictive value of 99.6% in a population with HSV shedding prevalence of 10.8%, based on the prevalence of genital HSV previously found among HSV-2 seropositive women in labor.

- **Conclusion**: Rapid HSV PCR provides results with excellent sensitivity and specificity within a timeframe that could inform clinical decision making for identifying neonates at risk of neonatal HSV infection.

Level of evidence: II.

### Diagnosis and management of genital ulcers [^116krnmh]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus infection and syphilis are the most common causes of genital ulcers in the United States. Other infectious causes include chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), secondary bacterial infections, and fungi. Noninfectious etiologies, including sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions, can also lead to genital ulcers. Although initial treatment of genital ulcers is generally based on clinical presentation, the following tests should be considered in all patients: serologic tests for syphilis and darkfield microscopy or direct fluorescent antibody testing for Treponema pallidum, culture or polymerase chain reaction test for herpes simplex virus, and culture for Haemophilus ducreyi in settings with a high prevalence of chancroid. No pathogen is identified in up to 25 percent of patients with genital ulcers.

The first episode of herpes simplex virus infection is usually treated with seven to 10 days of oral acyclovir (five days for recurrent episodes). Famciclovir and valacyclovir are alternative therapies. One dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine is recommended to treat genital ulcers caused by primary syphilis. Treatment options for chancroid include a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone or oral azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin. Lymphogranuloma venereum and donovanosis are treated with 21 days of oral doxycycline. Treatment of noninfectious causes of genital ulcers varies by etiology and ranges from topical wound care for ulcers caused by sexual trauma to consideration of specific interventions based on the underlying cause.

### Light microscopy, culture, molecular, and serologic methods for detection of herpes simplex virus [^11569rZ7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) cause a variety of human diseases, ranging from acute to chronic and mild to severe. The absence of curative therapy results in lifelong carriage marked by recurrent outbreaks and allows transmission of the virus to uninfected individuals. Nonspecific lesions, variable presentation, and chronic carriage necessitate the use of different laboratory testing methods appropriate for each presentation.

A thorough understanding of the performance characteristics and limitations of available tests is critical for selection of the appropriate test and interpretation of results. Clinical sensitivity, specificity, and selection of the appropriate methodology are paramount to avoid misdiagnosis and guide therapy.

In this article, we review the different methods for detection and typing of HSV, including light microscopy, culture, serology, and nucleic acid-based tests. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each method for diagnosing HSV infection, cite performance characteristics, and review appropriate clinical uses.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^116KHvDv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

We studied an individual who acquired HSV-1 five years prior, and any viral adaptation to the genital niche or her immune response may have already occurred. Although it is plausible that daily swabbing of the genital mucosa could affect the observed genital shedding patterns, the participant's previous five years of repeated recurrences suggest otherwise. We also cannot rule out that the viral genomes and shedding patterns observed here could represent spatial cross-contamination rather than simultaneous reactivation of the virus from multiple ganglia. However, in previous work exploring anatomic shedding patterns of HSV-2, several controls were used to address this possibility, and it was concluded that simultaneous reactivation, rather than contamination, accounted for the observed HSV-2 shedding patterns. In this study, we found minor genetic variants between swab specimens collected on the same day at different genital sites, providing further support for simultaneous shedding rather than cross-contamination.

One of the strengths of this study was the implementation of an oligonucleotide enrichment strategy that enabled successful sequencing and assembly of the first uncultured genital HSV-1 genomes. We observed that the differences in HSV-1 genome copy number and the ratio of viral to host DNA impacted the overall yield and viral genome recovery of each library. The coverage of all v.29 genomes met or exceeded that of prior genomic studies of cultured HSV-1. However, the high G+C-content, repetitive elements, and potential recombination breakpoints in the large str.

### Evaluation of a new point-of-care serologic assay for herpes simplex virus type 2 infection [^112YWxre]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Herpes simplex virus type 2 infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Because presentation is often atypical or subclinical, serologic testing is necessary for diagnosis, treatment, and counseling. In an urban clinic specializing in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, a new point-of-care rapid serologic test was compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot for the detection of herpes simplex virus type 2. Using an ELISA index cutoff value of 1.1, the rapid test was found to have a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 98%, a positive predictive value of 92%, and a negative predictive value of 99%. Increasing the cutoff index value to 3.5 increased the test sensitivity to 100%.

### Twenty years of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) research in low-income and middle-income countries: Systematic evaluation of progress made in addressing who priorities for research in HSV-2 epidemiology and diagnostics [^117KWgu2]. BMJ Global Health (2024). Low credibility.

A total of 63 studies assessing HSV-2 diagnostics in LMICs between 2000 and 2020 were identified. The most frequently researched topic was serological diagnostic techniques with 33 (52.3%) studies. Other less frequently studied techniques included molecular biology/DNA detection methods, with 16 (25.3%) studies, syndromic diagnosis, with 12 (19.0%) studies, and diagnostic sampling techniques, with 6 (9.5%) studies. Thirty-six (57.1%) studies included both male and female participants, 16 (25.3%) included females only, and 5 (7.9%) included males only.

Geographically, the most studied areas were East Asia with 14 (22.2%) studies and East Africa with 12 (19.0%) studies. South Asia and Southern Africa had 11 (17.4%) and 8 (12.6%) studies, respectively, and both West Africa and South America had 7 (11.1%) studies each. Central Africa and Western Asia had five (7.9%) and three (4.7%) studies, respectively, and both Central America and North Africa had one (1.5%) study each.

Regarding the study population, most studies, 26 (41.2%), focused on clinic attendees and/or symptomatic people presumed to have genital ulcer disease (GUD). Other populations studied included the general population with 12 (19.0%) studies, commercial sex workers with 5 (7.9%) studies, men who have sex with men (MSM) with 5 (7.9%) studies, pregnant women and patients living with HIV, each with 4 (6.3%) studies, people with infertility with 3 (4.7%) studies, and adolescents, market vendors, and fishermen, each with 1 (1.5%) study.

### Herpes simplex virus shedding rate: Surrogate outcome for genital herpes recurrence frequency and lesion rates, and phase 2 clinical trials end point for evaluating efficacy of antivirals [^113sgWpF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

We tested whether genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding is an appropriate surrogate outcome for the clinical outcome of genital herpes lesions in studies of HSV-2 antiviral interventions.

- **Methods**: We analyzed prospective data from natural history studies and clinical trials of antiviral agents for HSV-2 in which HSV-2-seropositive participants provided self-collected anogenital swab specimens daily over ≥ 25 days for HSV DNA quantitation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genital recurrences were self-reported.

- **Results**: Among 674 participants, genital HSV shedding was detected on 17% of days, and genital lesions were reported on 10% of days. Within the same session, HSV shedding rates were strongly correlated with lesion rates (ρ = 0.61, P < .0001). The relative reduction in the recurrence rate was 72% (P = 0.041) for recipients of the antiviral agent pritelivir compared to recipients of placebo, but it decreased to 21% (P = 0.75) after adjustment for HSV shedding rate. When evaluating valacyclovir and acyclovir, adjustment for the HSV shedding rate also led to a reduced association of these antivirals with the recurrence rate. Overall, 40%-82% of the antiviral effect on recurrences was explained by its effect on HSV shedding.

- **Conclusion**: HSV genital shedding measured by PCR analysis in swab specimens self-collected daily is an appropriate surrogate outcome for genital herpes lesions because it is in the causal pathway to recurrences.

### Genital shedding of herpes simplex virus among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with HSV-2 infection [^113XbwAr]. JAMA (2011). High credibility.

Since herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antibody tests have become commercially available, an increasing number of people have learned that they have genital herpes through serologic testing. However, the natural history of HSV-2 in asymptomatic, seropositive individuals remains uncertain.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the virologic and clinical course of HSV genital shedding among individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic HSV-2 infection.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A cohort of 498 immunocompetent HSV-2-seropositive persons was enrolled in prospective studies of genital HSV shedding at the University of Washington Virology Research Clinic, Seattle, and Westover Heights Clinic, Portland, Oregon, between March 1992 and April 2008. Each participant obtained daily self-collected swabs of genital secretions for at least 30 days.

- **Main outcome measure**: The rate of viral shedding was measured by quantitative real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction for HSV DNA from genital swabs.

- **Results**: Herpes simplex virus type 2 was detected on 4753 of 23,683 days (20.1%; 95% confidence interval, 18.3%-22.0%) in 410 persons with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection compared to 519 of 5070 days (10.2%; 95% CI, 7.7%-13.6%) in 88 persons with asymptomatic infection (P < .001). Subclinical shedding rates were higher in persons with symptomatic infection compared to asymptomatic infection (2708 of 20,735 days [13.1%; 95% CI, 11.5%-14.6%] vs. 434 of 4929 days [8.8%; 95% CI, 6.3%-11.5%]) (P < .001). However, the amount of HSV detected during subclinical shedding episodes was similar.

### Genital herpes: Rapid evidence review [^1157fx7U]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for genital herpes, specifically in the context of laboratory testing, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2 in patients who have partners with genital herpes, are presenting for STI evaluation, or have had more than 10 lifetime sexual partners.
