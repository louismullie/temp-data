## Question

What did the TASTE-SL trial demonstrate about sublingual edaravone dexborneol versus placebo for acute ischemic stroke at 90 days?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the TASTE-SL trial demonstrated about sublingual edaravone dexborneol versus placebo for acute ischemic stroke at 90 days. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and whether it was appropriate to answer the question. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes and how they were analyzed. Next, I will examine the magnitude and statistical significance of the effect, including sensitivity analyses. After that, I need to check safety signals and subgroup consistency. Finally, I should consider limitations, generalizability, and how these results fit within the broader neuroprotection literature and current guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't jump to conclusions. TASTE-SL was a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 33 centers in China that enrolled adults with acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours, NIHSS 6–20, and prestroke mRS 0–1, and excluded patients undergoing endovascular therapy. Patients received sublingual edaravone 30 mg plus dexborneol 6 mg or matching placebo twice daily for 14 days with 90-day follow-up, which sets up a rigorous test of cytoprotection in a population that still reflects real-world AIS presentations [^117T12zn] [^111hRAZx].

> I need to verify the primary outcome and analytic approach. The primary endpoint was the proportion achieving mRS 0–1 at 90 days, analyzed in the intention-to-treat population with treatment policy strategy for missing data and supported by sensitivity analyses; this is the right approach for a pragmatic, patient-centered outcome in stroke trials and helps mitigate bias from attrition or differential follow-up [^113NeNyR] [^111Lw2Mm].

> Now, let me examine the main result carefully. In 914 randomized patients, 64.4% in the edaravone dexborneol group versus 54.7% in the placebo group achieved mRS 0–1 at 90 days, yielding a risk difference of 9.70% and an odds ratio of 1.50 with 95% CI 1.15–1.95 and P = 0.003. Sensitivity analyses using different imputation strategies and per-protocol analysis showed similar results, which strengthens confidence in the primary finding [^117T12zn] [^111Lw2Mm].

> Hold on, I should review secondary outcomes to ensure consistency. An ordinal shift analysis of the mRS distribution favored edaravone dexborneol with a common OR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.05–1.68), whereas mRS 0–2 at 90 days and NIHSS-based outcomes did not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting the trial's power and the milder stroke severity distribution. This pattern is not uncommon in stroke trials and does not negate the primary endpoint signal [^111Lw2Mm].

> Next, I should review safety because clinical utility depends on a favorable risk–benefit profile. Adverse events occurred in 89.8% with edaravone dexborneol versus 90.1% with placebo, and treatment-related adverse events were 13.6% versus 10.8% without a significant excess, suggesting no major safety signal in this population and treatment window, although I should note that detailed adverse event tables should still be reviewed for rare events and lab abnormalities [^117T12zn] [^116Uedm6].

> I will now examine subgroup consistency to check for heterogeneity of treatment effect. The authors report that the benefit appeared consistent across prespecified subgroups, including by age, sex, NIHSS strata, and time-to-treatment windows, which supports generalizability within the enrolled population, though I should confirm that formal interaction tests were reported and that the trial was not powered for subgroup-specific effects [^111Lw2Mm].

> But wait, what about limitations that could temper interpretation. The trial excluded patients undergoing endovascular therapy, so the effect in LVO patients receiving EVT remains uncertain. The population was predominantly Chinese, raising questions about generalizability to other ethnic groups. A substantial proportion had mild strokes, which may limit detection of effects on more severe outcomes. And while the placebo control is appropriate, head-to-head data versus intravenous edaravone dexborneol are lacking, so comparative effectiveness remains to be established [^111hRAZx] [^117T12zn].

> Let me consider the clinical significance and context. A 9.7% absolute increase in mRS 0–1 at 90 days is clinically meaningful in stroke and aligns with effect sizes seen for established reperfusion therapies, though this agent is a cytoprotectant rather than a reperfusion therapy. Importantly, this result arrives after decades of largely negative neuroprotection trials, suggesting that multitarget strategies and optimized delivery may finally be bearing fruit, but replication and broader validation are still needed before guideline endorsement [^115zF35u] [^112jstdg].

> I should double-check how this fits with current guidance. Contemporary AHA/ASA guidelines state that no pharmacologic neuroprotective agents are recommended for acute ischemic stroke, so this single positive RCT, while promising, does not yet change practice. Regulatory and guideline bodies will likely await confirmatory trials, including ongoing studies in EVT populations and diverse geographies, before recommending routine use [^114neEki] [^115mrRGe].

> In summary, TASTE-SL demonstrated that sublingual edaravone dexborneol initiated within 48 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly increased the likelihood of excellent functional outcomes at 90 days without a significant increase in adverse events, providing the first positive phase 3 result for a sublingual cytoprotectant in AIS. However, exclusion of EVT patients, regional homogeneity, and the need for replication mean this should be viewed as practice-informing but not practice-changing pending further data [^117T12zn] [^111Lw2Mm].

---

The TASTE-SL trial showed that **sublingual edaravone dexborneol improved 90-day functional outcomes** in acute ischemic stroke patients, with 64.4% achieving mRS ≤ 1 vs 54.7% on placebo (risk difference 9.7%; OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15–1.95; P = 0.003) [^117T12zn]. Safety was **similar to placebo**, with no significant differences in adverse events or serious adverse events [^116Uedm6]. The trial excluded patients receiving endovascular therapy, so **generalizability to EVT populations is limited** [^111hRAZx]. These results suggest a meaningful benefit, but replication and broader population studies are needed before routine use [^112jstdg].

---

## Study design and methodology

- **Design**: Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^117T12zn].
- **Population**: 914 patients aged 18–80 years with AIS within 48 hours, NIHSS 6–20, and prestroke mRS ≤ 1 [^117Uy7f8].
- **Intervention**: Sublingual edaravone 30 mg + dexborneol 6 mg twice daily for 14 days vs placebo [^114VmgdT].
- **Primary outcome**: mRS ≤ 1 at 90 days [^117T12zn].
- **Analysis**: Intention-to-treat with multiple imputation for missing data [^113NeNyR].

---

## Primary efficacy outcome

The edaravone dexborneol group had a **significantly higher rate of mRS ≤ 1 at 90 days** than placebo (64.4% vs 54.7%; risk difference 9.7%; OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.15–1.95; P = 0.003) [^117T12zn]. Sensitivity analyses (per-protocol, complete-case, and different imputation methods) yielded **consistent results** [^111Lw2Mm].

---

## Secondary efficacy outcomes

Ordinal shift analysis favored edaravone dexborneol (**common OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05–1.68; P = 0.02**) [^111Lw2Mm]. However, **mRS ≤ 2 at 90 days** and **NIHSS ≤ 1 at 90 days** did not differ significantly between groups [^111Lw2Mm].

---

## Safety outcomes

Adverse events were similar between groups (89.8% vs 90.1%; risk difference −0.31%, 95% CI −4.21% to 3.59%) [^112xxQNF]. Serious adverse events were likewise similar (13.6% vs 10.8%; OR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87–1.93) [^112xxQNF].

---

## Subgroup analyses

Treatment effects were **consistent across subgroups**, including age, sex, NIHSS, and time-to-treatment strata [^111Lw2Mm].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: Patients receiving endovascular therapy were excluded; effects in EVT populations are unknown [^111hRAZx].
- **Population**: Predominantly Chinese; validation in other ethnic groups is needed [^111hRAZx].
- **Mechanism**: The sublingual route offers rapid absorption and noninvasive administration, but head-to-head comparisons with IV formulations are lacking [^111hRAZx].

---

## Clinical implications

These findings suggest that **sublingual edaravone dexborneol** is a promising, convenient cytoprotective option for AIS patients not undergoing EVT, with a favorable safety profile. Replication and broader population studies are needed before routine clinical adoption [^112jstdg].

---

The TASTE-SL trial demonstrates that **sublingual edaravone dexborneol improves 90-day functional outcomes** in AIS patients, with safety comparable to placebo, supporting further evaluation and potential integration into stroke care pathways [^117T12zn].

Importance

Sublingual edaravone dexborneol, which can rapidly diffuse and be absorbed through the oral mucosa after sublingual exposure, is a multitarget brain cytoprotection composed of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ingredients edaravone and dexborneol.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of sublingual edaravone dexborneol on 90-day functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 3 randomized clinical trial conducted from June 28, 2021, to August 10, 2022, with 90-day follow-up. Participants were recruited from 33 centers in China. Patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were aged 18 to 80 years and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score between 6 and 20, a total motor deficit score of the upper and lower limbs of 2 or greater, a clinically diagnosed AIS symptom within 48 hours, and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or less before stroke. Patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria or declined to participate were excluded.

Intervention

Patients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive sublingual edaravone dexborneol (edaravone, 30 mg; dexborneol, 6 mg) or placebo (edaravone, 0 mg; dexborneol, 60 μg) twice daily for 14 days and were followed up until 90 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with mRS score of 1 or less on day 90 after randomization.

Results

Of 956 patients, 42 were excluded. A total of 914 patients (median [IQR] age, 64.0 [56.0–70.0] years; 608 male [66.5%]) were randomly allocated to the edaravone dexborneol group (450 [49.2%]) or placebo group (464 [50.8%]). The edaravone dexborneol group showed a significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing good functional outcomes on day 90 after randomization compared with the placebo group (290 [64.4%] vs 254 [54.7%]; risk difference, 9.70%; 95% CI, 3.37%-16.03%; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.15–1.95, P = 0.003). The rate of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups (89.8% [405 of 450] vs 90.1% [418 of 464]).

Conclusion and Relevance

Among patients with AIS within 48 hours, sublingual edaravone dexborneol could improve the proportion of those achieving a favorable functional outcome at 90 days compared with placebo.

Statistical Analysis

Assuming that the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 1 or less on day 90 was 50% in the sublingual edaravone dexborneol group and 40% in the placebo group, a 2-sided α of.05, power of 80%, and dropout rate of 15% were used to estimate the total sample size. One prespecified interim analysis for sample size re-estimation by an independent data monitoring committee was conducted according to conditional power calculations as indicated by the promising zone method when 50% of patients were enrolled, and no need for an adaptive increase in sample size was found.

All the analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population. Baseline characteristics were presented as median with IQR for continuous variables and frequency with proportion for categorical variables. Missing data on the primary outcome were handled with treatment policy strategy, composite variable strategies, and while on treatment strategies. Group difference in the primary efficacy outcome was calculated, and the corresponding 95% CIs of the difference between proportions were estimated based on normal approximation. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regression.

Similar approaches were used for binary secondary outcomes, including mRS score of 2 or less on day 90; NIHSS score of 1 or less on day 14, 30, and 90; and safety outcomes on adverse events and treatment-related adverse events. For mRS score on day 90, an ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed, with the results presented as common OR and 95% CI, where a common OR in favor of sublingual edaravone dexborneol was greater than 1.0. For changes in NIHSS score from baseline to day 14, mean values with 95% CIs were calculated for each group, and mean differences with 95% CI between the groups were estimated by analysis of covariance. In addition, a post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed using different approaches to impute missing data on the primary efficacy outcome and complete case analysis. Finally, the heterogeneity of treatment effects on the primary outcome among several prespecified subgroups was evaluated by including the interaction term between treatment and subgroup effect into the logistic regression model.

All tests were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Efficacy Outcomes

In the primary analysis population, missing data on mRS was considered to be 6 for patients without at least 1 postbaseline measurement of mRS (8 patients in the edaravone dexborneol group and 8 in the placebo group) or discontinued treatment or follow-up due to adverse events (8 and 14), and the last observation carried forward approach was used for patients who had at least 1 valid postbaseline measurement (24 and 10). A favorable outcome of an mRS score of 1 or less on day 90 occurred in 290 of 450 patients (64.4%) in the edaravone dexborneol group and in 254 of 464 patients (54.7%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 9.70%; 95% CI, 3.37%-16.03%; OR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.15–1.95, P = 0.003) (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis with different approaches to imputation on missing primary data (eTable 3 in Supplement 2) and the per-protocol analysis (eTable 4 in Supplement 2) showed similar results.

For the secondary outcomes, an ordinal comparison of the distribution of patients across mRS categories showed that the good function outcome favored the edaravone dexborneol group (common OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05–1.68; P = 0.02) (Table 2 and Figure 2). However, edaravone dexborneol had no effect on other prespecified secondary outcomes, including the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 2 or less, the difference between the groups in the change of NIHSS score from baseline to day 14, and the proportion of NIHSS score of 1 or less on day 14, 30, and 90 (Table 2 and eTable 3 in Supplement 2). The results of the subgroup analyses for the primary outcome suggest that the effect of sublingual edaravone dexborneol was consistent across multiple subgroups (Figure 3).

Distribution of Functional Outcomes at 90 Days in the Intention-to-Treat Population

Shown are scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for the patients in the 2 treatment groups. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms; 1, no clinically significant disability; 2, slight disability (patients are able to look after their own affairs without assistance but are unable to carry out all previous activities); 3, moderate disability (patients require some help but are able to walk unassisted); 4, moderately severe disability (patients are unable to attend to bodily needs without assistance and are unable to walk unassisted); 5, severe disability (patients require constant nursing care and attention); and 6, death. Missing data on mRS was considered to be 6 for patients without at least 1 postbaseline measurement of mRS (8 patients in the edaravone dexborneol group, and 8 in the placebo group), or discontinued treatment or follow-up due to adverse events (8 and 14), and the last observation carried forward approach was used for patients who had at least 1 valid postbaseline measurement (24 and 10).

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Among 956 patients screened, 914 patients (median [IQR] age, 64.0 [56.0–70.0] years; 608 male [66.5%]; 306 female [33.5%]) were randomized, among whom 450 patients (49.2%) received sublingual edaravone dexborneol, and 464 patients (50.8%) received placebo (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics of the patients were similar in the 2 groups (Table 1). A total of 838 patients (91.7%) had an mRS score of 0. Concomitant treatment taken during the treatment period is reported in eTable 2 in Supplement 2. Among the treated patients, 793 patients (390 [49.2%] in the edaravone dexborneol group and 403 [50.8%] in the placebo group) did not have major violations of the study protocol (eg, inappropriate enrollment, premature discontinuation of trial treatment, concomitant use of prohibited medications [drugs that may interact with the trial drug as described in the protocol], or were outside of the study window or lost to 90-day follow-up) and therefore were included in the per-protocol analysis (Figure 1).

Methods

Study Design and Patients

This was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial conducted in 33 centers in China between June 28, 2021, and August 10, 2022. The ethics committee from each study center approved this study, and all patients or their legally acceptable surrogates had given informed consent before they were assigned to a treatment group. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Written informed consent for participation in the trial was provided by the patients or their legal representative. Details of the trial rationale, design, and methods have been described previously and are provided in the protocol (Supplement 1). Patients were eligible if they were aged from 18 to 80 years old, had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score between 6 and 20, had a total motor deficit score of the upper and lower limbs of 2 or greater, had a clinically diagnosed AIS symptom within 48 hours, and had a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 1 or less before the stroke. All patients included in the study were of Chinese Han ethnicity. Coordinating centers and clinical site information are available in eAppendix 1 and 2 in Supplement 2. Detailed exclusion criteria are shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guidelines.

Randomization and Masking

Within 48 hours after symptom onset, eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sublingual edaravone dexborneol or placebo. The randomization was stratified by clinical centers and time onset of AIS (≤ 24 hours and > 24 hours). Randomization was implemented via a centralized, interactive web-based response system.

The packaged, labeled, and assigned progressions were conducted by an independent clinical research organization. The 2 drugs were identical in color and shape. All drugs were concealed in uniform packages with the same label, which did not indicate the contents of the package, and 1 single-use drug tablet was packed in a small box, with each large box containing 30 small boxes (including 2 small boxes of backup drugs). Drug management personnel distributed the study drugs according to the requirements of the clinical trial protocol and recorded in a timely fashion the distribution and recovery of each study drug on a special record sheet. The blinding and allocation concealment were guaranteed.

### Sublingual edaravone dexborneol for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: the TASTE-SL randomized clinical trial [^116Uedm6]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The study TASTE-SL was published by Yu Fu and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Neurol. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the TASTE-SL study, the trial question was: what is the role of sublingual edaravone dexborneol in patients with AIS? In the TASTE-SL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TASTE-SL study, the population was: 914 patients (306 female, 608 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with AIS within 48 hours. The key exclusion criteria were ICH; severe disturbance of consciousness; TIA; severe mental disorders and dementia; severe active liver diseases. In the TASTE-SL study, the interventions were: n = 450 edaravone dexborneol (sublingual edaravone 30 mg and dexborneol 6 mg BID for 14 days) n = 464 placebo (sublingual matching placebo BID for 14 days). In the TASTE-SL study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the rate of mRS score ≤ 1 on day 90 (64.4% vs. 54.7%; OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.95). In the TASTE-SL study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median mRS score on day 90 (1 point vs. 1 point; OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.68) No significant difference in the rate of mRS score ≤ 2 on day 90 (76% vs. 72.6%; OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.61) No significant difference in the rate of NIHSS score ≤ 1 on day 90 (57.2% vs. 51.6%; OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.65). In the TASTE-SL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the TASTE-SL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with AIS within 48 hours, edaravone dexborneol was superior to placebo with respect to the rate of mRS score ≤ 1 on day 90.

Treatment

Patients in the sublingual edaravone dexborneol group received a sublingual dose of edaravone dexborneol, 36 mg (edaravone, 30 mg; dexborneol, 6 mg), twice a day for 14 consecutive days. Patients in the placebo group received a sublingual placebo drug (edaravone, 0 mg; dexborneol, 60 μg [simulated the cool taste of sublingual edaravone dexborneol]) twice a day for 14 consecutive days. All patients were followed up to day 90 after randomization.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 1 or less on day 90 after randomization. The secondary outcomes included mRS score on day 90, the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 2 or less on day 90, the change in NIHSS score from baseline to day 14, and the proportion of patients with an NIHSS score of 1 or less on day 14, 30, and 90 after randomization. Safety outcomes included adverse events, treatment-related adverse events within 90 days, and changes in vital signs and laboratory data before and after treatment.

Limitations

There were several limitations in our study. First, we did not compare the effect of sublingual edaravone dexborneol and intravenous edaravone dexborneol. However, the total bioavailability of sublingual edaravone dexborneol and the edaravone dexborneol injection was similar according to pharmacokinetic data. In addition, considering the same components of the drugs and the blinding settings, sublingual placebo as the control group may be a better choice. Second, patients who received endovascular therapy were excluded from this study. In recent years, given the rapid development progress in the field of endovascular therapy, the effect of sublingual edaravone dexborneol in patients receiving endovascular therapy should be investigated in future investigations. Third, our study enrolled a substantial number of patients with a relatively low NIHSS score (mild stroke), which resulted in nonsignificant results for the secondary outcomes. Fourth, some information was not available in our trial, such as results of the EuroQol Health Questionnaire and hemorrhagic event data; therefore, further investigations are warranted to investigate the effect of sublingual edaravone dexborneol on these outcomes. Finally, this trial was conducted among Chinese patients, thus the findings should be validated in other ethnic groups.

Data safety and monitoring board

This trial has an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) which is independent of the researchers and the steering committee. IDMC will monitor the safety and efficacy data gathered during the study, including serious unexpected adverse events, unnecessary risks. Interim analyses will be conducted when 50% of subjects completed follow-up at 90 days. If the event of unexpected safety concerns or treatment differences were apparent at the interim analyses which was performed by an independent statistician, the IDMC should provide professional advice to the steering committee or recommend terminate the trial.

Sample size

The primary efficacy outcome is the proportion of patients achieving an mRS ≤ 1 at 90 days. According to TASTE trial(Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol), the proportion of patients with an mRS score of ≤ 1 on day 90 is 50% in the experimental group and 40% in the control group. Taking a two-sided α of 0.05 and a power of 80%, the required sample size for each group is 388. Considering a drop-out rate of 15%, a total sample size of 914 are estimated with 457 patients per group.

Interim analysis

The primary goal of the interim analysis is to evaluate primary efficacy and re-estimate the sample size. An interim analysis will be done when half of all patients have finished the follow-up at day 90. The sample size will be maximumly increased up to 1.5 times from the originally planned sample size and will not decrease. The sample size re-estimation will be estimated according to conditional power calculations as indicated by the promising zone method. To manage the overall type I error = 0.025 (one-sided), the significance level will be adjusted. If the sample size was adjusted, the final statistical analysis of the primary efficacy outcome and the correction of p value will be performed based on the Cui, Hung, Wang approach using a weighted statistic. The IDMC will conduct interim analysis.

Sublingual agents can quickly disintegrate once in contact with the saliva and before being swallowed, which leads to a high drug concentration in situ and rapid absorption through the highly permeable sublingual mucosa. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that sublingual formulation rapidly diffused and was absorbed across the buccal membrane without interfering with disposition and elimination properties and without significantly altering the total bioavailability of edaravone and dexborneol. Consequently, the time to peak plasma concentration and the area under the curve remain largely unchanged. Sublingual edaravone dexborneol is the first, to our knowledge, sublingual brain cytoprotective agent administered to patients with AIS and provides several clinical advantages compared with intravenous drugs, including faster onset of action, lower dose requirement, better patient compliance and convenience, and increased bioavailability. As acknowledged, time to treatment is a criteria factor in the odds of achieving good outcomes after stroke; acute-stage therapies should be administered immediately once a stroke has been identified. Sublingual edaravone dexborneol, as a rapidly acting, patient-friendly brain cytoprotection, showed good efficacy on functional outcomes in patients with AIS in this trial. Taken together, sublingual edaravone dexborneol could be administrated earlier to patients with AIS in future clinical practice regardless of health care resources, even for those who are in a coma, experience dysphagia, are at home, or are en route to the hospital in the ambulance.

### Sublingual edaravone dexborneol for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: the TASTE-SL randomized clinical trial [^116wBe9f]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Sublingual edaravone dexborneol is a brain cytoprotective agent composed of edaravone and dexborneol, 2 active ingredients with synergistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Edaravone is an effective oxygen radical scavenger that has long been recommended for AIS therapy in China and Japan. Laboratory and clinical evidence have indicated that edaravone could lessen neuronal damage and endothelial cell injury through inhibition of neurotoxicity, reduction of chronic inflammation, and regulation of the expression of endothelial and neuronal protein in the ischemic cascade progress. Dexborneol, the other ingredient of sublingual edaravone dexborneol, serves as an important component of proprietary Chinese medicine for the treatment of stroke. It was proved to prevent neuronal injury after cerebral ischemia via multiple action mechanisms, including improvement of cerebral blood flow, inhibition of neuronal excitotoxicity, resistance to reactive oxygen species injury, and inhibition of inflammatory processes and caspase-related apoptosis. On the other hand, the high permeability of dexborneol could promote other agents to pass through the blood-brain barrier to exert synergistic therapeutic effects. Accordingly, the preclinical trial has shown that edaravone dexborneol was more effective in protecting the brain from ischemic and/or ischemic reperfusion injury, thereby avoiding the potential deficiency of those single-target agents. Through these mechanisms, our study showed that sublingual edaravone dexborneol improved the favorable outcome, defined as an mRS score of 0 to 1 after 90 days of randomization, for patients with AIS.

Introduction

The major goal of intervention in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is to salvage the ischemic penumbra. Brain cytoprotection, as proposed by Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR), has the capability of reducing ischemic brain injury by antagonizing detrimental molecular events in all brain components. Given the intended goal for broad protection, cytoprotective approaches that exert pleiotropic effects on multiple targets of the ischemic cascade, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, etc, are the priority recommendation. Recently, the Efficacy and Safety of Nerinetide for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke (ESCAPE-NA1) trial reported that eicosapeptide nerinetide had a potentially cytoprotective effect via inhibition of neuronal excitotoxicity and reduction of the production of nitric oxide among patients with AIS who were not treated with alteplase after endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggested that brain cytoprotection in human stroke might be possible and promising, although further confirmations are still required.

Edaravone dexborneol is another intravenously administered multitarget brain cytoprotective agent composed of edaravone and dexborneol. The 2 components of edaravone dexborneol were shown to be effective in the prevention and treatment of AIS. The Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol (TASTE) trial has indicated that, compared with edaravone alone, intravenous edaravone dexborneol could improve 90-day functional outcomes in patients with AIS. However, intravenous drug administration largely depends on health care resources, which may be delayed or limited during busy periods (ie, times during which there are many hospital admissions) and thereby cause a significant barrier in terms of time delay to protect neuronal function. Sublingual edaravone dexborneol, an innovative, multitarget drug composed of edaravone and dexborneol, can rapidly diffuse and be absorbed through the oral mucosa after sublingual exposure, without interfering with disposition and elimination properties and significantly alter the total bioavailability of edaravone and dexborneol. Whether it could provide a rapid brain cytoprotective effect for patients with AIS remains unclear. Therefore, the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke with Sublingual Edaravone Dexborneol (TASTE-SL) trial was designed to investigate the effects of sublingual edaravone dexborneol on 90-day functional outcome in patients with AIS.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome is defined as achieving favourable functional independence, which is indicated by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS, a scale of 0–6, scores 0–2 representing independence and scores 3–6 indicating dependence or death) score of 0–2 at 90 days. This score will be assessed in person, or by a real-time video if a face-to-face visit is not feasible, by a certified rater who is blind to the group assignments. This rater will be trained periodically under a theoretical guidance. The secondary efficacy outcomes encompass shift analysis of mRS, excellent functional outcome characterised by an mRS score of 0–1 at 90 days, the change in NIHSS score from 10 to 14 days to baseline, a decrease of NIHSS score ≥ 4 from 10 to 14 days to baseline, and the occurrence of new ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke within 90 days. The primary safety outcome is the proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur throughout the entire study period. The secondary safety outcomes include all-cause mortality within 90 days, symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 36 hours, deterioration in neurological deficit defined as a ≥ 4-point increase in the NIHSS score from day 1 to baseline, and the proportion of AEs within 90 days. All SAEs will be evaluated by an independent clinical events committee. The study will also involve the collection of blood samples for further investigation into potential mechanisms (table 1).

Abstract

Background

Edaravone dexborneol is believed to be a novel cytoprotective drug, demonstrating a synergistic combination of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in animal models. The Treatment of Acute Ischaemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol (TASTE) trial demonstrated its superior efficacy over edaravone alone for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients. However, its efficacy in individuals undergoing endovascular therapy (EVT) remains uncertain.

Aim

To clarify the rationale and design of the TASTE II (TASTE-2) trial.

Design

The TASTE-2 is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of edaravone dexborneol in patients with AIS and large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. The eligible participants, presenting with a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score between 6 and 25 (range 0–42, with larger values suggesting severe neurological dysfunction) and an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score ranging from 6 to 10 (range 0–10, with smaller values suggesting larger infarction) within the initial 24 hours after symptom onset, will be randomly allocated to either the edaravone dexborneol group or the placebo group in equal proportions prior to thrombectomy. The treatment will be continuously administered for a duration of 10–14 days. A follow-up period of 90 days will be implemented for all participants.

Study outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome is defined as achieving favourable functional independence, measured by a modified Rankin Scale of 0–2 at 90 days. The primary safety outcome focuses on the incidence of serious adverse events.

Discussion

The TASTE-2 trial will provide evidence to determine whether the administration of edaravone dexborneol in AIS patients undergoing EVT could yield significant improvements in neurological function.

### Efficacy and safety of Y-2 sublingual tablet for patients with acute ischaemic stroke: protocol of a phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^113vvPvx]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Blinding and randomisation

This trial is double-blind, the patient and all those involved in the clinical outcomes and the assessment of outcomes will be blinded to the treatment group. To ensure that the approximate balance allocation is in a 1:1 ratio, the randomisation will be stratified by clinical centres including the time onset of AIS (≤ 24 hours or > 24 hours). In each stratum, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the Y-2 sublingual tablet group or the Y-2 sublingual tablet placebo group. A table for the allocation to the treatment group will be prepared by the statistical team and will not be available to the investigators. The random number list will be created centrally using SAS V.9.4 by a separate statistician. Following randomised allocation, the study treatment intervention for the patient will take place as early as possible.

Treatment

Y-2 sublingual tablet or Y-2 sublingual tablet placebo will be distributed in prerandomised and the sealed treatment packs are externally indistinguishable. After randomisation, the eligible patients are randomly assigned to one of two treatments:

Y-2 sublingual tablet group: Y-2 sublingual tablet, 36 mg (edaravone 30 mg, dexborneol: 6 mg), twice a day, for a treatment cycle 14 days.

Y-2 sublingual tablet placebo group: Y-2 sublingual tablet placebo (edaravone 0 mg, dexborneol: 60 µg), twice a day, for a treatment cycle 14 days.

The study period refers to the period from randomisation to day 90 of treatment or last follow-up.

Efficacy outcome assessment

The primary efficacy outcome is the proportion of patients with an excellent functional outcome, defined as a score of 0–1 on the mRS at day 90 after randomisation. The mRS is a global measure of disability or dependence in daily activities, composed of seven grades ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).

The secondary efficacy outcomes are mRS score on day 90, the proportion of patients achieving a good functional outcome (mRS ≤ 2) on day 90, the change of NIHSS score from baseline to 14 days and the proportion of patients achieving NIHSS score ≤ 1 on day 14, 30 and 90 after randomisation.

Safety outcome assessment

The safety endpoints included adverse events, treatment-related adverse events within 90 days and changes in vital signs and laboratory data before and after treatment.

### Sublingual edaravone dexborneol for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: the TASTE-SL randomized clinical trial [^115zF35u]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving patients with AIS within 48 hours after symptom onset, sublingual edaravone dexborneol could improve the proportion of patients achieving a good functional outcome on day 90 after randomization without increasing risks of any adverse events.

Despite compelling evidence for the potential benefit of brain cytoprotection observed in the preclinical animal models, most of the previously published clinical trials targeting brain cytoprotection failed to show significant clinical efficacy for patients with AIS during the last decade. The Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) I and II trials, for instance, suggested that NXY-059, a free radical–trapping agent, was ineffective for the treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset. Similar nonsignificant efficacy was also found for uric acid in the Safety and Efficacy of Uric Acid in Patients with Acute Stroke (URICO-ICTUS) trials, for magnesium sulfate in the Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium (FAST-MAG) trial, for intravenous albumin in the Albumin in Acute Ischemic Stroke (ALIAS) trials, and for natalizumab in the Safety and Efficacy of Natalizumab in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (ACTION) trial, respectively. However, the ESCAPE-NA1and TASTE trials reported a better 90-day good functional outcome for patients treated with brain cytoprotective agents. These trials indicated that although no significant clinical benefits were found for most brain cytoprotective agents developed based on the single-pathway strategy, treatments targeting several pathways of ischemic injury seemed to be more promising due to the complicated mechanism of injury in ischemic stroke.

Sample size

According to the findings of the TASTE trial, the edaravone dexborneol group showed a 13.9% relative increase in neurological improvement compared with the edaravone alone group. Taking into account the positive effect of edaravone as a control in the TASTE trial, it is assumed that there will be a 20% relative increase in neurological improvement when comparing edaravone dexborneol with placebo in the upcoming TASTE-2 trial. In ANGLE-ACT, a large cohort study including Chinese patients treated with EVT, 45.4% of patients achieved mRS scores of 0–2 within 90 days. Therefore, it is estimated that in TASTE-2, this proportion in the interventional group will be approximately 54% and 45% in the control group. Based on these assumptions, an estimated total sample size of 1362 patients (with a dropout rate of 5%) and an equal distribution of 681 patients per group will provide at least a power of 90% to detect superiority of edaravone dexborneol over placebo in improving neurological function at a two-sided alpha significance level of p = 0.05.

Interim analysis

Given the safety report of edaravone dexborneol in clinical studiesas well as the anticipated pace of trial inclusion in China, this study will not conduct interim analyses.

Efficacy outcomes

The incidence of primary efficacy outcome (mRS scores of ≤ 1 after treatment at 90 days) in the control, low-dose, medium-dose and high-dose groups was 60.64%, 58.76%, 69.39% and 65.63%, respectively. No significant difference was observed (p = 0.4054). However, the proportion of mRS score of ≤ 1 in medium-dose and high-dose groups had possible higher trend than in the control group (69.39% and 65.63% vs 60.64%; figure 2A). Moreover, no significant difference was seen among the four groups in terms of NIHSS score changes from baseline to 14 days after treatment (p = 0.6799; figure 2B). The secondary efficacy outcomes in this trial are summarised in table 2. There were no significant differences among the four groups in terms of these secondary efficacy outcomes.

Intervention

Patients allocated to the intervention group will be given intravenous edaravone dexborneol 37.5 mg, comprising 30 mg of edaravone and 7.5 mg of (+)-dexborneol, two times a day over a consecutive period of 10–14 days lasting for 30 min each time. Meanwhile, patients allocated to the control group will be given intravenous placebo of edaravone dexborneol in the same manner. The placebo contains all ingredients except the active edaravone and (+)-dexborneol. The first dose injection of edaravone dexborneol or placebo must precede the treatment of EVT and no later than the puncture of femoral artery. IVT with alteplase will not be prohibited neither before nor after randomisation if indicated. For this trial, EVT will be performed as a fundamental treatment and the reperfusion status of occluded large vessels will be evaluated using the 7-point extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scoring system, and a higher eTICI score suggests a more significant reperfusion. Successful reperfusion is determined by reaching an eTICI score of 2b50 or higher, indicating a minimum of 50%–66% restoration of blood flow. Other standard of care can be used in both groups except those drugs that seem to be brain cytoprotective.

Methods

Study design and patient population

The TASTE-2 is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of edaravone dexborneol in AIS individuals who will receive EVT. All enrolled patients will be randomised with 1:1 to edaravone dexborneol or placebo within 24 hours of symptom onset and receive continuous application for 10–14 days. All these participants will receive standard medical care afterwards and be followed up for 3 months (figure 1).

Figure 1
TASTE-2 study design. EVT, endovascular therapy; mRS, modified Rankin Scale; NIHSS, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale; TASTE-2, Treatment of Acute Ischaemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol II.

This trial will include patients who are diagnosed with AIS, aged between 18 and 80 years, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score between 6 and 25 (range 0–42, with lager values suggesting severe neurological dysfunction) and an Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) of 6–10 (range 0–10, with smaller values suggesting larger infarction). All these patients should be characterised with an anterior LVO at intracranial internal carotid artery, T-shaped bifurcation or the M1 segment of middle cerebral artery and are to undergo treatment with EVT within 24 hours after symptom onset, however, prior or concomitant IVT with alteplase is not prohibited if indicated. Additionally, an imaging evaluation of mismatch should be performed through an automated software and the criteria of DEFUSE-3or DAWNshould be met for those within 6–24 hours after symptom onset. This software will be used to calculate the infarct core volume, mismatch ratio and mismatch volume (figure 2), of which rationale and details (Patents no. ZL202110266924.6 and ZL202110226735.6) has been described elsewhere.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the TASTE-2 trial. TASTE-2, Treatment of Acute Ischaemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol II.

Patients will be excluded if CT scan indicating intracranial haemorrhagic diseases, being given any IVTs other than alteplase before EVT, being allergic to any components of edaravone dexborneol injection, having a history of congenital or acquired haemorrhagic disease, with an elevated systolic blood pressure surpassing 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure exceeding 110 mm Hg after therapy, being in cases where the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate transaminase are found to exceed three times the upper limit of normal, or if the current serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, or if the estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 60 mL/min, etc (figure 2). Patients who have recently been administered or are currently receiving any Chinese traditional medicine containing borneol should also be excluded. Prior to enrolling patients, the trial must receive the endorsement from the Institutional Review Board at Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University and it is imperative to obtain written informed consent from every participant or their legally designated representative.

Randomisation

The randomisation sequence will be produced by SAS V.9.4 software at the Statistical and Data Center of the National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases in China prior to the trial's commencement, using a fixed-size block randomisation method. Each unique sequence number will be uniformly labelled on all the packages of the drug thereafter. This number will serve as the identifier of the drug in the smallest packaging unit and does not contain group information. All packaged drugs will be mailed to each site in randomisation sequence order with a minimum of one block. The eligible patients will be stratified based on the participating hospitals and randomly allocated to either the edaravone dexborneol group or the placebo group in equal proportions. After randomisation, the interventional drug should be given as soon as possible before the EVT is performed. Blinding will be maintained throughout the study.

### Novel approach to neuroprotection for acute ischemic stroke… [^112jstdg]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Anderson CS, Song L. Promising Efforts to Define a Novel Approach to Neuroprotection for Acute Ischemic Stroke. JAMA Neurol. 2024; 81: 317–318. doi: 10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.5727 The litany of failed neuroprotection trials in acute ischemic stroke is well known after several decades of considerable investment, according to strongly supportive, basic science work. However, renewed efforts have arisen to evaluate approaches to protecting various components of the neurovascular unit against the cellular and biochemical consequences of cerebral ischemia in the modern era of endovascular therapy of acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion. 1 Many patients have poor access to reperfusion therapy and, even when they. do have it, do not have a satisfactory recovery despite achieving a good technical result of recanalization of an occluded vessel.

2 Moreover, in showing the benefits of endovascular therapy within a 6- to 24-hour onset-to-treatment time window in patients with a large ischemic lesion, recent trials have also challenged understanding about how viable vs dead neuronal tissue is defined on brain imaging. 3 Therefore, a clear rationale persists for cytoprotective therapies having a place as an adjuvant treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Thus, the study by Fu et al4 published in this issue of JAMA Neurology, a carefully conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized trial showing that the sublingual combination of edaravone dexborneol improved clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke, is most encouraging but warrants scrutiny over reliability and applicability.

### Edaravone dexborneol for ischemic stroke with sufficient recanalization after thrombectomy: a randomized phase II trial [^112DEwmb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Procedures

Patients were randomly assigned to the ED group (intravenous ED [37.5 mg, dissolved in 100 mL saline] twice a day for 12 days), or control group (intravenous placebo [dissolved in 100 mL saline] twice a day for 12 days). Intravenous ED or placebo was administered within 60 min after successful recanalization. Neurological status, measured with the NIHSS, was assessed at baseline, 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, and 12 days after randomization. Demographic and clinical details were obtained at randomization. Follow-up data were collected at 24 h, 48 h, 7 days, 12 days (or at hospital discharge if earlier), and 90 days after randomization. Remote and on-site quality control monitoring and data verification were performed throughout the study. All patients received standard medical management according to national stroke guidelines.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was favorable functional outcome, defined as a mRS of 0–2 at 90 days after randomization.

The secondary endpoints were excellent functional outcome (mRS 0–1) at 90 days after randomization; an ordinal shift of the full range of mRS scores at 90 days; change in NIHSS score compared with baseline at 24 h, 48 h and 12 ± 2 days; infarct volume at 1 week; all-cause mortality at 90 ± 7 days.

The safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 48 h, defined as an increase in the NIHSS score of ≥ 4 points as a result of the intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal hemorrhage at 48 h, and serious adverse events (SAE).

### Rationale and design of treatment of acute ischaemic stroke with edaravone dexborneol II (TASTE-2): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^111odpc5]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

TASTE-2 will address a significant challenge in providing cytoprotection during in-hospital prethrombectomy for AIS patients in the new era of reperfusion therapy. The rationale and design of this study are based on multiple preclinical and clinical studies, adhering to the STAIR recommendations. The two primary reperfusion treatments for brain ischaemia, namely thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy therapy, have the potential to yield favourable functional outcomes for patients by fully or partially restoring the blood flow within a suitable time window. However, considering the pathophysiology of recanalised blood flow, it may be worth exploring the use of a multitarget cytoprotectant as a viable intervention to mitigate subsequent injury caused by ischaemia and reperfusion.

Recently, the publication of the efficacy and safety of nerinetide for the treatment of AIS (ESCAPE-NA1) trial demonstrated that nerinetide, a postsynaptic density protein 95, did not improve functional outcomes for patients undergoing EVT when compared with placebo. The lack of positive outcome could potentially be explained by the plasmin-mediated enzymatic breakdown of nerinetide within the alteplase layer. In our search on PubMed and Web of Science for this trial design, we found no evidence suggesting edaravone dexborneol is affected by alteplase; however, experimental thrombosis models indicate edaravone can accelerate thrombolysis with alteplase. Therefore, patients with alteplase are not prohibited and the subgroup analysis of efficacy for patients with or without alteplase before EVT will be performed in this trial. Although DL-3-n-Butylphthalide, a new cytoprotectant, was demonstrated to be efficacious in improving functional outcome for patients with AIS receiving reperfusion therapy, the specific molecular mechanism of action of butylphthalide was unknown and the rate of EVT was rather low. An ongoing phase-III trial of a sublingual tablet containing edaravone dexborneol was designed to evaluate its efficacy and safety in terms of functional outcomes in AIS patients. However, the trial excluded patients undergoing EVT.

In conclusion, TASTE-2 represents the pioneering phase-III trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of edaravone dexborneol in AIS patients undergoing EVT. This study will generate robust data regarding the effectiveness of this cytoprotective drug in individuals receiving reperfusion treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of Y-2 sublingual tablet for patients with acute ischaemic stroke: protocol of a phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^112LrzUE]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This multicentre, randomised, control trial will assess the efficacy and safety of the Y-2 sublingual tablet, which is composed of edaravone and dexborneol in patients with AIS.

Previous studies have demonstrated intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular treatment are the most effective managements to successful reperfusion in patients suffering from AIS. However, even after achieving successful recanalisation, there are 41%–55% patients with an unfavourable clinical outcome at day 90, which resulted in futile recanalisation. Delayed onset to puncture and puncture to reperfusion are associated with higher risk of futile recanalisation. So, timely and effective management can improve clinical outcomes and decrease futile recanalisation rates in patients with AIS.

Edaravone dexborneol is a multitarget neuroprotective drug with both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects to improve the outcome of ischaemic stroke through scavenging hydroxyl-free, peroxyl-free and superoxide-free radicals, relieving cerebral oedema, with an anti-inflammatory effect and consequently inhibiting delayed neuronal death. Clinical studies have proven that edaravone dexborneol injection could improve the functional outcomes in patients with AIS.

Importantly, there are still some differences between the current Y-2 trail and previous study. First of all, the control group of the current trail is a placebo, whereas the control group of a previous injection study is edaravone, which is the active ingredient. Second, Y-2 trial has an increased number of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis in the subject population and the efficacy of neuroprotective agents in the patient population receiving recanalisation treatment can be further analysed during postanalysis. Third, although the proportion of the Y-2 oral dosage form and injection component is different, the proportion of the Y-2 component is roughly similar to that of injection in terms of bioavailability.

As the Y-2 sublingual tablet is not restricted by healthcare resource (beds, nurse, equipment, etc), it can be administrated easily and earlier to AIS patients. This is significant as a trend has been found in previous studies, that patients can receive more benefit from an earlier treatment window.

Y-2 sublingual tablet is the first sublingual tablet to be administrated in patients with AIS. The randomised, multicentre and prospective design of this study has great methodological superiority to control confounding bias and selection bias. In addition, the scientific calculation of the sample size guarantee strong statistical power and the results will be statistically reliable.

Safety outcome assessment

Data for safety assessment included adverse reactions observed during the trial and changes in laboratory data before and after treatment. Severe adverse events (SAEs) included disability, prolonged hospitalisation and death.

Statistical analysis

Based on the principle of intention-to-treat analysis, all randomised patients were included in the safety analysis, and patients who had at least one valid assessment were included in the efficacy analysis. The last observation was used for patients who withdrew from the study and counted as lack of efficacy. Data for patients who withdrew because of safety or other reasons were included throughout the last visit and before the termination of the study. The baseline characteristics in four groups were compared. Proportions were used for categorical variables, and means with SD were used for continuous variables. Differences in efficacy and safety outcomes among four groups were analysed. Continuous data were analysed by analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test, and categorical data examined by χ² test or Fisher's exact test. All tests were two-sided, and a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS V.9.2 software.

### Edaravone dexborneol versus edaravone alone for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a phase III, randomized, double-blind, comparative trial [^111nD1n3]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Edaravone dexborneol, comprised of 2 active ingredients, edaravone and (+)-borneol, has been developed as a novel neuroprotective agent with synergistic effects of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory in animal models. The present clinical trial aimed at testing the effects of edaravone dexborneol versus edaravone on 90-day functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

Methods

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparative, phase III clinical trial was conducted at 48 hospitals in China between May 2015 and December 2016. Inclusion criteria included patients diagnosed as AIS, 35 to 80 years of age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score between 4 and 24, and within 48 hours of AIS onset. AIS patients were randomized in 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment arms: 14-day infusion of edaravone dexborneol or edaravone injection. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 1 on day 90 after randomization.

Results

One thousand one hundred sixty-five AIS patients were randomly allocated to the edaravone dexborneol group (n = 585) or the edaravone group (n = 580). The edaravone dexborneol group showed significantly higher proportion of patients experiencing good functional outcomes on day 90 after randomization, compared with the edaravone group (modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 1, 67.18% versus 58.97%; odds ratio, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.12–1.81]; P = 0.004). The prespecified subgroup analyses indicated that a greater benefit was observed in female patients than their male counterparts (2.26, 1.49–3.43 versus 1.14, 0.85–1.52).

Conclusions

When edaravone dexborneol versus edaravone was administered within 48 hours after AIS, 90-day good functional outcomes favored the edaravone dexborneol group, especially in female patients. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02430350.

Methods

Study design

This was designed as a phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, multiple-dose, active-controlled clinical trial conducted at 28 centres in China between May 2013 and February 2015. Patients were assigned to treatment after they had given informed consent.

Patient selection

Patients who met the following inclusion criteria were eligible for enrolment: age 35–75 years, diagnosis of AIS, ability to start the study drug within 48 hours after stroke onset, a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score between 4 and 24, and a total score of upper and lower limbs ≥ 2 on motor deficits.

Study intervention

For this trial, 400 cases were planned to be randomised into four groups: control group (edaravone injection, 30 mg/dose, once every 12 hours, continued for 14 days), low-dose group (Edaravone Dexborneol injection, 12.5 mg/dose [edaravone 10 mg, (+)-borneol 2.5 mg], one dose every 12 hours, continued for 14 days), medium-dose group (Edaravone Dexborneol injection, 37.5 mg/dose [edaravone 30 mg, (+)-borneol 7.5 mg], one dose every 12 hours, continued for 14 days) and high-dose group (Edaravone Dexborneol injection, 62.5 mg/dose [edaravone 50 mg, (+)-borneol 12.5 mg], one dose every 12 hours, continued for 14 days). Randomisation was stratified according to the interval between the stroke onset and enrolment (≤ 24 hours vs between 24 hours and 48 hours). The randomisation number was assigned by an automated randomisation system.

Efficacy outcome assessment

The primary efficacy outcome was defined as the proportion of modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 1 at 90 days and NIHSS score change from baseline to 14 days after randomisation; the secondary efficacy outcomes included (1) NIHSS score ≤ 1 at 14, 30 and 90 days after randomisation; (2) Barthel Index ≥ 95 at 14, 30 and 90 days after randomisation; (3) Montreal Cognitive Assessment score at 14, 30 and 90 days after randomisation; and (4) Stroke Impact Scale score at 90 days.

Conclusion

Medium-dose Edaravone Dexborneol was safe in this phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, multiple-dose, active-controlled clinical trial. However, the efficacy still needs to be explored in a large trial. The medium-dose edaravone group (37.5 mg/time) (edaravone 30 mg, (+)-borneol 7.5 mg) will be the optimal dose for a phase III clinical trial.

In animal and human experiments, the pharmacokinetics parameters (C max, AUC 0–t, AUC 0–inf, t 1/2, MRT) of intravenous and oral edaravone dexborneol are similar. Data in animal experiments using edaravone demonstrated the following results: AUC, 5290 hours×ng/mL in animals compared with 5900 hours×ng/mL in humans, C max: 2110 ng/mL in animals compared with 2436 ng/mL in humans. The following results were demonstrated using dexborneol: AUC: 30.8 ng/mL in animals compared with 23.8 hours×ng/mL in humans, C max 20 ng/mL in animals compared with 33 ng/mL in human.

The objective of this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparative phase III trial is to evaluate the safety and effective of edaravone dexborneol sublingual tablet in patients with AIS.

Background

Edaravone Dexborneol is a novel neuroprotective agent that comprised edaravone and (+)-borneol, a food additive with an anti-inflammatory effect in animal ischaemic stroke models. This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of Edaravone Dexborneol compared with edaravone in treating patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS).

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, multiple-dose, active-controlled, phase II clinical trial, patients with AIS within 48 hours after stroke onset were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to low-dose (12.5 mg), medium-dose (37.5 mg) or high-dose (62.5 mg) Edaravone Dexborneol groups, and an active control group with edaravone (30 mg) by 30 min intravenous infusion every 12 hours, for 14 consecutive days. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of modified Rankin Scale (mRS)score ≤ 1 at 90 days and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score change from baseline to 14 days after randomisation. The safety outcome included any adverse event during 90 days after treatment.

Results

Of 385 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 94 were randomised to low-dose group, 97 to medium-dose group, 98 to high-dose group and 96 to the control group. No significant difference was observed among the four groups on mRS score (mRS ≤ 1, p = 0.4054) at 90 days or NIHSS score change at 14 days (p = 0.6799). However, a numerically higher percentage of patients with mRSscore ≤ 1 at 90 days in the medium-dose (69.39%) and high-dose (65.63%) groups was observed than in the control group (60.64%). No significant difference in severe adverse events was found among the four groups (p = 0.3815).

Conclusions

Compared with edaravone alone, Edaravone Dexborneol was safe and well tolerated at all doses, although no significant improvement in functional outcomes was observed at 90days.

### Efficacy and safety of Y-2 sublingual tablet for patients with acute ischaemic stroke: protocol of a phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^111c9deS]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Several hundred phase 2 studies and many randomised controlled trials of neuroprotective drugs have failed to demonstrate adequate therapeutic efficacy, making the continued search for effective treatments imperative. We hypothesised that one of the most important reasons for the failure of previous studies was that a single neuroprotective entity was not sufficient to achieve significant clinical outcomes.

Edaravone is an effective free radical scavenger and has been recommended for AIS therapy by guidelines for stroke care in China and Japan. Previous studies have demonstrated that edaravone could prevent neuronal and endothelial cell injury in ischaemic stroke following a chain reaction induced by excessive Ca 2+ influx reactive oxygen species (ROS). This was achieved through inhibiting neurotoxicity, chronic inflammation and modulating the expression of endothelial and neuronal proteins. In addition, preclinical studies demonstrated the effective function of dexborneol in the prevention and treatment of nerve injury in ischaemic stroke through multiple mechanisms in ischaemia/reperfusion injury, such as reducing ROS generation, inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) and NO synthase pathways, restraining inflammatory process and caspase-related apoptosis. Dexborneol has also allowed other agents to easily pass through the blood–brain barrier with high permeability to exert therapeutic effects. Edaravone dexborneol is a novel neuroprotective agent that is composed of edaravone and dexborneol. A preclinical trial showed that edaravone dexborneol has a synergistic effect and is more effective in protecting brain from ischaemic and/or ischaemic reperfusion injury than edaravone alone. Furthermore, compared with edaravone, edaravone dexborneol could improve the function outcomes at day 90 in patients with AIS.

Administering drugs intravenously presents a significant challenge in terms of healthcare resources such as beds, nurses, equipment, etc. This could potentially cause delays or limitations in treatment during busy periods, ultimately posing a barrier to protecting neuronal function due to time delays. Y-2 sublingual tablet is an innovative drug, composed of edaravone and dexborneol in a 5:1 ratio (edaravone 30 mg, dexborneol 6 mg). Pharmacokinetic studies have showed that the sublingual formulation is rapidly permeated and absorbed across the buccal membrane without interfering with the disposition and elimination properties, and without significantly altering the total bioavailability of edaravone and dexborneol. Consequently, the peak plasma concentration time (T max), peak plasma concentration (C max) and the area under the curve (AUC) remain largely unchanged.

Background

Acute ischaemic stroke, due to its high mortality and disability rates, imposes a significant economic and social burden worldwide. Typically, endovascular treatment within the therapeutic window is provided to salvage the ischaemic penumbra; however, even when recanalisation is successful during endovascular treatment, the clinical outcomes may still be disappointing. This highlights the necessity of further research, so as to discover better solutions to futile recanalisation and improve patient outcomes.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of Y-6 sublingual tablets (cilostazol and dexborneol) compared with a placebo in the treatment of patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion.

Method

The efficacy and safety of Y-6 sublingual tablets in patients with acute ischaemic stroke are evaluated in a phase II, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial. Eligible patients having provided informed consent are randomised into five groups for a 28-day treatment period. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients achieving the modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days.

Discussion

The EFfects of Y-6 SUblingual Tablets for PaTients with AcUte Ischemic StRokE trial assesses whether Y-6 sublingual tablets are effective and safe in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion.

### Rationale and design of treatment of acute ischaemic stroke with edaravone dexborneol II (TASTE-2): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^11149Q8k]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and rationale

Reperfusion therapy, namely intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT), has been highly recommended to individuals diagnosed with major ischaemic stroke (IS), particularly those with large-vessel occlusion (LVO), however, the proportion of unfavourable functional outcome remains as high as 54% in the five classical trials of EVT. Brain cytoprotection, formerly known as neuroprotechtion, had been highly expected to improve functional outcome of IS but failed to show their benefits so far in randomised clinical trials. Considering the rapid advancement of thrombectomy techniques and devices aimed at improving functional outcome in patients with LVOs effectively in the era of reperfusion and to have maximum impact of cytoprotectants, the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) recommended to clinically evaluate cytoprotective agents alongside reperfusion therapy, for which multiple mechanisms of brain ischaemia or reperfusion injury had been elucidated. Therefore, a strategy using multitarget cytoprotectant agents which act through various synergistic mechanisms to prevent ischaemic injury was recommended with priority.

Edaravone, approved to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by the US Food and Drug Administration, has proven to be cytoprotective through early scavenging of free radicals and later exerting anti-inflammatory effects to promote functional recovery and structural integrity in reperfusion animal models. Furthermore, a retrospective observational study has shown that edaravone was associated with greater functional independence in stroke patients who underwent EVT. While (+)-borneol was estimated to have potent cytoprotective effects through multiple mechanisms in IS models, like inhibiting neuronal excitotoxicity through potentiating ɑ2/ɑ3-containing GABAA receptors, regulating the expression of nitric oxide synthase, suppressing Ca 2+ overload and reducing the release of reactive oxygen species. Being combined together with a ratio of 4:1, edaravone dexborneol has been demonstrated to be a brain cytoprotective agent that exhibits synergistically antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and downregulating ferroptosis to attenuate reperfusion injury in preclinical modelsand has been proved to be efficacious in improving functional recovery among IS patients within 48 hours when compared with edaravone alone in Treatment of Acute Ischaemic Stroke (AIS) with Edaravone Dexborneol (TASTE) trial. However, whether it is cytoprotective as a whole in those patients who are treated with EVT has not been confirmed.

Therefore, we launched the TASTE II (TASTE-2) trial to test the efficacy and safety of edaravone dexborneol in improving functional outcome for those patients undergoing EVT because of LVO.

### Safety and efficacy of edaravone dexborneol versus edaravone for patients with acute ischaemic stroke: a phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, multiple-dose, active-controlled clinical trial [^111VjXy1]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

In this trial, the major adverse reactions included pruritus, skin rash, acute liver injury and kidney injury. The adverse reactions of Edaravone Dexborneol seemed to show a dose-dependent relationship. It is worth noting that, among a total of 29 SAEs, 2 events (severe liver and kidney damage) were related to Edaravone Dexborneol, both of which happened in one patient in the high-dose group. The underlying pharmacological mechanisms remained unclear. In consideration of safety, high-dose Edaravone Dexborneol should not be recommended for further clinical investigation.

Although no significant difference was found among the four groups in the primary efficacy outcome, proportions of the patients with mRS score of ≤ 1 at 90 days in the group treated with medium-dose (69.39%) or high-dose (65.63%) Edaravone Dexborneol were higher than in the group treated with edaravone (60.64%), and we found the efficacy of the medium-dose Edaravone Dexborneol was likely to be even better than the high-dose one. In combination with efficacy and safety data, a phase III clinical trial with the medium-dose edaravone group, with a dose of 37.5 mg/time (edaravone 30 mg, (+)-borneol 7.5 mg) is suggested.

This phase II, randomized, double blinded, multi-center study aims to explore whether intravenous edaravone dexborneol (ED) could improve clinical outcomes in patients with anterior circulation stroke with successful endovascular reperfusion (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04667637). Eligible patients were randomly (1:1) assigned into ED, which received intravenous ED (37.5 mg, 2/day, for 12 days) or control group, which received placebo. The primary endpoint was favorable functional outcome (a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] of 0–2 at 90 days). Two hundred patients were enrolled, including 97 in ED group and 103 in control group. The proportion of patients with 90-day mRS (0–2) was 58.7% (54/92) in ED group and 52.1% (49/94) in control group (unadjusted odds ratio 1.37, [95% CI 0.76–2.44], P = 0.29). This work suggests that intravenous ED is safe, but do not statistically improve 90-day functional outcomes in patients with anterior circulation stroke with successful endovascular reperfusion.

### Efficacy and safety of ginkgo diterpene lactone meglumine in acute ischemic stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^1177ZCkW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Recently, the exploratory analysis of the ESCAPE-NA1 (Efficacy and Safety of Nerinetide for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke) trial indicated a potential efficacy of nerinetide for patients who didn't receive treatment of alteplase. More directly, edaravone dexborneol, a novel multitargeted neuroprotectant, was reported to have significant benefits in improving functional outcomes for patients with AIS in the TASTE (Edaravone Dexborneol vs Edaravone Alone for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke) trial. These previously mentioned trials indicated, to some extent, that multitargeted neuroprotectants might be more promising for AIS treatment than those targeting a single pathway, partially due to the complex process of ischemic damage.

Ginkgolide-related intravenous preparation is a class of multitargeted neuroprotectants widely used for the treatment of cardiocerebrovascular diseases in China, of which GDLM was approved for clinical use among patients with ischemic stroke in 2012 (national medicine permission number, Z20120024). To date, a series of randomized clinical trials have been conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GDLM, a large portion of which were single-center trials with a limited sample size of approximately 100 to 200 patients. Moreover, most previous randomized clinical trials were not placebo controlled. They commonly made direct comparisons between GDLM and other neuroprotective agents like Danhong, Shuxuening, Deengzhanxixin, and Butylphthalide injections. Therefore, evidence for the single-therapeutic response to GDLM remains scarce, to our knowledge, until now. The present study, which involved a large sample size of more than 3000 participants and used a multicenter, placebo-controlled design with strict quality control, confirmed the potential therapeutic value of GDLM in patients with AIS reported previously. Further, the present study provided more precise and direct estimates of GDLM's clinical efficacy.

### Clinical and safety outcomes of edaravone dexborneol in acute ischemic stroke: a multicenter, prospective, cohort study [^111LVyJK]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Although edaravone dexborneol, a multitarget cytoprotective drug, has demonstrated benefits in previous clinical trials, its actual clinical efficacy and safety in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remain unclear. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that edaravone dexborneol is associated with better outcomes in patients with AIS in real-world clinical practice.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, real-world cohort study at 72 centers in China from January 14 to July 4, 2023. We included patients age 18 years or older, with AIS within 14 days of onset, and a prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0 or 1. Patients were divided into those receiving edaravone dexborneol (the exposed group) or not (the unexposed group). Clinical outcomes included favorable functional outcome (mRS score 0–1) at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) during the hospital, and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Multivariable logistic regression, propensity score matching (PSM), and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses were conducted.

Results

Of 4,401 participants (2,904 men [66.8%]; median [interquartile range] age, 65 [57–72] years), 3,017 (68.6%) were treated with edaravone dexborneol. The exposed group was younger (65 [56–72] years vs 66 [58–74] years), had higher NIH Stroke Scale (3 [2–7] vs 3 [1–5]), and had shorter time from onset to admission (7.0 [2.5–24.0] hours vs 10.4 [2.8–48.0] hours). The exposed group had a higher proportion of patients with favorable functional outcome at 90 days compared with the unexposed group (68.6% [2,071/3,017] vs 66.0% [914/1,384], adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.23 [95% CI 1.06–1.43]). Moreover, sICH rates (0.4% vs 0.6%, aOR 0.44 [95% CI 0.14–1.44]) and mortality within 90 days (2.1% vs 3.3%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.58–1.37]) were similar in both groups. PSM and IPTW analyses yielded results consistent with the multivariate adjustment model.

Discussion

In this observational cohort study involving Chinese patients with AIS, edaravone dexborneol was associated with significantly better functional outcome at 90 days. Verification of our findings is warranted in other populations.

Trial Registration Information

This trial is registered with Effectiveness and Safety of Edaravone Dexborneol in Acute Ischemic Stroke, number NCT05644223; submitted for registration on November 30, 2022; first patient enrollment was on January 14, 2023.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that treatment of patients with AIS with edaravone dexborneol is associated with significantly better functional outcome at 90 days measured using the mRS.

### Edaravone dexborneol for ischemic stroke with sufficient recanalization after thrombectomy: a randomized phase II trial [^113TtNBD]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Based on several randomized controlled trials, endovascular treatment (EVT) has been recommended as the most effective therapy for anterior circulation AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) by current guidelines. However, despite the high rate of recanalization after EVT, 46% to 51% of patients with successful reperfusion achieve functional independence at 90 days. Improving outcomes in patients who achieve reperfusion without regaining functional independence is an unmet need. Given the involvement of the inflammatory response and oxidative stress in acute stroke, anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative pathways have been attractive targets to improve the outcomes of patients with LVO-AIS after EVT.

To date, no drug has been shown to be effective in AIS although many were found to be neuroprotective in animal stroke models. Subgroup analysis of the ESCAPE-NA1 trial showed that nerinetide may improve clinical outcome in AIS-LVO patients who do not receive alteplase, which offers hope for neuroprotection in AIS. Furthermore, recent BAST (Butylphthalide for Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Receiving Intravenous Thrombolysis or Endovascular Treatment) provided the evidence for the cerebroprotective effect of Butylphthalide in patients who received intravenous thrombolysis or EVT. These studies further support the cerebroprotective strategy to improve reperfusion injury in patients who received reperfusion treatments –. Reperfusion injury may result in clinically ineffective reperfusion after EVT by generation of harmful free radicals such as the superoxide, hydroxyl, and peroxynitrite radicals, which may lead to apoptosis or programmed cell death, disruption of neurovascular unit, endothelial injury, and aggravation of inflammation and immune dysregulation. Edaravone dexborneol (ED), a compound composed of edaravone and dexborneol with both antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, was found to exert multiple neuroprotective effects in pre-clinical studies. Edaravone has been recommended for AIS therapy with the ability of scavenging free radical, preventing neuronal and endothelial cell injury by excessive Ca2+ influx reactive oxygen species –. Dexborneol was reported to exert neuroprotective effects through inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) and NO synthase pathways, reducing ROS generation, restraining inflammatory process and caspase-related apoptosis. Furthermore, the TASTE (Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke with Edaravone Dexborneol) trial showed that a 14-day infusion of ED produced better 90-day functional outcomes (mRS 0–1) compared to the edaravone group in AIS patients who did not received thrombolysis or EVT presenting within 48 h of symptom onset. The recent TASTE–SL (TASTE sublingual) phase 3 trial showed in patients with AIS presenting within 48 h and not candidate for EVT, patients who received sublingual ED had higher rates of 90-day good functional outcome (mRS 0–1) compared to those who received placebo.

### Efficacy and safety of Y-2 sublingual tablet for patients with acute ischaemic stroke: protocol of a phase III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial [^113ydQvE]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and rational

Although stroke is largely preventable, stroke has remained the second greatest cause of death and the third most common cause of disability, accounting for 6.55 million death and 143 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2019. As a result stroke has posed major health and social economic cost over the world, particularly in low-income and middle-income nations. The key aim of acute stroke treatment is to recanalise occluded vessels early, salvage ischaemic penumbra or volume of hypoperfused, non-functional, but still salvageable tissue surrounding the infarcted core.

Although recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator and endovascular therapy are the major effective approaches for early reperfusion and can achieve good functional outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), only a small percentage of patients may benefit from thrombolysis. Neuroprotection approaches suggest that an intervention that modifies the key aspects of the ischaemic cascade can stop ischaemic brain damage from progressing into infarction. However, so far, neuroprotective agents have not been developed for early reperfusion, and the efficacy of neuroprotective drugs have not been established and accepted by most international guidelines.

### Edaravone for acute ischaemic stroke [^113T7SkB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroprotection is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. Edaravone is a neuroprotective agent that has been widely used in China, and several studies have suggested that it may be beneficial in acute ischaemic stroke.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of edaravone for acute ischaemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (November 2010) and the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (November 2010). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1950 to November 2010), EMBASE (1980 to November 2010), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (1979 to November 2010), Chinese Biomedical Database (1979 to November 2010), Chinese Evidence-Based Medicine Database (November 2010) and Chinese Science and Technology Journals Database (1980 to November 2010). In an attempt to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched reference lists and clinical trials and research registers, and contacted a pharmaceutical company, researchers and study authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing edaravone with placebo or no intervention in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and independently extracted the data.

Main Results

We included three trials, involving 496 participants, and defined four trials as waiting assessment. All three included trials were of edaravone plus another treatment compared with the other treatment alone. The dose of edaravone injections in the three trials was the same at 60 mg per day. The course of treatment in all three trials is 14 days. None of the included trials reported the pre-specified primary outcome of death or dependency defined using the modified Rankin scale during the follow-up period. The three trials evaluated the effect of edaravone at different times and using different methods. All three trials reported adverse events; there were no differences between the treatment group and the control group. Overall, edaravone appeared to increase the proportion of participants with marked neurological improvement compared with the control group, and the difference was significant (risk ratio (RR) 1.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.49).

Authors' Conclusions

The risk of bias in the included trials was moderate and the sample was small. Hence, although the data in this review show an effective treatment trend of edaravone for acute ischaemic stroke, further large, high-quality trials are required to confirm this trend.

### Bioavailability of edaravone sublingual tablet versus intravenous infusion in healthy male volunteers [^114k4cK9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Edaravone is a free-radical scavenger. Edaravone 30mg IV has been approved for use in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in Japan and China, and for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in Japan and the United States. Considering the inconvenience of IV infusion in clinical practice, an oral tablet formulation of edaravone was developed but failed in 2011 due to poor bioavailability. More recently, a sublingual (SL) tablet formulation of edaravone 30mg was developed by a Good Manufacturing Practices-compliant manufacturer in China. This study explored the bioavailability of the SL tablet of edaravone and aimed to provide evidence to support decision making in future clinical development.

Methods

This 2-way crossover study was conducted in 10 healthy male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 dosing sequences: (1) SL edaravone 30mg, followed by edaravone 30mg IV infusion given over 30 minutes; or (2) edaravone 30mg IV infusion given over 30 minutes, followed by SL edaravone 30mg. The washout period between the 2 dosing periods was at least 24hours. Serial blood samples were collected in each dosing period. The bioavailability of the SL tablet was assessed using bioavailability analysis. Tolerability was evaluated throughout the study.

Findings

The plasma concentration-time profile of the SL tablet was similar to that with the IV infusion. Amean (SD) C max of 2030.2 (517.2) ng/mL was reached within a median T max of 0.875hour, which was statistically significantly longer than the median T max with IV administration (0.5 hour). The C max with SL administration corresponded to 83.92% (90% CI, 73.22%-96.18%) of the C max with the start of IV infusion (2354.0 [336.6] ng/mL). The mean AUC 0-t with SL dosing was 5420.07 (1429.75) h · ng/mL, which corresponded to 91.94% (90% CI, 86.81%-97.39%) of the AUC 0-t with IV administration (5824.42 [1338.48] h · ng/mL). Two cases of adverse events were reported during the study; both were considered by the investigator to have been possibly not related to the study treatment.

Implications

The bioavailability of the SL tablet of edaravone was 91.94%. Compared with IV administration, C max with SL administration was ∼17% lower and T max was statistically significantly longer. The exposure differences can be addressed by modifying the strength of the SL tablet, and then conducting a second study to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic bioavailability of the sublingually administered new strength versus IV infusion of edaravone.

### Safety and efficacy of GABA α 5 antagonist S44819 in patients with ischaemic stroke: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115Pnrh8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

S44819, a selective GABA A α5 receptor antagonist, reduces tonic post-ischaemic inhibition of the peri-infarct cortex. S44819 improved stroke recovery in rodents and increased cortical excitability in a transcranial magnetic stimulation study in healthy volunteers. The Randomized Efficacy and Safety Trial of Oral GABA A α5 antagonist S44819 after Recent ischemic Event (RESTORE BRAIN) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of S44819 for enhancing clinical recovery of patients with ischaemic stroke.

Methods

RESTORE BRAIN was an international, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 2 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of oral S44189 in patients with recent ischaemic stroke. The study was done in specialised stroke units in 92 actively recruiting centres in 14 countries: ten were European countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and four were non-European countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Korea). Patients aged 18–85 years with acute ischaemic stroke involving cerebral cortex (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score 7–20) without previous disability were eligible for inclusion. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 300 mg S44819 twice a day, or placebo twice a day by a balanced, non-adaptive randomisation method with a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment randomisation and allocation were centralised via the interactive web response system using computer-generated random sequences with a block size of 3. Blinding of treatment was achieved by identical appearance and taste of all sachets. Patients, investigators and individuals involved in the analysis of the trial were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 90 days from onset of treatment, evaluated by shift analysis (predefined main analysis) or by dichotomised analyses using 0–1 versus 2–6 and 0–2 versus 3–6 cutoffs (predefined secondary analysis). Secondary endpoints were the effects of S44819 on the NIHSS and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, time needed to complete parts A and B of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index. Efficacy analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5 (specifically, on or after day 30). Safety was compared across treatment groups for all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02877615.

Findings

Between Dec 19, 2016, and Nov 16, 2018, 585 patients were enrolled in the study. Of these, 197 (34%) were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg S44819 twice a day, 195 (33%) to receive 300 mg S44819 twice a day, and 193 (33%) to receive placebo twice a day. 189 (96%) of 197 patients in the 150 mg S44819 group, 188 (96%) of 195 patients in the 300 mg S44819 group, and 191 (99%) patients in the placebo group received at least one dose of treatment and had at least one mRS score taken after day 5, and were included in efficacy analyses. 195 (99%) of 197 patients in the 150 mg S44819 group, 194 (99%) of 195 patients in the 300 mg S44819 group, and 193 (100%) patients in the placebo group received at least one dose of treatment, and were included in safety analyses. The primary endpoint of mRS at day 90 did not differ between each of the two S44819 groups and the placebo group (OR 0.91 [95% CI 0.64–1.31]; p = 0.80 for 150 mg S44819 compared with placebo and OR 1.17 [95% CI 0.81–1.67]; p = 0.80 for 300 mg S44819 compared with placebo). Likewise, dichotomised mRS scores at day 90 (mRS 0–2 vs 3–6 or mRS 0–1 vs 2–6) did not differ between groups. Secondary endpoints did not reveal any significant group differences. The median NIHSS score at day 90 did not differ between groups (4 [IQR 2–8] in 150 mg S44819 group, 4 [2–7] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 4 [2–6] in placebo group), nor did the number of patients at day 90 with an NIHSS score of up to 5 (95 [61%] of 156 in 150 mg S44819 group, 106 [66%] of 161 in 300 mg S44819 group, and 104 [66%] of 157 in placebo group) versus more than 5 (61 [39%] in 150 mg S44819 group, 55 [34%] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 53 [34%] in placebo group). Likewise, the median MoCA score (22.0 [IQR 17.0–26.0] in 150 mg S44819 group, 23.0 [19.0–26.5] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 22.0 [17.0–26.0] in placebo group), time needed to complete parts A (50 s [IQR 42–68] in 150 mg S44819 group, 49 s [36–63] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 50 s [38–68] in placebo group) and B (107 s [81–144] in 150 mg S44819 group, 121 s [76–159] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 130 s [86–175] in placebo group) of the Trail Making Test, and the Barthel index (90 [IQR 60–100] in 150 mg S44819 group, 90 [70–100] in 300 mg S44819 group, and 90 [70–100] in placebo group) were similar in all groups. Number and type of adverse events were similar between the three groups. There were no drug-related adverse events and no drug-related deaths.

Interpretation

There was no evidence that S44819 improved clinical outcome in patients after ischaemic stroke, and thus S44819 cannot be recommended for stroke therapy. The concept of tonic inhibition after stroke should be re-evaluated in humans.

Funding

### Predicting the pharmacokinetic characteristics of edaravone intravenous injection and sublingual tablet through modeling and simulation [^112XvsvS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Edaravone is a free-radical scavenger with relatively favorable properties of brain penetration. It has been approved for the indications of acute ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This study aimed to establish a pharmacokinetic (PK) model to fit the PK profile of edaravone after a single sublingual (SL) dose of a novel edaravone tablet and single IV infusion of injectable edaravone in healthy Chinese volunteers participating in a bioavailability study. The model is expected to be useful for predicting the concentration-time profiles of edaravone following different dosing regimens in a healthy Chinese population. The purposes were to identify an optimal dose and dosing regimen for the new SL formulation and to support future clinical exploration of this tablet product in its approved indications and other therapeutic fields being developed.

Methods

The PK profiles after a single SL dose or IV infusion of edaravone 30 mg can be well described by a 3-compartment linear disposition model, on which a first-order absorption model with a lag time and a parameter for bioavailability was incorporated to fit the absorption phase of the SL dose. Performance of these PK models was evaluated for goodness of fit, residual trends, visual predictive checks, as well as precision of model predictions against external data. The validated models were employed for simulating the PK profiles of edaravone after a single SL dose of 60 mg and IV infusion of 60 mg for 60 min.

Findings

The resultant estimates support the possibility and feasibility of demonstrating bioequivalence between an SL administration of edaravone 60 mg and the currently approved dosing regimen for ALS (ie, 60 mg IV over 60 min) once per day. The calculation of sample size suggested that the requirement for subject number was acceptable considering the general capacity of a Phase I study center, and so were the procedures defined in the protocol.

Implication

The models can be further applied to simulate favorable concentration-time profiles in diseases with different underlying courses of oxidative stress, and hence facilitate the optimization of current dosing regimens.

### Oral edaravone demonstrated a favorable safety profile in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis after 48 weeks of treatment [^117MNiEF]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Over the course of 48 wk of treatment, this study indicated that oral edaravone was well tolerated, with no new safety concerns identified. This trial provides safety data to support the use of oral edaravone, which expands on existing evidence supporting the use of FDA‐approved IV edaravone and the recently approved oral suspension formulation.

### Edaravone for acute ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114LFxgo]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The management of acute stroke is challenging. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of edaravone, with or without thrombolytic therapy, in the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. Mean differences (MD), risk ratios (RR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and heterogeneity were calculated.

Findings

Totals of nine RCTs and four cohort studies were included, for a total of 2102 patients. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, edaravone monotherapy was associated with significantly improved Barthel Index of functioning in activities for daily living (MD, 23.95; 95% CI, 18.48 to 29.41; P < 0.001) and neurologic deficit, (as measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score) (MD = -3.49; 95% CI, -5.76 to 1.22; P = 0.003), on short-term follow-up. However, edaravone was not associated with an improved rate of death or disability (RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.23; P = 0.25) on long-term follow-up. When plus to thrombolytic therapy, edaravone was associated with significant improvements in recanalization rate (RR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.77; P = 0.03) and neurologic deficit (MD = 3.97; 95% CI, 5.14 to 2.79; P < 0.001), without an increase in the prevalence of bleeding events (RR = 1.11; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.62; P = 0.59). However, edaravone did not have a significant effect on death or disability (RR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.04; P = 0.12).

Implications

Based on the findings from the present meta-analysis, edaravone was an effective and well-tolerated neuroprotective agent in these patients with ischemic stroke. With the use of edaravone, activities of daily living and neurologic deficits, along with recanalization rates, were improved on short-term follow-up, but the long-term effects still need confirmation in larger-scale clinical trials.

### Edaravone for acute intracerebral haemorrhage [^112eRpQJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) causes significant morbidity and mortality. Prognosis for ICH patients is poor. Edaravone may be safe and effective in reducing the risk of early death and improving long-term functional outcomes in survivors.

Objectives

To assess the safety and efficacy of edaravone for acute ICH.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (March 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2010), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (August 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to August 2010), EMBASE (1980 to March 2010) and 12 Chinese databases (August 2010). We also searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists, relevant conference proceedings and contacted companies manufacturing edaravone.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which edaravone was compared with placebo, or edaravone plus routine treatment was compared with routine treatment alone, in patients with acute ICH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, collected adverse events data and contacted trialists for missing information.

Main Results

We included 10 RCTs involving 768 participants; quality was generally poor. For all trials, the control group was usual care/routine therapy (not placebo), treatment allocation and outcome evaluations were not blinded or not described, and the primary outcome (death or dependency at the end of long-term follow-up) was not reported. Only one trial reported deaths, indicating that edaravone treatment did not decrease the number of deaths significantly either during the scheduled treatment (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.50) or at three month follow-up (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.32). Four studies assessed activities of daily living (ADL) but ADL score was not improved significantly (MD 21.65, 95% CI -6.98 to 50.28) at the end of long-term follow-up. Combining data from all studies, edaravone treatment did increase the rate of improvement of neurological impairment (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.69) until the end of the scheduled treatment, but it is not clear that this translates to any longer-term beneﬁt of clinical importance. Reported adverse events with edaravone were mild and were common (9%), but there was no significant difference in adverse effect between the two groups (RR 2.09, 95% CI 0.71 to 6.19).

Authors' Conclusions

All 10 studies were inconclusive in finding a beneficial or deleterious effect provided by edaravone for the treatment of ICH. Further high quality, large scale RCTs are required.

### Citicoline for treating people with acute ischemic stroke [^116ezHCM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-lasting disability and mortality and its global burden has increased in the past two decades. Several therapies have been proposed for the recovery from, and treatment of, ischemic stroke. One of them is citicoline. This review assessed the benefits and harms of citicoline for treating patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other control for treating people with acute ischemic stroke.

Search Methods

We searched in the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS until 29 January 2020. We searched the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we also reviewed reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles, and searched the websites of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any setting including participants with acute ischemic stroke. Trials were eligible for inclusion if they compared citicoline versus placebo or no intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We selected RCTs, assessed the risk of bias in seven domains, and extracted data by duplicate. Our primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and the degree of disability or dependence in daily activities at 90 days. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We conducted our analyses using the fixed-effect and random-effects model meta-analyses. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for six pre-specified outcomes using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified 10 RCTs including 4281 participants. In all these trials, citicoline was given either orally, intravenously, or a combination of both compared with placebo or standard care therapy. Citicoline doses ranged between 500 mg and 2000 mg per day. We assessed all the included trials as having high risk of bias. Drug companies sponsored six trials. A pooled analysis of eight trials indicates there may be little or no difference in all-cause mortality comparing citicoline with placebo (17.3% versus 18.5%; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence due to risk of bias). Four trials found no difference in the proportion of patients with disability or dependence in daily activities according to the Rankin scale comparing citicoline with placebo (21.72% versus 19.23%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.26; I² = 1%; low-quality evidence due to risk of bias). Meta-analysis of three trials indicates there may be little or no difference in serious cardiovascular adverse events comparing citicoline with placebo (8.83% versus 7.77%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence due to risk of bias). Overall, either serious or non-serious adverse events - central nervous system, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, etc. - were poorly reported and harms may have been underestimated. Four trials assessing functional recovery with the Barthel Index at a cut-off point of 95 points or more did not find differences comparing citicoline with placebo (32.78% versus 30.70%; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13; I² = 24%; low-quality evidence due to risk of bias). There were no differences in neurological function (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at a cut-off point of ≤ 1 points) comparing citicoline with placebo according to five trials (24.31% versus 22.44%; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.21; I² = 27%, low-quality evidence due to risk of bias). A pre-planned Trial Sequential Analysis suggested that no more trials may be needed for the primary outcomes but no trial provided information on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

This review assessed the clinical benefits and harms of citicoline compared with placebo or any other standard treatment for people with acute ischemic stroke. The findings of the review suggest there may be little to no difference between citicoline and its controls regarding all-cause mortality, disability or dependence in daily activities, severe adverse events, functional recovery and the assessment of the neurological function, based on low-certainty evidence. None of the included trials assessed quality of life and the safety profile of citicoline remains unknown. The available evidence is of low quality due to either limitations in the design or execution of the trials.

### CONSORT extension for the reporting of randomised controlled trials conducted using cohorts and routinely collected data (CONSORT-ROUTINE): checklist with explanation and elaboration [^117JUtXx]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Limitations

Item 20 (unmodified)

Trial limitations, addressing sources of potential bias, imprecision, and, if relevant, multiplicity of analyses.

Examples

"A number of limitations of the TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia] trial should be noted. First, the treating physician was aware of the group to which the patient had been assigned, and that physician entered the angiographic variables into the registry; therefore, these variables were susceptible to bias. Second, we did not adjudicate events and did not review angiograms in a blinded fashion. We used all-cause death as the primary end point as it is the most stringent end point and because of the completeness of the national death registries in each participating country. We chose not to perform separate adjudication of secondary end points both to limit expense and because of the high reliability of the SWEDEHEART [Swedish Web System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies] registry. A comparison of the clinical characteristics and outcomes between the patients who underwent randomization and those who did not indicates that the two cohorts differed significantly in a number of respects. Even when a trial uses a population-based registry for enrollment, the trial participants cannot be fully representative of the complete range of patients".

"Awareness of the trial might have itself promoted better data recording [in the EHR]. Nevertheless, we observed several limitations of the data including, for example, a high proportion of patients with unspecified subtype of stroke and a smaller number with BP [blood pressure] values not recorded during the intervention period. From an explanatory perspective, these limitations of the data reduce the capacity of the study to provide an accurate assessment of intervention efficacy".

Explanation

According to CONSORT 2010, identifying and discussing the potential limitations of a trial is crucial to appropriately interpretating the trial results, including issues such as potential bias, imprecision, and multiplicity of comparisons. Unique characteristics of trials using cohorts or routinely collected data might be linked to risk of bias and associated problems and, therefore, need specific attention in the discussion, including issues such as data availability, problems with data linkage, data validation, and data quality. The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiativehas similarly identified that problems with the relevance, reliability, or reproducibility of data within registries or with other routinely collected data can influence the conduct and results of the trial.

### Comparison of tenecteplase with alteplase for the early treatment of ischaemic stroke in the melbourne mobile stroke unit (TASTE-A): a phase 2, randomised, open-label trial [^114UFFL7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Mobile stroke units (MSUs) equipped with a CT scanner reduce time to thrombolytic treatment and improve patient outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that tenecteplase administered in an MSU would result in superior reperfusion at hospital arrival, when compared with alteplase.

Methods

The TASTE-A trial is a phase 2, randomised, open-label trial at the Melbourne MSU and five tertiary hospitals in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with ischaemic stroke who were eligible for thrombolytic treatment were randomly allocated in the MSU to receive, within 4.5 h of symptom onset, either standard-of-care alteplase (0.9 mg/kg [maximum 90 mg], administered intravenously with 10% as a bolus over 1 min and 90% as an infusion over 1 h), or the investigational product tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg [maximum 25 mg], administered as an intravenous bolus over 10 s), before being transported to hospital for ongoing care. The primary outcome was the volume of the perfusion lesion on arrival at hospital, assessed by CT-perfusion imaging. Secondary safety outcomes were modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 5 or 6 at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and any haemorrhage within 36 h, and death at 90 days. Assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04071613, and is completed.

Findings

Between June 20, 2019, and Nov 16, 2021, 104 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either tenecteplase (n = 55) or alteplase (n = 49). The median age of patients was 73 years (IQR 61–83), and the median NIHSS at baseline was 8 (5–14). On arrival at the hospital, the perfusion lesion volume was significantly smaller with tenecteplase (median 12 mL [IQR 3–28]) than with alteplase (35 mL [18–76]; adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.81; p = 0.0030). At 90 days, an mRS of 5 or 6 was reported in eight (15%) patients allocated to tenecteplase and ten (20%) patients allocated to alteplase (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.23–2.16; p = 0.54). Five (9%) patients allocated to tenecteplase and five (10%) patients allocated to alteplase died from any cause at 90 days (aOR 1.12, 95% CI 0.26–4.90; p = 0.88). No cases of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage were reported within 36 h with either treatment. Up to day 90, 13 serious adverse events were noted: five (5%) in patients treated with tenecteplase, and eight (8%) in patients treated with alteplase.

Interpretation

Treatment with tenecteplase on the MSU in Melbourne resulted in a superior rate of early reperfusion compared with alteplase, and no safety concerns were noted. This trial provides evidence to support the use of tenecteplase and MSUs in an optimal model of stroke care.

### Ticagrelor added to aspirin in acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack in prevention of disabling stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^1148X6FF]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Trial Procedures

Written informed consent was provided prior to any study specific procedures. Following enrollment/randomization, visits were scheduled at 7 days (visit window, 2 days), 30 days (visit window, 4 days), and 60 days (visit window, 4 days). The visits at 7 and 60 days could be telephone visits.

Enrolled, eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either ticagrelor or matching placebo, in accordance with the sequestered, fixed-randomization schedule, with the use of balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 1:1 ratio of the 2 regimens.

A loading dose of ticagrelor, 180 mg (two 90 mg tablets), or matching placebo was to be given as soon as possible after randomization. Subsequent maintenance doses of ticagrelor, 90 mg, or matching placebo were taken in the morning and evening, at approximately 12-hour intervals, for the remainder of the 30-day treatment period.

In addition, and as part of clinical practice, patients received a loading dose with aspirin (recommended 300–325 mg of aspirin, taking any dose of aspirin given after symptom onset but before randomization in account) and thereafter were treated with a recommended aspirin dose of 75 to 100 mg once daily.

After the 30 days of study treatment, patients were treated according to standard of care at the discretion of the investigator and followed up for an additional 30 days with continued collection of end points and safety events.

### Aptiganel hydrochloride in acute ischemic stroke: a randomized controlled trial [^113TTuSU]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Tissue plasminogen activator is the only thrombolytic agent approved in the United States for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and has limitations. Aptiganel hydrochloride is a novel and selective ligand for the ion-channel site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-channel complex and a promising neuroprotective agent in animal models of focal brain ischemia.

Objective

To determine whether aptiganel improves the clinical outcome for acute ischemic stroke patients.

Design

Nested phase 2/phase 3 randomized controlled trial conducted between July 1996 and September 1997.

Setting

One hundred fifty-six medical centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, England, and Scotland.

Participants

A total of 628 patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke (50.3% male; mean age, 71.5 years).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned within 6 hours of stroke to receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens: high-dose aptiganel (5-mg bolus followed by 0.75 mg/h for 12 hours; n = 214); low-dose aptiganel (3-mg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/h for 12 hours; n = 200); or placebo (n = 214).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy end point was the Modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days after stroke onset. Secondary end points included mortality and change in National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale score at 7 days after stroke.

Results

The trial was suspended by the sponsor and the independent data and safety monitoring board because of both a lack of efficacy and a potential imbalance in mortality. There was no improvement in outcome for either aptiganel (low-dose or high-dose) group compared with the placebo group at 90 days (median Modified Rankin Scale score for all 3 treatment groups = 3; P = 0.31). At 7 days, placebo-treated patients exhibited slightly greater neurological improvement on the NIH Stroke Scale than high-dose aptiganel patients (mean improvement for placebo group, -0.8 points vs for high-dose aptiganel, 0.9 points; P = 0.04). The mortality rate at 120 days in patients treated with high-dose aptiganel was higher than that in patients who received placebo (26.3% vs 19.2%; P = 0.06). Mortality in the low-dose aptiganel group was 22.5% (P = 0.39 vs placebo).

Conclusions

Aptiganel was not efficacious in patients with acute ischemic stroke at either of the tested doses, and m ay be harmful. The larger proportion of patients with favorable outcomes and lower mortality rate in the placebo group suggest that glutamate blockade with aptiganel may have detrimental effects in an undifferentiated population of stroke patients.

### Assessing taste and smell dysfunction in acute and chronic stroke patients: insights from an adapted bedside questionnaire [^111XCD9x]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design and Patient Recruitment

This single‐center observational cross‐sectional study included adult stroke patients who were admitted to the stroke unit or evaluated in the outpatient clinic at Hospital Santa Maria in Lisbon, Portugal, between September 2020 and December 2022. Consecutive patients admitted to the stroke unit were invited to participate if they fulfilled inclusion criteria and did not have exclusion criteria. Patients evaluated in the outpatient clinic were also invited to participate in the study under the same criteria. Ethical approval was obtained from the Local Ethics Committee.

Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) a definitive diagnosis of stroke ischemic or hemorrhagic, based on the World Health Organization criteria, and confirmed by brain imaging (brain CT or MRI); (2) agreement to participate, providing written informed consent.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) aphasia impairing the ability to participate in the questionnaire; (2) dementia or cognitive impairment hindering questionnaire completion; (3) nasogastric intubation; (4) severe kidney insufficiency (Stage IV); (5) prior traumatic brain injury or pre‐existing brain lesions diagnosed before the stroke; (6) history of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and any other taste complaints occurring before the stroke, as identified through their medical history.

2.2 Patient's Assessment and Data Extracted

For patients included in the stroke unit or in the outpatient clinic, we collected the following variables: demographics (age, sex), vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption); prior coronary ischemic disease and vascular events; stroke severity at admission, using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS); neurological examination at the time of the questionnaire (NIHSS and modified Rankin scale); stroke etiology, established using the Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria; neuroanatomical lesion location using CT or MRI, vascular territory (vertebrobasilar or carotid) and lesion laterality in supratentorial stroke (right or left); acute‐phase therapies (intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy); pharmacological treatments since stroke onset and at the time of assessment.

For patients included in the outpatient clinic we also collected the interest in and enjoyment of food, weight changes since the stroke and the impact of taste and smell dysfunction on quality of life.

For both groups of patients, we further carried out a structured interview focused on changes in taste and smell, and we applied the TSS questionnaire.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase for thrombolysis in patients selected by use of perfusion imaging within 4. 5 h of onset of ischaemic stroke (TASTE): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority trial [^111eZuZW]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Intravenous tenecteplase increases reperfusion in patients with salvageable brain tissue on perfusion imaging and might have advantages over alteplase as a thrombolytic for ischaemic stroke. We aimed to assess the non-inferiority of tenecteplase versus alteplase on clinical outcomes in patients selected by use of perfusion imaging.

Methods

This international, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, clinical non-inferiority trial enrolled patients from 35 hospitals in eight countries. Participants were aged 18 years or older, within 4.5 h of ischaemic stroke onset or last known well, were not being considered for endovascular thrombectomy, and met target mismatch criteria on brain perfusion imaging. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a centralised web server with randomly permuted blocks to intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) or alteplase (0.90 mg/kg). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients without disability (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at 3 months, assessed via masked review in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. We aimed to recruit 832 participants to yield 90% power (one-sided alpha = 0.025) to detect a risk difference of 0.08, with an absolute non-inferiority margin of -0.03. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12613000243718, and the European Union Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT Number 2015-002657-36, and it is completed.

Findings

Recruitment ceased early following the announcement of other trial results showing non-inferiority of tenecteplase versus alteplase. Between March 21, 2014, and Oct 20, 2023, 680 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to tenecteplase (n = 339) and alteplase (n = 341), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (multiple imputation was used to account for missing primary outcome data for five patients). Protocol violations occurred in 74 participants, thus the per-protocol population comprised 601 people (295 in the tenecteplase group and 306 in the alteplase group). Participants had a median age of 74 years (IQR 63–82), baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 7 (4–11), and 260 (38%) were female. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 191 (57%) of 335 participants allocated to tenecteplase and 188 (55%) of 340 participants allocated to alteplase (standardised risk difference [SRD] = 0.03 [95% CI -0.033 to 0.10], one-tailed p non-inferiority = 0.031). In the per-protocol analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 173 (59%) of 295 participants allocated to tenecteplase and 171 (56%) of 306 participants allocated to alteplase (SRD 0.05 [-0.02 to 0.12], one-tailed p non-inferiority = 0.01). Nine (3%) of 337 patients in the tenecteplase group and six (2%) of 340 in the alteplase group had symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (unadjusted risk difference = 0.01 [95% CI -0.01 to 0.03]) and 23 (7%) of 335 and 15 (4%) of 340 died within 90 days of starting treatment (SRD 0.02 [95% CI -0.02 to 0.05]).

Interpretation

The findings in our study provide further evidence to strengthen the assertion of the non-inferiority of tenecteplase to alteplase, specifically when perfusion imaging has been used to identify reperfusion-eligible stroke patients. Although non-inferiority was achieved in the per-protocol population, it was not reached in the intention-to-treat analysis, possibly due to sample size limtations. Nonetheless, large-scale implementation of perfusion CT to assist in patient selection for intravenous thrombolysis in the early time window was shown to be feasible.

### Emergency consent: patients' and surrogates' perspectives on consent for clinical trials in acute stroke and myocardial infarction [^111WKxd5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The overarching goals of informed consent for clinical research are to respect and protect participants, to inform them about key aspects of the study, and to provide them with an opportunity to participate or decline. 1 How to advance these goals in the context of medical emergencies such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke is unclear. In both situations, either a capacitated patient or surrogate is typically present. However, decisions about treatment and trial enrollment must be made rapidly, often in the context of acute symptoms and substantial stress. 2

Regulations in the United States and other countries permit clinical trials to be conducted under an exception from informed consent in certain emergency settings. 3, 4 Some trials in myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke have used these mechanisms. Examples include the HEAT‐PPCI (Unfractionated Heparin Versus Bivalirudin in Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial in ST‐elevation myocardial infarction and the FAST‐MAG (Field Administration of Stroke Therapy‐Magnesium) trial. 5, 6 Other studies, such as the TASTE‐MI (Thrombus Aspiration in ST‐Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial, have utilized a brief verbal consent process. 7 However, acute stroke and AMI trials, especially in the United States, have typically been conducted using standard informed consent processes, often including long forms containing all elements required by Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services regulations. 8, 9 These regulations require 6 basic elements and up to 9 additional elements. Determining the necessary detail is left to the discretion of institutional review boards (IRBs).

The appropriateness of standard consent in AMI and acute stroke trials is unclear. Limited available data suggest these patients and surrogates do often value being involved in trial enrollment decisions prospectively. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 However, they also suggest that patients and surrogates have a minimal understanding of the study at enrollment. The latter finding is not surprising given time constraints and frequent use of medications (eg, sedation for procedures) that could affect cognition or memory. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the quality of these patients' and surrogates' experiences with consent, particularly whether they feel respected and appropriately involved, and what information they find important at the time of the decision. Studying experiences of patients and surrogates in trials for acute stroke and AMI can promote development of approaches that simultaneously advance respect for persons, acknowledge the reality of emergency settings, and facilitate important trials. This interview study was designed to identify practical opportunities for improvement and alignment of these goals.

14.3 Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

THALES

The THALES study (NCT03354429) was a 11,016-patient, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of ticagrelor tablets 90 mg twice daily versus placebo in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of stroke and death up to 30 days. Ischemic stroke was assessed as one of the secondary endpoints.

Patients were eligible to participate if they were ≥ 40 years old, with non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 5) or high-risk TIA (defined as ABCD2score ≥ 6 or ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis ≥ 50% in the internal carotid or an intracranial artery). Patients who received thrombolysis or thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to randomization were not eligible.

Patients were randomized within 24 hours of onset of an acute ischemic stroke or TIA to receive 30 days of either ticagrelor tablets (90 mg twice daily, with an initial loading dose of 180 mg) or placebo, on a background of aspirin initially 300–325 mg then 75–100 mg daily. The median treatment duration was 31 days.

Ticagrelor tablets were superior to placebo in reducing the rate of the primary endpoint (composite of stroke and death), corresponding to a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 17% and an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.1% (Table 10). The effect was driven primarily by a significant reduction in the stroke component of the primary endpoint (19% RRR, 1.1% ARR).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of RADICAVA ORS is based on a bioavailability study comparing RADICAVA and RADICAVA ORS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The efficacy of RADICAVA for the treatment of ALS was established in a 6-month, randomized, placebo- controlled, double-blind study conducted in Japanese patients with ALS who were living independently and met the following criteria at screening:

Functionality retained most activities of daily living (defined as scores of 2 points or better on each individual item of the ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised [ALSFRS-R; described below])
Normal respiratory function (defined as percent-predicted forced vital capacity values of [%FVC] ≥ 80%)
Definite or Probable ALS based on El Escorial revised criteria
Disease duration of 2 years or less

The study enrolled 69 patients in the RADICAVA arm and 68 in the placebo arm. Baseline characteristics were similar between these groups, with over 90% of patients in each group being treated with riluzole.

RADICAVA was administered as an intravenous infusion of 60 mg given over a 60-minute period according to the following schedule:

An initial treatment cycle with daily dosing for 14 days, followed by a 14-day drug-free period (Cycle 1)
Subsequent treatment cycles with daily dosing for 10 days out of 14-day periods, followed by 14-day drug-free periods (Cycles 2–6).

The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison of the change between treatment arms in the ALSFRS-R total scores from baseline to Week 24. The ALSFRS-R scale consists of 12 questions that evaluate the fine motor, gross motor, bulbar, and respiratory function of patients with ALS (speech, salivation, swallowing, handwriting, cutting food, dressing/hygiene, turning in bed, walking, climbing stairs, dyspnea, orthopnea, and respiratory insufficiency). Each item is scored from 0–4, with higher scores representing greater functional ability. The decline in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline was significantly less in the RADICAVA-treated patients as compared to placebo (see Table 3). The distribution of change in ALSFRS-R scores from baseline to Week 24 by percent of patients is shown in Figure 1.

To determine the safety and efficacy of citicoline treatment in acute stroke patients.

Method

An 118-center, randomized, double-blind, efficacy trial in 899 patients compared placebo (n = 446) with citicoline (n = 453) (1000 mg PO twice a day) for 6 weeks, with a 6-week post-treatment follow-up period. Patients with acute (≤ 24 hours) ischemic strokes clinically thought to be in the middle cerebral artery territory with NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores ≥ 8 were enrolled.

Results

Mean time to treatment was 13 hours for both groups and mean age was 67 years for those receiving placebo and 68 years for those receiving citicoline. Mean baseline NIHSS scores were 14.5 for placebo and 13.9 for citicoline (p = 0.06); medians were 14 for placebo and 13 for citicoline (p = 0.04). The incidence and type of side effects were similar between the groups. There were no between-group differences on the planned primary analysis, percent of patients with a ≥ 7-point NIHSS score change at 90 days (placebo 51%, citicoline 52%). There were no between-group differences on the other planned secondary analyses at 90 days, including mortality. However, post hoc analyses using standard "excellent recovery" measures suggested a possible treatment effect on the modified Rankin 0 or 1 (last observation carried forward: placebo 20%, citicoline 26%; p = 0.025) as well as a global outcome statistic.

Conclusions

Citicoline was safe but ineffective in improving the outcome of patients with acute ischemic stroke as measured by the planned analyses. Post hoc analyses suggest that a modest treatment effect may have been seen if more traditional analyses had been used.

### Antiplatelet therapy in acute mild-moderate ischemic stroke (ATAMIS): a parallel, randomised, open-label, multicentre, prospective study [^113XPREc]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

As a prospective trial, loss to follow-up bias in this study is inevitable. Despite this limitation, the randomised, multicentre and prospective design of the study has great methodological superiority. For randomisation and multicentre studies, confounding bias and selection bias will be well controlled. For the safety of participants, treatment allocation will be open-label. Once unexpected situation occurs, it can be controlled in time. The scientific calculation of the sample size can guarantee the strong statistical power. Since the statistical method of the study is scientific and advanced, the results will be statistically reliable. In addition, the primary and second endpoints of the study can comprehensively reflect the efficacy and safety of the two therapies. For this reason, the results of the trial will provide significant guidance for clinical practice.

In conclusion, the trial will be conducted under a rational design. Whether the result of the trial is positive or negative, it will provide valuable evidence on the appropriate treatment for this population.

### Effect of edaravone on neurological symptoms in real-world patients with acute ischemic stroke [^116RnT6u]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- In Japan, nearly half of ischemic stroke patients receive edaravone for acute treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of edaravone on neurological symptoms in patients with ischemic stroke stratified by stroke subtype. Methods- Study subjects were 61048 patients aged 18 years or older who were hospitalized ≤ 14 days after onset of an acute ischemic stroke and were registered in the Japan Stroke Data Bank, a hospital-based multicenter stroke registration database, between June 2001 and July 2013. Patients were stratified according to ischemic stroke subtype (large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-vessel occlusion, and cryptogenic/undetermined) and then divided into 2 groups (edaravone-treated and no edaravone). Neurological symptoms were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The primary outcome was changed in neurological symptoms during the hospital stay (ΔNIHSS = NIHSS score at discharge-NIHSS score at admission). Data were analyzed using multivariate linear regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting after adjusting for the following confounding factors: age, gender, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the start of treatment, NIHSS score at admission, time from stroke onset to hospital admission, infarct size, comorbidities, concomitant medication, clinical department, history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and history of stroke. Results- After adjusting for potential confounders, the improvement in NIHSS score from admission to discharge was greater in the edaravone-treated group than in the no edaravone group for all ischemic stroke subtypes (mean [95% CI] difference in ΔNIHSS: -0.46 [-0.75 to -0.16] for large-artery atherosclerosis, -0.64 [-1.09 to -0.2] for cardioembolism, and -0.25 [-0.4 to -0.09] for small-vessel occlusion). Conclusions- For any ischemic stroke subtype, edaravone use (compared with no use) was associated with a greater improvement in neurological symptoms, although the difference was small (< 1 point NIHSS) and of limited clinical significance.

### Effects of smoking on outcomes after acute atherothrombotic stroke in Japanese men [^116g5w6S]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of smoking on clinical outcomes following acute stroke remain controversial.

Methods

We evaluated the influence of smoking on 90-day outcomes after acute atherothrombotic stroke in 292 Japanese men extracted from the database of the Edaravone and Argatroban Stroke Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke randomized parallel-group trial that tested the safety and efficacy of edaravone and argatroban therapy in 814 patients in 2004–2008. Smokers were matched with non-smokers of the same age for identical age distribution in the smoker and non-smoker groups. Poor 90-day outcomes (defined as death, Barthel index < 60, or modified Rankin score > 3) were evaluated using a logistic regression model. Significant variables (P < 0.05) in univariate analysis were further evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis using a forward-selection method.

Results

Body temperature, age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at admission, systolic blood pressure, and smoking status were selected in the final model. Smokers had significantly increased odds of poor 90-day functional outcomes independent of other statistically significant predictor variables (adjusted odds ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–4.55; P = 0.019).

Conclusions

In Japanese men, smoking leads to poor functional outcomes at 3 months after acute atherothrombotic stroke.

### Allogeneic stem cell therapy for acute ischemic stroke: the phase 2 / 3 TREASURE randomized clinical trial [^116p7B7r]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is intravenous allogeneic multipotent adult progenitor cell (MultiStem) therapy safe and effective for patients with acute ischemic stroke?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial with 206 participants, intravenous administration of MultiStem therapy within 18 to 36 hours of ischemic stroke onset was safe but did not improve short-term outcomes at 90 days compared with placebo. There were no grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions, including in older patients.

Meaning

The results of this study support the safety of MultiStem, but further research is needed to determine whether MultiStem therapy for ischemic stroke has a beneficial effect in patients who meet specific criteria.

### Effects of edaravone on early outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [^113EngyC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We investigated whether edaravone could improve early outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. We identified patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke from 1 July 2010 to 31 March 2012 and treated with rtPA on the same day of stroke onset or the following day. Thereafter, we selected those who received edaravone on the same day of rtPA administration (edaravone group), and those who received rtPA without edaravone (control group). The primary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at discharge. One-to-one propensity-score matching was performed between the edaravone and control groups. An ordinal logistic regression analysis for mRS scores at discharge was performed with adjustment for possible variables as well as clustering of patients within hospitals using a generalized estimating equation.

Results

We identified 6336 eligible patients for inclusion in the edaravone group (n = 5979; 94%) and the control group (n = 357; 6%) as the total population. In 356 pairs of the propensity-matched population, the ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that edaravone was significantly associated with lower mRS scores of patients at discharge (adjusted odds ratio: 0.74; 95% confidence interval: 0.57–0.96).

Conclusions

Edaravone may improve early outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with rtPA.

### Clinical policy: use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator for the management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department [^113gaDEJ]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

NINDS rt-PA Stroke Study Group — acute ischemic stroke randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 0.9 mg/kg found Part I showed no difference between tPA and placebo (46.5% vs 38.8%, P = 0.21) and Part II showed an odds ratio for good global outcome 1.7 (1.2–2.6, P = 0.008); analysis of part I data confirmed the part II finding that tPA confers an increased odds of good outcome, essentially meaning no stroke-related disability at 90 days (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.2, P = 0.001), with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage 6.3% in tPA vs 0.6% in placebo (P < .001) and mortality 17.3% in tPA vs 20.5% in placebo (P = 0.30), with sample sizes N = 291 for part I and N = 333 for part II.

### Additional outcomes and subgroup analyses of NXY-059 for acute ischemic stroke in the SAINT I trial [^111r6Wup]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

NXY-059 is a free radical-trapping neuroprotectant demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic stroke. We conducted analyses on additional end points and sensitivity analyses to confirm our findings.

Methods

We randomized 1722 patients with acute ischemic stroke to a 72-hour infusion of placebo or intravenous NXY-059 within 6 hours of stroke onset. The primary outcome was disability at 90 days, as measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (no residual symptoms) to 5 (bed-bound, requiring constant care). Additional and exploratory analyses included mRS at 7 and 30 days; subgroup interactions with final mRS; assessments of activities of daily living by Barthel index; and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) neurological scores at 7 and 90 days.

Results

NXY-059 significantly improved the distribution of the mRS disability score compared with placebo at 7, 30, and 90 days (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test P = 0.002, 0.004, 0.038, respectively; 90-day common odds ratio 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.42). The benefit was not attributable to any specific baseline characteristic, stratification variable or subgroup interaction. Neurological scores were improved at 7 days (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13, 1.89; P = 0.003) and the Barthel index was improved at 7 and 30 days (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.22, 1.98; P < 0.0001; OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.59; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

NXY-059 within 6 hours of acute ischemic stroke significantly reduced disability. Benefit on neurological scores and activities of daily living was detectable early but not significant at 90 days; however, our trial was underpowered to measure effects on the neurological examination. The benefit on disability is not confounded by interactions and is supported by other outcome measures.

### Clinical policy: use of intravenous tPA for the management of acute ischemic stroke in the emergency department [^11282yVC]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

NINDS rt-PA Stroke Study Group — intravenous tPA was tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with N = 291 for part I and N = 333 for part II; primary endpoints were NIHSS decrease ≥ 4 or resolution by 24 h and a global outcome measure at 90 days. Part I showed no difference between tPA and placebo (46.5% vs 38.8%, P = 0.21), whereas part II reported an OR for good global outcome 1.7 (1.2–2.6, P = 0.008), with similar OR when parts I and II were analyzed together (P < .01 for time strata 0–90 and 90–180). Analysis of part I data confirmed increased odds of good outcome at 90 days (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3–3.2, P = 0.001); combining parts I and II, SICH was 6.3% in tPA vs 0.6% in placebo (P < .001), and mortality was 17.3% in tPA vs 20.5% in placebo (P = 0.30).
