## Question

Bicarb for metabolic acidosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to use sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of acidosis. Then, I should verify the etiology because bicarbonate is not etiologic therapy. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications and contraindications. After that, I need to check dosing, administration, and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations and summarize a practical decision framework with caveats and safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity, because the threshold for bicarbonate use depends on both the degree of acidemia and the underlying cause. I should double-check that pH less than about 7.20 is where most ICU guidelines begin to consider bicarbonate, while pH greater than 7.15–7.20 generally does not warrant bicarbonate for hemodynamic purposes in septic shock, and in CKD the treatment threshold is typically bicarbonate less than 18–22 mmol/L rather than pH alone [^114V1MMK] [^1147SnGX] [^111MEz24].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to identify the etiology because bicarbonate treats the numbers, not the cause, and using it indiscriminately can worsen outcomes in some scenarios. In septic shock with lactic acidosis, guidelines suggest against bicarbonate to improve hemodynamics when pH is at least 7.15, whereas in severe metabolic acidemia with AKI there is a weak suggestion to use bicarbonate; in DKA, insulin and fluids are primary and bicarbonate is reserved for extreme cases; in CKD, oral bicarbonate is used to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range; in toxicologic acidoses, bicarbonate is often indicated for sodium channel blockade and urine alkalinization; in cardiac arrest, bicarbonate is not routine but may be used for specific indications like hyperkalemia or prolonged arrest with refractory acidosis [^114V1MMK] [^117Cxxn6] [^112wKKwe] [^111MEz24] [^117A5Go3] [^116vK6Za] [^111rzN7v] [^112x1YkF].

> Wait, let me verify the key RCT signal that often drives ICU decisions. The BICAR-ICU trial in severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20) showed no overall mortality benefit but a significant mortality reduction in the AKI subgroup, which is why guidelines issued a weak recommendation for bicarbonate in severe acidemia with AKI, even though overall quality of evidence is low and adverse effects like hypernatremia and hypocalcemia were more frequent with bicarbonate [^1137VtWp] [^114V1MMK] [^117Cxxn6].

> I should confirm absolute and relative contraindications before ordering bicarbonate. It is contraindicated in patients losing chloride (e.g., vomiting, NG suction) or on thiazide/loop diuretics predisposing to hypochloremic alkalosis, and it should be used cautiously or avoided in mixed respiratory acidosis where CO2 retention could worsen, in severe hypernatremia, and in situations where rapid CO2 generation could precipitate paradoxical intracellular acidosis. I need to ensure I'm not masking a respiratory acidosis that requires ventilatory support rather than alkali [^112iWVHo] [^114ZFUvR] [^113ZhNdo].

> Next, I should review dosing and administration. For less urgent metabolic acidosis, typical adult dosing is about 2–5 mEq/kg IV over 4–8 hours, titrated to clinical response and serial gases, with a general rule to avoid full correction in the first 24 hours to prevent overshoot alkalosis. In cardiac arrest, rapid boluses of 1–2 ampules (about 44.6–100 mEq) may be repeated every 5–10 minutes while monitoring pH. In infants, use the 4.2% solution and do not exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. I should double-check that I'm using the correct concentration and accounting for the hypertonic sodium load [^114aKtKH] [^113dN2gZ] [^113fiutU] [^114ZFUvR].

> I need to ensure meticulous monitoring is in place. That means frequent ABGs, electrolytes including ionized calcium, lactate, hemodynamics, and fluid balance, because bicarbonate can cause hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and overshoot metabolic alkalosis. If alkalosis occurs, I should stop bicarbonate and treat complications such as hypokalemia and hypocalcemia as indicated, and I should remember that overcorrection can worsen neurologic status in some contexts [^113dN2gZ] [^112h2q1a] [^115KJV6y] [^112HBJaZ].

> Let me consider special populations. In pediatrics, routine bicarbonate during cardiac arrest is not recommended, but it may be considered for specific indications like hyperkalemia, sodium channel blocker toxicity, or persistent severe acidosis despite adequate ventilation. In neonates, I should prefer the 4.2% solution and slower administration to mitigate hypernatremia and intracranial risks. In pregnancy, management is generally the same with maternal-fetal monitoring. In CKD, oral bicarbonate is preferred chronically to maintain serum bicarbonate around 22–26 mmol/L, with attention to sodium load and blood pressure [^111rzN7v] [^112x1YkF] [^111Nk6o2] [^114ZFUvR] [^111MEz24] [^1147SnGX].

> But wait, what if the patient has a toxicologic etiology? I should verify that sodium bicarbonate is strongly recommended for sodium channel blocker toxicities such as tricyclics and for cocaine-related QRS widening, both to improve conduction and contractility and to mitigate acidosis, and I should remember that alkalinization is also used for salicylate and methanol poisonings to favor distribution and metabolism, often alongside specific antidotes and supportive care [^117A5Go3] [^116vK6Za] [^112wKKwe].

> I will now examine the practical decision framework to ensure nothing is missed. First, confirm severity and etiology. Second, treat the underlying cause aggressively. Third, reserve IV bicarbonate for severe acidemia with AKI, select toxicologic indications, or refractory cardiac arrest physiology. Fourth, avoid bicarbonate when pH is above about 7.20 without compelling indication, in mixed respiratory acidosis, or with contraindications. Fifth, dose conservatively and monitor closely. Finally, reassess frequently and stop once the indication resolves or adverse effects emerge [^114V1MMK] [^112wKKwe] [^1137VtWp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overstated that bicarbonate improves hemodynamics in septic shock. I should correct that: guidelines suggest against using bicarbonate to improve hemodynamics or reduce vasopressor needs in hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia when pH is at least 7.15, so any hemodynamic benefit is unproven in that context and fluids, vasopressors, and source control remain the priorities [^114V1MMK] [^117Cxxn6].

> In summary, I need to ensure that bicarbonate is a targeted bridge therapy rather than routine care. It may help in severe metabolic acidemia with AKI, in specific toxicologic poisonings, and in select cardiac arrest scenarios, but it carries risks of hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and overshoot alkalosis, and it never replaces definitive management of the cause. Continuous monitoring and stepwise dosing with explicit stop criteria are essential to safe use [^1137VtWp] [^114V1MMK] [^113dN2gZ].

Sodium bicarbonate is indicated for **severe metabolic acidosis** (pH ≤ 7.20) [^114V1MMK] — especially with AKI [^1137VtWp] — and for specific toxicologic emergencies (e.g. tricyclic overdose, sodium channel blockade) [^117A5Go3]. It is **not recommended for mild acidosis** (pH > 7.20) or lactic acidosis without AKI because it does not improve hemodynamics and may cause harm [^114V1MMK]. Use 50–100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate IV bolus or 2–5 mEq/kg over 4–8 hours, with close monitoring of ABG, electrolytes, and volume status; avoid rapid correction and use caution in hypernatremia, hypokalemia, or heart failure [^114aKtKH] [^113dN2gZ].

## Indications for sodium bicarbonate therapy

Sodium bicarbonate therapy is indicated in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Severe metabolic acidosis**: pH ≤ 7.20, particularly with acute kidney injury (AKI) [^114V1MMK] [^1137VtWp].
- **Specific toxicologic emergencies**: Tricyclic antidepressant overdose, sodium channel blocker toxicity, and other drug intoxications requiring urine alkalinization [^112x1YkF] [^112wKKwe].
- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Persistent metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/L) to slow CKD progression [^111MEz24] [^112NEDx1].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Sodium bicarbonate therapy should be avoided or used with caution in the following scenarios:

- **Mild metabolic acidosis**: pH > 7.20 without significant symptoms or organ dysfunction [^notfound].
- **Lactic acidosis without AKI**: No improvement in hemodynamics or vasopressor requirements [^114V1MMK].
- **Hypernatremia or fluid overload**: Risk of exacerbating sodium and fluid retention [^114aKtKH].
- **Hypokalemia**: Potential to worsen potassium shifts and cardiac function [^116vK6Za].
- **Heart failure or renal impairment**: Increased risk of fluid overload and electrolyte disturbances [^1147SnGX].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Several **clinical guidelines** provide recommendations on sodium bicarbonate therapy:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Severe metabolic acidosis (pH ≤ 7.20) with AKI | Consider sodium bicarbonate therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence) [^114V1MMK] |
| Lactic acidosis without AKI | Do not use sodium bicarbonate therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence) [^114V1MMK] |
| Chronic kidney disease with metabolic acidosis | Use sodium bicarbonate supplementation to maintain serum bicarbonate within normal range (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) [^notfound] |
| Toxicologic emergencies (e.g. tricyclic overdose) | Administer sodium bicarbonate to improve conduction block and contractility (strong recommendation, high certainty) [^117A5Go3] |

---

## Dosage and administration

The **dosage and administration** of sodium bicarbonate vary by clinical scenario:

- **Severe metabolic acidosis**: 50–100 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution (25–50 mEq) IV bolus, followed by additional doses as needed based on arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis [^notfound].
- **Less urgent cases**: 2–5 mEq/kg body weight over 4–8 hours, titrated based on ABG results and clinical response [^113dN2gZ].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation (typically 0.5–1.8 g/day) to maintain serum bicarbonate within the normal range (22–26 mmol/L) [^111MEz24].

---

## Monitoring and potential complications

During sodium bicarbonate therapy, **close monitoring** is essential to detect and manage potential complications:

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia [^1137VtWp].
- **Fluid overload**: Particularly in patients with heart failure or renal impairment [^notfound].
- **Paradoxical intracellular acidosis**: Risk of worsening cellular acidosis if administered too rapidly [^notfound].
- **Respiratory compensation**: Risk of metabolic alkalosis if ventilation is not adequately managed [^113fiutU].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

The **effectiveness** of sodium bicarbonate therapy varies by clinical scenario:

- **Severe metabolic acidosis with AKI**: May reduce mortality and improve renal function, although evidence is limited and mixed [^1137VtWp].
- **Lactic acidosis without AKI**: No improvement in hemodynamics or clinical outcomes [^114V1MMK].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Slows progression of CKD and improves nutritional parameters [^112NEDx1] [^116LPZ8G].

---

## Alternative therapies

Alternative therapies for metabolic acidosis include:

- **Treat underlying cause**: Address the underlying cause of acidosis (e.g. sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure) [^115Tcgqg].
- **Supportive care**: Provide oxygen, fluids, and electrolyte management [^113d9FF3].
- **Dialysis**: Consider renal replacement therapy for severe acidosis refractory to medical management [^111GqmEA].

---

Sodium bicarbonate is indicated for **severe metabolic acidosis** (pH ≤ 7.20), particularly with AKI, and for specific toxicologic emergencies. It is not recommended for mild acidosis or lactic acidosis without AKI due to lack of benefit and potential harm. Close monitoring and cautious administration are essential to minimize complications.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis – e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2content is crucial – e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, calcium chloride (Lactated ringers) [^111a3Mde]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS:

Although Lactated Ringer's Injection has a potassium concentration similar to the concentration in plasma, it is insufficient to produce a useful effect in case of severe potassium deficiency; therefore, it should not be used for this purpose.

Lactated Ringer's Injection is not for use for the treatment of lactic acidosis or severe metabolic acidosis.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should not be administered simultaneously with citrate anticoagulated/preserved blood through the same administration set because of the likelihood of coagulation.

The infusion must be stopped immediately if any signs or symptoms of a suspected hypersensitivity reaction develop. Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated. Hypersensitivity reactions are reported more frequently during pregnancy.

Depending on the volume and the rate of infusion, the intravenous administration of Lactated Ringer's Injection can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states, pulmonary edema or acid-base imbalance. The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections.

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations may be necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient or the rate of administration warrants such evaluation.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with hyperkalemia or conditions predisposing to hyperkalemia (such as severe renal impairment or adrenocortical insufficiency, acute dehydration, or extensive tissue injury or burns) and in patients with cardiac disease.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with alkalosis or at risk for alkalosis. Because lactate is metabolized to bicarbonate, administration may result in, or worsen, metabolic alkalosis.

Lactated Ringer's Injection should be administered with particular caution, if at all, to patients with severe renal impairment, hypervolemia, overhydration, or conditions that may cause sodium and/or potassium retention, fluid overload, or edema.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — transient/reversible causes and initial management — states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms. Negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin can decrease the sinus rate, and sodium-channel and potassium-channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs can exacerbate bradycardia in preexisting SND; hypothyroidism can cause clinically significant bradycardia and such cardiovascular abnormalities respond well to replacement therapy with thyroxine (T4), and metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia can uncommonly cause sinus bradycardia in acute settings.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^112iWVHo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate therapy increases plasma bicarbonate, buffers excess hydrogen ion concentration, raises blood pH and reverses the clinical manifestations of acidosis.

Sodium bicarbonate in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Bicarbonate (HCO3-) is a normal constituent of body fluids and the normal plasma level ranges from 24 to 31 mEq/liter. Plasma concentration is regulated by the kidney through acidification of the urine when there is a deficit or by alkalinization of the urine when there is an excess. Bicarbonate anion is considered "labile" since at a proper concentration of hydrogen ion (H+) it may be converted to carbonic acid (H2CO3) and thence to its volatile form, carbon dioxide (CO2) excreted by the lung. Normally a ratio of 1 :20 (carbonic acid: bicarbonate) is present in the extracellular fluid. In a healthy adult with normal kidney function, practically all the glomerular filtered bicarbonate ion is reabsorbed; less than 1% is excreted in the urine.

### Topiramate [^115YfctW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

Topiramate can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by topiramate. Topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with topiramate in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to < 2% for placebo.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^114ZFUvR]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Dosage and Administration

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In infants (up to two years of age), the 4.2% solution is recommended for intravenous administration at a dose not to exceed 8 mEq/kg/day. Slow administration rates and the 4.2% solution are recommended in neonates, to guard against the possibility of producing hypernatremia, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid pressure and inducing intracranial hemorrhage.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight — depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2 content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) — metabolic abnormalities and mitochondrial evaluation: During vomiting episodes, mild mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested by anion gap metabolic acidosis that "is often 15–20 mg/dL", lactic acidosis, urinary ketosis early in the episode, and/or hypoglycemia, and these findings "by themselves do not necessitate a comprehensive metabolic workup". When present, early testing with quantitative urine organic acids and plasma amino acids "can confirm mild mitochondrial dysfunction" by elevated urine ketones, Krebs cycle intermediates, and/or dicarboxylic acids, while "urine organic acids are typically normal" when asymptomatic or after several hours of intravenous dextrose. In some cases, episodes may reflect mitochondrial disease with severe anion gap metabolic acidosis " > 20 mg/dL", insulin resistance, and/or multisystem failure such as cardiomyopathy or seizures.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

Insights and implications — confounders in predicting good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest: The Red Cross guidelines for predicting good neurological outcome are informed by the ILCOR systematic review and treatment recommendations. While assessment of the Glasgow Coma Scale motor score may be useful for recognizing comatose patients who should undergo functional and structural testing for prognostication, it is important to consider that the use of sedatives, such as midazolam and analgesics, may confound the assessment. Other confounders may include electrolyte abnormalities, encephalopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, multiorgan failure, unrecognized seizures and traumatic brain injury. Prognostication requires both functional (i.e., neurological examination) and structural test information considered over time and with consideration of confounders.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Indications for cardiac transplantation — absolute, relative, and insufficient categories are outlined as follows: For hemodynamic compromise due to heart failure (HF), absolute indications include refractory cardiogenic shock, documented dependence on intravenous (IV) inotropic support to maintain adequate organ perfusion, and peak VO2 less than 10 mL per kg per min with achievement of anaerobic metabolism; additional absolute indications are severe symptoms of ischemia that consistently limit routine activity and are not amenable to coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, and recurrent symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias refractory to all therapeutic modalities; relative indications include peak VO2, 11 to 14 mL per kg per min (or 55% predicted) and major limitation of the patient's daily activities, recurrent unstable ischemia not amenable to other intervention, and recurrent instability of fluid balance/renal function not due to patient noncompliance with medical regimen; insufficient indications are low left ventricular ejection fraction, a history of functional class III or IV symptoms of HF, and peak VO2, greater than 15 mL per kg per min (and greater than 55% predicted) without other indications.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^117AUKcT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute issues — acidosis in stimulant intoxication: Acidosis is typically due to excessive movement or muscle activity, drug-specific effects such as temperature elevation, and seizures, and control of agitation, seizures, and neuromuscular hyperactivity is critical; the CGC did not propose any clinical recommendations specific to stimulant intoxication or withdrawal and notes that treating agitation will help address acidosis. Significant acidosis — associated with persistent chemistry abnormalities, persistent neuromuscular agitation, temperature elevation, and/or long duration of intoxication — should be managed in acute care settings according to best practices; GABAergic medications are first-line agents, IV fluids and cooling can help after attenuation of neuromuscular excitation, temperature should be closely monitored, and in severe acidosis with other complications more acute measures such as cardiac and electrolyte monitoring and administration of sodium bicarbonate may be indicated.

Children and adolescents — initial pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes: In individuals with incidentally diagnosed or metabolically stable diabetes (A1C < 8.5% [< 69 mmol/mol] and asymptomatic), metformin is the initial pharmacologic treatment of choice if kidney function is normal (A). Youth with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL [≥ 13.9 mmol/L] A1C ≥ 8.5% [≥ 69 mmol/mol]) without acidosis at diagnosis who are symptomatic with polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and/or weight loss should be treated initially with long-acting insulin while metformin is initiated and titrated (B). Initiate subcutaneous or intravenous insulin treatment in individuals with ketoacidosis to rapidly correct the hyperglycemia and the metabolic derangement, and once acidosis is resolved, metformin should be initiated while subcutaneous insulin therapy is continued (A). In individuals presenting with severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose ≥ 600 mg/dL [≥ 33.3 mmol/L]), consider assessment for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (A).

Metabolic acidosis in CKD — practice points, treatment thresholds, and dietary guidance are as follows: Practice Point 3.10.1 states to consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Practice Point 3.10.2 advises monitoring to ensure therapy does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status. The KDOQI Work Group agrees that acidosis in adults should only be treated with pharmacologic agents when bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l or if there is a clear indication to do so, and notes a large clinical trial of veverimer did not demonstrate a decline in a composite CKD progression outcome. Pediatric clinicians may choose to treat milder acidosis more aggressively to help optimize growth and bone health. Nutrition guidance supports prevention and treatment via increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables, including the statement: In adults with CKD 1–4, we suggest reducing net endogenous acid production through increased dietary intake of fruits and vegetables (2C) to reduce the rate of decline of residual kidney function.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^111Dg1Lg]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Indications & Usage

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of blood pigments. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate.

Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis ― e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total CO2 content is crucial ― e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

Use caution with history of coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, including family history of arrhythmia, stroke, congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension and with agitated state, like mania. High blood pressure warrants obtain cardiac echo to assess for baseline end-organ damage and ensure adequate control of blood pressure before starting phentermine, and congenital heart disease warrants obtain cardiology consultation before starting phentermine. Concomitant use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors with topiramate may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis, and use of SSRIs and SNRIs may increase risk of serotonin syndrome. Use of insulin — with weight loss, dose of insulin may need to be decreased to avoid hypoglycemia, and caution is noted for renal impairment, metabolic acidosis, history of kidney stones, and depression or suicidal ideation; for patients at high risk for pregnancy, do not start Phentermine/Topiramate ER.

Cardiac transplantation — indications and peak VO2 thresholds are delineated as absolute, relative, and insufficient. For hemodynamic compromise due to heart failure (HF), absolute indications include refractory cardiogenic shock, documented dependence on intravenous (IV) inotropic support to maintain adequate organ perfusion, and peak VO2 less than 10 mL per kg per min with achievement of anaerobic metabolism; additional absolute indications include severe symptoms of ischemia that consistently limit routine activity and are not amenable to coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention and recurrent symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias refractory to all therapeutic modalities. Relative indications include peak VO2, 10 to 14 mL per kg per min (or 55% of predicted) and major limitation of the patient's daily activities, recurrent unstable ischemia not amenable to other intervention, and recurrent instability of fluid balance/renal function not due to patient noncompliance with medical regimen. Insufficient indications include low left ventricular ejection fraction, history of functional class III or IV symptoms of HF, and peak VO2, greater than 15 mL per kg per min (and greater than 55% of predicted) without other indications.

Cardiac arrest pharmacology and wide QRS complex tachycardia — High-dose epinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg IV, as opposed to a standard dose of 1 mg) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest unresponsive to defibrillation improved survival to hospital admission but showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival, and the administration of vasopressin is no longer recommended. Intravenous magnesium showed no benefit for refractory ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest; in out-of-hospital arrest, administration of 2 to 4 g magnesium intravenously did not improve survival to hospital admission, and in inpatient arrest it did not improve return of spontaneous circulation, survival to 24 hours, or survival to hospital discharge, with exceptions such as marked hypokalemia or medication-induced torsades de pointes in which intravenous magnesium is warranted. Post–myocardial infarction prophylactic antiarrhythmic use found routine lidocaine and procainamide associated with increased mortality and beta blockers associated with a significantly lower mortality rate; a subsequent randomized controlled trial involving 1073 patients showed high-dose amiodarone led to a higher mortality rate, while a moderate dose was not superior to placebo. For a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia, patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia and known structural heart disease should be presumed to have ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise, and administration of a calcium channel blocker such as verapamil to a patient with VT may result in severe hypotension or syncope, with the exception of verapamil-sensitive VT that occurs in a structurally normal heart, which is often difficult to recognize on initial presentation.

QRS widening — cocaine intoxication management in acute care: QRS widening associated with severe cocaine intoxication should be treated in an acute care setting, and if QRS widening or impaired cardiac contractility are identified, 2 ampoules of sodium bicarbonate should be administered in a bolus to improve the conduction block and contractility; if sodium bicarbonate is unavailable, 3% hypertonic saline can be used (200 mL = 2 ampoules of sodium bicarbonate) for the conduction block. If not responsive to sodium bicarbonate or 3% hypertonic saline, or if the patient is in cardiac arrest and not responding to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), a 20% lipid emulsion concentration (ie, Intralipid in a 1 mL/kg bolus [100 mL in an adult]) can be considered for patients with cocaine intoxication or overdose, and this should only be administered in acute care settings. Sodium bicarbonate treatment can exacerbate the risk for QT prolongation, if present, by lowering serum potassium concentrations, and during sodium bicarbonate shortages 3% hypertonic saline has been used as a sodium replacement, but it does not correct metabolic acidosis. The guideline further states that clinicians should administer sodium bicarbonate to improve the conduction block and contractility; this will also improve metabolic acidosis if present (High certainty, Strong Recommendation).

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^113dN2gZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP may be added to other intravenous fluids, The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight- hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight - depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

Cerebral edema — hypertonic sodium solution (HTS) adverse effects and monitoring: Retrospective cohorts report renal and electrolyte risks, including that both increase in mean serum chloride level (OR 7.39 per 10 mEq/L increase) and use of HTS (OR 2.074) were found to be independently associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), and in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients those who received continuous infusion 3% NaCl and developed hyperchloremia (Cl > 115 mEq/L) had significantly higher rates of AKI, with hyperchloremia and AKI more observed to be more frequent in the continuous infusion cohort. Regarding acid–base balance, a sodium acetate and NaCl mix (to equal a 2 to 3% solution) demonstrated no difference in the rate of metabolic acidosis, and neither the dose nor the use of 23.5% NaCl to achieve 145–155 mEq/L in severe ICH were associated with differences in acid–base balance. The document notes that though the quality of the evidence is low, it suggests that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia from HTS are associated with AKI; clinicians should be mindful of the potential for hyperchloremia to induce metabolic acidosis, and clinicians should monitor renal function, electrolytes, and acid–base balance closely when using HTS.

Implications within US health care for contrast-enhanced imaging and contrast-induced AKI are as follows: all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging procedures should be evaluated for risk of AKI, and screening can most appropriately be performed using standardized questionnaires; routine measurement of serum creatinine (SCr) in all patients undergoing contrast-enhanced imaging is not recommended; the risks and benefits of contrast administration need to be carefully evaluated in patients at high risk of contrast-induced AKI, and the risk of contrast-induced AKI should not preclude the performance of needed diagnostic imaging and therapeutic procedures; iso-osmolar or selected low-osmolar contrast in the lowest possible dose should be used in high-risk patients; the only intervention consistently demonstrated to decrease risk is periprocedural intravenous volume administration using isotonic crystalloid, thus all patients at increased risk should receive periprocedural intravenous isotonic crystalloid, although the optimal rate of fluid administration is uncertain and whether bicarbonate is superior to saline remains unresolved; the benefit associated with NAC remains uncertain, and given its minimal risk and cost, we do not recommend against its use, although it should not be used in lieu of more effective interventions, particularly periprocedural administration of isotonic crystalloid.

In the AKI subgroup (AKIN stage 2 or 3 at randomization; 182/389 [47%]), mortality was lower with bicarbonate versus control (42/92 [46%] vs 57/90 [63%]; absolute risk reduction −17% [−33.0 to −2.3]; p = 0.016), with significant heterogeneity versus AKIN 0–1 (p = 0.023). Sepsis was present in 61% (238/389) and no differential effect was observed by sepsis status.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^116LPZ8G]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) metabolic acidosis — In dialysis, the oral bicarbonate group had higher overall SGA scores starting at 24 weeks (p-value < 0.0003). In CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, the oral sodium bicarbonate group had significant lower nPNA (nPCR) at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05) and significant higher serum albumin at 12 and 24 months (p < 0.05). In a group of CKD 5 hemodialysis patients, there was no significant difference in serum albumin among time points (p > 0.05), whereas in CKD 5 hemodialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased serum albumin level (p = 0.01). It should also be noted that high dialysate bicarbonate concentrations are associated with increased mortality in observational studies. Among CKD 4–5 pre-dialysis, oral sodium bicarbonate increased both serum albumin and prealbumin levels between before and after intervention (p < 0.05). Among CKD 1–2 compared to control and HCO3, the fruit and vegetable group had significantly greater decrease in body weight at the end of the intervention for both individuals with CKD 1–2 (p < 0.05 for both), with no difference between HCO3 and control. Thus there does not appear to be a significant effect of reduction in NEAP on nutritional status in patients with CKD 1–2. In CKD 4 compared to CKD 3, the FV group had lower weight at 1-year follow up (p < 0.01), and baseline weight did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.24). In CKD 3, fruits and vegetables had greater net body weight loss than both HCO3 and control (p < 0.05), and the control group had greater net body weight loss than the HCO3 group (p < 0.05). The evidence supporting the recommendations on dietary management of NEAP with fruits and vegetables and bicarbonate supplementation is based on Grade III /Grade C evidence, and the recommendation regarding bicarbonate maintenance based on Consensus/expert opinion.

### The cardiovascular response of the acidotic newborn to sodium bicarbonate… [^116XCCgx]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The neonatal puppy responds to hemorrhage with a decrease in cardiovascular function and severe metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate increases pH and improves cardiovascular function. The purpose of this study was to determine if the correction of the acidosis by sodium bicarbonate was responsible for the improved cardiovascular function since sodium bicarbonate, in addition to being a buffer, has a high sodium concentration and osmolality. A solution of sodium chloride having the same osmolality as sodium bicarbonate, one having the same sodium concentration as sodium bicarbonate, and a mannitol solution with the same osmolality as sodium bicarbonate all produced improved cardiovascular function without a pH rise. This suggests that improved cardiovascular function after sodium bicarbonate infusion may be due to the osmolality of the solution rather than its buffering action. Rowe MI, Arango A.

### Sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of severe metabolic acidosis with moderate or severe acute kidney injury in ICU (BICARICU-2) [^111GqmEA]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Acute acidemia is frequently observed during critical illness, its reported incidence varying from 14%to 42%. Persistent acidemia has been associated with poor prognosis, with a mortality rate as high as 57% when the pH stays below 7⋅20 more than 24h. Along with case-specific treatment, improvement of tissue perfusion and supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation and renal-replacement therapy are the cornerstones of severe metabolic acidemia management in critically ill patients. Given that an acidotic cellular environment can cause cellular dysfunction, intravenous bicarbonate administration to increase the pH may also be beneficial. In a survey performed in North America, more than two thirds of the program directors in nephrology or intensive care units declared that they used bicarbonate for the treatment of acidemia with hyperlactatemia.

Despite the frequency of its use in ICUs across the world, the effect of bicarbonate infusion for the treatment of metabolic acidemia remains controversial. However, bicarbonate could compensate the deleterious effects of acidotic cells on cardiovascular and oxygen delivery and might delay or avoid unnecessary early renal-replacement therapy. Among the organ failure that are associated with acidemia, acute kidney injury is often observed. Moderate to severe AKI occurs in 35–40% of the critically ill patients. The mainstay of AKI management is to identify and correct causative factors while providing supportive care and treating acute complications. Clinical manifestations include encephalopathy and pericardial effusion. Other potentially dangerous complications include metabolic abnormalities of hyperkalaemia and acidosis, and fluid overload. Despite correcting causative and providing supportive care AKI-associated mortality remains high.

Investigators conducted a prospective multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether bicarbonate infusion would improve outcome in critically ill patients with severe metabolic acidemia. Specifically, investigators hypothesized that, compared with no bicarbonate, early bicarbonate infusion would result in an improvement in the primary outcome. pH ≤ 7. 20; Bicarbonatemia ≤ 20 mmol/l; AND PaCO2 ≤ 45mmHg;.

### AARC clinical practice guideline. surfactant replacement therapy: 2013 [^111YNr9u]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic versus selective treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) — early surfactant therapy rapidly establishes normal surfactant levels and improves lung mechanics but may expose infants who may not develop RDS to intubation, mechanical ventilation, and an unnecessary drug; selective treatment treats only symptomatic infants but may delay surfactant administration and allow inflammation and protein-containing fluid influx to impair gas exchange. Prophylactic and early surfactant replacement therapy (within 2 hours of birth) reduces mortality and pulmonary complications in mechanically ventilated infants with RDS, compared to later selective administration. A lower treatment threshold of fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) < 0.45 reduces air leak syndromes and BPD, whereas a higher threshold of FIO2 > 0.45 is associated with increased risk of patent ductus arteriosus, with evidence of as much as a 22 mm Hg change in mean arterial pressure immediately (within 15 min) after surfactant. Early surfactant followed by planned extubation at 1 hour to nasal CPAP significantly reduces the incidence of BPD compared to selective administration.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^116ASomL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Administration Instructions

Renal Replacement Solution: Not for direct intravenous infusion.

The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of REGIOCIT solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient's fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.

The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient's fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.

Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.

1.2 Suggested Dosing

The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.

Table 1: REGIOCIT Solution Flow Rates to Achieve Citrate Dose of 3 mmol/L of Blood

Prior to initiating therapy, the patient's systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of REGIOCIT, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician's prescription when REGIOCIT is stopped.

Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). REGIOCIT solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.

Conclusions for evaluation and management after bariatric/metabolic surgery state that this surgery "is unmatched with respect to its weight loss and metabolic benefits", and "The selection criteria will continue to broaden, likely resulting in increasing numbers of less robust patients undergoing surgery (eg, children, elderly, and those with significant cardiorespiratory comorbidities)". As use increases, "As utilization escalates, so will the number of patients who suffer early complications". Accordingly, "it is imperative that the endoscopist have the aptitude to efficiently evaluate and manage patients in a collaborative, multidisciplinary manner", with a role to "ascertain the anatomical contributors to the complication and then offer patients the myriad of therapies (behavioral, medical, endoscopic, and surgical) required to address them", and "The endoscopist should have the knowledge, experience, and resources to modify and progress from one endoscopic technique to another, as well as have awareness to escalate to more invasive surgical management when necessary".

### Use of serum bicarbonate measurement in place of arterial base deficit in the surgical intensive care unit… [^115UUk7T]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Serum HCO3 reliably predicted the presence of significant metabolic acidosis with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 93 at admission and
0. 95 overall, outperforming pH, anion gap, and lactate. The severity of metabolic acidosis as indicated by the measurement has been demonstrated to predict ICU and hospital mortality, 3–6 length of stay and hospital morbidity, 5, 7, 8 severity of sepsis and organ failure, 9 the presence of bowel ischemia, 10 and transfusion requirements11 in both medical and surgical or trauma ICU populations. The increased concentrations of plasma hydrogen ions with metabolic acidosis are buffered by a variety of homeostatic mechanisms, including plasma bicarbonates. 21 Serum HCO3 levels have been shown to decrease in a linear fashion with increasing acid loads22, 23 and theoretically should provide information similar to the arterial BD.

The predictive ability of HCO3 and 3 conventional measures of severe metabolic acidosis and mortality were examined by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Severe metabolic acidosis was defined as a BD greater than 5. The AG was calculated with the following formula: In addition, the BD has been shown to be superior to other conventional measures of acidosis, such as the arterial pH or the serum anion gap. 4, 28, 43, 44 Our data confirm that nonsurvivors in a surgical ICU population have significant BD elevations, that both the admission and serially obtained BDs are predictive of ICU mortality, and that the BD clearly outperforms other measures such as pH and anion gap. Steven C. Stain, MD, Nashville, Tenn: Dr Martin and his colleagues at USC have presented a series of 2291 nontrauma patients admitted to their surgical ICU with more than a 24-hour length of stay between 1996 and 2004.

This retrospective analysis assessed the correlation of venous HCO3 levels with arterial BD at admission and during the ICU stay and concluded that venous HCO3 levels reliably predict the presence of significant metabolic acidosis with BDs of greater than 5.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^112fXs1g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypomagnesemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Administration).

Hypoglycemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels should be monitored regularly.

Hypokalemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.

Metabolic Alkalosis

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance.

If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate flow rate or change the composition of the CRRT solution.

Blood calcium levels, pH and bicarbonate should be monitored regularly in patients with metabolic alkalosis since this condition may potentiate hypocalcemia.

Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

For Patients With Clinical Signs or Symptoms Consistent With Lactic Acidosis, obtain blood lactate level and additional diagnostic evaluations should include serum bicarbonate, anion gap, and/or arterial blood gas; amylase and lipase; serum albumin; and hepatic transaminases; blood for lactate determination should be collected and processed within 4 hours of collection. Management includes Anecdotal (Unproven) Supportive Therapies — administer bicarbonate infusions, THAM (tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane), high doses of thiamine and riboflavin, and oral antioxidants (e.g. L-carnitine, co-enzyme Q10, vitamin C). Following resolution of abnormalities, resume therapy either with an NRTI-sparing regimen or a revised NRTI-containing regimen, and institute a revised NRTI-containing regimen with caution using NRTIs that are less likely to induce mitochondrial dysfunction (i.e. ABC, TAF, TDF, FTC, or 3TC); lactate should be monitored monthly for ≥ 3 months. Management can be initiated before receiving the results of the confirmatory test.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — chronic phenotype and OFC interpretation: General criteria are provided for patients with chronic FPIES, but given the paucity of published reports of chronic FPIES, specific major and minor criteria could not be established at this time. For severe chronic FPIES, regular ingestion of the offending food (eg, infant formula) leads to intermittent but progressive vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally with blood) sometimes with dehydration and metabolic acidosis, whereas milder chronic FPIES from lower doses (eg, solid foods or food allergens in breast milk) causes intermittent vomiting and/or diarrhea with poor weight gain/FTT but without dehydration or metabolic acidosis. It is important to recognize 2 distinct hallmarks of chronic FPIES: asymptomatic status and normal growth when the trigger food is eliminated and recurrence of repetitive FPIES symptoms on reintroduction, and criteria for interpreting OFC results differ in the degree of neutrophilia and remove stool laboratory findings.

### Bicarbonate, not' CO ₂'… [^112k6BTk]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Medical students, house officers, and practitioners continue to find acid-base metabolism difficult to understand. Part of that difficulty stems from terminology that is confusing and often misleading. One problem has been that the exact laboratory methods for measuring the various factors used in the evaluation of acid-base disorders have had undue influence on the terminology used in clinical acid-base practice. One example would be the use of the term blood pH as opposed to blood hydrogen ion concentration. Other articles1, 2 have dealt with the controversy of whether to report hydrogen ion activity as pH or as hydrogen ion concentration in nanoequivalents, or nanomoles, per liter. The unnecessary confusion resulting from the use of the aphysiologic terms standard bicarbonate, whole blood buffer base, and base excess has been elegantly reviewed.

Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) treatment — evolving paradigms emphasize airway-first management, targeted reversal of toxicity mechanisms, effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and cautious epinephrine dosing. "The treatment of severe LAST is fundamentally different from conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) insofar as toxic cardiomyopathy differs pathophysiologically from other causes of CV collapse", and "successful treatment of LAST hinges on the primacy of airway management to prevent hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis that potentiate LAST and negatively impact resuscitative efforts". Moreover, "successful treatment of LAST seeks to effectively moderate or reverse the mechanisms underlying the local anesthetic toxicity". Regarding lipid therapy, "the inotropic benefit of lipid only occurs when myocardial local anesthetic content is reduced below a threshold that corresponds to ion channel blocking concentrations", which "underlines the importance of effective CPR to ensure that coronary perfusion is sufficient to reduce local anesthetic tissue levels to attain the maximum benefit of lipid infusion". For vasopressor use, rat data support that epinephrine "be administered initially in small doses (1 µg/kg or less)".

Malaria — severe disease, cerebral malaria, and complications: Uncomplicated malaria infection can progress to severe disease or death within hours, and malaria with central nervous system symptoms can be particularly ominous. Cerebral malaria is defined as unarousable coma not attributable to any other cause in patients infected with P. falciparum; in Africa, case fatality rates with cerebral malaria approach 40%. The risk of severe and complicated illness increases with high levels of parasitemia and absence of partial immunity, with metabolic acidosis an important manifestation of severe malaria and an indicator of poor prognosis. Other acute complications include renal failure, hypoglycemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock, and acute pulmonary edema, and P. falciparum is the species most commonly responsible for severe disease and death, although other species can also cause severe disease and death.

### 8.4% sodium bicarbonate [^113fiutU]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, it is unwise to attempt full correction of a low total CO2 content during the first 24 hours of therapy, since this may be accompanied by an unrecognized alkalosis because of a delay in the readjustment of ventilation to normal. Owing to this lag, the achievement of total CO2 content of about 20 mEq/liter at the end of the first day of therapy will usually be associated with a normal blood pH. Further modification of the acidosis to completely normal values usually occurs in the presence of normal kidney function when and if the cause of the acidosis can be controlled. Values for total CO2 which are brought to normal or above normal within the first day of therapy are very likely to be associated with grossly alkaline values for blood pH, with ensuing undesired side effects.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. See PRECAUTIONS.

Do not use unless solution is clear and the container or seal is intact. Discard unused portion.

### Zonisamide (Zonisade) [^1169N7mt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Metabolic Acidosis

Zonisamide causes hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of zonisamide on carbonic anhydrase. Generally, zonisamide-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment, but it can develop at any time during treatment. Metabolic acidosis generally appears dose-dependent and can occur at doses as low as 25 mg daily.

Conditions or therapies that predispose to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of zonisamide.

Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor. Chronic, untreated, metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. Nephrolithiasis has been observed in the clinical development program in 4% of adults treated with zonisamide, has also been detected by renal ultrasound in 8% of pediatric treated patients who had at least one ultrasound prospectively collected, and was reported as an adverse event in 3% (4/133) of pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)]. Metabolic acidosis can also increase the risk for hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence of drugs which can cause hyperammonemia.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) — chronic presentation includes a severe pattern with regular ingestion of the offending food causing intermittent but progressive vomiting and diarrhea (occasionally with blood) with possible dehydration and metabolic acidosis, and a milder pattern with lower doses (eg, solid foods or food allergens in breast milk) causing intermittent vomiting and/or diarrhea with poor weight gain/failure to thrive without dehydration or metabolic acidosis; the most important diagnostic criterion is resolution within days after elimination with acute recurrence when reintroduced, with vomiting in 1–4 h and diarrhea in 24 h (usually 5–10 h), and without confirmatory challenge the diagnosis remains presumptive.

### Sodium bicarbonate injection, (Sodium bicarbonate) [^115Tcgqg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, extracorporeal circulation of blood, cardiac arrest and severe primary lactic acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate is further indicated in the treatment of certain drug intoxications, including barbiturates (where dissociation of the barbiturate-protein complex is desired), in poisoning by salicylates or methyl alcohol and in hemolytic reactions requiring alkalinization of the urine to diminish nephrotoxicity of hemoglobin and its breakdown products. Sodium bicarbonate also is indicated in severe diarrhea which is often accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate. Treatment of metabolic acidosis should, if possible, be superimposed on measures designed to control the basic cause of the acidosis - e.g., insulin in uncomplicated diabetes, blood volume restoration in shock. But since an appreciable time interval may elapse before all of the ancillary effects are brought about, bicarbonate therapy is indicated to minimize risks inherent to the acidosis itself.

Vigorous bicarbonate therapy is required in any form of metabolic acidosis where a rapid increase in plasma total C02 content is crucial - e.g., cardiac arrest, circulatory insufficiency due to shock or severe dehydration, and in severe primary lactic acidosis or severe diabetic acidosis.

### Sodium bicarbonate [^114aKtKH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Sodium Bicarbonate Injection is administered by the intravenous route.

In cardiac arrest, a rapid intravenous dose of one to two 50 mL vials (44.6 to 100 mEq) may be given initially and continued at a rate of 50 mL (44.6 to 50 mEq) every 5 to 10 minutes if necessary (as indicated by arterial pH and blood gas monitoring) to reverse the acidosis. Caution should be observed in emergencies where very rapid infusion of large quantities of bicarbonate is indicated. Bicarbonate solutions are hypertonic and may produce an undesirable rise in plasma sodium concentration in the process of correcting the metabolic acidosis. In cardiac arrest, however, the risks from acidosis exceed those of hypernatremia.

In less urgent forms of metabolic acidosis, Sodium Bicarbonate Injection may be added to other intravenous fluids. The amount of bicarbonate to be given to older children and adults over a four-to-eight-hour period is approximately 2 to 5 mEq/kg of body weight – depending upon the severity of the acidosis as judged by the lowering of total CO2content, blood pH and clinical condition of the patient. In metabolic acidosis associated with shock, therapy should be monitored by measuring blood gases, plasma osmolarity, arterial blood lactate, hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm. Bicarbonate therapy should always be planned in a stepwise fashion since the degree of response from a given dose is not precisely predictable. Initially an infusion of 2 to 5 mEq/kg body weight over a period of 4 to 8 hours will produce a measurable improvement in the abnormal acid-base status of the blood. The next step of therapy is dependent upon the clinical response of the patient. If severe symptoms have abated, then the frequency of administration and the size of the dose may be reduced.

### Donor heart and lung procurement: a consensus statement [^1146aQzG]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Donor lung procurement — fluid management emphasizes achieving euvolemia, noting that "One of the most important goals in maintaining organ perfusion during donor management is achieving euvolemia" and that "Diabetes insipidus (DI) and hyperglycemia may also compound further losses, increasing the risk for hypovolemic shock". For decreased pre-load, "crystalloid solutions (0.9% sodium chloride or Ringer's lactate) are the preferred choices for fluid repletion and maintenance". In hypernatremia, "Dextrose containing fluids or hypotonic solutions, such as 0.45% sodium chloride, may be used… (Serum Na+ > 145 mmol/liter) after correction of hypovolemia", while "Sodium bicarbonate may be added to treat metabolic acidosis". The statement cautions that "Careful fluid management avoids massive crystalloid infusion, which has a detrimental effect on arterial oxygenation", that "Surgeons should evaluate the lungs for pulmonary edema at the donor hospital", and that "Rapid increases in intravascular volume may adversely affect right ventricular function as well as potentiate acute kidney injury".

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^1159T4KR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Metabolic Acidosis

TOPAMAX can cause hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis). This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to carbonic anhydrase inhibition by TOPAMAX. TOPAMAX-induced metabolic acidosis can occur at any time during treatment. Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L. Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet, or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of TOPAMAX.

Metabolic acidosis was commonly observed in adult and pediatric patients treated with TOPAMAX in clinical trials. The incidence of decreased serum bicarbonate in pediatric trials, for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial-onset seizures was as high as 67% for TOPAMAX (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo. The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value < 17 mEq/L and ≥ 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was up to 11%, compared to ≤ 2% for placebo.

### Management of the potential organ donor in the ICU: Society of Critical Care Medicine / American College of Chest Physicians / association of organ procurement organizations consensus statement [^111h2tLN]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential organ donor fluid management — initial volume replacement, crystalloid selection, hypernatremia management, colloids, and transfusion — is summarized as follows: Initial intravascular volume replacement with crystalloids or colloids is acceptable, and the recommended isotonic crystalloids are 0.9% saline and lactated Ringer solution, although hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may preclude the use of 0.9% saline and the hypoosmolar effects and electrolyte content of lactated Ringer solution may not be advisable for some donors. If volume status is stabilized but correction of hypernatremia is needed, hypotonic fluids (e.g. D5W) can be used; patients with metabolic acidosis may benefit from solutions containing sodium bicarbonate, with 50–150 mmol/L depending on phase and severity, and in hypernatremic donors, 0.45% saline with or without sodium bicarbonate can be used. For colloids, HES should not be used routinely for colloidal resuscitation in organ donors, and if it is used the infused volume should be limited to 500–1,000 mL. Packed RBCs may be required for severe anemia, and although the optimal hemoglobin is unknown in this population, in other critically ill populations a target above 7 g/dL has been recommended.
