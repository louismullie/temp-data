## Question

Causes of hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of hyponatremia, specifically how they are organized by pathophysiology and etiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states. Then, I should classify by volume status into hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic categories. Next, I will enumerate the major etiologies within each category, including SIADH, endocrine disorders, medications, and special contexts like exercise-associated hyponatremia. After that, I should review the diagnostic approach using serum and urine osmolality, urine sodium, and clinical assessment. Finally, I will synthesize a practical framework and highlight key pitfalls and controversies, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and the initial diagnostic fork in the road. Hyponatremia is typically defined as serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L, but I need to ensure this is true hypotonic hyponatremia by checking serum osmolality and excluding pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic hyponatremia, because management and implications differ substantially if the osmolality is normal or high rather than low [^111fLWER] [^113g8d3Y]. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: most guidance treats osmolality less than about 275–285 mOsm/kg as consistent with hypotonicity, while higher osmolality suggests hypertonic hyponatremia from effective osmoles like glucose or mannitol, or pseudohyponatremia from paraproteinemia or hyperlipidemia, which do not require sodium correction per se [^113g8d3Y] [^116Zh6gJ].

> Next, I should review the core pathophysiology. True hypotonic hyponatremia reflects a relative excess of water to sodium, driven by impaired free-water excretion, most commonly due to inappropriate vasopressin activity, or by excessive intake of electrolyte-free water in the setting of impaired excretion, so I need to keep both arms in mind as I classify etiologies [^111fLWER] [^112q1gbT]. Wait, let me verify the role of vasopressin: nonosmotic AVP release is central to SIADH and contributes to hyponatremia in heart failure and cirrhosis, which explains why urine osmolality is often inappropriately high despite hypotonic plasma [^116omhxd] [^112q1gbT].

> I will now examine hypovolemic hyponatremia, where total body sodium and water are reduced but water loss is relatively less than sodium loss, triggering vasopressin and water retention. Common causes include gastrointestinal losses from vomiting or diarrhea, third-space sequestration such as pancreatitis or peritonitis, and renal losses from diuretics or salt-wasting nephropathies; I should confirm that urine sodium is typically low when extrarenal losses are the driver and may be high when renal salt wasting is present [^111fLWER] [^112q1gbT]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic utility of urine sodium: in hypovolemic states from extrarenal causes, urine sodium is usually less than 20–30 mmol/L, whereas in renal salt wasting or diuretic use it tends to be higher, helping distinguish mechanisms when clinical assessment is equivocal [^111B44kt].

> Now, let me consider euvolemic hyponatremia, where total body water is increased without significant sodium excess, most often due to SIADH. I need to check the breadth of SIADH triggers: malignancy, pulmonary disease, CNS disorders, pain, nausea, and numerous drugs including SSRIs, carbamazepine, and others; importantly, SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring normal thyroid and adrenal function and absence of diuretics or other confounders [^116omhxd] [^111fLWER]. But wait, what if the patient is on thiazides or has endocrine disease? Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency can impair free-water excretion and mimic SIADH, so I should confirm thyroid and cortisol status before labeling SIADH, and I should remember that measuring vasopressin is not routinely recommended in the diagnostic workup of SIADH [^111fLWER] [^117VQ1wD].

> I should double-check medication-induced euvolemic hyponatremia beyond SIADH-classic drugs. Desmopressin can precipitate severe hyponatremia, especially with excessive fluid intake or interacting drugs, so I need to ask about DDAVP use and counsel strict fluid restriction and sodium monitoring when it is prescribed [^113BDRdJ]. Let me verify the monitoring cadence: the FDA label advises checking sodium within 7 days and again at about 1 month after initiation, with closer surveillance in older adults or those at risk, which I should incorporate into the medication history review [^113BDRdJ].

> Next, I should review hypervolemic hyponatremia, where total body sodium is increased but water is increased even more, producing edematous states. Heart failure and cirrhosis are the prototypical causes, with nonosmotic vasopressin release and reduced effective arterial blood volume driving water retention; I need to ensure I recognize that hyponatremia in cirrhosis portends worse prognosis and may warrant transplant evaluation when severe or refractory [^111fLWER] [^114NVLhP]. Hold on, I should verify management implications: in cirrhosis, fluid restriction and careful diuretic adjustment are foundational, and guidelines emphasize not pursuing sodium-raising strategies in isolation without addressing the underlying disease and volume status [^116GwdrP] [^116gof4Q].

> Let me not forget special contexts. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is typically euvolemic or hypervolemic and results from overdrinking hypotonic fluids in the setting of sustained, nonosmotic AVP release during prolonged exertion. Prevention hinges on drinking to thirst and avoiding overhydration, while treatment of symptomatic cases favors hypertonic saline boluses and strict fluid restriction rather than isotonic fluids, which can worsen the hyponatremia [^115mUEkT] [^113KnqfC]. I should confirm that mild cases can be managed with oral hypertonic solutions or salty foods if tolerated, reserving IV hypertonic saline for moderate to severe presentations with neurologic symptoms [^11592N29] [^113KnqfC].

> I need to ensure the diagnostic approach is explicit. First, confirm hypotonicity with measured serum osmolality and exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic causes. Then classify by volume status using history, exam, and urine sodium, recognizing that urine osmolality helps gauge AVP activity. Finally, tailor labs to suspected etiologies, including thyroid, morning cortisol, and a medication review, and consider that measuring vasopressin is not advised routinely in SIADH workups [^113g8d3Y] [^111B44kt] [^117VQ1wD]. Wait, let me verify the urine sodium thresholds again: greater than 30 mmol/L in the context of hypotonic hyponatremia suggests renal sodium loss or SIADH, whereas less than 20–30 mmol/L favors extrarenal losses or hypervolemic states, but I must integrate diuretic use and clinical context to avoid misclassification [^111B44kt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before etiology is clear, but I should acknowledge urgency. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia requires prompt hypertonic saline to mitigate cerebral edema, with guideline-concordant targets of a 4–6 mEq/L early rise and avoidance of exceeding about 10 mEq/L in the first 24 hours to limit osmotic demyelination risk, followed by cause-directed therapy once the patient is stabilized [^114hmeK4] [^111fLWER]. I should double-check that this applies across acute and chronic contexts: the early correction target is for symptomatic patients regardless of chronicity, whereas the daily limit is most critical in chronic hyponatremia where brain adaptation increases demyelination risk [^114hmeK4] [^113aETX4].

> Let me synthesize a practical framework to avoid missing key causes. True hypotonic hyponatremia arises from impaired free-water excretion due to vasopressin excess or renal water-retaining mechanisms, or from excessive electrolyte-free water intake in the face of impaired excretion; etiologies cluster into hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic bins, with SIADH dominating euvolemic cases, heart failure and cirrhosis dominating hypervolemic cases, and gastrointestinal or renal losses dominating hypovolemic cases; medications and endocrine disorders are frequent contributors and must be actively screened [^111fLWER] [^112q1gbT]. I should confirm that this framework aligns with major guidelines and reviews, which consistently emphasize volume status classification, urine studies, and a thorough medication and endocrine review as the backbone of diagnosis and management planning [^114hmeK4] [^111B44kt].

> Finally, I need to highlight pitfalls and controversies so we do not overgeneralize. Misclassification is common, especially equating all euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients with SIADH without excluding cerebral or renal salt wasting or medication effects. Registry data show frequent underuse of essential diagnostics and persistent hyponatremia at discharge, underscoring the need for disciplined workups and reassessment during treatment [^112nQieF] [^114oZizi]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied thiazides are the main diuretic culprits; I should correct that loop diuretics can also contribute via hypovolemia and impaired free-water clearance, and in cirrhosis or heart failure, diuretic choices must be carefully balanced against volume status and renal perfusion [^116GwdrP]. I should also remember that vaptans can raise sodium but carry a risk of overly rapid correction and uncertain patient-centered benefits, so if used, they require close monitoring and judicious selection of candidates [^11534PiV] [^114hmeK4].

Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium < 135 mmol/L and is most often due to **excess free water intake or impaired water excretion** [^111fLWER]. The **most common cause is SIADH** [^116omhxd], driven by non-osmotic vasopressin release from malignancy, pulmonary/CNS disease, or drugs [^111GRoMH]. Other major causes include hypovolemia (GI/renal losses, diuretics) [^111fLWER], hypervolemic states (heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) [^111WyraN], endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency) [^111fLWER], and medications (SSRIs, thiazides, desmopressin) [^113BDRdJ]. Less common causes include psychogenic polydipsia, low solute intake, and exercise-associated hyponatremia [^113zdkPK]. Evaluation should confirm hypotonicity [^113g8d3Y], classify by volume status, and use urine sodium/osmolality to distinguish causes [^116Zh6gJ].

## Classification of hyponatremia

Hyponatremia is classified by **serum osmolality and volume status**:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypotonic hyponatremia | Low serum osmolality (< 275 mOsm/kg) | - SIADH <br/> - Hypovolemia <br/> - Hypervolemic states (HF, cirrhosis) [^111duo5q] |
| Hypertonic hyponatremia | High serum osmolality (> 295 mOsm/kg) | - Hyperglycemia <br/> - Mannitol <br/> - Glycine [^113g8d3Y] |
| Isotonic hyponatremia | Normal serum osmolality (275–295 mOsm/kg) | - Pseudohyponatremia <br/> - Laboratory artifact [^113g8d3Y] |

## Common causes of hyponatremia

### Hypotonic hyponatremia

Hypotonic hyponatremia is the **most common form** and is classified by volume status:

---

#### Hypovolemic hyponatremia

Hypovolemic hyponatremia reflects **sodium and water loss with relatively greater water retention** [^111fLWER]:

- **Gastrointestinal losses**: Vomiting, diarrhea, nasogastric suction.
- **Renal losses**: Diuretics, osmotic diuresis, salt-wasting nephropathy.
- **Third-space losses**: Pancreatitis, peritonitis, burns.

---

#### Euvolemic hyponatremia

Euvolemic hyponatremia features **normal total body sodium with excess water** [^notfound]:

- **SIADH**: Malignancy, pulmonary/CNS disease, drugs (SSRIs, carbamazepine, opioids) [^notfound].
- **Endocrine disorders**: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency [^111fLWER].
- **Medications**: Desmopressin, thiazides, NSAIDs [^notfound].
- **Psychogenic polydipsia**: Excessive water intake [^111fLWER].
- **Low solute intake**: "Tea and toast" or beer potomania [^111fLWER].

---

#### Hypervolemic hyponatremia

Hypervolemic hyponatremia reflects **increased total body water with relatively smaller sodium gain** [^112Hzt6J]:

- **Heart failure**: Reduced effective arterial blood volume [^116Dh6zX].
- **Cirrhosis**: Portal hypertension and splanchnic vasodilation [^notfound].
- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Proteinuria and edema [^notfound].

---

### Hypertonic hyponatremia

Hypertonic hyponatremia results from **effective osmoles drawing water out of cells**, lowering measured sodium:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Osmotic shift of water intracellularly [^113g8d3Y].
- **Mannitol**: Osmotic diuretic [^113g8d3Y].
- **Glycine**: Prostate/bladder surgery irrigation [^113g8d3Y].

---

### Isotonic hyponatremia

Isotonic hyponatremia is a **laboratory artifact** from high paraprotein or triglycerides, not true hyponatremia [^113g8d3Y].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

- **Confirm hypotonicity**: Measure serum osmolality [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Assess volume status**: Clinical exam, urine sodium, urine osmolality [^116Zh6gJ].
- **Identify underlying cause**: History, medications, endocrine testing [^116Zh6gJ].

---

## Clinical implications

Hyponatremia is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality** [^112q1gbT], including neurologic complications (seizures, coma), gait instability, falls, and fractures [^114hmeK4]. Management depends on the cause, severity, and chronicity, with hypertonic saline for severe symptomatic cases and careful correction to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114hmeK4].

---

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder with diverse causes; **SIADH is the most frequent** [^116omhxd]. Accurate classification and a structured diagnostic approach are critical for targeted management and prevention of complications [^116yEj9k].

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^1169CfKA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^111mCjG4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities occurring in clinical practice. Severe acute hyponatremia can have devastating consequences, but even mild chronic hyponatremia can lead to adverse health effects. Mild hyponatremia has been shown to be associated with increased fallsas well as higher rates of osteoporosisand fractures. Determining the underlying cause of hyponatremia can be challenging and requires extensive laboratory evaluation. Hypothyroidism has been proposed to be one of the causes of euvolemic hyponatremia. However, the association between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia is neither clearly defined nor well understood. This review focuses on the available literature regarding thyroid and its possible association with hyponatremia.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^117RWnJQ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Hyponatremia in the emergency department [^112GSy2Z]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, is frequently encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. Symptoms are often unspecific and include a recent history of falls, weakness and vertigo. Common causes of hyponatremia include diuretics, heart failure as well as Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis (SIAD) and correct diagnosis can be challenging. Emergency treatment of hyponatremia should be guided by presence of symptoms and focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic hyponatremia.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^112GCSuE]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia (HN), defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na +]) below the lower limit of normal, is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients, with a prevalence as high as 30–42%. HN is independently associated with mortality in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, and hospitalized patients in general, and with increased hospital costs and readmission rates. Chronic HN has been linked to impaired gait and balance, increased falls and fracture rates, and osteoporosis. However, a causal role of HN for these associations is largely unproven.

Correction of severe HN of sudden onset can be genuinely lifesaving, and treatment of chronic HN associated with neurological symptoms is undeniably beneficial. Despite the widespread clinical impression that correction of less severe chronic HN is also worthwhile, evidence-based data demonstrating clinical benefit are limited.,

Hypovolemic HN responds readily to volume repletion. Until recently, treatment of hypervolemic HN has been limited to fluid restriction (FR) and correction of the underlying disorder. Treatment modalities for euvolemic HN have included FR, hypertonic saline (HS), loop diuretics, demeclocycline, and urea. With the approval of the vasopressin-receptor antagonists conivaptan and tolvaptan, more targeted treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic HN became available. It remains uncertain how treatment options are employed, and how correction magnitude and incidence of adverse outcomes are affected by the type of therapy. With this background, the multinational HN Registry was initiated to assess the current state of treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic HN in diverse, real-world hospital settings. Its specific purpose was to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in [Na +]. An additional goal was to determine which treatments posed the greatest risk of overly rapid correction and osmotic demyelination.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Cerebral correlates of hyponatremia [^112MJJXr]. Neurocritical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) less than 135 mEq/L, is commonly caused by elevated levels of the hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which causes water retention. The principal organ affected by disease-related morbidity is the brain. The neurologic complications associated with hyponatremia are attributable to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure, caused by the osmotically driven movement of water from the extracellular compartment into brain cells. Although neurologic symptoms induced by hyponatremia are limited by an adaptive brain mechanism known as "regulatory volume decrease", an overly rapid correction of serum [Na+] before the reversal of this adaptive response can also produce neurologic damage. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hyponatremia related to central nervous system disorders, neurosurgery, or the use of psychoactive drugs. Fluid restriction is the standard of care for patients with SIADH who are asymptomatic or who have only mild symptoms, but patients with severe or symptomatic hyponatremia require more aggressive therapy. Infusion of hypertonic saline is the usual approach to the treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, but patients require frequent monitoring. Pharmacologic agents such as demeclocycline and lithium may be effective in some patients but are associated with undesirable adverse events. The AVPreceptor antagonists are a new therapeutic class for the treatment of hyponatremia. The first agent in this class approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients is conivaptan. Two other agents, tolvaptan and lixivaptan, are being evaluated in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The AVP-receptor antagonists block the effects of elevated AVP and promote aquaresis, the electrolyte-sparing excretion of water, resulting in the correction of serum [Na+]. These agents may also have intrinsic neuroprotective effects.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^116XhAVB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^114EsrDx]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### Hyponatremia: mechanisms and newer treatments [^115XRMHU]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the neural and renal mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis, provide a rationale for the sensitivity of the central nervous system to hyponatremia, and outline modern approaches to therapy of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Methods

Review of relevant literature with focus on physiologic mechanisms.

Results

With careful monitoring, acute hyponatremia can be managed, while minimizing risks both of continued hyponatremia and the osmotic demyelination that can occur with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia due to disorders of volume regulation (congestive heart failure or cirrhosis) or to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release can be managed effectively with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, but there is no evidence that controlling the hyponatremia enhances survival associated with the underlying diseases.

Conclusions

Therapy in the acute setting balances the risk of the osmotic disturbance with the risk of overly rapid correction. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has enhanced our ability to improve chronic hyponatremia in conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

Hyponatremia is the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality. Severe hyponatremia in pregnancy poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Pregnancy involves changes in physiology that affect water and sodium homeostasis. Knowledge of these complex physiologic alterations during pregnancy is critical to managing dysnatremias in pregnancy. This teaching case describes a woman with chronic hyponatremia who presented during pregnancy with worsening hyponatremia. She had an activating vasopressin receptor mutation, which was passed on to her child, and her diagnostic workup is described.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Hyponatremia and bone: an emerging relationship [^116zrUzF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and is mainly known for its neurological complications. New studies suggest previously unrecognized complications of hyponatremia, including falls, osteoporosis and fractures. Because these novel associations are mainly derived from epidemiological studies, it remains unclear whether hyponatremia has a direct effect on bone or whether it is a surrogate marker of another etiology. However, one animal and one in vitro study now show that hyponatremia can have direct effects on bone, mainly via activation of osteoclasts. The association between hyponatremia and fractures appears to be independent of osteoporosis (defined as low BMD). Also, data suggest that this association cannot be fully explained by the possibility that hyponatremia predisposes to falls. Hyponatremia, therefore, also has an effect on bone quality that is not captured by BMD. Here, the emerging relationship between hyponatremia and bone is reviewed, with special emphasis on possible mechanisms, unanswered questions and clinical implications.

Approaches to diagnostic strategies for hyponatremia

Seven guidance documents covered diagnosis and differential diagnosis of hyponatremia. Table 2 shows the key recommendations. The key areas addressed included the threshold for initiating diagnostic workup, confirmation and classification of hypotonic hyponatremia, and identification of the underlying disorder.

Guidance documents differed somewhat in their recommended threshold for starting diagnostic assessment. Six recommended starting diagnostic assessment when the serum sodium concentration dropped below 135 mmol/L and to confirm hypotonicity through a measured serum or plasma osmolality < 275 to 285 mOsm/kg. Two others set lower thresholds of serum sodium concentration at < 131 mmol/L and < 130 mmol/L. Six guidance documents advised classifying hypotonic hyponatremia into categories of hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia to aid differential diagnosis and guide treatment. Most guidance documents recommended a clinical assessment of hydration status and a urinary sodium concentration as well as a urinary osmolality measurement, although specific criteria, thresholds, and algorithms differed.

Most guidance documents proposed additional laboratory tests that could be of value to identify the underlying disorder, but they varied substantially regarding which tests to use in what situation and which reference values to use. Only two explicitly recommended taking a history of drug intake and symptoms as part of the assessment. Four presented an algorithm to guide differential diagnosis.

### Hyponatremia: diagnosis, complications, and management including V2 receptor antagonists [^1151QPkL]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies have consistently demonstrated the common prevalence of hyponatremia in the hospital and intensive care settings, and how it correlates with untoward outcomes. This review discusses the classification, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of hyponatremia and how these agents may influence its management, and also examines the available treatment options and their weaknesses and strengths.

Recent Findings

This review is timely and relevant, as mild degrees of serum sodium lowering may be associated with adverse neurologic and musculoskeletal effects. These findings have the potential to transform our approach to managing hyponatremia. A major advance in our ability to treat hyponatremia was the introduction and approval of aquaretics (vaptans). Emerging data on vaptans and their potential role to treat hyponatremia in the settings of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis are presented.

Summary

Vaptans will likely play an important role in treating hyponatremia, given their clinical effectiveness and tolerability. Cost remains a hindrance for vaptans, and more studies are needed to further define their best utilization in hyponatremic patients.

### Interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia [^11534PiV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic (present > 48 hours) non-hypovolaemic hyponatraemia occurs frequently, can be caused by various conditions, and is associated with shorter survival and longer hospital stays. Many treatments, such as fluid restriction or vasopressin receptor antagonists can be used to improve the hyponatraemia, but whether that translates into improved patient-important outcomes is less certain.

Objectives

This review aimed to 1) look at the benefits and harms of interventions for chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia when compared with placebo, no treatment or head-to-head; and 2) determine if benefits and harms vary in absolute or relative terms dependent on the specific compound within a drug class, on the dosage used, or the underlying disorder causing the hyponatraemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 1 December 2017 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened the reference lists of potentially relevant studies, contacted authors, and screened the websites of regulatory agencies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared the effects of any intervention with placebo, no treatment, standard care, or any other intervention in patients with chronic non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia. We also included subgroups with hyponatraemia from studies with broader inclusion criteria (e.g. people with chronic heart failure or people with cirrhosis with or without hyponatraemia), provided we could obtain outcomes for participants with hyponatraemia from the report or the study authors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We expressed treatment effects as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes (health-related quality of life, length of hospital stay, change from baseline in serum sodium concentration, cognitive function), and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes (death, response and rapid increase in serum sodium concentration, hypernatraemia, polyuria, hypotension, acute kidney injury, liver function abnormalities) together with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We identified 35 studies, enrolling 3429 participants. Twenty-eight studies (3189 participants) compared a vasopressin receptor antagonist versus placebo, usual care, no treatment, or fluid restriction. In adults with chronic, non-hypovolaemic hypotonic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists have uncertain effects on death at six months (15 studies, 2330 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.33) due to risk of selective reporting and serious imprecision; and on health-related quality of life because results are at serious risk of performance, selective reporting and attrition bias, and suffer from indirectness related to the validity of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) in the setting of hyponatraemia. Vasopressin receptor antagonists may reduce hospital stay (low certainty evidence due to risk of performance bias and imprecision) (3 studies, 610 participants: MD -1.63 days, 95% CI -2.96 to -0.30), and may make little or no difference to cognitive function (low certainty evidence due to indirectness and imprecision). Vasopressin receptor antagonists probably increase the intermediate outcome of serum sodium concentration (21 studies, 2641 participants: MD 4.17 mmol/L, 95% CI 3.18 to 5.16), corresponding to two and a half as many people having a 5 to 6 mmol/L increase in sodium concentration compared with placebo at 4 to 180 days (moderate certainty evidence due to risk of attrition bias) (18 studies, 2014 participants: RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.95 to 3.18). But they probably also increase the risk of rapid serum sodium correction - most commonly defined as > 12 mmol/L/d (moderate certainty evidence due to indirectness) (14 studies, 2058 participants: RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.40) and commonly cause side-effects such as thirst (13 studies, 1666 participants: OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.80 to 4.27) and polyuria (6 studies, 1272 participants): RR 4.69, 95% CI 1.59 to 13.85) (high certainty evidence). The potential for liver toxicity remains uncertain due to large imprecision. Effects were generally consistent across the different agents, suggesting class effect. Data for other interventions such as fluid restriction, urea, mannitol, loop diuretics, corticosteroids, demeclocycline, lithium and phenytoin were largely absent.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with chronic hyponatraemia, vasopressin receptor antagonists modestly raise serum sodium concentration at the cost of a 3% increased risk of it being rapid. To date there is very low certainty evidence for patient-important outcomes; the effects on mortality and health-related quality of life are unclear and do not rule out appreciable benefit or harm; there does not appear to be an important effect on cognitive function, but hospital stay may be slightly shorter, although available data are limited. Treatment decisions must weigh the value of an increase in serum sodium concentration against its short-term risks and unknown effects on patient-important outcomes. Evidence for other treatments is largely absent. Further studies assessing standard treatments such as fluid restriction or urea against placebo and one-another would inform practice and are warranted. Given the limited available evidence for patient-important outcomes, any study should include these outcomes in a standardised manner.

### Hyponatremia and mortality: moving beyond associations [^112K8tfe]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Acute hyponatremia can cause death if cerebral edema is not treated promptly. Conversely, if chronic hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, osmotic demyelination may ensue, which also potentially is lethal. However, these severe complications of hyponatremia are relatively uncommon and often preventable. More commonly, hyponatremia predicts mortality in patients with advanced heart failure or liver cirrhosis. In these conditions, it generally is assumed that hyponatremia reflects the severity of the underlying disease rather than contributing directly to mortality. The same assumption holds for the recently reported associations between hyponatremia and mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction. However, recent data suggest that chronic and mild hyponatremia in the general population also are associated with mortality. In addition, hyponatremia has been associated with mortality in long-term hemodialysis patients without residual function in whom the underlying disease cannot be responsible for hyponatremia. These new data raise the question of whether hyponatremia by itself can contribute to mortality or it remains a surrogate marker for other unknown risk factors. We review hyponatremia and mortality and explore the possibility that hyponatremia perturbs normal physiology in the absence of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice, but current management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the current state of management of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in diverse hospital settings, specifically which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

Methods

The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion via measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

Results

The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%); 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for all active therapies than no active treatment. Hypertonic saline and tolvaptan produced the greatest mean rate of [Na(+)] change (interquartile range, both 3.0 [6.0] mEq/L/d) compared with lower interquartile range rates of [Na(+)] change for isotonic saline (1.5 [3.0] mEq/L/d) and fluid restriction (1.0 [2.3] mEq/L/d). The general pattern of responses was similar in both the US and EU cohorts. At discharge, [Na(+)] was < 135 mEq/L in 75% of patients and ≤ 130 mEq/L in 43% of patients. Overly rapid correction occurred in 10.2% of patients.

Conclusions

Current treatment of hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion often uses therapies with limited efficacy; the most commonly chosen monotherapy treatments, fluid restriction and isotonic saline, failed to increase the serum [Na(+)] by ≥ 5 mEq/L in 55% and 64% of monotherapy treatment episodes, respectively. Appropriate laboratory tests to diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were obtained in < 50% of patients; success rates in correcting hyponatremia were significantly higher when such tests were obtained. Few outcome differences were found between the United States and the European Union. A notable exception was hospital length of stay; use of tolvaptan was associated with significantly shorter length of stay in the European Union but not in the United States. Despite the availability of effective therapies, most patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion were discharged from the hospital still hyponatremic.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### Hyponatremia and arginine vasopressin dysregulation: mechanisms, clinical consequences, and management [^111GRoMH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most common electrolyte disorder, occurs frequently in older people and in hospitalized patients. Physiological changes of aging that interact with diseases and drugs commonly present in older people put this population at greater risk for hyponatremia. It can accompany central nervous system disorders, pulmonary and renal disease, cancer, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis, as well as many commonly used drugs. Delayed recognition can lead to symptomatic hyponatremia with consequent cerebral edema and possibly irreversible neurological damage. Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia may be subtle or not attributed to hyponatremia. Most cases are of the euvolemic type, in which extracellular fluid volume is normal and is often due to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Hyponatremia can also occur in association with hypervolemia or hypovolemia. Common to all of these circumstances is increased secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Understanding of the pathophysiological basis of hyponatremia and of brain compensatory mechanisms is critical to safe treatment. Fluid restriction or infusion of hypertonic saline can improve symptoms and normalize serum sodium levels but does not address excess AVP, which in most cases is the underlying cause of the disorder. A major new approach to treatment of hyponatremia is the development of aquaretics: AVP-receptor antagonists that provide a targeted therapeutic approach to correcting the many kinds of hyponatremia caused by excess AVP levels.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^112Hzt6J]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia… [^113j7BjV]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq per L. 1–3 A Dutch systematic review of 53 studies showed that the prevalence of mild hyponatremia was 22. 2% in geriatric hospital wards,
6. 0% in nongeriatric wards, and 17. 2% in the intensive care unit. 2 The prevalence of severe hyponatremia was 4. 5%,
0. 8%, and 10. 3%, respectively. 3 Patients who develop hyponatremia during hospitalization have increased mortality rates compared with those who have hyponatremia on admission. 7, 8 It is unclear if hyponatremia is a marker for poor prognostic outcomes or merely a reflection of disease severity. Its presence suggests a worse prognosis in patients with liver cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, hip fractures, and pulmonary embolism. 1, 8–10.

Etiology and Pathophysiology The most common classification system for hyponatremia is based on volume status: hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic. 11 Plasma osmolality has a role in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia. Osmolality refers to the total concentration of solutes in water. Effective osmolality is the osmotic gradient created by solutes that do not cross the cell membrane. Effective osmolality determines the osmotic pressure and the flow of water. 11 Plasma osmolality is maintained by strict regulation of the arginine vasopressin system and thirst. If plasma osmolality increases, ADH is secreted and water is retained by the kidneys, thus decreasing serum osmolality.

If plasma osmolality decreases, ADH also decreases, resulting in diuresis of free water and a return to homeostasis. 12, 13.

### Hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis [^1173dQKV]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium concentration [Na +] of less than 135 mmol/L, is the most frequently encountered metabolic disorder in clinical practice. It is especially common in elderly individuals, with reported incidences from 7% to 53% in ambulatory and institutionalized geriatric patients, respectively. Approximately 50% of chronic hyponatremia is due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Other causes include medications (e.g. diuretics), hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hepatic cirrhosis, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. Although chronic hyponatremia historically has been difficult to treat, the recent development of oral antagonists to the renal vasopressin V2 receptor offers the likelihood that both acute and chronic hyponatremia will be correctable in the near future. Thus this represents a opportune time to evaluate the adverse effects of chronic hyponatremia.

Wilderness Medical Society exercise-associated hyponatremia definitions — This table standardizes key terms and thresholds relevant to exercise and heat illness. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity", while the severe variant with encephalopathy is "A severe form of exercise-associated hyponatremia associated with neurologic changes resulting from cerebral edema". Exercise-associated hypernatremia is "A serum, plasma, or blood sodium concentration > 145 mmol·L-1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity". Heat stroke is "A core temperature above 40°C (104°F) with altered mental status and generally divided into 2 categories: classic heat stroke… and exertional heat stroke". Hypohydration during exercise is described as "hypohydration during exercise with > 2% of body mass can occur from sweat loss during exercise and high environmental temperatures and is usually characterized as hyperosmotic hypovolemia". Hypertonic saline is "Any crystalloid solution containing more than 0.9% sodium chloride (ie, 3% sodium chloride)". Overhydration is "Excessive oral intake of hypotonic fluids (eg, water and sport electrolyte drinks) resulting in the amount of salt and other electrolytes in the body becoming diluted (ie, hyponatremia)", and hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when "serum sodium rapidly decreases (eg, exercise-associated hyponatremia), there is an osmotic shift of fluid into the intracellular spaces, resulting in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure".

### Hyponatremia in acute decompensated heart failure: mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment options [^115nAJLj]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common and is increasingly recognized as an independent prognostic marker that adversely affects morbidity and mortality in various disease states, including heart failure. In acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the degree of hyponatremia often parallels the severity of cardiac dysfunction and is further exacerbated by any reduction in glomerular filtration rate and arginine vasopressin dysregulation. A recent study showed that even modest improvement of hyponatremia may have survival benefits. Although management of hyponatremia in ADHF has traditionally focused on improving cardiac function and fluid restriction, the magnitude of improvement of serum sodium is fairly slow and unpredictable. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of hyponatremia in ADHF, review its evolving prognostic significance, and evaluate the efficacy of various treatments for hyponatremia, including the recently approved vasopressin receptor antagonists for managing hyponatremia among patients hospitalized for ADHF.

### Is there a causal relationship between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia? [^115Jt9Z3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common lab abnormalities seen in clinical practice. It has become widely accepted that hypothyroidism is a cause of euvolemic hyponatremia. The primary mechanism is thought to be due to impaired free water excretion and changes in sodium handling in the kidney. However, the clinical studies are conflicting and do not definitively confirm the association between hypothyroidism and hyponatremia. Therefore, if severe hyponatremia occurs in a patient without myxedema coma, other potential etiologies should be sought.

### Association of hyponatremia with bone mineral density and fractures: a narrative review [^113vu8bh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Practical approach to patient with hyponatremia

Hyponatremia, even mild, is a readily identifiable risk factor for falls, osteoporosis and bone fracture occurrence. This independent association should inform clinical decision-making in day-to-day clinical practice with respect to measuring serum sodium in individuals with fractures or osteoporosis as well as testing BMD in patients with hyponatremia. The first scenario is patients presenting with fractures. Several studies have recorded a high prevalence of 9–13% for hyponatremia in patients aged 65 years or older admitted with any type of bone fracture. This prevalence is even higher, estimated at around 19%, among elderly patients admitted with hip fractures. These data highlight the need to reinforce the recommendation for serum sodium measurement in all patients presenting with bone fracture (Figure 2). The second scenario is an individual with osteoporosis. Taking into consideration the high rate of hyponatremia among people with osteoporosis in combination with the ease and low cost of screening for hyponatremia, we recommend measuring sodium concentration in patients with low BMD. The third scenario is that of an individual with hyponatremia and whether BMD should be measured. In general, any screening programme could be justified only on the basis of high-quality evidence that it can reduce morbidity or mortality. Obviously, a universal screening programme with BMD measurement in patients with hyponatremia cannot be recommended since it has not been proved that correcting hyponatremia reduces fracture risk. A large proportion of patients with hyponatremia, such as all women above the age of 65 and postmenopausal women younger than 65 years with high fracture risk, should, anyway, undergo BMD testing according to the US Preventive Services Task Force et al. The decision about offering BMD testing to a patient with hyponatremia should be individualized, taking into consideration various parameters. Since the association of hyponatremia with fracture risk is dependent on the duration and magnitude of hyponatremia, the longer the duration of hyponatremia and the lower the sodium value, the larger the potential negative effect of hyponatremia on bone health. We suggest considering hyponatremia as a risk factor for fracture, provided it is chronic with minimum duration of 6 months, since brief episodes of hyponatremia are expected to have minimal long-term impact on bone health. We recommend that hyponatremia should trigger BMD testing in the presence of two or more risk factors, such as history of fragility fracture, parental history of hip fracture, history of falls, significant exposure to glucocorticoids, causes of secondary osteoporosis, low body mass index, smoking and significant alcohol intake (Figure 2).

### Role of vaptans in the management of hyponatremia [^115ctTFR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most commonly encountered electrolyte abnormality, affects as many as 30% of hospitalized patients. It is a powerful predictor of poor outcomes, especially in patients with congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. The failure to excrete electrolyte-free water that results from persistent secretion of antidiuretic hormone despite low serum osmolality usually underlies the development of hyponatremia. Treatment depends on several factors, including the cause, overall volume status of the patient, severity of hyponatremic symptoms, and duration of hyponatremia at presentation. This review focuses on the role of the vasopressin receptor antagonists, or vaptans, in the treatment of hyponatremia. These recently introduced agents have the unique ability to induce an aquaresis, the excretion of electrolyte-free water without accompanying solutes. After a brief historical perspective and discussion of pharmacologic characteristics of vaptans, we review the accumulated experience with vaptans for the treatment of hyponatremia. Vaptans have been shown to increase serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia in a reproducible manner, but their safe use requires full understanding of their indications and contraindications.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines-have they gone too far? [^117CEjPZ]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116omhxd]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting more than 15% of patients in the hospital. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the most frequent cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, mediated by nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP, previously known as antidiuretic hormone), which acts on the renal V2 receptors to promote water retention. There are a variety of underlying causes of SIAD, including malignancy, pulmonary pathology, and central nervous system pathology. In clinical practice, the etiology of hyponatremia is frequently multifactorial and the management approach may need to evolve during treatment of a single episode. It is therefore important to regularly reassess clinical status and biochemistry, while remaining alert to potential underlying etiological factors that may become more apparent during the course of treatment. In the absence of severe symptoms requiring urgent intervention, fluid restriction (FR) is widely endorsed as the first-line treatment for SIAD in current guidelines, but there is considerable controversy regarding second-line therapy in instances where FR is unsuccessful, which occurs in around half of cases. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of SIAD, and summarize recent evidence for therapeutic options beyond FR, with a focus on tolvaptan, urea, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.

### Association of hyponatremia with bone mineral density and fractures: a narrative review [^114x3KJW]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent studies suggest a possible association of hyponatremia with osteoporosis, falls and bone fractures. The objectives of this narrative review were to further explore this association and the related pathophysiological mechanisms and to suggest a practical approach to patients with osteoporosis or chronic hyponatremia in clinical practice. We conducted an extensive PubMed search until October 2022 with the combination of the following keywords: 'hyponatremia' or 'sodium' or 'SIADH' and 'fractures' or 'bone' or 'osteoporosis', as MeSH Terms. Review of numerous observational studies confirms a significant independent association of, even mild, hyponatremia with two- to three-fold increase in the occurrence of bone fractures. Hyponatremia is a risk factor for osteoporosis with a predilection to affect the hip, while the magnitude of association depends on the severity and chronicity of hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia also increases the risk for falls by inducing gait instability and neurocognitive deficits. Besides the detrimental impact of hyponatremia on bone mineral density and risk of falls, it also induces changes in bone quality. Emerging evidence suggests that acute hyponatremia shifts bone turnover dynamics towards less bone formation, while hyponatremia correction increases bone formation. The key unanswered question whether treatment of hyponatremia could improve osteoporosis and lower fracture risk highlights the need for prospective studies, evaluating the impact of sodium normalization on bone metabolism and occurrence of fractures. Recommendations for clinical approach should include measurement of serum sodium in all individuals with fracture or osteoporosis. Also, hyponatremia, as an independent risk factor for fracture, should be taken into consideration when estimating the likelihood for future fragility fracture and in clinical decision-making about pharmacological therapy of osteoporosis. Until it is proven that normalization of sodium can lower fracture occurrence, correcting hyponatremia cannot be universally recommended on this basis, but should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

### Approach to the treatment of the infant with hyponatremia [^115kLSEy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an electrolyte abnormality that occurs in infancy due to a variety of inherited and acquired disorders. Infants with hyponatremia can present with neurologic symptoms such as vomiting, weakness, and seizures. Common causes of hyponatremia in the infant population are excess ingestion or administration of hypotonic fluids and excessive gastrointestinal salt loss. Hyponatremia in infancy also can be a sign of less common disorders, such as mineralocorticoid deficiency or resistance, and disregulation of arginine vasopressin with impaired free-water removal. Treatment of infants with hyponatremia is dependent on the severity of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia. In nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (NSIAD), fluid retention is due to a gain-of-function mutation in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene leading to low arginine vasopressin levels. We describe the case of an infant with hyponatremia due to NSIAD, whose mother also has a known mutation in the AVPR2 gene. We report the approach to the treatment of hyponatremia and its unique challenges in infancy.

### Hyponatremia in the cancer patient [^1135vqck]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder observed in a wide variety of malignancies and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Newer cancer therapies have improved patient outcomes while contributing to new cases of hyponatremia. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of vasopressin- and non-vasopressin-mediated hyponatremia. Acute and symptomatic forms of hyponatremia require urgent intervention, and recent findings support the correction of chronic "asymptomatic" hyponatremia. Optimizing hyponatremia may reduce medical costs, and improve cancer survival likelihood and quality of life. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hyponatremia in the cancer patient.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to severity grading (based on symptoms), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to classify hyponatremia based on the symptomatic presentation:

- moderate: any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of moderate symptoms (nausea without vomiting, confusion, or headache)

- severe: any biochemical degree of hyponatremia in the presence of severe symptoms (vomiting, altered level of consciousness, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress).

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^11168QRU]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

### Etiology and clinical features of patients with hyponatremia in the emergency department: a cross-sectional study [^1121opW3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, affects a significant portion of the population, particularly in emergency and hospitalized settings. This study aimed to investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of hyponatremia in emergency department patients.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included 997 patients diagnosed with hyponatremia in the emergency department between June 2019 and May 2024. We investigated the causes of hyponatremia through medical interviews, blood tests, and urinalysis.

Results

We found that for every 1-year increase in age, serum sodium levels in patients with hyponatremia decreased by 0.14 mmol/L, whereas for every 1 mg/dL increase in serum uric acid, the serum sodium levels increased by 0.125 mmol/L. The leading cause of hyponatremia was the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), accounting for 357 cases (35.8%). However, a significant number of patients showed a similar diagnostic pattern to that of SIAD but were diagnosed with other conditions, such as cerebral salt wasting (31cases, 5.8%), renal salt wasting (23 cases, 3.8%), and mineralocorticoid-responsive hyponatremia of the elderly (17 cases, 1.8%). Many patients initially diagnosed with SIAD were later found to have one of these alternative conditions upon further evaluation. Fractional excretion values of phosphate and uric acid effectively distinguished SIAD from other conditions.

Conclusion

Hyponatremia in the emergency department has diverse causes, with overlapping diagnostic criteria for SIAD and related conditions, though treatment strategies vary significantly. Accurate differential diagnosis is crucial to optimizing patient outcomes. Recognizing the range of underlying causes can help clinicians improve treatment strategies for hyponatremia in emergency settings.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- Definition: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- Pathophysiology: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- Disease course: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^114nfxLE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

### The prevalence and mortality of hyponatremia is seriously underestimated in Chinese general medical patients: an observational retrospective study [^113ygKRy]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

A strong association between hyponatremia and increased in-patient mortality has been demonstrated in our study and several other studies. However, whether hyponatremia by itself contributes to mortality or merely represents a surrogate marker for the severity of the underlying diseases remains a contentious issue. Some authors have suggested that hyponatremia merely reflects other co-morbidities, i.e. an epiphenomenon of illness. Others have argued that hyponatremia itself contributes independently to in-hospital death and is the probable cause of excess mortality. In our study, the review of patients with severe hyponatremia who died showed that death was mostly attributable to conditions other than hyponatremia. The outcome analysis showed that CCI and age were the only significant predictive risk factors for mortality in severe hyponatremia. These results may challenge the hypothesis that a causal link exists between hyponatremia and mortality. Hyponatremia can be a marker of the severity of an underlying disease. Similar to the results found by Chawla et al. once the serum sodium concentration fell below 120 mmol/L, the mortality rate did not appear to increase as the severity of hyponatremia worsened. Additionally, a recent study found that a decrease in serum sodium below a threshold of 132 mmol/L did not contribute to a further increase in overall mortality risk. Although the dose–response effect of progressive hyponatremia on mortality has been noted in other previous studies, the paucity of data regarding the effect of hyponatremia on in-hospital mortality highlights the need for more studies to address this critical question. Another possibility here is a survivorship bias-a phenomenon commonly referred to as "depletion of susceptibles", i.e. those remaining in the cohort are likely resistant to the effect of hyponatremia on mortality.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^116DDwPZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyponatremia is frequently observed in cancer patients and can be explained by malignant disease itself, concomitant comorbidities, physical stress (e.g. pain), or medication. In hospitalized cancer patients, hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality and length of hospital stay, and higher costs. It is widely accepted that the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) due to ectopic release of vasopressin accounts for the majority of cases. However, drugs including chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies, hypo- or hypervolemia, as well as other less frequent disorders such as adrenal insufficiency, myxedema, etc. must be ruled out as possible alternative causes. Diagnostic work-up is often viewed as complex, and treatment is considered cumbersome and potentially dangerous. However, despite the urgent need for better education on how to approach the hyponatremic patient, no evidence-based guideline for hyponatremia management specific to cancer patients is available. Current management strategies are not well characterized.

The multinational Hyponatremia Registry (NCT01240668) assessed the current state of treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in real-world hospital settings. This report focuses on the subgroup of patients with cancer and SIADH with the aim to determine which diagnostic and treatment modalities are employed, how effective they are, and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum [Na +].

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^112nQieF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) management principles and heat illness definition — For this guideline, heat illness is defined "as any total body water deficit (> 2% of body weight) that can occur from sweat loss during physical activity in high environmental temperatures". When EAH is confirmed or strongly suspected, "empiric treatment of symptomatic EAH is an acceptable option", and "treatment options should be predicated on the presence (or absence) of neurologic impairment to differentiate mild EAH from severe EAH and guide resuscitative choices". The page notes this algorithmic empiric approach "can be lifesaving and is unlikely (but unconfirmed) to induce harm", and emphasizes that "individuals can rapidly progress from mild to severe EAH", so "initial resuscitation and symptomatic care to minimize morbidity and progression of disease are of paramount importance".

### Exercise-associated hyponatremia: updated guidelines… [^113KnqfC]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

- Mild EAH is treated with fluid restriction and oral hypertonic solutions, or salty foods can be added. From the AFP Editors Exercise-associated hyponatremia occurs when exertion results in sodium concentration less than 135 mEq per L, and symptoms can present up to 24 hours after physical activity. When asymptomatic ultramarathon participants are screened, up to one-half demonstrate hyponatremia. The usual cause of EAH is overhydration with hypotonic fluids such as water or sports drinks. Although fluids are lost through sweat during exercise, determining fluid replacement based on weight loss during prolonged exercise does not prevent EAH. Changes in antidiuretic hormone levels can predispose to EAH, and ADH levels increase with pain, stress, exercise, nausea, and hypoglycemia. Common medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can also increase ADH.

Because EAH is caused by overconsumption of hypotonic oral fluids and inappropriately elevated ADH levels, affected people most often have elevated or normal total body water. Hypovolemic EAH is uncommon and associated with chronic diuretic use and older age. The increased desire for high-sodium foods after prolonged sweating suggests that salt can be replaced orally. Sodium-rich foods and fluids should be available during lengthy exertion in high temperatures, although they will not prevent EAH when overdrinking occurs. Diagnosis of EAH will most often depend on a history of aggressive hydration and temperatures that are normal or minimally elevated. Overlapping symptoms make clinical assessment challenging. Without mental status changes, orthostatic symptoms and thirst can suggest heat illness, whereas bloating and lack of thirst can suggest EAH. MILD EAH Mild EAH often manifests as bloating, weight gain, and lack of orthostasis.

Fluid restriction is the primary treatment until significant diuresis occurs. External cooling can be added, and intravenous hypotonic or isotonic fluid should be avoided. In mild EAH, salt can be replaced through oral hypertonic solutions such as three to four bouillon cubes or three ramen seasoning packets per 125 mL of water, or by consumption of salty foods. Intravenous hypertonic saline may be used if anti-emetics are ineffective in enabling oral intake.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^112q1gbT]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.
