## Question

A 3 month-old baby develops Azotemia following a Massive Gastroenteritis. Your most likely diagnosis is: a) Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis b) Tubular Necrosis c) Systemic Lupus Nephritis d) Goodpasture's Syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely in a 3-month-old infant who develops azotemia after massive gastroenteritis, with options including post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, systemic lupus nephritis, and Goodpasture syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the most common pathophysiology of azotemia after severe diarrhea in infants. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and eliminate entities that are epidemiologically or clinically implausible in this age group. Next, I will review the pathophysiology linking gastroenteritis to prerenal azotemia and intrinsic renal injury. Finally, I will weigh the competing options and select the most likely diagnosis with supporting evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the likely mechanism of azotemia here. Massive gastroenteritis in infants causes large fluid and electrolyte losses, leading to hypovolemia and prerenal azotemia; if hypoperfusion persists, ischemic acute tubular necrosis can develop, so the most straightforward explanation is prerenal azotemia progressing to ATN in the setting of severe dehydration and shock physiology, which is repeatedly emphasized in pediatric AKI literature and reviews of diarrheal illness in children [^1132nmzr] [^111B78A9] [^116Xbgc1].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and eliminate the implausible options before jumping to conclusions. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis typically follows a streptococcal pharyngitis or impetigo with a latent period of roughly 10 days to 3 weeks and presents with hematuria, proteinuria, edema, and hypertension; there is no clear link to acute watery diarrhea as a trigger, making PSGN unlikely in this scenario [^112ie3aB] [^116bEynf]. Systemic lupus erythematosus and Goodpasture syndrome are exceedingly rare in a 3-month-old and would require specific serologic and clinical features not suggested by the vignette, so both are highly improbable in this age group and context [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the epidemiology of pediatric AKI after diarrheal illness to ensure I'm not missing a more common alternative. Community-acquired pediatric AKI in large cohorts frequently follows diarrhea and sepsis, with dehydration being a leading driver; in a multicenter Chinese study, diarrhea and sepsis were top risk factors for community-acquired AKI, and infants had the highest incidence, reinforcing that prerenal azotemia and ischemic ATN are common after gastroenteritis in this age group [^116jiBqk]. I should also remember that HUS is a key post-diarrheal cause of intrinsic AKI, but HUS is defined by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and AKI; the stem does not provide evidence of hemolysis or thrombocytopenia, so HUS cannot be inferred from the information given, even though it is an important consideration in infants with bloody diarrhea and AKI [^113vHbez] [^113BCiut].

> Let me think about the pathophysiology next. Severe volume depletion lowers effective arterial blood volume, triggering renal vasoconstriction and a fall in GFR, producing prerenal azotemia with disproportionate BUN elevation and oliguria. If hypoperfusion persists, tubular epithelial injury occurs, transitioning to intrinsic ATN with rising creatinine and prolonged oliguria, which fits the natural history after massive gastroenteritis in infants [^notfound]. I should double-check that this sequence is consistent with pediatric guidance on AKI recognition and management, which emphasize early identification of prerenal states and the risk of progression to ATN if uncorrected [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could the azotemia reflect a postrenal process rather than prerenal or intrinsic injury. Postrenal obstruction can cause azotemia, and there are case reports of obstructive ammonium acid urate stones complicating adenovirus gastroenteritis in infants; however, that is a rare complication and would typically present with anuria or flank pain rather than isolated azotemia after massive diarrhea, so without obstructive features, prerenal azotemia or ATN remains more likely [^113ZxKXp] [^113AGtrG].

> I will now examine the competing options against the clinical picture. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis requires a preceding streptococcal infection and a latent interval, and it is not triggered by acute nonbloody gastroenteritis, so it does not fit the temporal pattern or exposure here [^112ie3aB]. Systemic lupus nephritis and Goodpasture syndrome are systemic autoimmune diseases with characteristic serologies and age distributions that make them extremely unlikely in a 3-month-old with isolated azotemia after diarrhea, absent corroborating features such as hemoptysis, serositis, or rash [^notfound]. By contrast, prerenal azotemia and ischemic ATN directly follow hypovolemia from massive gastroenteritis and are well documented in pediatric AKI literature, aligning with the vignette's timeline and findings [^1132nmzr] [^111B78A9].

> But wait, what if the question is testing recognition of HUS as a post-diarrheal cause of AKI. I should confirm that HUS remains a critical consideration when there is AKI after diarrhea, especially with bloody stools or systemic features; however, in the absence of the defining hematologic abnormalities of MAHA and thrombocytopenia, HUS cannot be diagnosed from the information provided, even though it is a leading cause of pediatric intrinsic AKI after diarrheal illness [^113vHbez] [^113BCiut]. If additional data showed hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, HUS would move to the top of the list, but with only azotemia after massive gastroenteritis, prerenal azotemia or ATN is the most parsimonious explanation [^1132nmzr].

> Let me reconsider the age-specific implications to ensure I'm not overlooking neonatal nuances. In infants, small absolute rises in creatinine reflect large relative drops in GFR, so a modest azotemia can signal significant prerenal compromise; pediatric AKI guidance underscores early reassessment and close monitoring in children with evolving AKI, which supports the notion that dehydration-related prerenal azotemia is both common and clinically consequential in this age group [^115i5VPe] [^113opPTb] [^115tyNfE].

> Final reasoning and answer: Given a 3-month-old with azotemia after massive gastroenteritis, the most likely diagnosis is acute tubular necrosis due to prerenal hypoperfusion from severe dehydration, with prerenal azotemia as the immediate precursor if recognized early. The alternative diagnoses listed are either epidemiologically mismatched or require features not described, making them less likely in this scenario [^1132nmzr] [^111B78A9] [^116jiBqk].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)** due to renal hypoperfusion from severe dehydration and shock following massive gastroenteritis [^111B78A9]. ATN is the **most common intrinsic renal cause of AKI** in this setting, whereas post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, systemic lupus nephritis, and Goodpasture's syndrome are unlikely without specific clinical or laboratory features [^111xwvdR] [^112ie3aB].

---

## Pathophysiology of azotemia in massive gastroenteritis

Azotemia reflects elevated BUN and creatinine and can be **prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal**. In massive gastroenteritis, prerenal azotemia from dehydration and hypovolemia is common; if hypoperfusion persists, **ischemic ATN** may develop [^113AGtrG].

---

## Differential diagnosis of azotemia in a 3-month-old infant

| **Diagnosis** | **Pathophysiology** | **Clinical features** | **Likelihood in this case** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) | Ischemic injury from prolonged hypoperfusion | - Oliguria/anuria <br/> - Rising creatinine <br/> - Non-specific symptoms | High |
| Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) | Immune complex-mediated glomerular injury after streptococcal infection | - Hematuria <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Edema <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Low C3 | Low |
| Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis | Immune complex-mediated glomerular injury | - Rash <br/> - Arthritis <br/> - Fever <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Proteinuria | Low |
| Goodpasture's syndrome | Anti-GBM antibody-mediated glomerular injury | - Hemoptysis <br/> - Hematuria <br/> - Proteinuria <br/> - Rapidly progressive renal failure | Low |

## Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): the most likely diagnosis

ATN is the **most common intrinsic renal cause of AKI** in infants with severe dehydration and shock from massive gastroenteritis [^notfound]. Prolonged hypoperfusion causes tubular epithelial injury, leading to oliguria/anuria and rising creatinine [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting ATN in this case

- **Oliguria/anuria**: Common in ATN due to tubular injury and obstruction [^notfound].
- **Rising serum creatinine**: Indicates declining GFR from tubular injury [^notfound].
- **Non-specific symptoms**: Lethargy, irritability, and poor feeding are common in infants with ATN.

---

## Laboratory findings consistent with ATN

- **Elevated serum creatinine and BUN**: Reflect reduced GFR [^notfound].
- **Low urine output**: Oliguria/anuria is typical [^notfound].
- **Urine analysis**: May show muddy brown casts and tubular epithelial cells [^notfound].

---

## Management of ATN in infants

Management is **supportive**, with correction of dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, and dialysis if indicated [^116aq6id]. Prognosis is generally favorable with supportive care, though some may have persistent renal impairment [^114xiHvo].

---

## Why other diagnoses are less likely

- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)**: Requires a preceding streptococcal infection and characteristic features (hematuria, proteinuria, edema, hypertension, low C3), which are not described [^112ie3aB].
- **Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) nephritis**: Rare in infants and requires systemic features (rash, arthritis, fever) not mentioned [^notfound].
- **Goodpasture's syndrome**: Extremely rare in infants and presents with hemoptysis and rapidly progressive renal failure, not described here [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The most likely diagnosis is **acute tubular necrosis (ATN)** due to renal hypoperfusion from severe dehydration and shock following massive gastroenteritis. This diagnosis is supported by the clinical context, typical features of ATN, and the absence of findings suggesting other etiologies.

Clinical considerations

Electrolyte abnormalities in children can present diverse challenges in clinical management and various factors must be understood for effective management. Distinguishing between acute and chronic electrolyte abnormalities is important in the approach for treatment. Acute imbalances may require immediate correction to prevent complications whereas chronic imbalances may need a more gradual correction, especially in cases to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. Additionally, when a SEA is detected, physicians must be aware for potential errors in sampling or processing by considering the clinical context. This can be achieved through repeating tests to confirm the imbalance and once detected, the treatment should depend on the severity of the SEA. To ensure the detection of SEAs, physicians should have a high index of suspicion in cases involving high risk groups such as critically ill patients or those receiving intravenous fluids. Addressing these various factors can help improve overall patient management and outcomes.

Impact

The consensus neonatal modified KDIGO definition has been crucial in expanding our understanding of the epidemiology and impact of neonatal AKI. A consensus definition of neonatal AKI remains essential to continuing to advance the field. This manuscript highlights a historical perspective, the strengths, and limitations of the current neonatal AKI definition, and reflects on the optimal characteristics and utility of neonatal AKI definitions. The future of neonatal AKI lies with improved diagnostic precision and consistently incorporating neonatal risk factors into risk stratification incorporating and the deployment of novel biomarkers to aid in earlier identification and improve outcomes in neonatal AKI.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperuricemia and encephalopathy intractable to regular-dose insulin [^114D3bjt]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children less than 1 year of age is a rare occurrence. Typical presentation includes a prodrome of weight loss and polyuria with subsequent presentation to medical care when acidosis becomes symptomatic.

Case Presentation

We describe an unusual case of a previously healthy infant with a 3 days' history of constipation, presenting acutely with abdominal pain, lethargy, and dehydration. On initial evaluation, our patient had profound encephalopathy, with marked tachypnea and work of breathing. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 6.9, pCO₂ of 20 and a bicarbonate level of < 5. There was profound leukocytosis (WBC 77 K/μL), hyperuricemia (uric acid 15.9 mg/dL), and evidence of pre-renal azotemia [blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 54, Cr 0.82]. Blood glucose was > 700 mg/dL. Despite fluid resuscitation and insulin infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/h, which are the mainstays of therapy for DKA, her severe metabolic acidosis and altered mental status did not improve. Differential diagnosis for her metabolic derangements included inborn errors of metabolism, insulin receptor defects, toxic ingestions, and septic shock secondary to an underlying oncologic or intra-abdominal process. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and rasburicase. She continued to have significant shock for the first 30 h of her hospital stay, requiring moderate vasoactive support. Due to her refractory acidosis and persistent hyperglycemia, insulin infusion was increased to 0.15 units/kg/h. A hemoglobin A1C obtained on the second hospital day revealed a level of 7.4 and helped to solidify the diagnosis.

Conclusions

Metabolic acidosis in an infant requires a broad differential. Rasburicase should be considered in hyperuricemia and DKA.

The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before this study, we did a systematic review of epidemiological studies seeking to determine the causes and adverse sequelae of paediatric diarrhoea in low-income countries. We searched PubMed for new studies and review articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and Aug 31, 2018, using the search string ("diarrhea"[All Fields] OR "gastroenteritis"[All Fields]) AND ("pediatric"[All Fields] OR "child"[All Fields]) AND ("etiology"[All Fields] OR "growth faltering"[All Fields] OR "stunting"[All Fields]) AND ("developing countr"[All Fields] OR "low-income"[All Fields]). We included older reports, and articles identified in reference lists when appropriate. We identified methodologic limitations that led to knowledge gaps about the epidemiology of diarrhoeal disease among children living in developing countries. We then designed and did the Global Enterics Multicenter Study (GEMS) to elucidate the incidence, aetiology, and adverse clinical consequences of medically attended moderate-to-severe diarrhoea (MSD) among children younger than 5 years living in developing countries. However, GEMS left unanswered questions about whether the findings of GEMS were generalisable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhoea in patients presenting to health-care centres. Therefore, we updated our literature search and designed this study to simultaneously examine MSD and LSD.

Added value of this study

Using a rigorous study design and microbiological methods capable of detecting a broad array of pathogens across a diverse set of study sites with medium and high under-5 mortality, we showed that inclusion of LSD defines a far greater burden of disease without substantially altering the four most important aetiological pathogens involved — ie, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin, and Shigella spp. While children with LSD are less acutely ill than those with MSD, particularly with regard to dehydration, they have similar susceptibility to linear growth faltering following their diarrhoeal episode relative to their matched healthy controls.

Implications of all the available evidence

These findings expand the population of children experiencing adverse clinical and nutritional consequences of acute diarrhoeal illness in low-resource settings. Since MSD and LSD have similar aetiologies, mitigation of disease associated with a restricted number of aetiological agents can substantially reduce the diarrhoeal disease burden and its associated nutritional faltering.

Attacks precipitated by intercurrent illness, fasting, and/or a high protein meal — vomiting induced by metabolic disorders often follows a catabolic state induced by acute illness, fasting, or a high protein meal. A symptomatic metabolic disorder constitutes a medical emergency with substantial risks for morbidity and mortality if appropriate treatment is not instituted promptly. If a metabolic disorder is suspected, then blood and urine for testing should be obtained immediately, followed by delivery of 10% dextrose-containing intravenous fluid at a rate of 1.5 times maintenance, and consultation with a metabolic specialist should be considered. In partial urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, ammonia accumulation may present following the ingestion of a high protein meal or with fasting, and a urea cycle disorder is suggested by a plasma ammonia level of ≥ 150 μmol/L when symptomatic.

### Genetic investigation confirmed the clinical phenotype of congenital chloride diarrhea in a Hungarian patient: a case report [^117Hw1Ys]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Undiagnosed CCD is a severe condition. Only rare cases are known to have survived after the first year undiagnosed. In an affected child, an acute gastroenteritis can lead to life-threatening dehydration and hypokalemia. Lifelong electrolyte supplementation to correct the biochemical abnormalities with NaCl and KCl is the basis of management. Timely and adequate therapy determines the outcome, normal growth and development of the affected child and requires early and sufficient supplementation. Patients require fastidious follow-up to prevent long-term complications, such as renal failure and hyperuricemia. A correct diagnosis of CCD has an important impact on family planning and allows preimplantation genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnostics.

### Congenital chloride diarrhoea in a Chinese infant with a compound heterozygous SLC26A3 mutation [^116P2aw6]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital chloride diarrhoea (CCD) is an autosomal recessive condition that causes secretory diarrhoea and potentially deadly electrolyte imbalances in infants because of solute carrier family 26 member 3 (SLC26A3) gene mutations.

Case presentation

A 7-month-old Chinese infant with a history of maternal polyhydramnios presented with frequent watery diarrhoea, severe dehydration, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, failure to thrive, metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninaemia, and hyperaldosteronaemia. Genetic testing revealed a compound heterozygous SLC26A3 gene mutation in this patient (c.269_270dup and c.2006 C > A). Therapy was administered in the form of oral sodium and potassium chloride supplements, which decreased stool frequency.

Conclusions

CCD should be considered when an infant presents with prolonged diarrhoea during infancy, particularly in the context of maternal polyhydramnios and dilated foetal bowel loops.

### Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium (Hypaque) [^1161pESJ]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

A positive history of allergies or hypersensitivity does not arbitrarily contraindicate the use of a contrast agent, where a diagnostic procedure is thought essential, but caution should be exercised (see ADVERSE REACTIONS — General). Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids to avoid or minimize possible allergic reactions in such patients should be considered. Recent reports indicate that such pretreatment does not prevent serious life-threatening reactions, but may reduce both their incidence and severity.

Preparatory dehydration for angiography and CT procedures is unnecessary and may be dangerous, contributing to acute renal failure in infants, young children, the elderly, patients with preexisting renal insufficiency, patients with advanced vascular disease, and diabetic patients. Dehydration in these patients seems to be enhanced by the osmotic diuretic action of urographic agents. Overnight fluid restriction for urography may be undesirable and is considered unnecessary when using this relatively high (76%) concentration.

Although azotemia is not a contraindication, the medium should be used with great care in patients with advanced renal destruction associated with severe uremia. (See also EXCRETORY UROGRAPHY, Precautions.)

Acute renal failure has been reported in diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy and in susceptible nondiabetic patients (often elderly with preexisting renal disease) following excretory urography. Therefore, careful consideration of the potential risks should be given before performing this radiographic procedure in these patients. (See also EXCRETORY UROGRAPHY, Precautions — Preparatory Dehydration.)

### Acute kidney injury due to ammonium acid urate stones in a patient with adenovirus gastroenteritis: a case report [^113AGtrG]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute gastroenteritis with viral infection is the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants, and it is the main cause of prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI). As reported by Fujinaga et al. postrenal kidney injury may occur secondary to urinary stones associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similar cases have been reported since 2005. Postrenal AKI associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis is now widely recognized by pediatric nephrologists and urologists as a clinical pitfall. Postrenal AKI due to urinary stones associated with adenovirus gastroenteritis is extremely rare. Here, we describe a case of postrenal AKI due to obstructive ammonium acid urate stones associated with adenovirus gastroenteritis.

### Hemolytic uremic syndrome with simultaneous Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli and complement abnormalities [^114wHvwQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a common cause of acute kidney injury in children. In children, hemolytic uremic syndrome is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal infections caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or other enteric organisms. Although less common, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is triggered by multiple factors and portends a significantly worse prognosis with a high rate of recurrence.

Case Presentation

Here we discuss the case of a 10 year old Caucasian male presenting with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute kidney injury.

Conclusions

This case highlights the clinical challenges in diagnosing and managing patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome. Because of similarity in symptoms, differentiating Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli associated hemolytic uremic syndrome and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome can be challenging. However, because of the increased morbidity and mortality of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, early detection and initiation of therapy are critical. Providers must have a heightened suspicion in order to initiate supportive care or disease directed therapy in the case of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (monitoring), UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain regular serum creatinine monitoring in pediatric patients until completion of the AKI episode and, depending on remaining risk factors for AKI, thereafter, to allow timely detection of progressive or recurrent disease - the frequency of monitoring relying on clinical judgment and the balance between optimal monitoring and the burden of over-frequent venipuncture.

### Lamivudine (Epivir) [^1178vCDi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies: Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300.

Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy‑naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6.

Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677): The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of EPIVIR was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.

Neonates: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1–infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known.

### Norovirus: a novel etiologic agent in hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant [^1149XCZv]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy usually seen in infants and children below the age of 5years. It usually follows a bout of bloody diarrhea caused by Shiga toxin producing E coli and is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury. We report the first case of hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant following Norovirus gastroenteritis.

Case Presentation

A nine-month-old male infant, was admitted with an 8-day history of watery, non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting and decreased oral intake. Physical exam revealed normal blood pressure, pallor and generalized edema. Laboratory findings were significant for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and azotemia. Stool studies with Multiplex Qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR were positive for Norovirus GI/G II. His clinical course was unusually severe, complicated by oligoanuria and worsening uremia requiring peritoneal dialysis but with eventual complete recovery.

Conclusions

To our knowledge this is the first case of Norovirus associated HUS in an infant. Given the ubiquity of this virus as a major cause of diarrhea, together with the increased availability of Multiplex Qualitative PCR in reference laboratories, it is quite possible that we shall be seeing more such cases in the future.

### Absence of renal sequelae after childhood Escherichia coli O157: H7 gastroenteritis [^112bwg28]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

Although a quarter of children who survive diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome develop long-term renal sequelae, the prognosis of acute, self-limited Escherichia coli O157:H7 gastroenteritis has never been previously studied. Four years after a drinking water outbreak of E. coli O157:H7, we examined the risk of high blood pressure (> 95th percentile expected for age, sex, and height), reduced kidney function, and microalbuminuria among previously healthy children and adolescents. Of the 951 participants, 313 were asymptomatic during the outbreak, 305 had moderate symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, and 333 had severe symptoms that necessitated medical attention. An additional 23 children who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome during the outbreak were excluded from this analysis. There were no differences in mean systolic blood pressure between those who had no, moderate, or severe symptoms of acute gastroenteritis during the outbreak (109, 110, and 107 mm Hg). Similarly, there were no group differences in diastolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or random urine albumin to creatinine ratio (P ranged from 0.14 to 0.52), or in the adjusted relative risk of high blood pressure, a glomerular filtration rate < 80 ml/min per 1.73 m², or microalbuminuria (P ranged from 0.23 to 0.89). Patients who presented to medical attention with gastroenteritis during this E. coli O157:H7 outbreak had an absence of renal sequelae 4 years later. With no existing data to support screening after self-limited E. coli O157:H7 gastroenteritis, we recommend that only those children who develop recognized features of hemolytic uremic syndrome be followed for long-term renal health.

### Epidemiology and spectrum of disease of Escherichia coli O157 [^115qvCA7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains, such as E. coli O157:H7, have emerged as major diarrheal pathogens both in the United States and elsewhere. These organisms are important because gastrointestinal infection (afebrile hemorrhagic colitis) can trigger microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome). Understanding the pathophysiology of this illness is likely to lead to important new treatment interventions.

Recent Findings

It is now recognized that children with hemorrhagic colitis routinely develop a spectrum of coagulation abnormalities and that only a fraction of children develop full blown hemolytic uremic syndrome. Individual variability in expression of inflammatory mediators is likely to be a key element in determining which children progress to the severe end of the spectrum of disease. The value of antibiotic therapy is unknown.

Summary

The pathophysiology of HUS remains incompletely understood. The lag between onset of diarrhea and onset of HUS represents an opportunity to intervene and prevent renal failure. However, there currently is no way to prevent such life threatening complications. The management should focus on diagnosis and close observation so that early intervention can prevent complications.

### Acute kidney injury due to ammonium acid urate stones in a patient with adenovirus gastroenteritis: a case report [^113ZxKXp]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adenovirus gastroenteritis is a common cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants, resulting in prerenal acute kidney injury (AKI). However, postrenal AKI due to urinary stones associated with adenovirus gastroenteritis is extremely rare. Here, we describe postrenal AKI due to obstructive ammonium acid urate stones associated with adenovirus gastroenteritis.

Case Presentation

A previously healthy 6-month-old boy had an 11-day history of severe diarrhea and a 5-day history of vomiting. His stool was positive for adenovirus antigens. We initiated fluid replacement therapy. On the second hospital day, he suddenly developed anuria. Abdominal computed tomography revealed bilateral hydronephrosis, left ureteral stones, and right bladder ureteral junction stones. Laboratory data showed that the creatinine level increased to 1.00 mg/dL. We diagnosed postrenal AKI due to obstructive bilateral urinary stones. Urination with stable urine volume resumed spontaneously after hydration. A few stones were found in the urine, which consisted of ammonium acid urate (> 98%). The serum creatinine level improved to 0.25 mg/dL. He was discharged nine days after admission.

Conclusions

We suggest that adenovirus gastroenteritis be considered in pediatric patients with postrenal AKI due to urinary stones.

### Nephrotoxicity in neonates [^1112vonK]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is classified based on prerenal, intrinsic, and postrenal causes. In the newborn, AKI can occur after an insult during the prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal period. AKI is usually an underrecognized condition and its true incidence is unknown. AKI may result from the administration of a number of different nephrotoxic medications, which are often used concurrently in critically ill neonates, exponentially increasing the risk of renal injury. Drug toxicity may also compromise the formation and development of nephrons, and this is particularly important in preterm infants, who have incomplete nephrogenesis. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of different medications used in neonates, especially for the most immature infant, and the use of most medications in this population is off label. Strategies to prevent AKI include the avoidance of hypotension, hypovolemia, fluid imbalances, hypoxia, and sepsis as well as judicious use of nephrotoxic medications. Treatment strategies aim to maintain fluids and electrolytic and acid-base homeostasis, along with an adequate nutritional status. Neonates are especially prone to long-term sequelae of AKI and benefit from long-term follow-up. This review summarizes the most relevant aspects of nephrotoxicity in neonates and describes the prevention, treatment, and follow-up of AKI in neonates.

### Clinical guidelines for post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis… [^112ie3aB]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis can occur after streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infections.
- PSGN often requires hospitalization, but mild or subclinical cases can occur.
- The prognosis for PSGN is good, especially for children.
- Treatment focuses on symptom management and giving antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with PSGN. Latent period Following group A strep pharyngitis: PSGN occurs after a latent period of approximately 10 days. Following streptococcal skin infections: PSGN occurs up to 3 weeks later. Risk factors There are no known risk factors specific for PSGN. PSGN is more common in children, particularly pre-school and early school aged children. However, it can also occur in adults. Risk factors for PSGN are the same as for the preceding infection:

Clinical features The clinical features of acute glomerulonephritis include:

- Edema
- Hypertension
- Proteinuria
- Macroscopic hematuria, with urine appearing dark, reddish-brown
- Complaints of lethargy, generalized weakness, or anorexia Edema is often pronounced in the face and around the eyes, especially on arising in the morning. Laboratory findings Laboratory examination usually reveals:

- Mild normocytic normochromic anemia
- Slight hypoproteinemia
- Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine
- Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- Low total hemolytic complement and C3 complement Patients usually have decreased urine output. Urine examination often reveals protein and hemoglobin with red blood cell casts. Subclinical and mild illness Subclinical cases of PSGN with only microscopic hematuria and decreased complement levels can occur. Some individuals may have symptoms that are mild enough to not come to medical attention.

Diagnosis and testing The differential diagnosis of PSGN includes other infectious and non-infectious causes of acute glomerulonephritis. Clinical history and findings with evidence of a preceding group A strep infection should inform a PSGN diagnosis. Evidence of preceding group A strep infection can include:

- Isolation of group A strep from the throat
- Isolation of group A strep from skin lesions
- Elevated streptococcal antibodies.

### What place for ▾ racecadotril? [^113dYtBc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, there are about two billion cases of diarrhoeal disease every year and it is the second leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age, killing 1.5 million children annually.(1) The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. In the UK, the incidence of diarrhoea is about one episode per person per year,(2) and approximately 10% of children younger than 5 years old present to healthcare services with gastroenteritis each year.(3) ▾Racecadotril (Hidrasec) is the first in a new class of antidiarrhoeal drug ('enkephalinase inhibitor') that has an antisecretory mechanism and is licensed in adults, children and infants (over 3 months of age) for symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhoea or as complementary treatment when causal treatment is possible.(4–6) Here we review the evidence for racecadotril and its place in the management of acute diarrhoea.

Many paediatricians will be faced with a sick infant who on investigation is found to have hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia at some time in their career. The focus of initial management includes the treatment of potentially life-threatening hyperkalaemia with concurrent investigation aiming to elucidate whether the underlying cause reflects a primarily renal or endocrine pathology. We describe the presentation of two infants who each presented with one of the more common underlying diagnoses that led to this biochemical disturbance and discuss the approach to immediate treatment, diagnostic work-up and longer term management.

### Hemolytic-uremic syndrome [^112pSGSC]. Pediatrics in Review (2001). Low credibility.

The hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) has been recognized for more than 45 years and consists of the combination of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS occurs predominantly in children younger than 4 years of age. It is the most frequent cause of acute renal failure in children. The most common form of the syndrome (D+ HUS) occurs in healthy young children (> 6 mo to < 5 y of age) and is preceded by watery diarrhea that can evolve to hemorrhagic colitis. The diarrhea precedes the hemolysis and thrombocytopenia by 5 to 7 days; oliguria/anuria follows several days later. Although the pathogenesis is unknown, available evidence strongly suggests that endothelial cell damage is necessary. The outcome for most patients who have D+ HUS is favorable: 65% to 85% recover completely, 5% to 10% die (usually during the acute illness), recurrence is uncommon, and only a few patients slowly progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Table 6. Frequencies of Selected Grade 3–4 Laboratory Abnormalities in Pediatric Subjects in Trial ACTG300

ULN = Upper limit of normal.

Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677): The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of lamivudine was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.

Neonates: Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known.

### From acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease in children: maladaptive repair and the need for long-term surveillance-a literature review [^1132nmzr]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The evolving landscape of pediatric acute kidney injury

A startling scale and a critical blind spot

The sheer scale of pediatric AKI is startling. In high-risk settings, such as following cardiac surgery, its incidence can affect 30–50% of infants and children. Within pediatric intensive care units (PICUs), it affects approximately 10–35% of young patients. The landmark Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury, Renal Angina and Epidemiology (AWARE) study, a global snapshot of 4,683 critically ill children, found that 26.9% developed AKI within one week of ICU admission, with severe injury (KDIGO Stage 2 or 3) directly linked to a stepwise escalation in mortality. The challenge begins at birth. The Assessment of Worldwide Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology in Neonates (AWAKEN) study documented AKI in 30% of newborns, with the most vulnerable — those born before 29 weeks' gestation — experiencing a staggering incidence of 47.9%. Even among general hospital admissions, AKI is estimated to occur in 1–7% of children.

Yet, a gap often exists between this research data and clinical practice. When an AKI episode goes unrecognized, the critical window for intervention closes, increasing the odds of maladaptive repair and progression to CKD. A radical improvement in recognition is needed, driven by provider education and systemic safeguards like electronic alerts.

Shifting etiologies and a window for prevention

The etiological landscape of pediatric AKI is diverse. In developing countries, community-acquired insults such as severe dehydration from gastroenteritis, overwhelming sepsis, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) remain predominant causes. In developed nations, while these conditions are still significant contributors, there has been a shift toward a greater proportion of hospital-acquired AKI. Common causes in all settings include sepsis from infections like pneumonia or bronchiolitis, and severe dehydration.

A substantial portion of hospital-acquired cases are iatrogenic or, at the very least, predictable. Key contributors include complications of critical illness, major surgeries (particularly cardiac procedures), and exposure to a wide range of nephrotoxic medications. This predictability presents a profound opportunity. Initiatives like the Nephrotoxic Injury Negated by Just-in-time Action (NINJA) program have successfully reduced medication-associated AKI. This foresight permits robust risk stratification and the deployment of preemptive countermeasures: aggressive hydration, scrupulous dosing of nephrotoxins, and intensified monitoring. A comprehensive classification of etiologies is in Table 1.

### Hypokalemia / hyperkalemia and hyponatremia / hypernatremia [^115uaRV3]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disorders are very common in the pediatric population. Derangements in serum sodium and potassium concentrations are among the most frequently seen given the risk factors and comorbidities unique to children. Pediatricians, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, should be comfortable with the evaluation and initial treatment of disturbances in these electrolyte concentrations. However, to evaluate and treat a child with abnormal serum concentrations of sodium or potassium, it is critical to understand the regulatory physiology that governs osmotic homeostasis and potassium regulation in the body. Comprehension of these basic physiologic processes will allow the provider to uncover the underlying pathology of these electrolyte disturbances and devise an appropriate and safe treatment plan.

### Consensus-based recommendations on priority activities to address acute kidney injury in children: a modified Delphi consensus statement [^1129UC9r]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Group 1: What Will Drive the Continuing Refinement and Evolution ofAKI Epidemiology?

Consensus Statement 1A (Recommendation)

AKI epidemiology related to short-term outcomes is well-described in critically ill neonates and children from high-income countries; however, further study is needed in other health care contexts, such as low-middle income countries and in non-ICU and ambulatory settings and for socioeconomic and long-term outcomes.

Consensus Statement 1B (Suggestion)

An understanding of pediatric AKI epidemiology allows us to begin employing strategies to improve primary, secondary, and tertiary AKI prevention in at-risk patient groups.

Implementation of standardized criteria to define the presence and severity of AKI has facilitated a description of pediatric AKI epidemiology. – Prospective multicenter studies provide insight into the epidemiology of AKI in critically ill neonates and children. Other studies describe AKI epidemiology in specific cohorts of children including sepsis, those receiving nephrotoxins, and cardiac surgical populations. However, residual knowledge gaps remain regarding the accurate description of AKI epidemiology in other health care contexts as the most data come from high-income countries, and few studies have described AKI epidemiology outside critical care settings.

Pediatric literature has described AKI and morbidity, mortality, and health resource use in critically ill children with a gradient-response association between AKI severity and the risk of worse outcomes. More recently, research has focused on assessing the medium and long-term sequalae of AKI, including longitudinal kidney function and its socioeconomic outcomes.

A comprehensive description of pediatric AKI epidemiology reflects current practice and best available information (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Given this, information should be up to date and readily available to clinicians and institutions in real time. A risk prediction studyand a randomized clinical trialsuggest a causal link between pediatric AKI and a limited scope of short-term outcomes, supporting prevention and mitigation of pediatric AKI and its complications as targets for improving outcomes. Pediatric AKI epidemiologic characteristics can be categorized as pre-event (eg, risk factors, key drivers, and predictors), peri-event (eg, demographic characteristics and etiology), and postevent (eg, outcomes and recovery). Studies of AKI epidemiology should explore the temporal nature of AKI, health contexts (eg, populations and locations) in which AKI has been inadequately described, and outcomes that are focused on patient, family, cost, and performance. Thus, by following epidemiologic trends, clinicians can help focus efforts to enhance public health surveillance, augment field investigations, clinical and preclinical studies, and further policy development to promote child health (eBox and eBackground in the Supplement).

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^112w9meR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Although acute diarrhoea is a self‐limiting disease, dehydration may occur in some children. Dehydration is the consequence of an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in liquid stools. When these losses are high and not replaced adequately, severe dehydration appears. Severe dehydration is corrected with intravenous solutions. The most frequently used solution for this purpose is 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate) are alternatives to 0.9% saline and have been associated with fewer days of hospitalization and better biochemical outcomes. Available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations. It is unclear whether 0.9% saline or balanced intravenous fluids are most effective for rehydrating children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of balanced solutions for the rapid rehydration of children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, in terms of time in hospital and mortality compared to 0.9% saline.

Search methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 May 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea comparing balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate or Plasma‐Lyte with 0.9% saline solution, for rapid rehydration.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. time in hospital and 2. mortality. Our secondary outcomes were 3. need for additional fluids, 4. total amount of fluids received, 5. time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, 6. change in and the final values of biochemical measures (pH, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine), 7. incidence of acute kidney injury, and 8. adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main results

Characteristics of the included studies

We included five studies with 465 children. Data for meta‐analysis were available from 441 children. Four studies were conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries and one study in two high‐income countries. Four studies evaluated Ringer's lactate, and one study evaluated Plasma‐Lyte. Two studies reported the time in hospital, and only one study reported mortality as an outcome. Four studies reported final pH and five studies reported bicarbonate levels. Adverse events reported were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia in two studies each.

Risk of bias

All studies had at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment informed the GRADE assessments.

Primary outcomes

Compared to 0.9% saline, the balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in hospital (mean difference (MD) −0.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.60 to −0.10; 2 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of the balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; 1 study, 22 children; very low‐certainty evidence).

Secondary outcomes

Balanced solutions probably produce a higher increase in blood pH (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 4 studies, 366 children; low‐certainty evidence) and bicarbonate levels (MD 2.44 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.97; 443 children, four studies; low‐certainty evidence). Furthermore, balanced solutions likely reduces the risk of hypokalaemia after the intravenous correction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; 2 studies, 147 children; moderate‐certainty evidence).

Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions may result in no difference in the need for additional intravenous fluids after the initial correction; in the amount of fluids administered; or in the mean change of sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction.

Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.

### A 9-day-old with weight loss and diarrhea [^112S8PBk]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 9-day-old infant girl presented with diarrhea and weight loss of 19% since birth. She was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks' gestation to a mother positive for group B Streptococcus who received adequate intrapartum prophylaxis. The infant was formula-fed every 2 to 3 hours with no reported issues with feeding or swallowing. The infant had nonmucoid watery stools ∼5 to 15 times per day. Her family history was significant for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in several of her family members. Her initial vital signs and physical examination were normal. Laboratory data on hospital admission showed a normal complete blood cell count, but her chemistry analysis revealed significant hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury. Her hypernatremia was resistant to fluid management. In this article, we discuss the infant's hospital course, our clinical thought process, and how we arrived at our final diagnosis.

### Comparison of clinical associations and laboratory abnormalities in children with moderate and severe dehydration [^113BXjMY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To search for possible early clinical associations and laboratory abnormalities in children with severe dehydration in northern Jordan.

Patients and Methods

We prospectively evaluated 251 children with acute gastroenteritis. Dehydration assessment was done following a known clinical scheme. Probable clinical associations and laboratory abnormalities were examined against the preassigned dehydration status.

Results

Children with severe dehydration had significantly more hypernatremia and hyperkalemia, less isonatremia, and higher mean levels of urea, creatinine, and glucose (P < 0.005). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed statistically significant area under the curve values for laboratory variables. These area under the curve values were 0.991 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.980–1.001) for serum urea, 0.862 (95% CI 0.746–0.978) for sodium, 0.850 (95% CI 0.751–0.949) for creatinine, 0.69 (95% CI 0.555–0.824) for potassium, and 0.684 (95% CI 0.574–0.795) for glucose (P < 0.05 for all). Certain independent serum cutoff levels of urea, creatinine, sodium, glucose, and potassium had high negative predictive value (100%), whereas other cutoff values for each, except potassium, had high positive predictive value (100%) for severe dehydration. Historic clinical characteristics of patients did not correlate to dehydration degree.

Conclusions

Serum urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and glucose were useful independently in augmenting clinical examination to diagnose the degree of dehydration status among children presenting with gastroenteritis. Serum urea performed the best among all. On the contrary, none of the examined historical clinical patterns could be correlated to the dehydration status. Larger and multicenter studies are needed to validate our results and to examine their impact on final outcomes.

Fluid management in infectious diarrhea — Isotonic intravenous fluids such as lactated Ringer's and normal saline solution should be administered when there is severe dehydration, shock, or altered mental status and failure of oral rehydration solution (ORS) therapy (strong, high) or ileus (strong, moderate). In people with ketoemia, an initial course of intravenous hydration may be needed to enable tolerance of oral rehydration (weak, low). In severe dehydration, intravenous rehydration should be continued until pulse, perfusion, and mental status normalize and the patient awakens, has no risk factors for aspiration, and has no evidence of ileus (strong, low), after which the remaining deficit can be replaced by using ORS (weak, low). Infants, children, and adults with mild to moderate dehydration should receive ORS until clinical dehydration is corrected (strong, low), and once rehydrated, maintenance fluids should be administered with replacement of ongoing stool losses with ORS until diarrhea and vomiting are resolved (strong, low).

### Norovirus: a novel etiologic agent in hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant [^1163GJMS]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Noroviruses constitute a major cause of foodborne illness and are responsible for at least 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. They are divided into at least six geno groups, designated GI-GVl, based on the amino acid sequence in the major structural protein and further subdivided into at least 38 genotypes. Norovirus gastroenteritis is characterized by sudden onset of fever, nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps with an incubation period of 12 to 48-h. Symptoms typically last 24 to 60 h. Reverse-transcriptase PCR or enzyme immunoassay testing of stool specimens can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is usually symptomatic and supportive, limited to oral or intravenous hydration.

Two adults with suspected norovirus related HUS have been reported. The first was an 82-year Japanese man with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. The patient developed AKI following a bout of non-bloody diarrhea superimposed on his CKD stage 3. There was evidence of TMA and he required acute and subsequently, chronic hemodialysis. Norovirus antigen was identified in a fecal sample by enzyme immunoassay. The second was a 42-year old female with chronic interstitial nephritis, who presented with worsening renal function and markers of nonimmune vascular hemolysis two years post renal transplant, and was found to have norovirus by enzyme immunoassay on fecal sample. In our patient with HUS and severe AKI, Norovirus Gl/Gll was detected in 2 separate stool specimens by multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR, while all other gastrointestinal pathogens, including STEC, stx₁/stx₂ were negative. This provides substantive evidence for the role of Norovirus in the causation of HUS. Detection of stool pathogens by multiplex PCR has been found to be a reliable method and has become commercially available. We believe that the virus or viral antigens caused endothelial damage by direct invasion initiating an inflammatory response and activation of the complement cascade with platelet activation and aggregation with subsequent microangiopathic hemolysis. Unlike atypical HUS and some cases of STEC HUS where the alternate complement pathway is activated and only C3 is low, our patient's low C3 and C4 suggests activation of the classical complement pathway as is usually seen in post infectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis and other immune complex mediated renal diseases. While beyond the scope of this report, the main difference between these two pathways is that the C3 convertase in the alternate pathway is C3bBb and activation occurs spontaneously and continuously, whereas in the classical pathway, the convertase is C4bC2b with activation occurring via C1qrs complex and cleavage of C4b and C2b. That may explain why the early components of the complement cascade (C1-C4) are low with classical pathway activation whereas a low C3 alone is suggestive of alternate pathway activation. We realize that since we did not look for mutations or antibodies to complement proteins (CFH, CFI, and MCP), atypical HUS, with the Norovirus infection acting as a trigger in a susceptible individual, cannot be ruled out and this is a limitation in our report. However, the complete clinical recovery, together with the return to normal of both complement components (C3, C4) without the need of plasma therapy or Eculizumab makes that possibility less likely. Also, the patient has been followed up for 11 months since hospital discharge with serial measurements of his blood pressure, hemogram, kidney function, complement levels and urine albumin excretion which have all been normal. Long term follow up is needed, however, and in the event of a relapse, genetic studies to detect mutations in complement proteins will be performed.

### Timing and risk factors associated with acute kidney injury in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis [^115HGFuT]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the prevalence, onset, risk factors, and mortality associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Design/Methods

Retrospective study at 2 centers in infants with NEC, with/without AKI. AKI assessed by serum creatinine and urine output. Statistical tests used included t, Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, and Fisher Exact tests.

Results

Among 80 eligible infants with NEC, 56 (70%) had AKI. Median onset of NEC was day 15, with median AKI onset two days (IQR, -5.75 to 0) prior to NEC onset. Vasopressors were significantly more likely to be used in infants with NEC and AKI (p = 0.009). Increased mortality (p = 0.01) was noted in infants with NEC and AKI.

Conclusions

The onset of AKI mostly precedes NEC onset, with moderate to severe AKI more prevalent than the milder form in infants with NEC. These infants are significantly more likely to be hemodynamically unstable and have increased mortality.

Evidence for oral rehydration solution (ORS) and solution osmolality — The safety and efficacy of ORS, in comparison to intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT), was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 1811 patients aged < 18 years from high-income and low-income countries, with no important clinical differences in failure to hydrate, weight gain at discharge, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, duration of diarrhea, or total fluid intake at 6 or 24 hours between children receiving ORS and IVT; the model estimated that 4% of children treated with ORS would fail and require IVT, and historically standard WHO-ORS (osmolarity 311 mmol/L) was recommended, but in 2002 a hypotonic ORS with total osmolality < 250 mmol/L was recommended by the WHO and other advisory bodies as first-line therapy for mild to moderate dehydration caused by diarrhea of all causes.

### Incidence, aetiology and outcome of community-acquired acute kidney injury in medical admissions in Malawi [^11272abm]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological data on Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) from low-income countries is sparse. The aim of this study was to establish the incidence, severity, aetiology, and outcomes of community-acquired AKI in Malawi.

Methods

We conducted a prospective observational study of general medical admissions to a tertiary hospital in Blantyre between 27 th April and 17 th July 2015. All patients were screened on admission with a serum creatinine; those with creatinine above laboratory reference range were managed by the nephrology team. Hospital outcome was recorded in all patients.

Results

Eight hundred ninety-two patients were included; 188 (21·1%) had kidney disease on admission, including 153 (17·2%) with AKI (median age 41 years; 58·8% HIV seropositive). 60·8% of AKI was stage 3. The primary causes of AKI were sepsis and hypovolaemia in 133 (86·9%) cases, most commonly gastroenteritis (n = 29; 19·0%) and tuberculosis (n = 18; 11·8%). AKI was multifactorial in 117 (76·5%) patients; nephrotoxins were implicated in 110 (71·9%). Inpatient mortality was 44·4% in patients with AKI and 13·9% if no kidney disease (p < 0.0001). 63·2% of patients who recovered kidney function left hospital with persistent kidney injury.

Conclusion

AKI incidence is 17·2% in medical admissions in Malawi, the majority is severe, and AKI leads to significantly increased in-hospital mortality. The predominant causes are infection and toxin related, both potentially avoidable and treatable relatively simply. Effective interventions are urgently required to reduce preventable young deaths from AKI in this part of the world.

### Glomerulonephritis… [^111xwvdR]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Glomerulonephritis encompasses several disorders that cause glomerular inflammation and injury through an interplay of immune-mediated mechanisms, host characteristics, and environmental triggers, such as infections. GN can manifest solely in the kidney or in the setting of a systemic illness, and presentation can range from chronic and relatively asymptomatic hematuria to fulminant renal failure. Classic acute GN is characterized by hematuria, edema, and hypertension, the latter 2 of which are the consequence of sodium and water retention in the setting of renal impairment. Although presenting signs and symptoms and a compatible clinical history can suggest GN, serologic and urinary testing can further refine the differential diagnosis, and renal biopsy can be used for definitive diagnosis. Treatment of GN can include supportive care, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade, immunomodulatory therapy, and renal transplant.

Prognosis is largely dependent on the underlying cause of GN and can vary from a self-limited course to chronic kidney disease. This review focuses on lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, and postinfectious GN. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments.

### Treatment and management of children with haemolytic uraemic syndrome [^112JWAgW]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), comprising microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and acute kidney injury, remains the leading cause of paediatric intrinsic acute kidney injury, with peak incidence in children aged under 5 years. HUS most commonly occurs following infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS). Additionally, HUS can occur as a result of inherited or acquired dysregulation of the alternative complement cascade (atypical HUS or aHUS) and in the setting of invasive pneumococcal infection. The field of HUS has been transformed by the discovery of the central role of complement in aHUS and the dawn of therapeutic complement inhibition. Herein, we address these three major forms of HUS in children, review the latest evidence for their treatment and discuss the management of STEC infection from presentation with bloody diarrhoea, through to development of fulminant HUS.

### Failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis, and diarrhea in a 7-week-old infant [^114uXWPg]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

A 7-week-old infant presented to the emergency department with fussiness, decreased oral intake, loose stool, and respiratory distress for 2 days. The patient was born full-term with an uncomplicated birth history but had a history of slow weight gain. He was alert, but toxic-appearing at presentation, hypothermic with signs of dehydration, and with respiratory failure. He was found to have severe anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, elevated lactate, and hyperammonemia. He responded well to initial resuscitation and was admitted to the ICU for intravenous electrolyte replacement, bowel rest, and respiratory support. A workup was pursued for failure to thrive with severe malnutrition, hyperammonemia, hyperlactatemia, anemia, vitamin D deficiency, and electrolyte abnormalities. After stabilization, he was restarted on enteral feeds and had a recurrence of loose stool and severe electrolyte abnormalities, which were refractory to enteral supplementations and required readmission to the ICU. His hospital course extended several weeks, included several subspecialty consultations, and ended with a surprising diagnosis of exclusion based on his clinical response to therapy.

### Recent developments in the detection and management of acute kidney injury [^116aq6id]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

With established AKI or resistant fluid overload, RRT is required and here continuous haemofiltration or peritoneal dialysis are more suitable for haemodynamically unstable patients as opposed to intermittent haemodialysis, which is associated with more hypotensive episodes. Importantly, nutrition should not be overlooked in children with AKI as underfeeding can be accentuated by AKI. The enteral mode of nutrition is preferred and this should start in the early phase of AKI, unless there are contraindications such as active colitis. Finally it is important that children with AKI have appropriate follow-up to ensure recovery, prevent further episodes of AKI and to screen for progression to CKD. Since progression of kidney disease is silent, there is a strong argument for lifelong screening of blood pressure and urinalysis in children who have experienced an episode of AKI.

### Lamivudine [^115k3gqn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Paresthesias and Peripheral Neuropathies Paresthesias and peripheral neuropathies were reported in 15 subjects (15%) in Trial NUCA2002, 6 subjects (9%) in Trial NUCA2005, and 2 subjects (less than 1%) in Trial ACTG300.

Selected laboratory abnormalities experienced by therapy-naive (less than or equal to 56 days of antiretroviral therapy) pediatric subjects are listed in Table 6.

ULN = Upper limit of normal.

Pediatric Subjects Once-Daily versus Twice-Daily Dosing (COL105677): The safety of once-daily compared with twice-daily dosing of lamivudine was assessed in the ARROW trial. Primary safety assessment in the ARROW trial was based on Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse events. The frequency of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events was similar among subjects randomized to once-daily dosing compared with subjects randomized to twice-daily dosing. One event of Grade 4 hepatitis in the once-daily cohort was considered as uncertain causality by the investigator and all other Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were considered not related by the investigator.

Neonates

Limited short-term safety information is available from 2 small, uncontrolled trials in South Africa in neonates receiving lamivudine with or without zidovudine for the first week of life following maternal treatment starting at Week 38 or 36 of gestation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Selected adverse reactions reported in these neonates included increased liver function tests, anemia, diarrhea, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, jaundice and hepatomegaly, rash, respiratory infections, and sepsis; 3 neonates died (1 from gastroenteritis with acidosis and convulsions, 1 from traumatic injury, and 1 from unknown causes). Two other nonfatal gastroenteritis or diarrhea cases were reported, including 1 with convulsions; 1 infant had transient renal insufficiency associated with dehydration. The absence of control groups limits assessments of causality, but it should be assumed that perinatally exposed infants may be at risk for adverse reactions comparable to those reported in pediatric and adult HIV-1-infected patients treated with lamivudine-containing combination regimens. Long-term effects of in utero and infant lamivudine exposure are not known.

### Balanced crystalloid solutions versus 0.9% saline for treating acute diarrhoea and severe dehydration in children [^112ZPidS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although acute diarrhoea is a self-limiting disease, dehydration may occur in some children. Dehydration is the consequence of an increased loss of water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate) in liquid stools. When these losses are high and not replaced adequately, severe dehydration appears. Severe dehydration is corrected with intravenous solutions. The most frequently used solution for this purpose is 0.9% saline. Balanced solutions (e.g. Ringer's lactate) are alternatives to 0.9% saline and have been associated with fewer days of hospitalization and better biochemical outcomes. Available guidelines provide conflicting recommendations. It is unclear whether 0.9% saline or balanced intravenous fluids are most effective for rehydrating children with severe dehydration due to diarrhoea.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of balanced solutions for the rapid rehydration of children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea, in terms of time in hospital and mortality compared to 0.9% saline.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials in children with severe dehydration due to acute diarrhoea comparing balanced solutions, such as Ringer's lactate or Plasma-Lyte with 0.9% saline solution, for rapid rehydration.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. time in hospital and 2.

Mortality

Our secondary outcomes were 3. need for additional fluids, 4. total amount of fluids received, 5. time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, 6. change in and the final values of biochemical measures (pH, bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine), 7. incidence of acute kidney injury, and 8.

Adverse Events

We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Characteristics of the included studies We included five studies with 465 children. Data for meta-analysis were available from 441 children. Four studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries and one study in two high-income countries. Four studies evaluated Ringer's lactate, and one study evaluated Plasma-Lyte. Two studies reported the time in hospital, and only one study reported mortality as an outcome. Four studies reported final pH and five studies reported bicarbonate levels. Adverse events reported were hyponatremia and hypokalaemia in two studies each. Risk of bias All studies had at least one domain at high or unclear risk of bias. The risk of bias assessment informed the GRADE assessments. Primary outcomes Compared to 0.9% saline, the balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in hospital (mean difference (MD) -0.35 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.60 to -0.10; 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of the balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.39; 1 study, 22 children; very low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes Balanced solutions probably produce a higher increase in blood pH (MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 4 studies, 366 children; low-certainty evidence) and bicarbonate levels (MD 2.44 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.97; 443 children, four studies; low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, balanced solutions likely reduces the risk of hypokalaemia after the intravenous correction (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.96; 2 studies, 147 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions may result in no difference in the need for additional intravenous fluids after the initial correction; in the amount of fluids administered; or in the mean change of sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of balanced solutions on mortality during hospitalization in severely dehydrated children. However, balanced solutions likely result in a slight reduction of the time in the hospital compared to 0.9% saline. Also, balanced solutions likely reduce the risk of hypokalaemia after intravenous correction. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that balanced solutions compared to 0.9% saline probably produce no changes in the need for additional intravenous fluids or in other biochemical measures such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and creatinine levels. Last, there may be no difference between balanced solutions and 0.9% saline in the incidence of hyponatraemia.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114JmKZm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — features linked to complications or severe disease: People of all ages with acute diarrhea should be evaluated for dehydration, which increases the risk of life-threatening illness and death, especially among the young and older adults (strong, high). When the clinical or epidemiologic history suggests a possible Shiga toxin–producing organism, diagnostic approaches should be applied that detect Shiga toxin (or the genes that encode them) and distinguish E. coli O157:H7 from other STEC (Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli) in stool (strong, moderate); if available, diagnostic approaches that can distinguish between Shiga toxin 1 and Shiga toxin 2, which is typically more potent, could be used (weak, moderate), and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 and, rarely, other pathogens may produce Shiga toxin and should be considered as a cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), especially with suggestive international travel or personal contact with a traveler (strong, moderate). Clinicians should evaluate people for postinfectious and extraintestinal manifestations associated with enteric infections (strong, moderate). Supporting risk data include that volume depletion is a frequently identified risk factor for diarrhea-related deaths; dehydration at admission among children with postdiarrheal HUS is associated with an increased need for dialysis; intravenous fluid during the diarrhea phase of STEC infections reduces the risk of oligoanuric renal failure; and although most patients with laboratory-confirmed STEC who develop HUS have bloody diarrhea, approximately 10% do not; factors independently associated with increased risk of STEC O157 include abdominal tenderness and absence of fever at first medical evaluation, and approximately 65% will have a peripheral white blood cell count > 10000 cells/μL.

Lower-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) — acid suppression therapy: Clinicians Should Not Prescribe Acid Suppression Therapy for Infants Presenting With a Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, and the strength is a Moderate recommendation. Benefits are to "Reduce unnecessary medication use, adverse effects, and cost from treatment with unproven efficacy", while risks are to "Delay treatment of rare but undiagnosed gastrointestinal diseases, which could lead to complications (eg, esophagitis)", with the benefit-harm assessment that "The benefits of reducing medication adverse effects, avoiding unnecessary treatment, and reducing cost outweigh the risk of delaying treatment of gastrointestinal disease". Additionally, "the inappropriate administration of acid suppression therapy may have harmful adverse effects because it exposes infants to an increased risk of pneumonia or gastroenteritis".

Recommendation 6 — The guideline panel suggests IV fluid administration at the early treatment of acute CVS episodes guided by patient age, symptom severity, and degree of dehydration (conditional recommendation, based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state there is no research evidence regarding use of D10 vs. D5 IV fluids in this setting and no recommendations for specific IV fluids are made due to lack of evidence and potential for delay if specialized fluids are utilized; IV fluids should be determined by the evaluating clinician and provided similarly to other children with acute onset vomiting, with goals of rehydration and alleviation of electrolyte disturbances and ketosis. Background notes that a prior pediatric expert consensus recommended dextrose 10% (D10) over dextrose 5% (D5), but the guideline panel found no published evidence supporting this practice, and the panel was unable to judge the desirable effects of D10 versus D5 given the lack of evidence.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — prevention and management notes that avoiding dehydration by ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake for replacement and maintenance is the mainstay of diarrheal illness management. People with diarrhea should refrain from recreational water activities, food preparation or service, and sexual activities while symptomatic. Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents and risk of worsening illness (such as diarrhea associated with C. difficile) can result from antimicrobial and antimotility drug use and highlight the need for appropriate use of these interventions. The burden of acute gastroenteritis has been reduced since implementation of 2 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed rotavirus vaccines, recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 2006 and 2008, and clinically significant disease and hospitalization and office visits have been decreased in infants who have received a rotavirus vaccine as well as in adults through community protection.

### The contrasting characteristics of acute kidney injury in developed and developing countries [^111B78A9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become increasingly prevalent in both developed and developing countries, and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality, especially in children. Uncertainty regarding the true incidence of AKI limits awareness of the problem, thereby reducing political visibility of the disorder and hampering efforts to prevent its occurrence. In developed countries, AKI occurs predominantly in urban intensive care units and is associated with multiorgan failure and sepsis, high mortality, and occurrence in older populations. While cases of AKI in urban areas of the developing world have similar characteristics to those in the developed world, AKI in rural regions commonly develops in response to a single disease and specific conditions (e.g. gastroenteritis) or infections (e.g. severe malaria, leptospirosis, or hemolytic-uremic syndrome) and in younger otherwise healthy individuals. Many causes of AKI in rural settings, such as diarrhea, poisoning, malaria, or septic abortion, can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, and regional levels. Treatment with dialysis is often unavailable or too costly in developing regions, so there must be community-wide efforts to eradicate causes of AKI, expedite diagnosis, and aggressively manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. We have reviewed recent literature on AKI, identified differences and similarities in the condition between developed and developing areas, analyzed the practical implications of the identified differences, and made evidence-based recommendations for study and management.

### Norovirus: a novel etiologic agent in hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant [^116K6HUJ]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy usually seen in infants and children below the age of 5 years. It usually follows a bout of bloody diarrhea caused by Shiga toxin producing E coli and is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury. We report the first case of hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant following Norovirus gastroenteritis.

Case presentation

A nine-month-old male infant, was admitted with an 8-day history of watery, non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting and decreased oral intake. Physical exam revealed normal blood pressure, pallor and generalized edema. Laboratory findings were significant for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and azotemia. Stool studies with Multiplex Qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR were positive for Norovirus GI/G II. His clinical course was unusually severe, complicated by oligoanuria and worsening uremia requiring peritoneal dialysis but with eventual complete recovery.

Conclusions

To our knowledge this is the first case of Norovirus associated HUS in an infant. Given the ubiquity of this virus as a major cause of diarrhea, together with the increased availability of Multiplex Qualitative PCR in reference laboratories, it is quite possible that we shall be seeing more such cases in the future.

### Acute kidney injury among hospitalized children in China [^116jiBqk]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

High-quality epidemiologic data on AKI in children are particularly lacking in developing countries. This study aimed to assess the epidemiology and clinical correlates of AKI among hospitalized children in China.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We performed a multicenter study, in a cohort of hospitalized children aged 1 month to 18 years, from 25 general and children's hospitals in China during 2013–2015. We obtained patient-level data from the electronic hospitalization information system and laboratory databases of all children who had at least two serum creatinine tests within any 7-day window during their first 30 days of hospitalization. We identified AKI events according to the creatinine criteria of Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes. The in-hospital outcomes of AKI, including mortality, kidney recovery, and length of stay, were assessed. We estimated the corresponding hazard ratios using a Cox proportional hazard model, with adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical procedures.

Results

A total of 19,908 (20%) patients with AKI were identified among 101,836 pediatric inpatients, of which 7220 (7%) were community acquired and 12,688 (13%) were hospital acquired. Up to 96% of these AKI events were not diagnosed on the discharge records. The cumulative incidence of AKI in infants (28%) was twice that in adolescents (12%). The profiles of risk factors differed between community-acquired and hospital-acquired AKI and varied with age. Diarrhea and sepsis were the top risk factors for community-acquired AKI, each contributing 6% of the risk. Congenital heart disease/cardiac surgery was the major risk factor for hospital-acquired AKI, contributing to 19% of cases. Exposure to nephrotoxic drugs, mostly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and proton pump inhibitors, was common in hospitalized children and was associated with a higher risk of AKI. Death occurred in 842 out of 19,908 patients (4%) with AKI versus 450 out of 81,478 children (0.5%) without AKI. The risk of in-hospital death was higher among children with severe AKI, shock, and respiratory failure. Pediatric AKI was associated with longer hospital stay and higher daily cost, even after adjustment for covariates.

Conclusions

Pediatric AKI is common and is substantially underdiagnosed in China.

### Thrombotic microangiopathy and associated renal disorders [^115t1rm3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Shiga toxin-associated HUS

Clinical features

HUS complicating enteric infection with shiga toxin-producing bacteria was identified in 1983 and is an important cause globally of acute renal failure in childhood. STEC is the main pathogen in developed countries, accounting for over 90% of HUS cases. STEC-HUS (also called diarrhoea-positive, D + HUS) typically presents as renal failure following a bloody diarrhoeal prodrome. The prognosis in children is generally favourable with supportive measures (including dialysis), in contrast to p-HUS where mortality among infants is around 25% despite treatment. The largest recorded outbreak of STEC-HUS was centred in Germany in May 2011. The epidemic was notable for adult predominance (especially females) and high mortality during the acute phase of illness, with 36 deaths among the 845 cases (4.3%). In addition to renal failure, a significant proportion of patients developed neurological sequelae late in the disease. Available information suggests that children (representing around 12% of cases) were less severely affected, with one death among over 90 cases.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^11748BDs]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Necrotizing enterocolitis-associated acute kidney injury-transforming the paradigm [^111hki9Y]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common conditions requiring emergency surgery in the neonatal intensive care unit and is associated with a septic shock-like state contributing to multiorgan dysfunction. NEC affects 6 to 10% of very low-birth-weight infants and remains a leading cause of death. The occurrence of severe acute kidney injury (AKI) following surgical NEC is a harbinger of multiple morbidities. This review presents current evidence about the clinical impact of NEC-associated AKI on the clinical outcomes. Studies evaluating nephroprotective strategies to prevent AKI and its consequences are greatly needed to improve the postoperative recovery and clinical outcomes in neonates with NEC. Future observational studies and clinical trials in preterm infants with NEC prioritize measuring short-term (AKI) and longer term (chronic kidney disease) kidney outcomes. KEY POINTS: · Severe AKI is common following surgical NEC. · Severe AKI following NEC is associated with poor clinical outcomes. · Studies evaluating nephroprotective strategies to prevent AKI and its consequences are needed. IMPACT: · Severe AKI (stage 2 and 3) occurs in 32.6% of neonates after NEC diagnosis and in 58.7% following surgical NEC diagnosis. · NEC-associated AKI is associated with severe postoperative course, moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia, surgical complications, brain injury, and longer hospital stay in preterm infants. · Severity of NEC-associated AKI can be utilized by bedside providers for the prognostication of clinical outcomes in preterm infants.

ASSUMPTION 6: MAKING A SINGLE 60-DAY POSTENROLLMENT VISIT TO CASE AND CONTROL HOUSEHOLDS CREATES PROSPECTIVE MINI-COHORTS FOR COMPARISONS

Some diarrheal pathogens can lead to death by dehydration stemming from losses of body water and electrolytes through loose stools and vomiting, and accompanied by diminished intake. When these abnormal losses and diminished intake occur in an infant (whose daily water and electrolyte requirements per kilogram greatly exceed those of an older child or adult), and if prompt and adequate rehydration therapy is not introduced, severe dehydration, renal shutdown, and death can ensue. Some enterotoxigenic bacterial pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae O1 and some strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli can cause such severe purging that even an older child can become severely dehydrated. However, once prompt and appropriate therapy is administered, survival of the patient is virtually assured and within a few days they are back to normal. In contrast, some enteric pathogens that cause pediatric diarrhea invade the intestinal mucosa and cause much destruction accompanied by neutrophilic infiltration. Shigella is the prototype for this type of pathogen, as the mucosal destruction can result in outright bloody diarrhea (ie, dysentery). Other enteric pathogens such as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Cryptosporidium cause other forms of mucosal disruption and modification characterized by effacement of enterocytes and pedestal formation or an unusual form of shallow invasion. With pathogens such as Shigella, EPEC, and Cryptosporidium that result in striking pathologic changes in the intestinal mucosa, one cannot help but wonder whether over a more extended period of observation some episodes of diarrheal illness may result in adverse nutritional consequences and death many days beyond the initial acute injury, but by which time the subject may no longer have overt diarrhea. Presumably, cases of diarrheal illness accompanied by significant mucosal destruction or modification may be at particular risk of delayed consequences.

Etiology and pathophysiology of AKI in severe malaria

The majority of children with severe malaria had a BUN to creatinine ratio consistent with prerenal azotemia (CM, 96.5%; SMA, 89.6%). There was no association between hydration status (capillary refill time, sunken eyes, decreased skin turgidity, cool peripheries, systolic blood pressure, dry mucous membranes) or comorbidities associated with volume depletion (i.e.g.astroenteritis) and prerenal azotemia in children with CM or SMA (p > 0.05 for all). Among children with severe malaria, prerenal azotemia was associated with an increased heart rate (p = 0.004) and lower weight-for-age (p = 0.01) and weight-for-height z scores (p = 0.004). Children with severe malaria and prerenal azotemia had a higher parasite density (p = 0.001) and parasite biomass (plasma HRP-2, p = 0.002) than children without prerenal azotemia. In a multivariable model, a one-unit increase in the natural log of plasma HRP2 was associated with an aOR of prerenal injury of 1.28 (1.15, 1.66) following adjustment for age, sex, heart rate, and weight-for-age and weight-for-height z score.

In bivariate analysis, AKI was associated with disease severity, hemoglobinuria, low glucose concentrations, high concentrations of lactate, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and parasite biomass (plasma HRP-2) (Table 3, Additional file 1: Table S3-S7). However, in multivariable models, LDH was the only measure independently associated with AKI in both CM and SMA following adjustment for multiple comparisons (Additional file 1: Table S4-S5). A one-unit increase in the natural log of LDH was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of AKI of 5.10 (95% CI 2.22, 11.69) and 8.62 (3.02, 24.60) in CM and SMA, respectively. History of nephrotoxic medication use was not associated with AKI at admission.

### Severe non-hepatic hyperammonaemic encephalopathy in an immunocompromised adolescent with enterocolitis [^117B3yMX]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Background

Hyperammonaemia is characterised by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood. It can lead to significant neurotoxicity, which may present as an altered level of consciousness and, if left untreated, can progress to coma and death. Ammonia is an essential molecule in human metabolism and is used to produce glutamine. It is primarily generated by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with a smaller proportion being generated in the renal tubules. It is metabolised in the liver into urea and excreted in urine as urea and ammonium. An overabundance of ammonia can occur when the production increases or elimination is reduced. Hyperammonaemia is most commonly attributed to liver failure, though urea cycle disorders must be closely considered. In the context of non-hepatic hyperammonaemia, there are a number of other important diagnostic considerations which have implications for the management of these patients during their acute presentation.

Here, we present a case of severe non-hepatic hyperammonaemia in a patient with very severe aplastic anaemia.

### Moyamoya disease presenting with tubular dysfunction in a child: pitfalls in diagnosing an atypical hyponatremic-hypertensive syndrome [^111usgmt]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The boy was born at 34 weeks of gestational age, after a pregnancy complicated by impending abortion, with a birth weight of 3075 g, not experiencing asphyxia, hypoglycemia, or other perinatal complications. Family history disclosed hypertension, kidney asymmetry and myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years in paternal grandfather, and hypertension in a paternal aunt. A febrile urinary tract infection occurred at age of 6 months. At that time, a kidney ultrasound revealed a slight renal asymmetry (right kidney 47 mm, left kidney 56 mm) and follow-up urine tests showed intermittent borderline proteinuria (maximum Upr/Ucr 0.5 mg/mg); instead, plasma creatinine and blood pressure were normal. At the age of 18 months, he was admitted to the hospital because of dehydration during an acute febrile viral enteritis. A history of polyuria and polydipsia, noticed during the first year of life and afterwards worsening, was disclosed by parents. Physical examination on admission showed severe dehydration, irritability, hypotonia and drowsiness. Body weight was 13 kg (81 th percentile), height was 96 cm (> 95 th percentile) and head circumference 51 cm (> 95 th percentile) according to CDC charts. Blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg (< 90 th percentile according to AAP Guidelines 2017). Laboratory blood examination showed metabolic alkalosis (pH 7.56, HCO₃⁻ 30.3, BE -8.1), hemoglobin 17.5 g/dL, Hct 46.5%, white blood cells 5290/μL (neutrophils 1390/μL), platelets 88 × 10³/μL, creatinine 0.37 mg/dL, eGFR 142 mL/min/1.73 m² (Schwartz equation, k = 0.55), plasma osmolality 292 mOsm/Kg (normal values (n.v.) 275–300), Na⁺ 123 mMol/L (n.v. 136–145), K⁺ 2.9 mMol/L (n.v. 3.5–5.1), phosphates 3.6 mg/dL (n.v.2.5–6.4), uric acid 1.9 mg/dL (n.v. 3.4–7), renin 210 mUI/L (n.v. 4.4–46 mUI/L) and aldosterone > 1000 ng/L (n.v. 35–300 ng/L). The tubular function test showed an increased fractional excretion of sodium (2.6%, n.v. 0.5%-1.5%) and uric acid 26%, (n.v. < 20%), a reduced tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP 77%, n.v. > 85%), hypercalciuria (Uca/Ucr 1, n.v. for age < 0.5 mg/mg) and proteinuria (Upr/Ucr 30, n.v. for age < 0.5 mg/mg). The tubular potassium gradient was mildly augmented (TTKG 11, n.v. 5–10), urine osmolality was 237 mOsm/Kg H₂O (n.v. 300–800), urine pH and specific gravity were 8 and 1006, respectively, and α₁-microglobulin 0.008 g/L (n.v. < 0.010). Increased plasmatic level of aldosterone, metabolic alkalosis and increased TTKG suggested a secondary hyperaldosteronism because of volume depletion. During hospitalization polyuria was present despite dehydration (about three liters/day), and an abdominal ultrasound confirmed the kidney asymmetry (right kidney 65 mm, left kidney 83 mm). A neurological consult showed a mild neurodevelopment delay. To investigate the persistence of irritability with onset of ataxic gait, the child underwent an electroencephalogram, which was normal, and a brain magnetic resonance that excluded either parenchymal abnormalities or evidence of ischemic damage. After the correction of the hydro-electrolyte disorders, the neurological symptoms improved, and the tubular function normalized in a few days (Table 1). Hence, the child wasdischarged, and in the following few weeksshowed again the borderline intermittent proteinuria (maximum Upr/Ucr 0.5 mg/mg). Five months later, at the age of 23 months, the boy was admitted to a foreign hospital for vomiting, left-sided hemiparesis, and obtunded sensorium after a head occipital trauma. A brain tomography displayed a right cerebral ischemia. At same time, a severe hypertension was detected (160/100 mmHg), poorly controlled by a combined treatment with ACE-inhibitor (enalapril), beta-blocking (carvedilol) and Ca²⁺-antagonist (nifedipine, then amlodipine). A cardiac ultrasound showed concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with normal electric conduction. A fundus oculi excluded hypertensive retinopathy. Laboratory testing showed normal creatinine and electrolytes, and an over-activation of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone axis (Table 1). A thrombophilia and an autoimmune underlying disease were excluded (data not shown). After the referral of the boy to our hospital, a cerebral and renal angiographic study was performed, revealing both aright internal carotid artery stenosis (70–80%) with compensatory vascular pathways displaying a puff of smoke pattern, and a severe right renal artery stenosis (95% at the distal tract of vessel). According to the representative angiographic brain findings (Fig. 1), moyamoya disease was diagnosed, together with a renovascular hypertension secondary to renal artery occlusion.

In conclusion, we have presented a case of severe HUS with anuric AKI in association with a Norovirus-related gastroenteritis. To our knowledge this is the first time such a causal relationship has been documented in an infant. With the routine immunization against rotavirus in infants, the prevalence of Norovirus gastroenteritis and its detection in stool samples by Multiplex PCR in this population is likely to rise, thus more cases of Norovirus-induced HUS may be diagnosed in the future, particularly in STEC negative patients with HUS.

CLINICAL SYNDROMES OF PEDIATRIC DIARRHEAL DISEASE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

As seen by clinical health providers at fixed healthcare facilities in developing countries, almost all cases of pediatric diarrheal illness can be conveniently characterized as falling into 1 of 5 clinical syndromes (Table 1). Approximately 80%–85% of patient episodes present as "simple gastroenteritis" with the subject passing loose or watery stool (often with mucus but not with blood), low-grade fever, occasional vomiting, anorexia, and apparent malaise (Figure 1). Approximately 5%–15% of children present with overt dysentery (gross blood in the diarrheic stools) (Figure 2), often accompanied by fever (sometimes high); many dysenteric patients appear clinically toxic. A small proportion of cases in older children present with profuse watery diarrhea, passing such voluminous "rice water" stools that even older children can rapidly become severely dehydrated (Figure 3). Another few percent of pediatric cases present with a history of apparent simple gastroenteritis that began 14 or more days previously but did not abate; this defines "persistent diarrhea", a syndrome that particularly can have adverse nutritional consequences. Finally, a few percent of children are brought by caretakers for care because of vomiting rather than diarrhea as the main complaint. Few reports have described expanded etiologic analyses in relation to these clinical syndromes.

The 5 Main Clinical Syndromes of Diarrheal Disease Seen Among Infants and Young Children Presenting to Health Centers and Hospitals in Developing Countries

Figure 1.
An infant who presented with diarrheal dehydration consequent to simple gastroenteritis that was not treated promptly or effectively. Loss of turgor of skin over the abdomen is visible as "tenting", following pinching. Simple gastroenteritis caused by many etiologic agents in young infants in developing countries can lead to dehydration. The fundamental reason is that per kilogram of body weight, the daily water and electrolyte requirements of young infants are substantially greater than those of older children. Thus, abnormal losses from diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, accompanied by inadequate fluid intake and lack of prompt and appropriate replacement (as with glucose/electrolyte oral rehydration solution), can lead to moderate and severe dehydration and death.

### About post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis | Group A strep… [^116bEynf]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is an inflammatory disease affecting the kidneys.
- It's rare, but PSGN can develop after strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo.
- Symptoms of PSGN usually point to kidney issues and long-term kidney damage can occur.
- Treatment usually focuses on managing swelling and blood pressure but can include antibiotics. Symptoms After strep throat or scarlet fever symptoms start: PSGN can develop about 10 days later. After impetigo symptoms start: PSGN can develop about 3 weeks later. Someone with PSGN usually has protein in the urine and hypertension. Symptoms can also include:

- Dark, reddish-brown urine
- Decreased need to pee or decreased amount of urine
- Edema
- Fatigue due to anemia The swelling occurs especially in the face, around the eyes, and in the hands and feet.

Some people may have no symptoms or symptoms that are so mild that they don't seek medical help. Complications Most people who develop PSGN recover within a few weeks without any complications. While rare, long-term kidney damage, including kidney failure, can occur. These rare complications are more common in adults than children. Risk factors Anyone can get PSGN after having strep throat, scarlet fever, or impetigo. People at increased risk for those infections are also at increased risk for getting PSGN. Age PSGN is more common in children than adults. After strep throat or scarlet fever Developing PSGN after strep throat or scarlet fever is most common in young, school-age children. After impetigo Developing PSGN after impetigo is most common in preschool-age children. Treatment and recovery Treatment of PSGN focuses on managing symptoms as needed. Healthcare providers limit salt and water intake or prescribe a diuretic to decrease swelling.

A diuretic is a medicine that increases the flow of urine. Healthcare providers prescribe blood pressure medicine to manage the patient's blood pressure. Antibiotics People with PSGN who still have a group A strep infection are often given antibiotics.

### Norovirus: a novel etiologic agent in hemolytic uremic syndrome in an infant [^113BCiut]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with a mean annual incidence of 6.1 cases/million children less than 5 years of age and an overall case fatality rate of 4%. The primary damage to the vascular endothelium is responsible for the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury (AKI). Pediatric HUS is classified either as: 1) typical and caused by Shiga toxin producing E.coli (STEC) and accounts for 90% of cases or 2) atypical, subdivided into familial HUS or non-familial HUS which are usually secondary to inherited or acquired abnormalities in the alternate complement pathway. Patients with STEC HUS develop acute kidney injury typically 2–12 days after the onset of bloody diarrhea. Treatment is supportive, blood transfusion if deemed necessary and temporary dialysis in case of severe acute kidney injury. Fortunately the mortality rate for STEC-HUS has decreased to less than 5% with a 70% complete recovery after an episode acute kidney injury.

We report an unusual case of HUS with severe anuric AKI in association with Norovirus (previously Norwalk virus) induced gastroenteritis in a nine-month-old baby which, to our knowledge, is the first infant where such a causal association is documented. We also present a brief review of other viruses reported to cause HUS and TTP.

### Diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium (Hypaque) [^111Wv4hW]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Precautions

Although azotemia is not considered a contraindication, care is required in patients with advanced renal failure. The usual preparatory dehydration should be omitted, and urinary output should be observed for one to two days in these patients. Adequate visualization may be difficult or impossible to attain in patients with severely impaired renal and/or hepatic function. Use with extreme caution in patients with concomitant hepatorenal disease.

When HYPAQUE-76 is used with a urea "washout" procedure, the patient should also be observed for a few hours to detect signs of undue dehydration caused by increased diuresis induced by both the medium and the urea. Ingestion of water may be required for rehydration.

In myelomatosis, urography should only be performed with caution. If a weak protein-binding agent such as a diatrizoate is used for the procedure, it is essential to omit preparatory dehydration, administer fluids, and attempt to alkalinize the urine.

Preparatory Dehydration: Preparatory dehydration is dangerous in infants, young children, the elderly, and azotemic patients (especially those with polyuria, oliguria, diabetes, advanced vascular disease, or preexisting dehydration). The undesirable dehydration in these patients may be accentuated by the osmotic diuretic action of the medium.

Dehydration may improve image quality in patients with adequate renal function particularly if a low dose is used. Dehydration, however, will not improve contrast quality in patients with substantial renal insufficiencies and will increase risk of contrast induced renal damage. Dehydration in these patients is therefore contraindicated.

Adverse Reactions

Side effects following this relatively high dose urography are usually mild and transitory and do not appear to occur more frequently or severely than those induced by "standard dose" urography. Nausea, facial flushing, and emesis are not uncommon reactions. (See also ADVERSE REACTIONS — General.)

Dosage and Administration

The usual intravenous dose for adults is 20 mL, with a range of 20 mL to 40 mL. Children require less in proportion to weight: Under 6 months of age — 4 mL; 6 to 12 months — 6 mL; 1 to 2 years — 8 mL; 2 to 5 years — 10 mL; 5 to 7 years — 12 mL; 8 to 10 years — 14 mL; 11 to 15 years — 16 mL.

### From acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease in children: maladaptive repair and the need for long-term surveillance-a literature review [^114xiHvo]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Identifying the vulnerable: risk factors for progression

The trajectory from AKI to CKD is modulated by a confluence of factors.

The nature of the injury

The severity (higher KDIGO stage, need for KRT), duration, and frequency of AKI episodes are paramount. The etiology is also critical; insults like severe ischemic ATN or HUS, known for causing extensive structural damage, carry a higher propensity for inducing irreversible fibrosis.

The developing host

Age at injury is a uniquely critical determinant. Neonates, and especially premature infants, are an exceptionally vulnerable population. While traditionally it was thought that nephrogenesis continues until 34–36 weeks' gestation, recent evidence suggests this process may conclude much earlier, possibly by 40 days after birth, even in preterm infants. An AKI occurring before the completion of nephrogenesis can permanently truncate the number of nephrons, resulting in a lifelong deficit. Low birth weight is an independent risk factor for CKD. Pre-existing conditions like congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), congenital heart disease, or malignancies also heighten susceptibility.

Early warning signs

Persistent hypertension or proteinuria after an AKI episode is a significant predictor of future CKD.

An insult to a growing organ: the impact of AKI on development

When AKI strikes a developing kidney, it can inflict permanent damage. Arresting nephron formation leads to a reduced nephron count, forcing the remaining nephrons into a state of compensatory hyperfiltration — a well-established driver of progressive glomerulosclerosis. Thus, even a neonatal AKI that appears to resolve clinically can sow the seeds for kidney disease that manifests years or decades later.

Furthermore, the process of maladaptive repair unfolds within a growing organ. A volume of fibrotic scar tissue that might be relatively small in an adult kidney could compromise a much larger fraction of the total functional renal mass in an infant, leading to a more significant and earlier decline in function. Beyond the kidney itself, AKI has been linked to impaired somatic growth, with studies showing lower length and weight z-scores in children post-AKI, an effect most pronounced in infants.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute kidney injury, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (monitoring), UKKA 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain close monitoring for AKI in pediatric inpatients deemed at high risk of AKI, particularly if there has been a new exposure. Monitor urine output and measure serum creatinine regularly (reflecting the potential burden of venipuncture) until at least 48 hours after the period of increased risk has elapsed.

### Timing and risk factors associated with acute kidney injury in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis [^11422udy]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study brings a new perspective on this topic by the finding that AKI mostly precedes NEC onset. AKI incidence and severity are much higher than previously reported. These infants are significantly more likely to be hemodynamically unstable, requiring vasopressors with a significant increase in mortality rate.

Discussion and conclusions

The overall incidence of diarrhea-associated HUS is rare at around 2.1 cases per 100,000 persons/yr. with a peak incidence of 6.1 per 100,000/yr. in children younger than 5 years. While rare in occurrence, HUS is a very common cause of AKI in children, particularly in infants below the age of 4 years. The vast majority of cases occur following a bout of bloody diarrhea caused by STEC, usually O157: H7 serotype enterohemorrhagic E. coli. The disease is characterized by microvascular thrombosis, primarily in the renal vasculature, but occasionally in multiple organs, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Acute kidney injury may be mild with transient elevation of urea and creatinine and oliguria but in more than 50% it is severe and protracted, necessitating renal replacement therapy in the form of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis as was the case with our patient. Although the mortality in STEC-HUS in children has decreased steadily over the years and is now at less than 5%, as many as 25% of survivors may be left with residual renal impairment including proteinuria, hypertension and reduced renal function.
