D. cerebellum

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which brain region is most responsible for the staggering gait and slurred speech seen with acute alcohol intoxication. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical signs and map them to motor control circuits. Then, I should verify which structure is most directly implicated in coordination, timing, and speech articulation. Next, I will consider the other options (limbic system, thalamus, sensorimotor cortex) and check whether they plausibly explain both phenomena. Finally, I will confirm with evidence on alcohol-related cerebellar toxicity and choose the best answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype: staggering reflects impaired balance and coordination, while slurred speech reflects impaired articulatory timing and motor control of speech. Both are classic manifestations of acute alcohol intoxication, and they point toward a system that fine-tunes movement timing and coordination rather than primary emotional or sensory processing per se [^notfound].

> I will now examine the cerebellum as the primary candidate. The cerebellum is centrally involved in motor coordination, balance, and the timing of movement sequences, including speech articulation; damage or dysfunction produces ataxia, dysarthria, and intention tremor, which aligns with staggering and slurred speech. Wait, let me verify the speech piece: cerebellar lesions and cerebellar outflow disruption are well known to cause dysarthria, and cerebellar mutism syndrome after posterior fossa surgery underscores cerebellar contributions to speech production, reinforcing the link to slurred speech in intoxication [^735d404a] [^4b451381].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the other options. The limbic system is primarily involved in emotion and motivation; while alcohol affects the limbic system, it does not directly explain incoordination or dysarthria, so A is unlikely. The thalamus is a relay nucleus; although cerebellar output traverses thalamic nuclei to cortex, the thalamus itself is not the primary site of motor coordination deficits in intoxication, making B less specific. The sensorimotor cortex executes movement but relies on cerebellar input for timing and precision; acute alcohol's most direct motor impact maps more cleanly onto cerebellar dysfunction than primary motor cortex alone, so C is not the best fit [^c4572554] [^9e1c99da].

> Next, I should review direct evidence that alcohol impairs cerebellar function. Alcohol is a recognized cerebellar toxin; chronic exposure causes Purkinje cell loss and cerebellar atrophy, and acute intoxication disrupts cerebellar timing and coordination. Let me double-check: population data show higher baseline ethanol consumption increases incident essential tremor risk, consistent with cerebellar neurotoxicity, and MRI studies in adolescents link binge drinking to smaller cerebellar volumes, supporting a causal role of alcohol on cerebellar tissue and function [^ffc33424] [^e05e5921].

> But wait, what if the motor cortex is the immediate executor and therefore the "cause"? Hmm, wait a minute, the motor cortex is necessary for movement, but the precision, timing, and smoothness deficits seen in intoxication — especially the dysmetria and dysarthria — are hallmark cerebellar signs. The cerebellum provides predictive internal models and error correction that the cortex relies on; when cerebellar computation is impaired by alcohol, execution becomes uncoordinated and speech becomes slurred, which is why the cerebellum remains the most parsimonious answer here [^1b62cc81] [^9e1c99da].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the conclusion: the staggering gait and slurred speech of acute alcohol intoxication are most directly explained by altered cerebellar function, given its role in coordination, timing, and speech motor control, and the evidence that alcohol impairs cerebellar circuitry. Therefore, the best answer is D. cerebellum [^735d404a] [^ffc33424] [^e05e5921].

---

The staggering and slurred speech from alcohol intoxication are most directly due to **cerebellar dysfunction** [^notfound]. Alcohol impairs cerebellar coordination and timing, causing ataxia and dysarthria, whereas the limbic system, thalamus, and sensorimotor cortex are less directly implicated in these specific motor signs. Chronic alcohol use can cause cerebellar damage, but acute effects are reversible with sobriety [^notfound].

---

## Cerebellar involvement in motor coordination and speech

The cerebellum is critical for **motor coordination, balance, and speech production** [^1b62cc81]; it integrates sensory input with motor commands to enable smooth, precise movements. Alcohol depresses cerebellar function, causing ataxia and dysarthria — the hallmark staggering gait and slurred speech of intoxication [^notfound].

---

## Alcohol's acute effects on the cerebellum

Alcohol acutely disrupts cerebellar processing via:

- **GABAergic enhancement**: Alcohol potentiates GABAergic inhibition, reducing cerebellar output and impairing coordination and timing [^notfound].
- **Glutamatergic inhibition**: Alcohol inhibits glutamatergic excitation, further degrading cerebellar function [^notfound].
- **Purkinje cell impairment**: Alcohol impairs Purkinje cells, disrupting cerebellar output and causing ataxia and dysarthria [^notfound].

These effects are **reversible with sobriety**, but repeated exposure can cause persistent cerebellar damage [^ffc33424].

---

## Comparison with other brain regions

| **Brain region** | **Role in motor coordination and speech** | **Involvement in alcohol-induced staggering and slurred speech** |
|-|-|-|
| Limbic system | Emotion, motivation, memory | Indirect; not primary for motor coordination or speech production |
| Thalamus | Sensory relay, motor control | Relay station; not primary for coordination or speech timing |
| Sensorimotor cortex | Motor execution, sensory processing | Executes movement but relies on cerebellar timing; not primary for coordination deficits |

---

The cerebellum is the **primary site** of alcohol-induced motor incoordination and dysarthria; the other regions contribute less directly to these specific deficits [^notfound].

---

## Chronic alcohol use and cerebellar damage

Chronic alcohol use can cause **cerebellar degeneration** with Purkinje cell loss and atrophy, leading to persistent ataxia and dysarthria even when sober [^ffc33424]. This damage is especially pronounced in the anterior superior vermis, which governs posture and gait [^76c5e3e8].

---

## Conclusion

Staggering and slurred speech from alcohol intoxication are most directly due to **cerebellar dysfunction** [^notfound]. Alcohol acutely impairs cerebellar coordination and timing, producing ataxia and dysarthria; chronic use can cause lasting cerebellar damage [^ffc33424]. The limbic system, thalamus, and sensorimotor cortex are less directly implicated in these specific motor signs.

### Functional recruitment and connectivity of the cerebellum is associated with the emergence of theory of mind in early childhood [^3fe89bdb]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Human interaction crucially relies on our ability to infer other people’s thoughts and intentions, a process widely known as Theory of Mind (ToM) or mentalizing,. Recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have greatly enhanced our neurobiological understanding of ToM, revealing its neural correlates not only in the cerebral cortex – but also in the adult cerebellum –. Although substantial evidence highlights the cerebellum’s involvement in ToM processing in adults, its role in the development of ToM remains poorly understood. This gap is particularly striking given that cerebellar lesions acquired during development are linked to profound and enduring ToM deficits—far more severe than those observed following lesions sustained in adulthood – —suggesting a crucial involvement of the developing cerebellum in ToM understanding. To address this issue, the present study investigated the functional involvement of the cerebellum in the development of ToM during early childhood to better understand how this structure is associated with the emergence of ToM abilities.

Despite being traditionally associated with sensorimotor processing –, a surge of findings over the last three decades highlights the importance of the cerebellum for a wide range of cognitive functions, including language and social cognition,–. In the context of ToM, the adult posterior cerebellum, especially Crus I–II, is consistently activated during ToM processing, pointing towards a substantial involvement of this region in ToM,,,. This evidence has been enriched by findings of functional and anatomical connectivity of the adult posterior cerebellum with the cerebral ToM network, which spans frontal and temporoparietal regions such as the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (d/vmPFC), the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and the precuneus (PreC),. Recent studies have demonstrated bidirectional task-driven connections and white matter loops between the posterior cerebellum and the ToM network,–, suggesting the importance of the cerebellum for ToM in terms of extensive information exchange with ToM regions of the cerebral cortex.

### Diversity and dynamism in the cerebellum [^d5e1deb2]. Nature Neuroscience (2021). High credibility.

The past several years have brought revelations and paradigm shifts in research on the cerebellum. Historically viewed as a simple sensorimotor controller with homogeneous architecture, the cerebellum is increasingly implicated in cognitive functions. It possesses an impressive diversity of molecular, cellular and circuit mechanisms, embedded in a dynamic, recurrent circuit architecture. Recent insights about the diversity and dynamism of the cerebellum provide a roadmap for the next decade of cerebellar research, challenging some old concepts, reinvigorating others and defining major new research directions.

### A multifaceted gradient in human cerebellum of structural and functional development [^3fba9610]. Nature Neuroscience (2022). High credibility.

The organization of the basic tissue and functional properties of the cerebellum across development is unknown. Combining several large datasets, we demonstrate in the human cerebellum a static tissue gradient in adults that mirrors a similar growth-rate gradient across development. Quantitative tissue metrics corroborate unique densities of certain lipids and proteins among lobules, and cerebellar structural development closely follows cerebellar functional properties through childhood.

### Cerebellar volume and cerebellocerebral structural covariance in schizophrenia: a multisite mega-analysis of 983 patients and 1349 healthy controls [^c2c35088]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Although cerebellar involvement across a wide range of cognitive and neuropsychiatric phenotypes is increasingly being recognized, previous large-scale studies in schizophrenia (SZ) have primarily focused on supratentorial structures. Hence, the across-sample reproducibility, regional distribution, associations with cerebrocortical morphology and effect sizes of cerebellar relative to cerebral morphological differences in SZ are unknown. We addressed these questions in 983 patients with SZ spectrum disorders and 1349 healthy controls (HCs) from 14 international samples, using state-of-the-art image analysis pipelines optimized for both the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Results showed that total cerebellar grey matter volume was robustly reduced in SZ relative to HCs (Cohens's d=-0.35), with the strongest effects in cerebellar regions showing functional connectivity with frontoparietal cortices (d=-0.40). Effect sizes for cerebellar volumes were similar to the most consistently reported cerebral structural changes in SZ (e.g., hippocampus volume and frontotemporal cortical thickness), and were highly consistent across samples. Within groups, we further observed positive correlations between cerebellar volume and cerebral cortical thickness in frontotemporal regions (i.e., overlapping with areas that also showed reductions in SZ). This cerebellocerebral structural covariance was strongest in SZ, suggesting common underlying disease processes jointly affecting the cerebellum and the cerebrum. Finally, cerebellar volume reduction in SZ was highly consistent across the included age span (16-66 years) and present already in the youngest patients, a finding that is more consistent with neurodevelopmental than neurodegenerative etiology. Taken together, these novel findings establish the cerebellum as a key node in the distributed brain networks underlying SZ.

### Cerebellar-driven cortical dynamics can enable task acquisition, switching and consolidation [^d3ff22c2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1 
Schematic of cortical recurrent networks with different types of feedback.

a Model variant with no feedback: temporal external input (x t) is fed to a cortical RNN (grey) and a linear readout layer (blue) produces the final model output (z t). b Model variant with readout-only feedback: in this scheme there is a feedback loop in which the RNN also receives readout predictions as extra input,. c Model variant with cerebellar feedback: a copy of RNN activity (h t) is sent to a (feedforward) cerebellar network, which feedbacks to the cortical network its own cerebellar predictions (c t). d A key property of our cerebellar network is that it learns via behavioural timing-specific learning rules, in line with experimental observations. In this learning rule the error between the cerebellar prediction c and future behavioural outcomes y (150 ms) triggers plasticity via climbing fibers at the parallel fibre input of Purkinje cells.

Here we focus on the feedback loop between two key brain regions, the cortex and the cerebellum. The cerebellum is a highly plastic system and is well placed to drive cortical dynamics via a set of stereotypical, but functionally separable cortico-cerebellar loops,. Indeed, an ever-growing array of clinical, functional imaging,, and optogenetic – studies support an important cerebellar contribution to cortical activity in both motor and non-motor domains. Recently, two hypotheses on the computational role of cortico-cerebellar loops have been put forward –. The first asserts that the cerebellum reinforces cortical-dependent goal-directed behaviour by appropriately steering or stabilising cortical states in real-time,. The second also promotes the cerebellum as a facilitator of goal-directed cortical transitions, but it does so indirectly via teaching signals which lead to cortical plasticity,. Whilst these two views may co-exist, it is the former that is well placed to operate under weakly plastic cortical networks. Moreover, the cerebellum acting as an instantaneous driver of cortical dynamics is in line with the fast activity-dependent cortico-cerebellar interactions that have been observed experimentally,,.

### Population-wide cerebellar growth models of children and adolescents [^2281e086]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the past, the cerebellum has been best known for its crucial role in motor function. However, increasingly more findings highlight the importance of cerebellar contributions in cognitive functions and neurodevelopment. Using a total of 7240 neuroimaging scans from 4862 individuals, we describe and provide detailed, openly available models of cerebellar development in childhood and adolescence (age range: 6–17 years), an important time period for brain development and onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. Next to a traditionally used anatomical parcellation of the cerebellum, we generated growth models based on a recently proposed functional parcellation. In both, we find an anterior-posterior growth gradient mirroring the age-related improvements of underlying behavior and function, which is analogous to cerebral maturation patterns and offers evidence for directly related cerebello-cortical developmental trajectories. Finally, we illustrate how the current approach can be used to detect cerebellar abnormalities in clinical samples.

### A hierarchical atlas of the human cerebellum for functional precision mapping [^7be91c5c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Multiple-demand regions

Tasks involving executive control, including updating, shifting and inhibition, consistently activated regions in lobules VI and VII. Based on work by Duncan et al. we labeled these regions the multi-demand domain (D for short). D1 occupied the most medial portion of Crus I and II. Further out in the hemispheres, the demand region formed a “shell” around the more central social-linguistic-spatial domain (Figs. 4b, 5). Here, D3 formed the outermost layer and D2 the innermost, with D1 being interspersed between. The regions (especially D2) also had a repeated representation in lobule IX (Fig. 3). This is consistent with a 3-fold representation. Intriguingly, we found also a vermal section of D3, both in lobule IV and IX. D4 was the smallest identified region. Functionally most similar to D1, it occupied the most lateral portion of the demand regions.

### Functional development of the human cerebellum from birth to age five [^b29a6df1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Despite the cerebellum’s crucial role in brain function, its early development, particularly in relation to the cerebrum, remains poorly understood. Here, we examine cerebellocortical connectivity using over 1000 high-quality resting-state functional MRI scans from children between birth and five years of age. By mapping cerebellar topography with fine temporal granularity, we unveil the hierarchical organization of cerebellocortical functional connectivity from infancy. We observe dynamic shifts in cerebellar functional topography, which become more focal with age while largely maintaining stable anchor regions similar to adults, highlighting the cerebellum’s evolving yet organized role in functional integration during early development. Our findings demonstrate cerebellar connectivity to higher-order networks at birth, which generally strengthen with age, emphasizing the cerebellum’s early role in cognitive processing beyond sensory and motor functions. Our study provides insights into early cerebellocortical interactions, reveals functional asymmetry and sex-specific patterns in cerebellar development, and lays the groundwork for future research on cerebellum-related disorders in children.

### Micafungin sodium (micafungin) [^9e88f22d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Micafungin inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an essential component of fungal cell walls, which is not present in mammalian cells.

Activity in Animal Models of Candidiasis

Activity of micafungin has been demonstrated in both mucosal and disseminated murine and rabbit models of candidiasis. Micafungin administered to immunocompetent or immunosuppressed mice or rabbits with disseminated candidiasis prolonged survival (mice) and/or decreased the fungal burden in different organs including brain in a dose-dependent manner (mice and rabbits). Overall, antifungal activity of micafungin was demonstrated in the brain and eye tissues of nonneutropenic rabbits with HCME infected with a micafungin-sensitive strain of C. albicans ; however, the activity varied in different central nervous system and ocular compartments. In the cerebrum, culture negativity was achieved at a micafungin dose regimen of 32 mg/kg once daily for 7 days; whereas, in spinal cord, vitreous humor, and choroid, culture negativity was achieved at micafungin dose regimens of 24 mg/kg to 32 mg/kg once daily. Compared to untreated animals, micafungin dose regimens between 8 and 24 mg/kg once daily reduced fungal burden in the cerebrum and cerebellum. When cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord data were combined, a decrease in fungal burden relative to untreated controls was evident at micafungin dose regimens between 16 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .

Resistance

There have been reports of clinical failures in patients receiving micafungin therapy due to the development of drug resistance. Some of these reports have identified specific mutations in the FKS protein component of the glucan synthase enzyme that are associated with higher MICs and breakthrough infection.

Antimicrobial Activity

Micafungin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following Candida species, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)] :

Candida albicans

Candida glabrata

Candida guilliermondii

Candida krusei

Candida parapsilosis

Candida tropicalis

### The cerebellum in Parkinson's disease [^b42fe70a]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that the major role of the cerebellum in Parkinson’s disease includes two aspects, pathological and compensatory effects. Pathological changes in the cerebellum might be induced by dopaminergic degeneration, abnormal drives from the subthalamic nucleus and dopaminergic treatment, and may account for several clinical symptoms in Parkinson’s disease. Because dopaminergic degeneration develops gradually, presumably, pathological impairments should be more severe as disease progresses. The compensatory effect may help to maintain relatively normal motor and non-motor function. In the mild-to-moderate stages of Parkinson’s disease, recruitment of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit positively correlates with the severity of symptoms or progression (,;). It is likely that the compensatory effect strengthens at a relatively early stage, but may diminish or eventually fail as pathological damages become more severe at the advanced stage. A hypothetical model of functional changes in the cerebellum during progression of Parkinson’s disease is shown in Fig. 6.

Figure 6 
A hypothetical model of functional changes in the cerebellum accompanying the progression of Parkinson’s disease.

Our knowledge on the role of the cerebellum in Parkinson’s disease remains limited. Further investigations are needed to clarify Parkinson’s disease–related pathological alterations in the cerebellum and how cerebellar pathological and compensatory effects evolve as the disorder progresses. A better understanding of the Parkinson’s disease–related functional and morphological changes of the cerebellum will significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease and may help develop new strategies and targets for treatment.

### A cerebellar partitioning method using spectral clustering with optimized nonlinear functional connectivity [^f1f09a4e]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The functions of the human cerebellum are likely to exhibit similar diversity and complexity to those of the cerebral cortex. (Ren et al.). Not only that, but different brain atlases need to be specified for different research questions (e.g. different neuropsychiatric disorders), and the cerebellum is more individual‐specific than the cortex (Li et al.; Marek et al.), so that a detailed functional partition of the cerebellum which helps us elucidate this diverse functionality and connectivity is essential. In our study, we proposed a novel cerebellar partitioning method designed to offer a variable number of partitions, to enhance partition reproducibility, and to ensure both regional homogeneity and spatial continuity. We applied the approach to the two independent datasets to validate the effectiveness of this partitioning series. Subsequently, we used this method for a PD classification problem as a clinical practice.

### Redefining the cerebellar cortex as an assembly of non-uniform purkinje cell microcircuits [^c2d796e3]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2015). Medium credibility.

The adult mammalian cerebellar cortex is generally assumed to have a uniform cytoarchitecture. Differences in cerebellar function are thought to arise primarily through distinct patterns of input and output connectivity rather than as a result of variations in cortical microcircuitry. However, evidence from anatomical, physiological and genetic studies is increasingly challenging this orthodoxy, and there are now various lines of evidence indicating that the cerebellar cortex is not uniform. Here, we develop the hypothesis that regional differences in properties of cerebellar cortical microcircuits lead to important differences in information processing.

### Heterogeneous encoding of temporal stimuli in the cerebellar cortex [^58e311a8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We know that recurrent connectivity in frontal areas of the cerebral cortexgives rise to complex, persistent, and heterogeneous dynamics,, which often feature multiplexed task representations –. The question arises, given recently uncovered local recurrent and feedforward microcircuit motifs and given input diversity to various cerebellar lobules, why such heterogeneity eludes cerebellar cortical activity underlying behavioral tasks. Here, we show evidence of multiplexed task-related representations and functional heterogeneity in cerebellar cortical responses in a relatively simple associative learning task. We provide computational models of the cerebellar microcircuit that incorporate recent anatomical insights, to predict how such distinct and diverse representations might be acquired and propagated within the cerebellar cortex.

### Dentate update: imaging features of entities that affect the dentate nucleus [^a17d3aed]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

The dentate nucleus is a cerebellar structure involved in voluntary motor function and cognition. There are relatively few entities that affect the dentate, and the clinical features of these conditions are often complex and nonspecific. Because these entities are rarely encountered, the formulation of a differential diagnosis can be difficult. Many of the conditions are reversible or treatable with early intervention. Therefore, it is important to recognize classic clinical presentations and their associated characteristic imaging findings. We provide a summary of entities that affect the dentate nucleus and a diagnostic workflow for approaching dentate nucleus imaging abnormalities.

### The cerebellum communicates with the basal ganglia [^2aacae2f]. Nature Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

The cerebral cortex is interconnected with two major subcortical structures: the basal ganglia and the cerebellum. How and where cerebellar circuits interact with basal ganglia circuits has been a longstanding question. Using transneuronal transport of rabies virus in macaques, we found that a disynaptic pathway links an output stage of cerebellar processing, the dentate nucleus, with an input stage of basal ganglia processing, the striatum.

### Cerebellum and social abilities: a structural and functional connectivity study in a transdiagnostic sample [^45afe5ae]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our analyses in a transdiagnostic sample suggest that there is no specific association between social abilities and cerebellum–rTPJ connectivity, but that there is a complex relationship between cerebellum–rTPJ connectivity, social performance and IQ as indicated by our previous work on structural alterations in the cerebellum. Such a relationship is specific to cerebellum–rTPJ connectivity, and is related to their structural anatomy.

### Cerebellum and social abilities: a structural and functional connectivity study in a transdiagnostic sample [^52300bd0]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

When taking structural values into CCA together with cerebellum–rTPJ connectivity, we found that the structural variables are in general highly correlated with the brain variate, compared with functional variables. It suggests that the structure of the cerebellum and the rTPJ is also associated with IQ and social abilities, with even a larger contribution to the canonical correlation relationship.

Taken together, the above findings add to a growing body of evidence that the cerebellum may play a role in general cognitive functioning, rather than in specific social cognition. In autistic research, recent large‐scale investigations on the cerebellum have favored the strong effect of IQ, instead of social performance (Elandaloussi et al.). Our findings on functional connectivity also support the postulated role of cerebellum in general cognition. Beyond the field of autism, atypicalities in the cerebellum, or more precisely, the cognitive part of the cerebellum (roughly bilateral Crus I and Crus II), have been shown in multiple mental health conditions, and also linked to cognitive functioning. For example, a recent large‐scale investigation on cerebellar structure in psychosis observed no effects of diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or neurotypical controls), but an association between cognitive ability and cerebellar volumes (Moussa‐Tooks et al.). Another indirect evidence for a ‘cognitive cerebellum’ may include the causal relationship between cerebellar–prefrontal network connectivity and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Brady et al.). Furthermore, cognitive deficits in autism may contribute to the impairments in social communication, as demonstrated by group comparison studies (Fong & Iarocci,; Leung et al.). These studies established a causative association between cognition and social abilities in autism. Overall, latest insights and our conclusion converge to a common ground, where the cerebellum is involved in general cognitive functioning that can further lead to socio‐communicative impairments in autism, and cerebellar deficits observed in autism and other psychiatric disorders may be explained by a decrease of overall cognitive ability.

### Social and emotional learning in the cerebellum [^711d48fd]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

The posterior cerebellum has a critical role in human social and emotional learning. Three systems and related neural networks support this cerebellar function: a biological action observation system as part of an extended sensorimotor integration network, a mentalizing system for understanding a person's mental and emotional state subserved by a mentalizing network, and a limbic network supporting core emotional (dis)pleasure and arousal processes. In this Review, I describe how these systems and networks support social and emotional learning via functional reciprocal connections initiating and terminating in the posterior cerebellum and cerebral neocortex. It is hypothesized that a major function of the posterior cerebellum is to identify and encode temporal sequences of events, which might help to fine-tune and automatize social and emotional learning. I discuss research using neuroimaging and non-invasive stimulation that provides converging evidence for this hypothesized function of cerebellar sequencing, but also other potential functional accounts of the posterior cerebellum's role in these social and emotional processes.

### The electrophysiological and neuropathological profiles of cerebellum in APP / PS1mice: a hypothesis on the role of cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease [^0eba74ee]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

We propose the hypothesis that the cerebellar electrophysiology and sleep-wake cycles may be altered at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), proceeding the amyloid-β neuropathological hallmarks. The electrophysiologic characteristics of cerebellum thereby might be served as a biomarker in the prepathological detection of AD. Sleep disturbances are common in preclinical AD patients, and the cerebellum has been implicated in sleep-wake regulation by several pioneer studies. Additionally, recent studies suggest that the structure and function of the cerebellum may be altered at the early stages of AD, indicating that the cerebellum may be involved in the disease's progression. We used APP swe /PS1 ΔE9 mice as a model of AD, monitored and analyzed electroencephalogram data, and assessed neuropathological profiles in the cerebellum of AD mice. Our hypothesis may establish a linkage between the cerebellum and AD, thereby potentially providing new perspectives on the pathogenesis of the disease.

### Mentalizing about dynamic social action sequences is supported by the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and neocortex: a meta-analysis of activation and connectivity [^c7377b1f]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

4.1 The Posterior Cerebellum Supports Social Action Sequences and Inconsistencies

Based on recent studies on the role of the social cerebellum, we hypothesized that the main function of the mentalizing network in the posterior cerebellum (Crus 1 and 2, lobule IX) is to identify dynamic social mentalizing based on temporal action sequences that helps to predict, prepare, and plan adequate social responses. The results of the meta‐analyses showed evidence for a social preference of the cerebellar mentalizing network, suggesting that a main function of the posterior cerebellum is to identify social actions. This was followed by somewhat weaker (and right lateralized) preference for sequencing, which seems to suggest that the pure sequencing function of the cerebellum may be less outspoken than its social function, at least in the studies that were included in the present meta‐analysis. In comparison, the nonsocial sequencing function in the cerebellar mentalizing network was very limited. This is in line with other studies reporting that, for instance, animations of nonhuman shapes moving in a biological manner (e.g. one shape “chasing” another) typically recruit mentalizing activity, also in the cerebellum (Van Overwalle et al.). Note that the role of the inferior posterior cerebellum lobule IX was mainly confined to social (sequencing) detection during prediction (i.e. prediction tasks; see Table S1) and did not play a significant role in identifying sequences of past behaviors. Perhaps its position in the inferior cerebellum close to the anterior cerebellum, responsible for engaging in motor behavior, explains this preferential function, as prediction might be considered as simulating future actions in one's mind.

### Development and developmental disorders of the human cerebellum [^05c4de39]. Journal of Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The human cerebellum develops over a long time, extending from the early embryonic period until the first postnatal years. This protracted development makes the cerebellum vulnerable to a broad spectrum of developmental disorders. The development of the cerebellum occurs in four basic steps: 1) characterization of the cerebellar territory at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary; 2) formation of two compartments for cell proliferation: first, the Purkinje cells and the deep cerebellar nuclei arise from the ventricular zone of the metencephalic alar plate; second, granule cell precursors are formed from a second compartment of proliferation, i. e. the upper rhombic lip; 3) inward migration of the granule cells: granule precursor cells form the external granular layer, from which (and continuing into the first postnatal year), granule cells migrate inwards to their definite position in the internal granular layer, and 4) formation of cerebellar circuitry and further differentiation. The precerebellar nuclei, i. e. the pontine nuclei and the inferior olive, arise from the lower rhombic lip. Developmental disorders of the cerebellum are often accompanied by malformations of the precerebellar nuclei. In this review the development of the cerebellum and some of its more frequent developmental disorders, such as the Dandy-Walker and related midline malformations, and the pontocerebellar hypoplasias, are discussed.

### A cerebro-cerebellar network for learning visuomotor associations [^74219296]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Patients with cerebellar pathology also show impairments in associative learning, including learning of arbitrary visuomotor associations,. However, the cerebellum has not been considered essential for the function of the brain-wide network for learning visuomotor associations,–. To the contrary, previous causal experimental studies have not found convincing evidence for cerebellar contributions to learning arbitrary visuomotor associations,–. The prior attempts to identify a causal role for the cerebellum in learning visuomotor associations have used broad and irreversible lesions that included the deep cerebellar nuclei and overlaying cerebellar cortex –. This broad approach involves permanent lesions of both motor and non-motor regions of the cerebellum, thus complicating the behavioral effects and the interpretation of results. In contrast, in the present experiments we targeted reversible inactivation to the specific regions of the cerebellar cortex (Crus I and II) that are interconnected with the PrePMd and where we previously recorded reinforcement error signals during learning of new visuomotor associations.

### Functional development of the human cerebellum from birth to age five [^b5812fa6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In summary, we investigated cerebellocortical functional connectivity during early childhood, spanning from birth to 60 months. Our findings demonstrate the presence of cerebellar connectivity not only with primary networks but also with higher-order networks, even at birth. Our parcellations with fine temporal resolution captured functional topography at different developmental stages, revealed the hierarchical organization of primary and higher-order networks, and suggested an S-A axis of early cerebellar functional development. Furthermore, we uncovered lateralization and sex-specific patterns in early cerebellar functional organization. These findings may guide future research into the neural mechanisms underlying early brain development.

### The role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia: an update of clinical, cognitive, and functional evidences [^e4bcae25]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In conclusion, abnormal postural control in schizophrenia is expected to reflect cerebellar dysfunction. However, only one controlled study assessed posture in patients, reporting abnormal swaying. More extended studies are needed to confirm this result, excluding comorbid alcohol abuse.

To summarize, a consistent and growing set of results suggest that the cerebellum is implicated in a significant part of NSS,,some of the items of NSS scales being well-known procedure classically used to assess the cerebellum.Postural impairments are among these signs though evidence is still limited to confirm its presence and physiopathological origin.

### The basal ganglia and the cerebellum: nodes in an integrated network [^c4572554]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are considered to be distinct subcortical systems that perform unique functional operations. The outputs of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum influence many of the same cortical areas but do so by projecting to distinct thalamic nuclei. As a consequence, the two subcortical systems were thought to be independent and to communicate only at the level of the cerebral cortex. Here, we review recent data showing that the basal ganglia and the cerebellum are interconnected at the subcortical level. The subthalamic nucleus in the basal ganglia is the source of a dense disynaptic projection to the cerebellar cortex. Similarly, the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum is the source of a dense disynaptic projection to the striatum. These observations lead to a new functional perspective that the basal ganglia, the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex form an integrated network. This network is topographically organized so that the motor, cognitive and affective territories of each node in the network are interconnected. This perspective explains how synaptic modifications or abnormal activity at one node can have network-wide effects. A future challenge is to define how the unique learning mechanisms at each network node interact to improve performance.

### FOXP genes regulate purkinje cell diversity and cerebellar morphogenesis [^f9e01782]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), the sole output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, are essential for motor coordination, learning and circuit formation. While functionally diverse, the extent of PC heterogeneity and the molecular drivers of this diversity remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified at least 11 molecularly distinct PC subtypes in the embryonic mouse cerebellum. Spatial reconstruction revealed that these subtypes are organized in embryonic patterns that predict key features of adult cerebellar architecture, including longitudinal stripes and lobular specificities. PC-subtype identity is defined by the combinatorial expression of Foxp1, Foxp2 and Foxp4. Genetic deletion of Foxp1 and Foxp2 disrupts PC diversification and cerebellar patterning, including the loss of a Foxp1 + subtype and the failure of cerebellar hemisphere formation. Foxp1 + PCs are enriched in the fetal human cerebellum but are rare in chick, suggesting a role in cerebellar evolution. These findings uncover early PC diversification and identify Foxp1 + PCs as critical regulators of cerebellar hemispheric development.

### Functional recruitment and connectivity of the cerebellum is associated with the emergence of theory of mind in early childhood [^09010d5b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we examined the functional involvement of the cerebellum in the development of ToM early in life. An in-scanner movie with ToM scenes revealed significant involvement of the posterior cerebellum, specifically Crus I-II, in ToM in young children. These activations were associated with the emergence of important ToM abilities: children who passed an out-of-scanner false-belief task demonstrated activation clusters in Crus I-II similar to clusters observed in adults, which were not significantly activated in children who did not pass the false-belief task. These regions also showed increased functional connections with the ToM network in the cerebral cortex as a function of children’s ToM abilities. Moreover, task-based connections from the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex were more prominent in ToM task passers, whereas in adults, downstream connections from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum were more prominent.

Our results provide evidence for the involvement of the cerebellum in the emergence of ToM abilities early in life. We found that functional changes in cerebellar Crus I-II and their connectivity to the cortex were associated with the emergence of false-belief reasoning in the critical period between 3 and 5 years. This highlights the importance of the cerebellum, not only in adult social cognition –,, but in the development of ToM in early childhood. Our finding that connections from the cerebellum to the cerebral cortex were important in ToM passers is in line with a prominent theory that the cerebellum plays a major role in early predictive social processing, by storing internal models of social sequences which can be fed forward to the cerebral cortex to allow predictions about social interactions –. In accordance with this theory, our findings suggest a significant association of early-life changes in the cerebellum with ToM development, insofar as the cerebellum stores information that supports the subsequent prediction of mental states. Our results also align with evidence suggesting that the sociocognitive deficits of ASD are associated with functional and structural abnormalities of the cerebellum,,,. Our observation of the role of the Crus I-II in ToM development may function as a framework of cerebellar regions and cerebro-cerebellar connections crucial for ToM in typically developing children, generating hypotheses for targeted studies in these regions in pediatric populations (e.g. children with ASD).

### Cerebellar lobules and dentate nuclei mirror cortical force-related-BOLD responses: beyond all (linear) expectations [^06d553b9]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

Moreover, it is interesting to note that the 1st, 2nd, and −3rd effects define an almost continuous area connecting the anterior and posterior lobules (Fig. 2). This functional anatomy may have various explanations. One possibility is that each of these non‐linear response components in the cerebellar cortex is mediated by a specific connectivity with cerebrocortical areas showing the same non‐linear response, so that the BOLD response simply inherits the activation state of the up‐stream cortical circuit. Another possibility is that local cerebellar processing generates specific spatially organized patterns of excitation and inhibition and thereby of local blood flow, around the lobule VI cluster.

The neurobiological source of the non‐linear behavior still remains to be understood, but its contribution is strongly supported by the data. One potential approach could be to apply additional neurovascular and cerebral quantitative methods or additional higher order fMRI tasks. Distinguishing between these two explanations would require the direct measurement of neurovascular coupling in the cerebellar tissue in response to various patterns of neuronal activity.

### Short latency cerebellar modulation of the basal ganglia [^a6374071]. Nature Neuroscience (2014). Medium credibility.

The graceful, purposeful motion of our body is an engineering feat that remains unparalleled in robotic devices using advanced artificial intelligence. Much of the information required for complex movements is generated by the cerebellum and the basal ganglia in conjunction with the cortex. Cerebellum and basal ganglia have been thought to communicate with each other only through slow, multi-synaptic cortical loops, begging the question as to how they coordinate their outputs in real time. We found that the cerebellum rapidly modulates the activity of the striatum via a disynaptic pathway in mice. Under physiological conditions, this short latency pathway was capable of facilitating optimal motor control by allowing the basal ganglia to incorporate time-sensitive cerebellar information and by guiding the sign of cortico-striatal plasticity. Conversely, under pathological condition, this pathway relayed aberrant cerebellar activity to the basal ganglia to cause dystonia.

### Procedure guideline for brain perfusion SPECT using (99m) Tc radiopharmaceuticals 3.0 [^e6287586]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2009). Medium credibility.

Brain perfusion SPECT reconstruction and attenuation correction—When possible, reconstruct the entire brain, using care not to exclude the cerebellum or vertex, and reconstruct data at the highest pixel resolution, that is, 1 pixel thick; if slices are to be summed, this should be done only after reconstruction and oblique reorientation (if performed). Attenuation correction should be performed in all cases unless a specific application or circumstance would dictate otherwise, using shape contouring if available, ensuring the contour includes scalp and not just gray matter, and whenever possible defining the surface contour individually for each transaxial slice. Reformat transaxial data into at least 3 orthogonal planes, generate transverse sections relative to a repeatable anatomic orientation with coronal and sagittal sections orthogonal to the transverse, and additional sections along a plane parallel to the long axis of the temporal lobes are frequently useful.

### Mentalizing about dynamic social action sequences is supported by the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and neocortex: a meta-analysis of activation and connectivity [^7f309420]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies were included when they analyzed at minimum one of the specificities/contrasts 1–4 listed above. All selected tasks involved human or human‐like actions, either depicted visually (e.g. showing a cartoon‐like action of a person) or described verbally in short sentences. To exclude the participation of the action observation/mirror network, only schematic cartoon‐like, still figurative or verbal representations of events was allowed (see Figure 2). All studies reported increased activation in mentalizing areas of the posterior cerebellar Crus 1 and 2 (Buckner et al.; Ji et al.; Nettekoven et al.; Van Overwalle et al.) during a critical contrast 1–4. Note that noninvasive cerebellar and sham placebo stimulations were each included as separate “studies” (cf. Haihambo et al.).

2.1.2 Exclusion Criteria

Studies were excluded from the meta‐analysis on the basis of the following exclusion criteria:

Participants
5 had neurological, mental or psychiatric disorders or diminished (social) functioning, or participants were nonhuman,
6 received hormonal or other substances such as alcohol as main manipulation in the study.

The task involved
7 no sequences of social events,
8 no social mentalizing judgments,
9 the presentation and observation of realistic biological movements (to exclude the participation of the mirror network),
10 mainly emotional judgments (e.g. recognition of facial expressions; to exclude the participation of limbic or other emotion‐related networks).

The contrasts 1–4
11 did not yield significant results in any of the ROIs or whole brain contrasts as this provided no coordinates for the meta‐analysis (this was the case for the separate noninvasive cerebellar and sham placebo stimulation conditions in Catoira et al.).

### A review on pathology, mechanism, and therapy for cerebellum and tremor in Parkinson's disease [^5b466be5]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Tremor is one of the core symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its mechanism is poorly understood. The cerebellum is a growing focus in PD-related researches and is reported to play an important role in tremor in PD. The cerebellum may participate in the modulation of tremor amplitude via cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits. The cerebellar excitatory projections to the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus may be enhanced due to PD-related changes, including dopaminergic/non-dopaminergic system abnormality, white matter damage, and deep nuclei impairment, which may contribute to dysregulation and resistance to levodopa of tremor. This review summarized the pathological, structural, and functional changes of the cerebellum in PD and discussed the role of the cerebellum in PD-related tremor, aiming to provide an overview of the cerebellum-related mechanism of tremor in PD.

Pathological changes in the cerebellum in PD

PD is characterized by Lewy body pathology formed by α-synuclein, while cerebellum was thought to be unaffected by Lewy bodies previously,. However, recent studies discovered α-synuclein-related pathological changes in the cerebellum in PD patients, which may be associated with tremor symptoms. In PD patients, α-synuclein-formed Lewy bodies, which were speculated to originate in the pre-cerebellar brainstem and spread in a prion-like manner, were identified in the cerebellum. Lewy bodies were found mainly in the cerebellar nuclei and adjacent white matters, while cerebellar lobules were only affected mildly. Histologically, in the cerebellum of PD patients, Lewy bodies were found in Bergmann glia in the molecular layer and Purkinje cell axons,.

PD patients have longer climbing fiber length, more climbing fibers extending into the molecular layer, more climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and increased percentage of climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses on the thin Purkinje cell dendritic branchlets compared with healthy controls, accompanied by torpedoes/swelling of Purkinje cell axons,. Based on cluster analysis, these pathological changes may form a pattern that predicts the presence of resting tremor, PD patients with lower climbing-fiber synaptic density and a higher Purkinje cell count tend to have rest tremor.

Moreover, iron accumulation has been identified in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum in PD. Using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), iron content in dentate nuclei was found elevated in tremor-dominant PD patients compared with healthy controls and akinesia/rigidity-dominant PD patients, and was proven positively correlated to tremor severity despite subtypes of PD –. Because iron accumulation may indicate ferroptosis, a nonapoptotic cell death pathway, increased iron content in dentate nuclei suggests a role of dentate nuclei and cerebellum in the pathophysiological mechanism of tremor in PD –. Notably, ferroptosis may also promote α-synuclein aggregation –.

Interestingly, both α-synucleinopathies and iron accumulation affect dentate nuclei, which act as the only output nuclei of the cerebellum, indicating a role of the cerebellum in tremor. White matter changes in the cerebellum, especially Purkinje cells and related climbing fiber changes, presented a clinical manifestation-related pattern, suggesting a role of cerebellar network damage in the tremor of PD. Therefore, in PD patients, damage exists in both deep nuclei and white matters of the cerebellum. These pathological changes outline a comprehensive impairment pattern of the cerebellum.

### A review on pathology, mechanism, and therapy for cerebellum and tremor in Parkinson's disease [^9f742110]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Further longitudinal researches on the change of tremor-related activity in different brain regions (e.g. cerebellum, thalamus, and cortex), tremor responsiveness to dopamine, and tremor-related activity-dopamine responsiveness relationships as disease progressing are needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of dopamine-resistant rest tremor and the role of the cerebellum in it.

In conclusion, the cerebellum is affected by α-synuclein-formed Lewy bodies and by iron accumulation in PD, which may induce tremor-related white matter alteration and tremor-specific structural and functional changes in the cerebellum. This damage in the cerebellum, together with damage of other structures, including mesencephalon, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus, may alter cerebellar (excitatory) output at three different levels (the input, the integrating process, and the output nuclei). The altered output of the cerebellum to VIM could excite the CTC circuit and enhance the tremor amplitude in PD. The dysregulation of cerebellum-modulated VIM activity may also decrease the susceptibility of VIM to levodopa, thus leading to dopamine-resistant tremor. Currently, few studies investigated the role of the cerebellum in PD-related tremor and its therapy, but still indicated an important role of the cerebellum in the mechanism of PD-related tremor. If further researched, the cerebellum may be a promising target of understanding and treatment of tremor in PD.

### Structured connectivity in the output of the cerebellar cortex [^37e56e15]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The spatial organization of a neuronal circuit is critically important for its function since the location of neurons is often associated with function. In the cerebellum, the major output of the cerebellar cortex are synapses made from Purkinje cells onto neurons in the cerebellar nuclei, yet little has been known about the spatial organization of these synapses. We explored this question using whole-cell electrophysiology and optogenetics in acute sagittal cerebellar slices to produce spatial connectivity maps of cerebellar cortical output in mice. We observed non-random connectivity where Purkinje cell inputs clustered in cerebellar transverse zones: while many nuclear neurons received inputs from a single zone, several multi-zonal connectivity motifs were also observed. Single neurons receiving input from all four zones were overrepresented in our data. These findings reveal that the output of the cerebellar cortex is spatially structured and represents a locus for multimodal integration in the cerebellum.

### Anodal cerebellar stimulation increases cortical activation: evidence for cerebellar scaffolding of cortical processing [^ac980d01]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Here using working memory and explicit motor sequence learning we demonstrated that cerebellar cathodal stimulation resulted in improved performance, and anodal stimulation hindered task performance. This effect of anodal stimulation also resulted in increased cortical activation, which we suggest is a compensatory mechanism due to the purported downregulation of the cerebellum after anodal stimulation. Specifically, when cerebellar output is degraded by anodal stimulation, the scaffolding effect the cerebellum provides is reduced, requiring more cortical activation to compensate for the reduced cerebellar output. This work has a potential to update existing models of aging and disease to include the cerebellum as a structure used to support cognitive processes, which has implications for remediation across clinical diagnoses.

PET acquisition protocols and positioning—Generally, image acquisition of the head is sufficient, and during the entire investigation continuous visual monitoring of the patient is necessary to account for motion, with monitoring particularly important in patients with metastases-associated seizures. For [18F]FDG PET/CT, a whole-body acquisition should be considered in individual patients for whom a systemic evaluation of neoplastic disease is required, and separate acquisition of the head in the same session is advised. Positioning should avoid extreme neck extension or flexion and ensure the entire brain is in the field of view, including the entire cerebellum. If a [18F]FDG whole-body scan is planned, image acquisition is performed in two separate steps (first whole-body, followed by the head) and the whole-body acquisition should be acquired with arms up to reduce artefacts in the torso.

3 RESULTS

We will henceforth refer to the cerebral cortex as “cortex,” our high‐resolution cerebellum model as “cerebellum” and the FreeSurfer outer shell segmentation of the cerebellum as “FreeSurfer cerebellum.”

3.1 Signal cancelation

3.1.1 Distributed dipoles

When the current dipoles were randomly distributed, there was no significant difference in signal cancelation between the cortex, the high‐resolution cerebellum, and the FreeSurfer cerebellum with MEG or EEG (Figure 2). There was also almost no difference in cancelation between MEG magnetometers, gradiometers, and EEG (Figure 2). Because the cancelation in MEG magnetometers and gradiometers were virtually the same, Figure 2 shows only simulation results for magnetometers and EEG. We note the fast decline in conservation factor when very few dipoles were activated; the conservation factor was less than 0.5 for fewer than 10 active dipole sources (Figure 2). For a large number of randomly distributed dipoles (> 10,000 dipoles), the conservation factor converged towards, that is, close to complete cancelation of M/EEG signals. These results show that signal cancelation for distributed sources is significant and of similar magnitude in the cerebellum and cortex with both MEG and EEG.

### The volume of experimental design cerebellum: stereological microanatomic study [^c3bd8985]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebellum is responsible to higher cognitive functions and delicate motor activity. Because of its significance, cerebellum may play a major role in cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric diseases. Therefore, the investigations on cerebellum may be contributed to the future researches so as to solve reasons of the diseases. The rabbit brain relatively larger than the rat and mouse brain and the individual evaluation of its subdivisions are rather easy. There are no data on cerebellar volume of rabbits in literature. Thus, the study presents microscopic volume calculation of rabbits' cerebellum using the stereological method. The mean (SD) calculated volume of the cerebellum in the rabbit brain was found to be 0.69 (0.03) cm3. The individual microscopic volume estimation of an animal subject can be achieved by Cavalier method. Researchers believed that the findings and the applied method in this study may be useful for the scientists.

### Organization of reward and movement signals in the basal ganglia and cerebellum [^a0f68528]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are major subcortical structures in the motor system. The basal ganglia have been cast as the reward center of the motor system, whereas the cerebellum is thought to be involved in adjusting sensorimotor parameters. Recent findings of reward signals in the cerebellum have challenged this dichotomous view. To compare the basal ganglia and the cerebellum directly, we recorded from oculomotor regions in both structures from the same monkeys. We partitioned the trial-by-trial variability of the neurons into reward and eye-movement signals to compare the coding across structures. Reward expectation and movement signals were the most pronounced in the output structure of the basal ganglia, intermediate in the cerebellum, and the smallest in the input structure of the basal ganglia. These findings suggest that reward and movement information is sharpened through the basal ganglia, resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio than in the cerebellum.

Amyloid PET—patient environment, positioning, and communication should prioritize safety and cooperation: obstacles in the room should be minimized; sharp, unstable or otherwise dangerous objects should be kept out of reach; and when restraining patients on the bed or in a head holder, frequent explanation and reassurance should be used to help the patient from becoming frightened or resistant. Imaging of the head is optimal when the head is in the center of the field of view, and the cerebrum and cerebellum should be fully in the axial FOV. Patients may have difficulty understanding the reason for the examination and the procedure, and a family member or guardian can sometimes assist communication and compliance with the instructions during the examination.

### Structured connectivity in cerebellar inhibitory networks [^8c43a04f]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

Defining the rules governing synaptic connectivity is key to formulating theories of neural circuit function. Interneurons can be connected by both electrical and chemical synapses, but the organization and interaction of these two complementary microcircuits is unknown. By recording from multiple molecular layer interneurons in the cerebellar cortex, we reveal specific, nonrandom connectivity patterns in both GABAergic chemical and electrical interneuron networks. Both networks contain clustered motifs and show specific overlap between them. Chemical connections exhibit a preference for transitive patterns, such as feedforward triplet motifs. This structured connectivity is supported by a characteristic spatial organization: transitivity of chemical connectivity is directed vertically in the sagittal plane, and electrical synapses appear strictly confined to the sagittal plane. The specific, highly structured connectivity rules suggest that these motifs are essential for the function of the cerebellar network.

### Cerebellum and social abilities: a structural and functional connectivity study in a transdiagnostic sample [^984f878e]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The cerebellum has been involved in social abilities and autism. Given that the cerebellum is connected to the cortex via the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, the connectivity between the cerebellum and cortical regions involved in social interactions, that is, the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) has been studied in individuals with autism, who suffer from prototypical deficits in social abilities. However, existing studies with small samples of categorical, case-control comparisons have yielded inconsistent results due to the inherent heterogeneity of autism, suggesting that investigating how clinical dimensions are related to cerebellar-rTPJ functional connectivity might be more relevant. Therefore, our objective was to study the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and rTPJ, focusing on its association with social abilities from a dimensional perspective in a transdiagnostic sample. We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans obtained during naturalistic films watching from a large transdiagnostic dataset, the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), and examined the association between cerebellum-rTPJ functional connectivity and social abilities measured with the social responsiveness scale (SRS). We conducted univariate seed-to-voxel analysis, multivariate canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and predictive support vector regression (SVR). We included 1404 subjects in the structural analysis (age: 10.516±3.034, range: 5.822-21.820, 506 females) and 414 subjects in the functional analysis (age: 11.260±3.318years, range: 6.020-21.820, 161 females). Our CCA model revealed a significant association between cerebellum-rTPJ functional connectivity, full-scale IQ (FSIQ) and SRS scores. However, this effect was primarily driven by FSIQ as suggested by SVR and univariate seed-to-voxel analysis. We also demonstrated the specificity of the rTPJ and the influence of structural anatomy in this association. Our results suggest that there is a complex relationship between cerebellum-rTPJ connectivity, social performance and IQ. This relationship is specific to the cerebellum-rTPJ connectivity, and is largely related to structural anatomy in these two regions. PRACTITIONER POINTS: We analyzed cerebellum-right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) connectivity in a pediatric transdiagnostic sample. We found a complex relationship between cerebellum and rTPJ connectivity, social performance and IQ. Cerebellum and rTPJ functional connectivity is related to structural anatomy in these two regions.

Results

From 162 records, ultimately 25 studies were included in the analysis, providing MRI-based connectivity data for 1917 subjects with an age range from 30 gestational weeks to 87 years (Fig. 2) [,,,,,,–,–,,,,,–,,,,]. Fifteen studies reported sensorimotor connectivity [,,,,,,,,,–,,,]. Cognitive, associative, and limbic connectivities were described in 14 studies.

Fig. 2 
PRISMA flow diagram of the present study

As visualized in Fig. 3a, connectivity of the anterior cerebellum, which is predominantly involved in sensorimotor function, was reported in similar frequency with the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), and inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP). For the posterior cerebellum, which is mainly associated with cognitive, emotional, and limbic functions, connectivity was reported mainly for the MCP, a lesser frequency for the SCP, and only rarely for the ICP.

Fig. 3 
Circular chart visualization of the connectivity between dichotomized functional cerebellar region and cerebellar peduncles (a), cerebellar cortical and nuclear anatomical areas and cerebellar peduncles (b), and cerebellar peduncles and supratentorial anatomical areas (c)

The vast majority of reported connections of the dentate nucleus (DN) were projections via the SCP, and to a smaller extent via the ICP (Fig. 3b). Direct connectivity of the MCP to several cerebellar cortical locations was evident, reflecting corticocerebellar and pontinocerebellar tracts.

With regard to connectivity to supratentorial cerebral structures (Fig. 3c), the SCP was found to connect mainly to thalamus as well as prefrontal and primary motor cortex. Connectivity of the MCP was reported for a broad spectrum of cerebral areas, including cortex, basal ganglia, and limbic system (but not thalamus). At the level of the brainstem, the pontine, red, and inferior olivary nuclei are implicated in these connections.

### Neural signals regulating motor synchronization in the primate deep cerebellar nuclei [^1b62cc81]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Synchronized movements to periodic events, such as dancing to music or clapping hands, are common in daily life. Such movements require information processing in the sensorimotor areas in the cerebral cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum –. In particular, when the cerebellum is damaged, rhythmic movements cannot be performed with a precision of tens to hundreds of milliseconds,. This is not surprising since the cerebellum is involved in regulating the timing of contraction of multiple muscles during motor execution, thereby enabling coordinated movements,. The cerebellum has also been shown to be important in the initiation of movement, especially its timing –. In theories of motor control, the essential role of the cerebellum is to generate internal models that allow for predictive motor control. The internal models are formed by experience and updated through learning to maintain accurate movement. This adaptive learning mechanism by the cerebellum optimizes not only the magnitude and direction of movement – but also its timing,.

In addition to motor control, when synchronizing with external rhythms, it is also necessary to detect the periodicity of events and make sensory predictions accordingly. The importance of the basal ganglia in such processes has long been recognized. Evidence from clinical cases,, functional imaging with non-motor rhythmic tasks,, and physiological experiments in primates, all suggest a role for the basal ganglia in beat-based timing. Recent studies have also shown that the cerebellum is involved in rhythm processing. For example, studies using magnetoencephalographyand experimental animals, have demonstrated that rhythm perception without movement involves periodic entrainment of neuronal activity in the cerebellum and its connected brain regions. Such activities might be related to temporal attention,. Furthermore, the cerebellum has been shown to be involved in predicting the trajectory of visual stimuli in the absence of movement, indicating that the cerebellum also generates internal forward models for purely sensory events –. Thus, the cerebellum is likely to be responsible for information processing necessary for synchronized movements, including sensory prediction of periodic events, predictive motor control based on these internal representations, and error monitoring for updating the forward models. Since the cerebellum forms loop circuits with various areas in the cerebral cortex and therefore contains multiple functional modules –, it is possible that these functions are processed in parallel through the relevant networks. However, it remains largely unknown how the cerebellum represents and processes information for synchronized movements.

### Involvement of the cerebellum in semantic discrimination: an fMRI study [^d283fdb6]. Human Brain Mapping (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), whether semantic discrimination, an inner linguistic task without overt articulation, can elicit activation in the cerebellum. Six subjects performed three semantic tasks with different loads of discrimination while being scanned. All three semantic tasks activated distributed brain areas, including the right posterior inferior cerebellum. Much stronger activation was found in the cerebellum in more difficult tasks, in terms of the activation volume and signal intensity. These results suggest that the cerebellum activation is involved in semantic discrimination and is modulated by discrimination difficulty.

### Leukodystrophies in children: diagnosis, care, and treatment [^22bd6e2e]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Leukodystrophy categories and definition—scope and examples are provided: a leukodystrophy is broadly any genetic disease affecting the myelin of the central nervous system (CNS). Leukodystrophies fall into (1) hypomyelination, (2) dysmyelination, and (3) demyelination, with demyelinating examples including Krabbe disease, X-ALD, and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and hypomyelinating examples including Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), RNA polymerase III–related leukodystrophies/4-H syndrome, and hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. A single disease can fall into more than one category, MRI-based categorization can be subjective, and there is disagreement over the exact definition. One standard published in 2015 classified 30 diseases as leukodystrophies, defined as heritable disorders affecting CNS white matter with or without peripheral nervous system involvement; acquired CNS myelin disorders are not included. Next-generation sequencing is revealing genotype-phenotype relationships that were unsuspected and unknown 5 years ago.

### Structured connectivity in cerebellar inhibitory networks [^bf5d4c84]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Defining the rules governing synaptic connectivity is key to formulating theories of neural circuit function. Interneurons can be connected by both electrical and chemical synapses, but the organization and interaction of these two complementary microcircuits is unknown. By recording from multiple molecular layer interneurons in the cerebellar cortex, we reveal specific, nonrandom connectivity patterns in both GABAergic chemical and electrical interneuron networks. Both networks contain clustered motifs and show specific overlap between them. Chemical connections exhibit a preference for transitive patterns, such as feedforward triplet motifs. This structured connectivity is supported by a characteristic spatial organization: transitivity of chemical connectivity is directed vertically in the sagittal plane, and electrical synapses appear strictly confined to the sagittal plane. The specific, highly structured connectivity rules suggest that these motifs are essential for the function of the cerebellar network.

### A functional neuroanatomy of tics in tourette syndrome (...) [^0ee05b89]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

In an individual patient with prominent coprolalia, such vocal tics were associated with activity in prerolandic and postrolandic language regions, insula, caudate, thalamus, and cerebellum, while activity in sensorimotor cortex was noted with motor tics. Conclusions Aberrant activity in the interrelated sensorimotor, language, executive, and paralimbic circuits identified in this study may account for the initiation and execution of diverse motor and vocal behaviors that characterize tics in TS, as well as for the urges that often accompany them. Activations in superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, and a point near the anterior thalamus, extending toward the head of caudate were also detected. These foci of activation are displayed and characterized in Figure 1 and Table 2. For particular tics, the specific cortical and subcortical regions that are activated may determine the phenomenology of the behavior.

In the individual analysis, coprolalia was associated with activation in the region of the Broca's area and the frontal operculum, known to be involved in the generation of speech. Activation was also noted in the head of the caudate, which has recently been identified by lesion methods as a critical component of the network underlying language. 45 The other language regions noted may have been involved in the generation or the subsequent hearing of the self-generated linguistic material. Activation in the posterior congulate gyrus has recently been described in association with emotional linguistic material. 46 The thalamic and cerebellar activations are consistent with the roles of these structures in modulating outflow of the cortical-subcortical circuits implicated.

In contrast to the vocal tics, motor tics were associated with notable sensorimotor cortex activation. It is likely that activations of somatotopically specific subregions in sensorimotor cortices would be associated with movements in specific corresponding muscle groups. In conclusion, activity was noted specifically during tics in motor/vocalization, paralimbic, premotor, and executive frontal-subcortical brain systems. Autonomous activity in these regions may account for the striking motor and vocal acts of TS patients, and may contribute to the "unvoluntary" experience of an irresistible urge that often accompanies these acts.

### Structured connectivity in cerebellar inhibitory networks [^f16306ef]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Molecular layer interneurons in the cerebellum play an important role in regulating cerebellar output and motor learning. They are interconnected by GABAergic chemical synapses and by electrical synapses. The connections between molecular layer interneurons have important functional roles: the electrical connections can promote synchrony, whereas the chemical synapses can delay action potentials and affect the precision of spike timing in postsynaptic interneurons. However, the level of overlap between the chemical and electrical networks and their higher-level organization remain unclear.

Here, we use multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to investigate the electrical and chemical connectivity of the interneuron network in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. We find that the structure of the network follows mostly random connectivity predictions at the level of pairs of neurons but deviates strongly from these predictions when probed at the level of triplets and quadruplets of neurons. Chemical synapses preferably form transitive connectivity motifs, such that if cell A connects to cell B, and B to C, then cell A also connects to cell C. We show that the observed connectivity is supported by a defined spatial organization: electrical synapses are restricted to sagittal planes, and the chemical transitivity is oriented in the sagittal plane. These signs of structured connectivity have important implications for the function of the network.

### Separation of trait and state in stuttering [^4ccff413]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the current study, we used a hierarchical approach to directly isolate fMRI activity related not only to general traits of stuttering but also to dysfluent states of speech within people who stutter. We also distinguished specific state effects within individuals who stutter from activation related to the frequency of dysfluent speech produced in the scanner by different subgroups of people who stutter. Furthermore, we examined whether any of these factors differed according to the task performed in the scanner. The results indicated differences in brain activity in stuttering that can be related to four factors: general traits, frequency of dysfluent states, specific speech states, and task demands. Below we elaborate on each of these factors before discussing the task findings from the study and some methodological considerations.

4.1 General trait effects of stuttering

Our trait analysis failed to reveal differences in brain activity across tasks in people who stutter relative to fluent controls at a statistical threshold corrected for multiple comparisons. We reported results instead at an exploratory threshold that did not require such a large extent of voxels to be activated to pass the corrected significance threshold. At this more lenient threshold, people who stutter showed reduced activity relative to controls in the posterior parts of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, the right postcentral gyrus, the right parietal operculum, the left superior temporal cortex, the medial occipital cortex, and several portions of the cerebellum both medially and laterally. These trait effects were predominantly due to greater activity during task relative to baseline in the control group compared with the stuttering group (see Table 3). Several of these regions also showed reduced activity in people who stutter in previous reports: inferior frontal cortex (Neef et al. 2016 ; Watkins et al. 2008); left superior temporal (auditory) cortex (e.g. Brown et al. 2005 ; Giraud et al. 2008 ; Watkins et al. 2008;Toyomura et al. 2015 ;Budde et al. 2014); and medial cerebellum (Chang, Kenney, Loucks, & Ludlow, 2009 ; Ingham et al. 2012). However, our findings are notably inconsistent with the broader claim that overactivity of the right inferior frontal cortex and cerebellar vermis are “neural signatures” of stuttering (Brown et al. 2005 ; Belyk et al. 2017 ; Budde et al. 2014).

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^4f2302e5]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Ischemic stroke subtype definitions and ESUS evaluation—Cerebral cortical involvement or brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction are described, with cortical and cerebellar lesions and brainstem or subcortical lesions >1.5 cm considered potentially caused by large artery atherosclerosis, and diagnostic studies should exclude potential sources of cardioembolic embolism. ESUS (embolic stroke of undetermined source) is described as a stroke that appears nonlacunar on neuroimaging without an obvious source after a minimum standard evaluation including arterial imaging, echocardiography, extended rhythm monitoring, and key laboratory studies such as a lipid profile and HbA1c to rule out known stroke etiologies such as cardioembolic sources and atherosclerosis proximal to the stroke. A diagnosis of ESUS implies the stroke is embolic in origin given the nonlacunar location, but the source of the embolus is unknown despite a minimal standard evaluation, and although cryptogenic stroke similarly implies that the cause of the origin is unknown, the stroke is not necessarily embolic; individuals with ESUS have cryptogenic stroke, but the converse is not always the case.

Conclusions

This study shows distinct volumetric changes in different types of cerebellar degeneration. Volumetric changes in cortical and subcortical hubs for motor performance, locomotion, navigation and cognition reflect functional disability in chronic cerebellar degeneration.

### Cerebellar control of reach kinematics for endpoint precision [^b6e64946]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

The cerebellum is well appreciated to impart speed, smoothness, and precision to skilled movements such as reaching. How these functions are executed by the final output stage of the cerebellum, the cerebellar nuclei, remains unknown. Here, we identify a causal relationship between cerebellar output and mouse reach kinematics and show how that relationship is leveraged endogenously to enhance reach precision. Activity in the anterior interposed nucleus (IntA) was remarkably well aligned to reach endpoint, scaling with the magnitude of limb deceleration. Closed-loop optogenetic modulation of IntA activity, triggered on reach, supported a causal role for this activity in controlling reach velocity in real time. Relating endogenous neural variability to kinematic variability, we found that IntA endpoint activity is adaptively engaged relative to variations in initial reach velocity, supporting endpoint precision. Taken together, these results provide a framework for understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the intermediate cerebellum during precise skilled movements.

### Cerebellar functional dysconnectivity in drug-Naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia [^0e70e9d8]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebellar functional dysconnectivity has long been implicated in schizophrenia. However, the detailed dysconnectivity pattern and its underlying biological mechanisms have not been well-charted. This study aimed to conduct an in-depth characterization of cerebellar dysconnectivity maps in early schizophrenia.

Study Design

Resting-state fMRI data were processed from 196 drug-naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 167 demographically matched healthy controls. The cerebellum was parcellated into nine functional systems based on a state-of-the-art atlas, and seed-based connectivity for each cerebellar system was examined. The observed connectivity alterations were further associated with schizophrenia risk gene expressions using data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas.

Study Results

Overall, we observed significantly increased cerebellar connectivity with the sensorimotor cortex, default-mode regions, ventral part of visual cortex, insula, and striatum. In contrast, decreased connectivity was shown chiefly within the cerebellum, and between the cerebellum and the lateral prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe, and dorsal visual areas. Such dysconnectivity pattern was statistically similar across seeds, with no significant group by seed interactions identified. Moreover, connectivity strengths of hypoconnected but not hyperconnected regions were significantly correlated with schizophrenia risk gene expressions, suggesting potential genetic underpinnings for the observed hypoconnectivity.

Conclusions

These findings suggest a common bidirectional dysconnectivity pattern across different cerebellar subsystems, and imply that such bidirectional alterations may relate to different biological mechanisms.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for brain [ F ] FDG PET imaging, version 2.0 [^74a1dbfd]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Brain [18F]FDG PET attenuation correction—visual checks and MR-AC limitations—states that it is recommended to visually control the generated attenuation correction maps for artifacts from metal or dental implants, missing cavities, and missing bones, particularly in MR-AC, and notes that tracer uptake in cortical brain regions may be underestimated by about 20% while pons or cerebellum may show upward bias if air cavities are not correctly considered; use of CT templates can overcome these limitations but may be less accurate with abnormal bone anatomy, and inserting individual CT scans into the PET/MR reconstruction pipeline is noted as not routinely available and formally approved on PET/MR systems.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^c141d935]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Brain structure and ASD—neuropathology describes that neuropathological research has been limited by the small number of postmortem brains available for study, and developmental brain abnormalities in people with ASD are reported in the cerebral neocortex; limbic system structures (including the hippocampal formation and amygdala); basal ganglia; thalamus; brainstem; and cerebellum. These abnormalities include dysplasia, altered neurogenesis, and abnormal neuronal migration, and the vast majority of abnormalities described originate during prenatal brain development. Findings in the cerebral cortex may include focal disruption of neuronal migration, minicolumnar abnormalities, and variations in neuronal density. A decreased number of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum is 1 of the most consistently reported neuropathologic findings associated with ASD; although initially thought to be prenatal in onset, evidence now indicates this phenomenon is more likely acquired postnatally, potentially related to seizures, medications, and/or ischemia or other factors. No uniform neuropathology has been identified in people with ASD.

### Epileptic activity intrinsically generated in the human cerebellum [^8f8f4bf3]. Annals of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Neoplastic or dysplastic neuronal tissue in the brain stem and cerebellum can become epileptogenic in pediatric patients. However, it is unknown whether such tissue may transform intrinsic properties of the human cerebellum, making it capable of generating epileptic population activity. We noninvasively detected epileptiform signals unaveraged in a pediatric patient with epilepsy due to a tumor in the middle cerebellar peduncle. Analysis of generators of the signals revealed that the cerebellum ipsilateral and contralateral to the tumor was the dominant interictal spike generator and could initiate ictal activity, suggesting that human cerebellum may become capable of intrinsically generating epileptic activity.

### A cortico-cerebellar loop for motor planning [^9e1c99da]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Persistent and ramping neural activity in the frontal cortex anticipates specific movements 1-6 . Preparatory activity is distributed across several brain regions 7,8 , but it is unclear which brain areas are involved and how this activity is mediated by multi-regional interactions. The cerebellum is thought to be primarily involved in the short-timescale control of movement 9-12 ; however, roles for this structure in cognitive processes have also been proposed 13-16 . In humans, cerebellar damage can cause defects in planning and working memory 13 . Here we show that persistent representation of information in the frontal cortex during motor planning is dependent on the cerebellum. Mice performed a sensory discrimination task in which they used short-term memory to plan a future directional movement. A transient perturbation in the medial deep cerebellar nucleus (fastigial nucleus) disrupted subsequent correct responses without hampering movement execution. Preparatory activity was observed in both the frontal cortex and the cerebellar nuclei, seconds before the onset of movement. The silencing of frontal cortex activity abolished preparatory activity in the cerebellar nuclei, and fastigial activity was necessary to maintain cortical preparatory activity. Fastigial output selectively targeted the behaviourally relevant part of the frontal cortex through the thalamus, thus closing a cortico-cerebellar loop. Our results support the view that persistent neural dynamics during motor planning is maintained by neural circuits that span multiple brain regions 17 , and that cerebellar computations extend beyond online motor control 13-15,18 .

### Structured connectivity in the output of the cerebellar cortex [^fe972918]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We wanted to explore how Purkinje cell inputs onto CN neurons are spatially organized within the sagittal plane. We focused on the cerebellar fastigial nucleus, since neurons in the fastigial nucleus receive most Purkinje cell input from the vermis, and are thus preserved within an acute slice preparation. We used electrophysiology and focal optogenetic stimulation to build spatial connectivity maps of Purkinje cell inputs onto individual CN neurons within the sagittal plane. We found that Purkinje cell inputs to the CN are organized along the same four transverse zones that are defined during cerebellar development. While many CN neurons receive input from a single zone, others receive Purkinje cell input from multiple zones, and connectivity between Purkinje cells and CN neurons is not random. We performed viral labeling of Purkinje cells from different zones and observed that their axons terminate in close proximity within the CN, providing anatomical support for our functional data. Finally, we performed both cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from single CN neurons to determine how Purkinje cell synaptic inputs affect CN output. We found that even small synaptic inputs could shape CN neuron output, suggesting that inputs may not need to synchronize to influence CN output. Our findings support CN neurons as a locus of integration within the cerebellum that is important for cerebellar information processing.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus-related brain abnormalities in the default mode network and the limbic system: a resting-state fMRI meta-analysis [^36a7ff19]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune-mediated and multi-systemic disease which may affect the nervous system, causing neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). Recent neuroimaging studies have examined brain functional alterations in SLE. However, discrepant findings were reported. This meta-analysis aims to identify consistent resting-state functional abnormalities in SLE.

Methods

PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify candidate resting-state functional MRI studies assessing SLE. A voxel-based meta-analysis was performed using the anisotropic effect-size version of the seed-based d mapping (AES-SDM). The abnormal intrinsic functional patterns extracted from SDM were mapped onto the brain functional network atlas to determine brain abnormalities at a network level.

Results

Twelve studies evaluating fifteen datasets were included in this meta-analysis, comprising 572 SLE patients and 436 healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, SLE patients showed increased brain activity in the bilateral hippocampus and right superior temporal gyrus, and decreased brain activity in the left superior frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, bilateral thalamus, left inferior frontal gyrus and right cerebellum. Mapping the abnormal patterns to the network atlas revealed the default mode network and the limbic system as core neural systems commonly affected in SLE.

Limitations

The number of included studies is relatively small, with heterogeneous analytic methods and a risk of publication bias.

Conclusions

Brain functional alterations in SLE are predominantly found in the default mode network and the limbic system. These findings uncovered a consistent pattern of resting-state functional network abnormalities in SLE which may serve as a potential objective neuroimaging biomarker.

### Routine neuroimaging of the preterm brain [^d8c4edb7]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Standard cranial ultrasound imaging technique—acoustic windows, planes, and posterior fossa assessment—details how to optimize detection of cerebellar injury. Cranial ultrasound imaging has traditionally made use of the anterior fontanelle as an acoustic window and should be performed by an American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography board-certified sonographer, with coronal and sagittal plane imaging and appropriate angulation. Use of the posterior fontanelle may allow more detailed assessment of the periventricular white matter and occipital lobes, but anterior fontanelle views provide limited views of the posterior fossa and cerebellum. The cerebellum is a frequent site of injury, with significant hemorrhage occurring in as many as 9% of preterm infants with a diagnosis made by appropriately performed ultrasonography; for this reason, additional imaging through the mastoid fontanelle is recommended. In cases of limited cerebellar hemorrhage, there was much better imaging sensitivity when mastoid views were obtained (86%) than when only the anterior fontanelle was assessed (16%), although most viewers were unable to detect cerebellar microhemorrhages, which can only be visualized with MRI.

### EANM practice guideline / SNMMI procedure standard for dopaminergic imaging in parkinsonian syndromes 1.0 [^fd5603a2]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). High credibility.

PET data acquisition and quantification—binding potential and specific binding ratio parameters are specified as follows: Suggested dynamic acquisition for estimation of binding potential (BPND) has a duration of 60 min, while suggested static acquisitions are 25 min from 17 to 42 min and, for routine clinical use, 10 min from 30 to 40 min. Image processing includes measured or CT attenuation correction, with OSEM reconstruction noting that resolution/PSF modeling is not needed for routine clinical use and a final image resolution of 5–8 mm. Binding potential (BPND) is estimated with a simplified reference tissue method or Logan graphical analysis using the cerebellum as the reference region. Semiquantification calculates the specific binding ratio (SBR) with cerebellar gray matter as reference and uses target metrics including SBR Caudate, SBR Putamen, SBR Striatum, the Putamen/Caudate ratio, and a hemisphere asymmetry index.

### Cerebellar development and its mediation role in cognitive planning in childhood [^5327441e]. Human Brain Mapping (2018). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that the cerebellum contributes not only to the planning and execution of movement but also to the high-order cognitive planning. Childhood is a critical period for development of the cerebellum and cognitive planning. This study aimed (a) to examine the development of cerebellar morphology and microstructure and (b) to examine the cerebellar mediation roles in the relationship between age and cognitive planning in 6- to 10-year-old children (n=126). We used an anatomical parcellation to quantify cerebellar regional gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes, and WM microstructure, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). We assessed planning ability using the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) task in all children. We revealed (a) a measure-specific anterior-to-posterior gradient of the cerebellar development in childhood, that is, smaller GM volumes and greater WM FA of the anterior segment of the cerebellum but larger GM volumes and lower WM FA in the posterior segment of the cerebellum in older children; (b) an age-related improvement of the SOC performance at the most demanding level of five-move problems; and (c) a mediation role of the lateral cerebellar WM volumes in age-related improvement in the SOC performance in childhood. These results highlight the differential development of the cerebellum during childhood and provide evidence that brain adaptation to the acquisition of planning ability during childhood could partially be achieved through the engagement of the lateral cerebellum.

### Supervisory attentional system in nonamnesic alcoholic men (...) [^098466f0]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Chronic alcohol consumption seems to be associated with severe executive function deficits, which are still present after a protracted period of alcohol abstinence. These data support the idea that the cognitive deficits in recently detoxified sober alcoholic subjects are due, at least partly, to frontal lobe dysfunctioning. The generalized brain dysfunction hypothesis asserts that long-term alcohol abuse produces neurotoxic effects throughout the brain, resulting in mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction that is global and nonspecific. 11 Although this hypothesis is consistent with the heterogeneity of neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data on chronic alcoholism, 12, 13 it appears to be so broad that it is difficult to disprove. Lastly, the frontal brain vulnerability hypothesis suggests that the frontal lobes are greatly vulnerable to long-term consumption of alcohol.

14 Moderate neuronal loss has been reported in the frontal cortex and in the cingulate gyrus in alcoholic subjects15 supporting this hypothesis. The interaction between these 2 factors was also significant. Post hoc analysis revealed that alcoholic subjects produced fewer words than controls only in the alternate fluency condition. On the Flexibility test, alcoholic subjects found fewer uncommon uses of objects than controls. The results of the Alpha-Span Task39 show that, in alcoholic subjects, the normal storage component remains healthy but the ability to manipulate the information stored is impaired.

A recent positron emission tomographic study53 indicated that the executive processes involved in a modified version of the Alpha-Span Task is distributed between frontal and parietal attentional systems. These data suggest that, in alcoholic subjects, this parietofrontal network might be disrupted. The findings of the present study showed that inhibition, planning, rule detection, and coordination of dual tasks were impaired in recently detoxified male alcoholic subjects. It seems as if these SAS/EC deficits were probably not caused by reduced processing speed. More generally, these findings are consistent with the view that the cognitive deficits in recently detoxified sober alcoholic subjects are due, at least partly, to frontal lobe dysfunctioning.

### Brain structure in juvenile-onset Huntington disease [^d053c154]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the context of human AOHD studies, loss of striatal volume and deterioration of surrounding white matter are detectable by neuroimaging up to 20 years before the disease onset, while the cerebellum is unchanged and described as being spared.Some evidence to support the notion that the cerebellum is spared from the disease process comes from the somatic instability literature. The striatum has extraordinarily high somatic instability, which means that over time, the CAG repeat lengths within striatal neurons become longer and longer, possibly driving symptom onset and progression. However, CAG repeats within HTT are exceedingly stable in the cerebellum.

What role the cerebellum has in JOHD is still unclear, however. Emerging neuroanatomical work by Bostan and Strick identified that bidirectional connections exist between basal ganglia and the cerebellum.Disynaptic projections exist between the cerebellum and striatum. The dentate nucleus of cerebellum is connected to dorsocaudal putamen via the ventrolateral thalamus. A returning projection connects the output of basal ganglia, the subthalamic nucleus, to the motor division of anterior cerebellar lobe via pontine nuclei. This circuitry with the striatum is integrated into the indirect pathway, which serves, in general, to inhibit movement. Those studies establish the existence of an integrated motor circuit between the striatum and cerebellum. In addition, our group has previously published regarding the effect of CAG repeat in HTT's effect on normal brain development.In children with CAG repeats below disease threshold (<35), the greater the number of CAG repeats is predictive of smaller putamen and larger cerebellum volumes (this effect was particularly strong in males). This suggests that HTT acts on brain development to sculpt an optimal striatal-cerebellar circuit. When the CAG repeat lengths become too long, this relationship may become pathologic with abnormally small volumes of the striatum being compensated for by increasingly larger cerebellum volumes. Given that an abnormal striatum in HD leads to hyperkinesis, an enlarged cerebellum could potentially compensate for this by driving the indirect pathway through its connection through the striatum, inhibiting excessive movements.

### Flortaucipir f-18 (Tauvid) [^da74189e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4 Image Display

The goal of the read is to identify and locate areas of flortaucipir activity in the neocortex that are greater than the background activity (background activity is defined as up to 1.65-fold the measured cerebellar average). For optimal display, select a color scale with a rapid transition between two distinct colors and adjust the scale so that the transition occurs at the 1.65-fold threshold. Examine the posterolateral temporal (PLT), occipital, parietal, and frontal regions bilaterally. Neocortical activity in either hemisphere contributes to image interpretation. Activity in white matter or regions outside the brain does not contribute to image interpretation. To help identify the PLT, consider subdividing the temporal lobe into four quadrants as instructed below. Activity in the anterior and medial temporal lobe does not contribute to image interpretation of a positive TAUVID pattern.

Image Display and Orientation

Display images in the transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes. Reorient images to remove head tilt in the transverse and coronal plane. Use a sagittal slice just off the midline to align the inferior frontal and inferior occipital poles in the horizontal plane.

Select and Adjust the Color Scale

To create a visual threshold for positivity:

Draw a region of interest around the cerebellum in the transverse plane.
Select the plane to go through the cerebellum at the maximum cross-sectional area of the cerebellum.
Record the mean activity or cerebellar counts (MCC). The region of interest should be drawn with the scan in gray scale and in the transverse plane as seen in the example in Figure 1 .

Figure 1: Example of Cerebellar Region of Interest

Select a color scale for image display that has a rapid transition between two distinct colors in the general range of 25% to 60% of maximum intensity.
Set the upper contrast value (UCV) of the color scale. Use the following formula to set the visual threshold of 1.65 x MCC to match the rapid transition in the color scale:

### Florbetapir f 18 (Amyvid) [^03aa0dec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Image Display

Display images in the transaxial orientation with access as needed to the sagittal and coronal planes.
In reviewing the images, include all transaxial slices of the brain using a black-white scale set to the maximum intensity of all the brain pixels.
Initially locate the brain slice with the highest levels of image contrast (highest signal intensity) and adjust the contrast appropriately.
Start image interpretation by displaying slices sequentially from the bottom of the brain to the top. Periodically refer to the sagittal and coronal plane image display as needed to better define the signal intensity and to ensure that the entire brain is displayed.

Visual Assessment

AMYVID images should be interpreted only by readers who successfully complete the training program provided by the manufacturer.

Perform image interpretation independently of the patient's clinical features, relying on the recognition of unique image features.

Interpret AMYVID images based upon the distribution of signal intensity within the cerebral cortex by comparing the signal intensity in the cortical gray matter and the adjacent white matter. The signal intensity in the cerebellum does not contribute to the scan interpretation. For example, a positive scan may show retained cerebellar gray-white contrast even when the cortical gray-white contrast is lost.

Some scans may be difficult to interpret due to image noise, atrophy with a thinned cortical ribbon, or image blur. For cases where there is uncertainty as to the location of cortical signal, use co-registered anatomical imaging to improve localization of signal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

Negative AMYVID Scan

Negative scans show more signal in white matter than in adjacent cortical gray matter, creating clear gray-white contrast.

A negative scan indicates sparse to no amyloid beta neuritic plaques. In patients being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline who have not been treated with amyloid beta-directed therapy, a negative scan is inconsistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD at the time of image acquisition and reduces the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD. A negative scan result does not preclude the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain in the future.

### A functional MRI study of somatotopic representation of somatosensory stimulation in the cerebellum [^c2fa6720]. Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Somatotopic representation in the cerebral cortex of somatosensory stimulation has been widely reported, but that in the cerebellum has not. We investigated the latter in the human cerebellum by functional MRI (fMRI). Using a 1.5 tesla imager, we obtained multislice blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI with single-shot gradient-echo echoplanar imaging in seven right-handed volunteers during electrical stimulation of the left index finger and big toe. In the anterior and posterior cerebellum, activated pixels for the index finger were separate from those for the toe. This suggests that somatosensory stimulation of different parts of the body may involve distinct areas of in the cerebellum as well as the cerebral cortex.

2.4 Image Display and Interpretation

Image Display

Display images in the transaxial orientation using gray scale or inverse gray scale. The sagittal and coronal planes may be used for additional orientation purposes.
CT or MR images may be helpful for anatomic reference purposes. However, visual assessment should be performed using the axial planes according to the recommended reading methodology.
Locate regions which ‘anatomically’ correspond to white matter structures (e.g., the cerebellar white matter or the splenium) for orientation.
Review images in a systematic manner, starting with the cerebellum and scrolling up through the lateral temporal and frontal lobes, the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and the parietal lobes.

Visual Assessment

NEURACEQ images should be interpreted only by readers who successfully complete training provided by the manufacturer. The reader training can be accessed here: https://www.neuraceqreadertraining.com/learn.

Perform image interpretation independently of the patient’s clinical features, relying on the recognition of unique image features.

Interpret NEURACEQ images based upon the distribution of signal intensity within the cerebral cortex by comparing the signal intensity in the cortical gray matter and the adjacent white matter. Signal intensity in the gray matter is assessed in the following four brain regions: the temporal lobes, the frontal lobes, the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and the parietal lobes. For a gray matter cortical region to be assessed as showing increased signal, the majority of slices from the respective region must be affected. The signal intensity in the cerebellum does not contribute to the scan interpretation. For example, a positive scan may show retained cerebellar gray-white contrast even when the cortical gray-white contrast is lost.

### Recent binge drinking predicts smaller cerebellar volumes in adolescents [^e05e5921]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

The current study examined the effects of recent binge drinking on cerebellar morphometry in a sample of healthy adolescents. Participants were 106 teenagers (46 bingers and 60 controls) aged 16-19 who received a high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. FreeSurfer segmented and quantified the volume of each cerebellum. Maximum drinks during a binge in the past 3 months and duration since last binge were examined as predictors of cerebellar volume, after controlling for potentially confounding variables. In the 106 teens, higher peak drinks predicted smaller left hemisphere cerebellar gray and whitematter, and right hemisphere cerebellar gray matter, and marginally predicted smaller right hemisphere cerebellar white matter. Gender did not moderate these effects. More intense adolescent binge drinking is linked to smaller cerebellar volumes even in healthy teens, above and beyond variability attributable to risk factors for binge drinking. Longitudinal research is needed to see if cerebellar volumes worsen with protracted drinking and recover with abstinence. Interventions aimed at improving brain structure in adolescent binge drinkers are necessary given the high prevalence of risky drinking in youth.

### Focal dystonia: functional connectivity changes in cerebellar-basal ganglia-cortical circuit and preserved global functional architecture [^94241638]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Neuroimaging studies suggest that changes in the cerebellar-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical sensorimotor circuit are a pathophysiologic feature of focal dystonia. However, it remains unclear whether structural and functional alterations vary in different forms of focal dystonia. Thus, in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BSP), we aimed to investigate structural damage and resting-state functional alterations using whole-brain and seed-based approaches to test the hypothesis of possible functional connectivity (FC) alterations in specific circuits, including the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex, in the context of preserved global FC.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, we applied a multimodal 3T MRI protocol, including 3-dimensional T1-weighted images to extract brain volumes and cortical thickness, and fMRI at rest to study FC of the dentate nucleus and globus pallidus with a seed-based approach and whole-brain FC with a graph theory approach.

Results

This study included 33 patients (17 with CD [14 female] age 55.7 ± 10.1 years, 16 with BSP [11 female] age 62.9 ± 8.8 years) and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) (7 female) 54.3 ± 14.3 years if age. Patients with CD, patients with BSP, and HC did not differ in terms of cortical or subcortical volume. Compared to HC, both patients with CD and patients with BSP had a loss of dentate FC anticorrelation with the sensorimotor cortex. Patients with CD and those with BSP showed increased pallidal FC with the cerebellum, supplementary motor area, and prefrontal cortices with respect to HC. Increased dentate FC with the cerebellum and thalamus and increased pallidal FC with the bilateral thalamus, sensorimotor and temporo-occipital cortices, and right putamen were present in patients with CD but not patients with BSP compared to HC. Measures of global FC, that is, global efficiency and small-worldness, did not differ between patients and HC.

Discussion

Both patients with CD and those with BSP showed altered dentate and pallidal FC with regions belonging to the integrated cerebellar-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical sensorimotor circuit, supporting the concept that focal dystonia is a disorder of specific networks and not merely a result of basal ganglia alterations in the context of a preserved whole-brain functional architecture. Differences in functional interplay among specific brain structures may distinguish CD and BSP.

### The role of the cerebellum in schizophrenia: an update of clinical, cognitive, and functional evidences [^72e55008]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Posture

Posture and gait specifically involve the cerebellum. First reports of altered postural reflexes in schizophrenia patients date from the 1970s.Measures of body postural sway are a way to assess postural control. In schizophrenia, 1 study (Marvel et al) explored the postural sway of patients and controls with a pressure-sensitive platform. Patients demonstrated more postural sway than controls, independently of medication. Differences remained significant, even after removing from the analysis the patients with tardive dyskinesia. Bloem et alreported altered long-latency postural reflexes in a heterogeneous group of medicated psychotic patients compared with different types of parkinsonism and controls. Stimuli consisted of predictable or unpredictable sequences of movements of a platform where the subjects were standing. Psychiatric patients showed adapted reflex amplitudes to predictable variations of the stimuli. Under unpredictable displacements, psychiatric and early-onset parkinsonian patients failed to present the stereotypic anticipated response, which was present in controls. Impairments in postural control in patients have also been found by Varambally et al(see “Cerebellar Symptoms in Schizophrenia”) who reported that the posture subscore of the ICARS scale for cerebellar evaluation was significantly higher compared with controls.

Alcohol abuse is highly prevalent among schizophrenia patients (50%–70%).Alcohol can alter cerebellar structure and function. However, its physiopathology on the cerebellum and any possible interaction are unknown. Sullivan et almeasured posture and gait in 4 groups: schizophrenic patients, alcoholic patients, comorbid schizophrenic-alcoholic patients, and controls. All 3 clinical groups were impaired compared with controls, but the comorbid group was significantly more impaired than both the alcoholic and schizophrenic groups, especially when tested with open eyes. This suggested 2 distinct and possibly additive physiopathological processes involving the cerebellum in patients comorbid for schizophrenia and alcohol abuse. This argument was also suggested by Deshmuck et alobserving a higher prevalence of dysdiadochokinesia in the schizophrenic group after a comparison of schizophrenics, alcoholics, and controls. Reinforcing the argument of an intrinsic cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia, the subgroup of schizophrenic patients showed a lesser prevalence of alcohol abuse, thus suggesting an intrinsic cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia.

### The mutant moonwalker TRPC3 channel links calcium signaling to lipid metabolism in the developing cerebellum [^ac8af493]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Altered calcium signaling pathways in the developing Mwk cerebellum

Having identified these dendritic and synaptic abnormalities, we next investigated the mechanism underlying Mw k TRPC3-mediated impairments in Purkinje cell development. As the Mwk phenotype results from a gain-of-function mutation in the calcium-permeable TRPC3 channel and we have also shown that VGCCs are involved (Fig. 1 C), we asked which calcium-sensitive downstream signaling pathways might be affected in the developing Mwk cerebellum. We prepared cerebellar extracts from Mwk mice and their wild-type littermates at several time points during postnatal development (P15–P46), followed by immunoblotting for key proteins of neuronal calcium signaling. We found that several calcium-sensitive signaling molecules were altered in the mutant cerebellum compared with wild-type controls. Changes were observed as early as 2 weeks postnatally. The phosphorylation status and thus the activity levels of both the extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were increased in Mwk cerebellum consistent with activated calcium signaling (Fig. 3 A). Levels of phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) were unchanged in Mwk cerebellum at all ages studied (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, phosphorylation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV) was reduced in the Mwk cerebellum (Fig. 3 C). Noteworthy, phosphorylated CaMKIV is predominantly present in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Hence, the changes in phosphorylated CaMKIV that were observed in total cerebellar extracts reflect specific changes in the Purkinje cells. Together, these findings demonstrate alterations in important calcium-sensitive signaling kinases and downstream transcription factors in the developing Mwk cerebellum.

### Hubs of long-distance co-alteration characterize brain pathology [^8bb39f0c]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 5 
Two‐dimensional representation of the decreases and increases co‐alteration networks, organized according to the belonging of each node to each one of the following resting‐state networks: visual networks 1, 2, and 3 (V1, V2, and V3), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), cerebellum, dorsal attentional network (DAN), thalamus and basal ganglia, auditory network, premotor network, salience network, default mode network (DMN), ventral attentional network (VAN), and sensorimotor network

The within‐co‐alteration of the cerebellum and thalamus‐basal‐ganglia are other examples of unexpected network‐betweenness. In fact, the prevalence of within‐network co‐alterations in these regions seems to be in contradiction with their supposed low level in the functional hierarchy, as well as with their long mean distances. As for the thalamus‐basal‐ganglia network, it must be observed that it consists in many nodes, therefore it can have enough long‐distance inter‐network edges to have long mean distances, and many relatively shorter distance intra‐network edges to result in a low network‐betweenness. Regarding the cerebellum, many of its nodes form a closed system that does not co‐alter with other networks, explaining its strong within‐co‐alteration. However, a relative minority of its regions is co‐altered with many external nodes, especially belonging to the thalamus‐basal‐ganglia and OFC, justifying its mean long distance (Figure 5).

3.2 Comparison with the map of functional DC

The co‐activation DC map reveals the presence of normative hubs in the bilateral superior temporal cortex, bilateral occipital cortex, right temporoparietal junction, and right inferior prefrontal gyrus. The systems that present the higher DC of co‐alterations are the sensorimotor network, the SN, and the auditory network. The correlations between the values of functional DC and those of GM decreases and increases mean Euclidean distance areand, respectively. The VCC analyses report a high concordance between the functional degree map and both the GM increases and decreases mean distance co‐alteration maps in most of the voxels, except for those belonging to the right PFC and the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in the GM decreases map, and those belonging to the left PFC, right MFG, and bilateral temporal cortices in the GM increases map (Figure 6).

### Physiological and brain mechanisms contributing to postural tremor in aging with and without alcohol use disorder [^76c5e3e8]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Early studies classified postural tremor by frequency and either presumed or measured brain lesion site as the anterior superior vermis of the cerebellum. Of relevance to AUD, truncal tremor, which is associated with anterior cerebellum integrity, a common site of volume deficit and Purkinje cell shrinkage, was pronounced in the 2–5 Hz range. This pattern comports with other studies of non-AUD patients who showed evidence of 3–10 Hz axial postural tremor with suspected pathology of cerebellar outflow pathways.

More recently, application of transmagnetic brain stimulation (TMS) to the left primary motor cortex reduced tremor intensity and improved postural control in all 8 patients examined with orthostatic tremor. The speculation was that TMS disrupted a faulty cerebellar-thalamic-cortical network that caused the tremor, thus invoking a multi-site source of postural instability (cf.). Consistent with this characterization of postural control, we have observed greater tremor during quiet standing while engaged in mental arithmetic in men with AUD than control men or women or women with AUD. We further found a dissociation between local tissue diffusivity, measured with MR diffusion tensor imaging, and tremor frequency exhibited by AUD men but not AUD women or controls. Specifically, greater tremor velocity in the 2–5 Hz range correlated with higher diffusivity in cerebellar and superior cingulate bundle white matter tracts, whereas greater tremor velocity in the 5–7 Hz range correlated with higher diffusivity in the motor cortex and internal capsule. Remaining to be examined are potential relations between alcohol-associated truncal tremor and regional brain volumes of these tremorgenic networks and whether the severity of tremor advances with age or is associated with evidence of pedal somatosensory impairment (cf.).

Accordingly, here we investigated physiological and brain structural factors that may contribute to a mechanistic understanding of postural instability during quiet standing in AUD and tested three hypotheses: truncal tremor would be greater in an AUD than a control group and would accelerate with aging; AUD men would exhibit greater tremor than AUD women; and greater truncal tremor in the AUD men would be related to smaller brain volumes in motor network structures measured with MRI.

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of single-photon emission brain perfusion imaging (including spect and spect / CT) [^f8406a00]. SPR/SNMMI/ACR/ACNM (2021). High credibility.

Acquisition parameters for brain perfusion scintigraphy—Dynamic blood flow imaging is required for use of Tc-99m DTPA and is recommended, but optional, for Tc-99m ECD and Tc-99m HMPAO. Acquisition should be in the anterior projection with the skull vertex and the common carotid arteries in the field of view. For Tc-99m HMPAO and Tc-99m ECD, planar static image acquisition for 500,000 to 1,000,000 counts in the anterior view is recommended, with additional lateral or posterior images depicting the cerebellum required; single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or SPECT/CT imaging may be performed.

### Sensorimotor processing for balance in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 [^735d404a]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Balance disorders are commonly observed after cerebellar lesions arising from genetic causes, ischemia, tumors, alcoholism, and trauma. 1, 2, 3, 4 However, we have no clear understanding of the cerebellum's role in balance control or the range of fundamental deficits that might be caused by different cerebellar lesions. Balance control involves acting on information about the body's current state of stability signaled by multiple sensory modalities. The cerebellum has the potential to participate in this process, because it either directly or indirectly receives considerable multisensory information known to be important for balance, including that from vestibular, 5 proprioceptive, 6 somatosensory, 7 and visual 8 sources. Here we pursue this idea by asking whether cerebellar disease is accompanied by a specific deficiency of sensorimotor processing for balance, and if so, whether the deficiency generalizes across all sensory modalities. To examine these questions, we studied a cohort of patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). SCA6 causes death of Purkinje cells in the superior and anterior parts of the cerebellum and gliosis in the flocculo‐nodular lobe. 9, 10 but with little or no extracerebellar involvement. 10 Thus, it is a rare but well‐defined and relatively pure form of cerebellar degeneration, which during quiet stance causes clear balance impairments that scale with disease severity. 4

The classical approach for studying balance is to perturb the body and measure the ensuing response. However, natural perturbations of the body inevitably stimulate multiple sensory systems simultaneously, making it difficult to analyze the processing of information from each sensory channel. The approach we have adopted, therefore, is to stimulate each of the three main sensory channels (visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive) in isolation, using stimuli that do not directly perturb the body but that nonetheless produce well‐defined postural responses. The three modes of stimulation were chosen to produce similar postural responses in the same directions so that any differences in response behavior could be attributed to the sensory channel rather than to the motor system generating the response.

We consider two fundamental sensorimotor functions that have been proposed for the cerebellum, namely, control of response scaling 11, 12, 13 and coordinate transformation. 14, 15, 16 If response scaling of a sensorimotor loop is deficient, the amplitude of the balance response will be either too small or too large. With a deficiency in the coordinate transformation of information from a sensory to an action coordinate frame, such as from head coordinates to leg coordinates, the direction of the balance response may be incorrect or excessively variable.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for amyloid PET imaging of the brain 1.0 [^a487c49b]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Amyloid PET protocol and injection—Before scanning, the patient should empty their bladder for maximum comfort during the study. The patient should be supine with suitable head support, the entire brain should be in the field of view including the entire cerebellum, and extreme neck extension or flexion should be avoided if possible; tape or other flexible head restraints may be employed and are often helpful. For 18F-florbetapir, 18F-flutemetamol and 18F-florbetaben, injection should be as a single intravenous slow-bolus in a total volume of 10 ml or less, and the dose/catheter should be flushed with at least 5-15 ml 0.9% sterile sodium chloride to ensure full delivery of the dose. The radiotracer should be injected using a short intravenous catheter (approximately 1.5 inches -4 cm- or less) to minimize the potential for adsorption of substantial amounts of the drug to the catheter.

### Unveiling altered connectivity between cognitive networks and cerebellum in schizophrenia [^03af399a]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Cognitive functioning is a crucial aspect in schizophrenia (SZ), and when altered it has devastating effects on patients' quality of life and treatment outcomes. Several studies suggested that they could result from altered communication between the cortex and cerebellum. However, the neural correlates underlying these impairments have not been identified. In this study, we investigated resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) in SZ patients, by considering the interactions between cortical networks supporting cognition and cerebellum. In addition, we investigated the relationship between SZ patients' rsFC and their symptoms. We used fMRI data from 74 SZ patients and 74 matched healthy controls (HC) downloaded from the publicly available database SchizConnect. We implemented a seed-based connectivity approach to identify altered functional connections between specific cortical networks and cerebellum. We considered ten commonly studied resting state networks, whose functioning encompasses specific cognitive functions, and the cerebellum, whose involvement in supporting cognition has been recently identified. We then explored the relationship between altered rsFC values and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores. The SZ group showed increased connectivity values compared with HC group for cortical networks involved in attentive processes, which were also linked to PANSS items describing attention and language-related processing. We also showed decreased connectivity between cerebellar regions, and increased connectivity between them and attentive networks, suggesting the contribution of cerebellum to attentive and affective deficits. In conclusion, our findings highlighted the link between negative symptoms in SZ and altered connectivity within the cerebellum and between the same and cortical networks supporting cognition.

### Secondary cerebro-cerebellar and intra-cerebellar dysfunction in cerebellar mutism syndrome [^4b451381]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) is characterized by deficits of speech, movement, and affect that can occur following tumor removal from the posterior fossa. The role of cerebro-cerebellar tract injuries in the etiology of CMS remains unclear, with recent studies suggesting that cerebro-cerebellar dysfunction may be related to chronic, rather than transient, symptomatology.

Methods

We measured functional connectivity between the cerebellar cortex and functional nodes throughout the brain using fMRI acquired after tumor removal but prior to adjuvant therapy in a cohort of 70 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma. Surgical lesions were mapped to the infratentorial anatomy, and connectivity with cerebral cortex was tested for statistical dependence on extent of cerebellar outflow pathway injury.

Results

CMS diagnosis was associated with an increase in connectivity between the right cerebellar and left cerebral hemisphere, maximally between cerebellum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VM-PFC). Connectivity dependence on cerebellar outflow was significant for some speech nodes but not for VM-PFC, suggesting altered input to the cerebellum. Connectivity between posterior regions of cerebellar cortex and ipsilateral dentate nuclei was abnormal in CMS participants, maximally within the right cerebellar hemisphere.

Conclusions

The functional abnormalities we identified are notably upstream of where causal surgical injury is thought to occur, indicating a secondary phenomenon. The VM-PFC is involved in several functions that may be relevant to the symptomatology of CMS, including emotional control and motor learning. We hypothesize that these abnormalities may reflect maladaptive learning within the cerebellum consequent to disordered motor and limbic function by the periaqueductal gray and other critical midbrain targets.

### Population-based study of baseline ethanol consumption and risk of incident essential tremor [^ffc33424]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Recent postmortem studies have demonstrated pathological changes, including Purkinje cell loss, in the cerebellum in essential tremor (ET). Toxic exposures that compromise cerebellar tissue could lower the threshold for developing ET. Ethanol is a well-established cerebellar toxin, resulting in Purkinje cell loss.

Objective

To test whether higher baseline ethanol consumption is a risk factor for the subsequent development of incident ET.

Methods

Lifetime ethanol consumption was assessed at baseline (1994-1995) in a prospective, population-based study in central Spain of 3285 elderly participants, 76 of whom developed incident ET by follow-up (1997-1998).

Results

In a Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for cigarette pack-years, depressive symptoms and community, the baseline number of drink-years was marginally associated with a higher risk of incident ET (relative risk, RR = 1.003, p = 0.059). In an adjusted Cox model, the highest baseline drink-year quartile doubled the risk of incident ET (RR = 2.29, p = 0.018), while other quartiles were associated with more modest elevations in risk (RR(3rd quartile) = 1.82 (p = 0.10), RR(2nd quartile) = 1.75 (p = 0.10), RR(1st quartile) = 1.43 (p = 0.34) vs non-drinkers (RR = 1.00)). With each higher drink-year quartile, the risk of incident ET increased an average of 23% (p = 0.01, test for trend).

Conclusions

Higher levels of chronic ethanol consumption increased the risk of developing ET. Ethanol is often used for symptomatic relief; studies should explore whether higher consumption levels are a continued source of underlying cerebellar neurotoxicity in patients who already manifest this disease.

### The male bias in the number of purkinje cells and the size of the murine cerebellum may require Müllerian inhibiting substance / anti-Müllerian hormone [^3b808204]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

There is a male bias in the size of the cerebellum, with males, on average, having more Purkinje cells than females. The critical periods in cerebellum development occur when the immature testes secrete Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS; synonym anti-Müllerian hormone) but only trace levels of testosterone. This suggests that the male bias in the cerebellum is generated by a different mechanism to the testosterone-sensitive reproductive nuclei. Consistent with this, in the present study, we report that Purkinje cells and other cerebella neurones express receptors for MIS, and that MIS(-/-) male mice have female-like numbers of Purkinje cells and a female-like size to other parts of their cerebellum. The size of the cell bodies of Purkinje cells was also dimorphic, although only a minority of this was a result of MIS. This suggests that MIS induces the initial male bias in the cerebellum, which is then refined by pubescent testosterone and/or other sex-specific factors.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^606e3478]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) small vessel disease types—arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)—account for the overwhelming majority of primary ICH and are common age-related pathologies, appearing at autopsy at moderate to severe extents in 30% to 35% of individuals in a longitudinal aging study. Arteriolosclerosis is detected as concentrically hyalinized vascular wall thickening favoring penetrating arterioles in deep territories (basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and deep cerebellar nuclei), and its major associated risk factors are hypertension, diabetes, and age. CAA is defined by deposition primarily of the β-amyloid peptide in the walls of arterioles and capillaries in the leptomeninges, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar hemispheres (lobar territories), with primary risk factors being age and apolipoprotein E genotypes containing the ε2 or ε4 alleles. ICH occurs in a relatively small subset of brains with advanced arteriolosclerosis or CAA, typically in deep territories for arteriolosclerosis and lobar territories for CAA.

### Abnormal functional activation and maturation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and cerebellum during temporal discounting in autism spectrum disorder [^da4d8f52]. Human Brain Mapping (2017). Low credibility.

People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have poor decision-making and temporal foresight. This may adversely impact on their everyday life, mental health, and productivity. However, the neural substrates underlying poor choice behavior in people with ASD, or its' neurofunctional development from childhood to adulthood, are unknown. Despite evidence of atypical structural brain development in ASD, investigation of functional brain maturation in people with ASD is lacking. This cross-sectional developmental fMRI study investigated the neural substrates underlying performance on a temporal discounting (TD) task in 38 healthy (11-35 years old) male adolescents and adults with ASD and 40 age, sex, and IQ-matched typically developing healthy controls. Most importantly, we assessed group differences in the neurofunctional maturation of TD across childhood and adulthood. Males with ASD had significantly poorer task performance and significantly lower brain activation in typical regions that mediate TD for delayed choices, in predominantly right hemispheric regions of ventrolateral/dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, striatolimbic regions, and cerebellum. Importantly, differential activation in ventromedial frontal cortex and cerebellum was associated with abnormal functional brain maturation; controls, in contrast to people with ASD, showed progressively increasing activation with increasing age in these regions; which furthermore was associated with performance measures and clinical ASD measures (stereotyped/restricted interests). Findings provide first cross-sectional evidence that reduced activation of TD mediating brain regions in people with ASD during TD is associated with abnormal functional brain development in these regions between childhood and adulthood, and this is related to poor task performance and clinical measures of ASD.

### Patterns of striatal and cerebellar functional connectivity in early-stage drug-naïve patients with Parkinson's disease subtypes [^6b7e27e9]. Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Both the striatal-thalamo-cortical (STC) circuit and cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuit play a critical role in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods

Resting-state functional MRI was used to assess functional connectivity (FC) focusing on the basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum among early-stage drug-naïve PD patients with tremor-dominant (TD) PD patients with postural instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) and healthy controls (HCs).

Results

Compared to HCs, both PD subgroups had higher FC between the cerebellum and paracentral lobule, sensorimotor areas; lower FC between the BG and superior frontal gyrus, and within the BG circuit; PD-TD patients showed higher FC between the BG and fusiform, paracentral lobule, cerebellum Lobule VI, and between the cerebellum and supplementary motor areas (SMA), insula; lower FC between the BG and rectus, sensorimotor areas, and within the cerebellum circuit; PD-PIGD patients showed higher FC between the cerebellum and middle frontal gyrus, precuneus; lower FC between the BG and cerebellum Crus II. Besides, compared to PD-PIGD patients and HCs, PD-TD patients had higher FC between the BG and calcarine region. In all PD patients, FC in paracentral lobule, SMA, and cerebellum Lobule VI positively correlated with tremor scores, and FC in calcarine area positively correlated with tremor scores, but negatively correlated with PIGD scores.

Conclusion

Our findings mainly suggested that the BG and cerebellum had hyper-connectivity with the cortical motor cortex, and the BG had prominent hyper-connectivity with the visual cortex in early-stage PD-TD patients. These findings may be helpful for facilitating the further understanding of potential mechanisms in the early-stage PD-TD. However, our results are preliminary, and further investigations are needed.
