## Question

Insulin transition glargine dose in DKa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the appropriate insulin glargine dose during the transition from intravenous insulin in diabetic ketoacidosis, including when to start it, how to calculate the dose, and how to bridge safely off the infusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the standard of care for DKA management. Then, I should verify the timing of initiating subcutaneous basal insulin relative to DKA resolution and IV insulin discontinuation. Next, I will examine dose calculation strategies, including weight-based dosing and conversion from IV infusion rates. After that, I need to check special populations and adjustments, such as renal impairment and pediatrics. I will then review the evidence for early basal insulin and reconcile it with regulatory labeling. Finally, I should confirm the practical bridging steps, monitoring, and follow-up adjustments to prevent rebound hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and standard of care. DKA is managed with IV fluids, electrolytes, and continuous IV insulin until metabolic acidosis resolves and the patient can tolerate oral intake, after which a structured transition to subcutaneous insulin is indicated to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia [^1117ZCKL] [^1164uV6V].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of basal insulin initiation. Traditional teaching is to start subcutaneous basal insulin 2–4 hours before stopping the IV insulin infusion to avoid rebound hyperglycemia, and this remains the conservative, guideline-concordant approach in many settings [^1163TwTf]. Hold on, I should also acknowledge emerging evidence that early subcutaneous basal insulin given within the first few hours of IV insulin initiation can shorten time to DKA resolution and reduce IV insulin requirements, though this strategy is not universally adopted and requires careful patient selection and monitoring [^111wB5z5] [^116Kickp] [^1143hAvE] [^111aJa5y].

> I will now examine dose calculation strategies. For most adults, a reasonable starting glargine dose is 0.3 units/kg/day, which aligns with multiple randomized trials and contemporary practice summaries, and is supported by UK guidance recommending approximately 0.25 units/kg/day in newly diagnosed patients or those transitioning off IV insulin [^111wB5z5] [^115e76ub] [^1143hAvE]. Let me consider an alternative approach: if the patient has been on IV insulin for several hours, I can estimate basal needs from the last 6–8 hours of infusion and convert to units per day; for example, 4 units/hour corresponds to roughly 0.55 units/kg/day in a 70 kg patient, which can be used to cross-check the weight-based estimate and adjusted based on clinical judgment [^111wh8sf].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and dose adjustments. In renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min, insulin clearance is reduced and hypoglycemia risk rises, so I should reduce the glargine dose to about 0.15 units/kg/day and titrate cautiously, as done in recent degludec trials and supported by pharmacokinetic reasoning and inpatient guidance for reduced insulin doses in advanced CKD [^1143hAvE] [^112MoB7x]. For pediatrics, early glargine at 0.3 units/kg has been studied and appears safe with signals for fewer treatment failures and less rebound hyperglycemia, though I need to ensure close potassium monitoring given pediatric risks for hypokalemia with early basal overlap [^1121Gf6J] [^1117tKpq].

> But wait, what about the regulatory stance on using glargine in DKA. The FDA labeling for glargine products states they are not recommended for the treatment of DKA, which reflects the traditional IV-only acute management paradigm and does not directly address the transition period; this means my use of glargine here is off-label during the transition, and I should document rationale and monitor closely [^116xDotD] [^1152okBf] [^116EVKKP]. I should double-check that this does not conflict with guideline-endorsed transition practices; major guidelines endorse scheduled basal-bolus regimens after resolution with overlap, so the off-label use pertains to timing and acute-phase context rather than the principle of basal therapy itself [^1164uV6V].

> Next, I should review the practical bridging steps to avoid gaps or stacking. I need to ensure the patient is clinically improving, anion gap is closing, and oral intake is anticipated before ordering subcutaneous basal insulin, then continue the IV infusion for 1–2 hours after the first subcutaneous dose to maintain coverage while the basal agent takes effect, adjusting the IV rate to 0.05 units/kg/h if glucose falls below target ranges to mitigate hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia risk [^1164uV6V] [^112T3Cze] [^115LGzuF]. Let me reconsider prandial insulin: I should add rapid-acting insulin only when the patient is ready to eat, typically starting at about 0.1 units/kg per meal with subsequent titration based on premeal glucose and dietary intake, while holding prandial doses if intake is uncertain [^111wh8sf].

> I need to ensure monitoring is adequate during this transition. Capillary glucose should be checked frequently, at least every 1–2 hours initially, and electrolytes, including potassium, should be measured every 2–4 hours until stable because insulin shifts potassium intracellularly and hypokalemia is a major preventable complication during DKA care [^1143hAvE] [^112qkDfR]. Hold on, I should verify that bedside ketone monitoring is available; if so, it can help track resolution, but if not, serial anion gap, bicarbonate, and venous pH suffice to confirm metabolic recovery before finalizing the transition [^111nVy84].

> Let me think about post-transition dose adjustments and follow-up. Once the patient is stabilized on subcutaneous insulin, I should reassess within 24–48 hours and titrate the basal dose to fasting glucose targets, recognizing that inpatient requirements may not mirror outpatient needs and that discharge planning should include education on sick-day management, ketone monitoring, and prompt adjustment of insulin during intercurrent illness to prevent recurrence [^111e8adi]. I should confirm that the patient receives clear instructions on recognizing early DKA symptoms and when to seek urgent care, especially if using SGLT2 inhibitors or if insulin adherence has been an issue [^1123UPzN] [^111e8adi].

> In summary, I should confirm that for most adults transitioning off IV insulin after DKA resolution, glargine 0.3 units/kg/day is a reasonable starting dose, initiated 2–4 hours before stopping the infusion, with dose reduction to 0.15 units/kg/day in advanced renal impairment and careful cross-checking against recent IV insulin requirements. Early basal initiation can be considered in selected patients but warrants vigilant monitoring and institutional protocol support, and all of this should be framed as guideline-concordant transition care despite FDA labeling constraints for acute DKA treatment [^111wB5z5] [^115e76ub] [^1143hAvE] [^112MoB7x] [^1163TwTf] [^116xDotD].

---

For DKA transition, **start glargine 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day** [^111wB5z5] [^115e76ub] subcutaneously 2–4 hours before stopping IV insulin [^1163TwTf] to prevent rebound hyperglycemia [^115c2X14]. Use the lower end (0.2 units/kg/day) for insulin-naïve or frail patients, and the higher end (0.3 units/kg/day) for those with prior basal insulin or higher requirements [^116Kickp]. Adjust to renal function (reduce by 50% if CrCl < 30 mL/min) [^1143hAvE] and monitor for hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [^1164uV6V] [^112qkDfR]. Continue IV insulin for 1–2 hours after the first glargine dose [^1164uV6V], then titrate the basal dose to fasting glucose 100–140 mg/dL.

---

## Recommended glargine dosing for DKA transition

- **Standard dosing**: 0.2–0.3 units/kg/day subcutaneously, given 2–4 hours before stopping IV insulin [^1163TwTf] [^117UAQGT] [^1117pEGW].

- **Insulin-naïve patients**: Start at 0.2 units/kg/day; titrate to fasting glucose 100–140 mg/dL.

- **Patients with prior basal insulin**: Use 0.3 units/kg/day or the pre-admission basal dose if known [^117UAQGT].

- **Renal impairment**: Reduce dose by 50% if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^1143hAvE].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting glargine dosing

- **Early glargine use**: Starting glargine during IV insulin shortens DKA resolution and reduces rebound hyperglycemia without excess hypoglycemia [^111wB5z5] [^115c2X14].

- **Glargine U100 vs U300**: Both are effective; U300 may offer more stable basal coverage and less hypoglycemia [^115e76ub] [^11521gwx].

- **Meta-analysis**: Early basal insulin with IV insulin accelerates DKA resolution and lowers IV insulin needs without more hypoglycemia or hypokalemia [^111aJa5y].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

ADA 2025 recommends initiating subcutaneous insulin after DKA resolution, continuing IV insulin for 1–2 hours after the first subcutaneous dose, and using a **basal-bolus regimen** with basal, prandial, and correction doses [^1164uV6V]. JBDS 2022 advises continuing long-acting basal insulin if already prescribed or initiating it at **0.25 units/kg/day** in new-onset diabetes [^111nVy84] [^1143hAvE]. AACE 2022 supports a proactive basal-bolus regimen when **transitioning from IV insulin** [^113nWT91] [^111AD13n].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing glargine dosing

- **Age and body weight**: Use weight-based dosing; adjust for frailty or low BMI [^111zDtPn].

- **Renal function**: Reduce dose by 50% if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^1143hAvE] [^112MoB7x].

- **Hepatic impairment**: Titrate cautiously due to altered insulin metabolism.

- **Comorbidities**: Individualize based on cardiovascular disease, infection, or other stressors [^1163TwTf].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of glargine dosing

- **Blood glucose monitoring**: Check capillary glucose every 1–2 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours once stable [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte monitoring**: Check potassium every 2–4 hours until stable; monitor for hypokalemia [^112qkDfR].

- **Dose titration**: Adjust daily to fasting glucose 100–140 mg/dL; modify for hypoglycemia or persistent hyperglycemia [^117UAQGT].

---

## Potential risks and complications

- **Hypoglycemia**: Monitor closely, especially in renal or hepatic impairment [^1143hAvE].

- **Hypokalemia**: Risk increases with insulin therapy; monitor and replace potassium as needed [^112qkDfR].

- **Rebound hyperglycemia**: Prevent by starting glargine 2–4 hours before stopping IV insulin [^1163TwTf].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended glargine dose** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Insulin-naïve patients | 0.2 units/kg/day | Titrate to fasting glucose 100–140 mg/dL |
| Patients with prior basal insulin | 0.3 units/kg/day or prior basal dose | Adjust based on prior requirements |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | 0.1–0.15 units/kg/day | Reduce dose by 50% |
| Hepatic impairment | Individualized | Titrate cautiously |
| Elderly or frail patients | 0.2 units/kg/day | Lower initial dose, titrate slowly |

---

Glargine is dosed at **0.2–0.3 units/kg/day** for DKA transition, started 2–4 hours before stopping IV insulin, with adjustments for renal function and patient factors. This approach reduces rebound hyperglycemia and supports safe, effective transition when paired with close monitoring and dose titration [^111wB5z5] [^1163TwTf].

4 DISCUSSION

This RCT evaluated the effectiveness and safety of early SC administration of ultralong‐acting basal insulin, insulin degludec, in addition to standard DKA treatment with IVII. The results demonstrated that early degludec administration in combination therapy with IVII was associated with faster DKA resolution compared with the control group. Exploratory analyses of patients with classic T1DM and severe DKA showed a trend toward shorter time to resolution, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Additionally, patients in the early degludec group had significantly lower CBG at 72 h after DKA resolution compared to the control group. The early combination of degludec within the first 3 h after DKA diagnosis was safe, as evidenced by similar rates of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia compared with the control group. LOS and in‐hospital mortality were not different between the groups.

### A multicentre, UK, retrospective, observational study to assess the effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 units / mL in treating people with type 1 diabetes mellitus in routine clinical practice (SPARTA) [^116zKo5n]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To conduct an open-label study to provide UK real-world evidence regarding the use of insulin glargine 300 units/ml (U300) in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

People with Type 1 diabetes who had been prescribed U300 ≥ 6 months before data collection and had HbA 1c levels recorded within 3 months prior to U300 (baseline) were included. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to month 6 after U300 initiation. Other endpoints included number of documented hypoglycaemic and diabetic ketoacidosis episodes, and change in daily basal insulin dose.

Results

A total of 298 people with Type 1 diabetes were included [mean age 42.1 years, mean HbA 1c 79 mmol/mol (9.4%)]. After U300 initiation, the mean reduction in HbA 1c from baseline to month 6 was -4 mmol/mol (-0.4%; P < 0.001; n = 188). The total daily basal insulin dose at 6 months was 1.3 units higher than at the time of U300 initiation (P < 0.001; n = 275) but was not significantly different from the prior basal insulin dose. There was no clinically significant difference in weight between baseline and month 6 [mean difference +0.7 kg, 95% CI -0.1, 1.5; P = 0.084; n = 115). During the 6 months before and after U300 initiation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes were documented for 6/298 and 4/298 participants. Diabetic ketoacidosis episodes requiring Accident and Emergency department visits or hospitalization were documented for 4/298 and 6/298 participants, before and after U300 initiation, respectively.

Conclusions

In people with Type 1 diabetes, a change in basal insulin to U300 was associated with clinically and statistically significant HbA 1c improvements, without significant changes in basal insulin dose and weight. Documented severe hypoglycaemia episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis requiring Accident and Emergency department visits or hospitalization were low and similar before and after U300 initiation.

Materials and Methods

Research Design

The EDITION JP1 study (NCT01689129) was a multicentre, randomized, open‐label, two‐arm, parallel‐group, phase III study in Japanese participants with type 1 diabetes. The study comprised a 2‐week screening phase and a 6‐month, main treatment period, followed by a preplanned 6‐month extension period. The results from the main 6‐month treatment period are reported in the present paper. The protocol was amended after study commencement to include an independent review of all hypoglycaemic events reported as severe and/or as serious adverse events (SAEs) by a Severe Hypoglycaemia Review Board to ensure consistency across the EDITION studies. The appropriate ethics committees approved the study, which was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 21 and the Declaration of Helsinki 22. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Participants

Participants were recruited as outpatients at 22 centres in Japan. Adults ≥ 18 years with type 1 diabetes receiving basal and mealtime insulin for ≥ 1 year with HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 10.0% (≥ 53 and ≤ 86 mmol/mol) at screening were included. Key exclusion criteria were: unstable insulin dose (± 20% total basal insulin dose) in the previous 30 days; use of premixed insulin, human regular insulin as mealtime insulin and/or any antihyperglycaemic drugs other than basal insulin and mealtime rapid‐acting insulin analogues within 3 months; use of an insulin pump within 6 months; any contraindication for use of insulin glargine as defined by the product labelling in Japan; severe hypoglycaemia resulting in coma/seizures or hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis within 6 months.

Randomization and Masking

Participants were randomized (1: 1) to Gla‐300 or Gla‐100, stratified by HbA1c at screening visit [< 8.0 or ≥ 8.0% (< 64 or ≥ 64 mmol/mol)]. Owing to differences between insulin injection devices and injection volumes, the study was open‐label; however, efficacy variables were assessed based on anonymized samples at the central laboratory.

### Increased time in range with ultra rapid lispro treatment in participants with type 2 diabetes: PRONTO-time in range [^115ER97W]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Participants

Adults aged at least 18 years with T2D for at least 1 year, HbA1c 7.5–10.0%, and body mass index (BMI) ≤ 40.0 kg/m 2 were eligible for participation if they had been treated with basal-bolus MDI insulin therapy for 90 days prior to screening that included insulin glargine U-100 as basal insulin along with prandial injection of a bolus insulin analog (lispro, aspart, or glulisine). Participants could be treated with up to three of the following oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAM): metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist. Participants could also be treated with an injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist. Participants had to be willing to use the CGM device supplied for glucose monitoring, diabetes management, and data collection.

Participants were excluded from the study if they had any episodes of severe hypoglycemia within the 6 months prior to screening; had an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis within 6 months prior to screening; had hypoglycemia unawareness, as judged by the investigator; or had excessive insulin resistance, defined as receiving a total daily dose of insulin greater than 2.0 U/kg at screening.

Interventions and Treatment

Participants continued their prestudy basal and prandial insulin therapy during the baseline period. At Week 0, participants started URLi treatment, initially transitioning unit-for-unit from their prestudy prandial insulin. URLi was injected immediately (0–2 min) prior to each meal. Starting at Week 0, all participants were treated with sponsor-provided glargine U-100 (Basaglar ®).

During the treatment period, insulin doses were titrated to achieve protocol glucose targets in line with those recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (Supplementary Table 2).

Basal insulin (glargine U-100) was titrated to a fasting blood glucose target of 100 mg/dl, and the dose could be adjusted by the investigator based on CGM and hypoglycemia data (Supplementary Table 3). Basal insulin dose was reviewed by the investigator at each visit during the 12-week treatment period or more frequently if required.

### DKA with lower-than-expected blood glucose in the… [^116ms5Vt]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: A 45-year-old patient presented to the emergency department after three days of generalized weakness. The patient's medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus that was diagnosed at age 40. The patient was prescribed 10 units of insulin glargine nightly, 10 mg of empagliflozin per day, and 5 mg of saxagliptin per day. The patient reported insulin nonadherence for one month before presentation to the emergency department, although the patient had continued taking oral agents daily. The patient was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and treated per hospital DKA protocols. Within six hours of starting the insulin drip, the patient's glucose levels dropped, requiring continual dextrose supplementation. The patient was treated for approximately 52 hours before the resolution of DKA and transition to subcutaneous insulin. Treatment also included three doses of sodium bicarbonate infusions administered over three days.

DKA associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use is well documented; however, it is unclear whether SGLT2 inhibitors are a direct precipitating factor for DKA. One proposed mechanism is that the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors causes a decrease in insulin levels and subsequent increase of glucagon production, which increases lipolysis, beta-oxidation, and ketone body production. 1 Patients prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors who develop DKA often present with lower-than-anticipated glucose levels, leading to delayed diagnosis and mismanagement of DKA. The most effective means of preventing SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA is to withhold SGLT2 inhibitors during situations that may precipitate DKA. 2 The half-life of SGLT2 inhibitors is 11 to 13 hours; therefore, these medications may have effects several days after discontinuation. 2 SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued three days before an anticipated stressful event such as surgery.

2 It is also crucial for patients to avoid missing or inappropriately reducing insulin doses, including days in which they are acutely ill. 2 If DKA is diagnosed, the SGLT2 inhibitor should be stopped immediately. Clinicians evaluating patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors who present with DKA signs and symptoms should not rule out the diagnosis based on lower-than-expected glucose levels.

### Potential role of ultrafast-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113VRPBo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the progress made in the in-hospital management of diabetes over the past decades, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a serious hyperglycemic emergency accompanied by significant rates of mortality and morbidity and high financial burden for health care systems and societies. Most national and international guidelines advocate continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of regular human insulin as the standard of care for the treatment of DKA. However, subcutaneous (sc) administration of rapid-acting insulin analogues has recently emerged as an alternative for patients with DKA of mild or moderate severity.

An IV insulin infusion is traditionally preferred over other routes of administration because of the rapid onset of insulin action that is necessary for the effective resolution of the hyperglycemic crisis and the suppression of ketogenesis. In addition, the short half-life of IV regimens enables an easy titration to achieve glycemic targets. However, IV administration of insulin usually requires patients to receive treatment in the emergency room or to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) to be closely monitored. Despite the fact that IV insulin infusion is acceptable for many countries to administer in general wards, the safety of such an approach has not been adequately studied. On the other hand, data from the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group show that ICU admission in patients with DKA is related to a high-risk of long-term mortality and also substantial economic costs.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^117UAQGT]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

After resolution of DKA, insulin infusion was discontinued 2 h after the administration of subcutaneous insulin. Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes received an initial total daily dose (TDD) of insulin of 0.6 unit · kg −1 · day −1. Subjects receiving insulin therapy before admission received the same outpatient insulin amount, with the TDD switched to glargine and glulisine or to NPH and regular insulin on a unit-for-unit basis.

Patients treated with subcutaneous glargine and glulisine received 50% of the TDD as glargine and 50% as glulisine insulin. Glargine was given once daily at the same time of day and glulisine was given in three equally divided doses before each meal. Glargine was given at the full dose independently of food intake, but to prevent hypoglycemia, the dose of glulisine was held if a subject was not able to eat a given meal. Patients treated with NPH and regular insulin received two-thirds of the TDD before breakfast and one-third of the TDD before dinner. The insulin dose was given as two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin in the morning with breakfast and two-thirds NPH and one-third regular insulin in the evening with dinner. To prevent hypoglycemia, regular insulin was held if a subject was not able to eat a given meal; in addition, the dose of NPH was reduced by 50% if a patient was kept NPO all day. Insulin dosage was adjusted daily according to glucose values to maintain target blood glucose < 140 mg/dl before meals. The insulin dose was adjusted, and supplemental insulin was given based on blood glucose levels (supplementary Table B, available in an online appendix).

The primary outcome of the study was the determination of differences in the rate of hypoglycemic events (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl) during the transition period between treatment groups. Secondary outcomes included differences in the time to resolution of DKA and hyperglycemia, average blood glucose during intravenous insulin infusion, mean daily blood glucose after resolution of DKA, length of hospital stay, and hospital complications between treatment groups.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1163TwTf]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Early subcutaneous basal insulin with intravenous insulin infusion for diabetic ketoacidosis management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111aJa5y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of early initiation of subcutaneous (SC) basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII), compared with IVII alone, for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early initiation of long- or ultra-long-acting basal insulin plus IVII versus IVII alone in DKA management. Studies published up to 6 September 2025, were included. Meta-analysis was performed using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes, both with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included total intravenous insulin use, rebound hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality. A one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was also conducted when individual-level data were available.

Results

Eight RCTs including 468 participants (256 receiving early SC basal insulin plus IVII; 212 receiving IVII alone) were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable across studies. Early SC basal insulin significantly reduced time to DKA resolution (MD -4.02h, 95%CI -5.52 to -2.52, p < 0.001) and total intravenous insulin dose until DKA resolution (MD -19.2units, 95%CI -28.99 to -9.26, p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups for rebound hyperglycemia, safety outcomes, LOS, or in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Early SC basal insulin in combination with IVII significantly accelerates DKA resolution and reduces total IVII requirements, without increasing the risk of adverse events, including hypoglycemia or hypokalemia.

### Joint British diabetes societies guideline for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^111nVy84]. Diabetic Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (these do not cover Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome) are available in full at: (i) http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/Our_Views/Care_recommendations/The-Management-of-Diabetic-Ketoacidosis-in-Adults; (ii) http://www.diabetes.nhs.uk/publications_and_resources/reports_and_guidance; (iii) http://www.diabetologists-abcd.org.uk/JBDS_DKA_Management.pdf. This article summarizes the main changes from previous guidelines and discusses the rationale for the new recommendations. The key points are: Monitoring of the response to treatment (i) The method of choice for monitoring the response to treatment is bedside measurement of capillary blood ketones using a ketone meter. (ii) If blood ketone measurement is not available, venous pH and bicarbonate should be used in conjunction with bedside blood glucose monitoring to assess treatment response. (iii) Venous blood should be used rather than arterial (unless respiratory problems dictate otherwise) in blood gas analysers. (iv) Intermittent laboratory confirmation of pH, bicarbonate and electrolytes only. Insulin administration (i) Insulin should be infused intravenously at a weight-based fixed rate until the ketosis has resolved. (ii) When the blood glucose falls below 14 mmol/l, 10% glucose should be added to allow the fixed-rate insulin to be continued. (iii) If already taking, long-acting insulin analogues such as insulin glargine (Lantus(®), Sanofi Aventis, Guildford, Surry, UK) or insulin detemir (Levemir(®), Novo Nordisk, Crawley, West Sussex, UK.) should be continued in usual doses. Delivery of care (i) The diabetes specialist team should be involved as soon as possible. (ii) Patients should be nursed in areas where staff are experienced in the management of ketoacidosis.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111JB2Pu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Early administration of insulin degludec, an ultralong‐acting basal insulin analogue, in combination with IVII within 3 h of DKA diagnosis resulted in faster DKA resolution and lower CBG levels at 72 h among patients experiencing rebound hyperglycaemia after transitioning to full SC insulin treatment, without increasing the incidence of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia. This approach may reduce the utilisation of personnel, laboratory testing, and intensive care resources in DKA management. It may be considered for all types of diabetes and DKA severity, particularly in patients with prior degludec use and insulin‐naïve individuals experiencing DKA for the first time who are planned to receive degludec for long‐term glycaemic control.

### Addendum 1: forum for injection technique and therapy expert recommendations, India [^114919Bt]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Certain factors which are considered vital for an insulin infusion system include the usage of a validated insulin titration programme, access to suitable staffing resources, accurate monitoring technology and standardized infusion preparation methods, delivery of consistent carbohydrate calories and nutritional provision, and dextrose replacement for hypoglycaemia prevention and treatment.

Intramuscular injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, as they end up working like rapid-acting insulin and may result in severe hypoglycaemia. In an evidence case report, a 24-year-old female with T1D experienced severe hypoglycaemia repeatedly when she switched to insulin glargine from NPH insulin at equal daily doses. It was found that she often injected herself in muscle tissue, which led to unexpected rapid insulin action. When the injection technique was corrected, hypoglycaemia did not recur. The long-acting kinetics of insulin glargine need precipitation in the subcutaneous tissue. Therefore, it is vital to review each patient's injection technique when treatment with long-acting insulin is started. The absorption rate is also dependent upon the subcutaneous and intramuscular sites. The intramuscular absorption rate is faster but is not recommended for routine use. It can be given under certain circumstances, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, dehydration, etc. Regular insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogues can be injected intramuscularly to achieve rapid control of hyperglycaemia and may avert the need for patients to be admitted to hospitals with diabetes and ketosis. Intramuscular insulin infusion has also been reported as a modality of treatment for brittle diabetes.

### ISPAD clinical practice consensus guideline: diabetic ketoacidosis in the time of COVID-19 and resource-limited settings-role of subcutaneous insulin [^113mVCnH]. Pediatric Diabetes (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes Clinical Practice Consensus Guideline 2018 for management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state provide comprehensive guidance for management of DKA in young people. Intravenous (IV) infusion of insulin remains the treatment of choice for treating DKA; however, the policy of many hospitals around the world requires admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for IV insulin infusion. During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or other settings where intensive care resources are limited, ICU services may need to be prioritized or may not be appropriate due to risk of transmission of infection to young people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this guideline, which should be used in conjunction with the ISPAD 2018 guidelines, is to ensure that young individuals with DKA receive management according to best evidence in the context of limited ICU resources. Specifically, this guideline summarizes evidence for the role of subcutaneous insulin in treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate DKA in young people and may be implemented if administration of IV insulin is not an option.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^114c7CQw]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Previous randomized studies in patients with DKA have focused on the amount and route of insulin administration during the acute resolution phase of ketoacidosis. Few studies, however, have focused on the transition period to subcutaneous insulin after the resolution of DKA. Accordingly, in this study we aimed to compare differences between treatment with basal bolus insulin analogs and NPH and regular insulin after resolution of DKA. We found no differences in the daily glucose concentration between treatment groups; however, patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had higher rates of hypoglycemia (41%) than subjects treated with basal bolus (15%) insulin (P < 0.03). The rate of hypoglycemic events in this study is similar to the rate reported previously with the use of NPH and regular insulin after discontinuation of intravenous therapy.

The higher rate of hypoglycemia with human insulins is explained by the pharmacological features and peak duration of action of NPH and regular insulin as well as the high day-to-day variability in absorption. NPH has an onset of action ranging between 2 and 4 h, a peak concentration of ∼6–8 h, and a duration of action up to 20 h. Regular human insulin has an onset of action in 30 min, peaks at 2–3 h when given subcutaneously, and has a duration of action of 6–8 h. The combination of basal and rapid-acting insulin analogs represents a more physiological approach to glucose control in the hospital. Glargine is a peakless, long-acting basal insulin with an onset of action of ∼2 h, a plateau of biological action at 4–6 h, and duration of action up to 24 h. Glulisine has a faster onset of action and a shorter duration of action after subcutaneous injection compared with regular insulin. In agreement with these results, we recently reported that a basal bolus algorithm with glargine and glulisine is an effective intervention for glucose control with a low rate of hypoglycemic events (3%) in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes. More recently, we reported that 38% of hospitalized patients treated with a combination of NPH and regular insulin experienced one or more episodes of blood glucose < 70 mg/dl during the hospital stay. Minimizing the rate of hypoglycemia events is of major importance in hospitalized patients because it may represent an independent risk factor of poor clinical outcome.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^1117ZCKL]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic ketoacidosis, more specifically with respect to general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer IV fluids, insulin, and electrolytes for the management of DKA and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. Identify and treat the precipitating cause. Obtain close monitoring during treatment, ensuring timely and bridged transition to maintenance subcutaneous insulin administration.

### Utility of initial bolus insulin in the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis [^114Jo9Cw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Current guidelines for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) recommend administration of an intravenous bolus dose of insulin followed by a continuous infusion. This study was designed to investigate whether the initial bolus dose is of significant benefit to adult patients with DKA and if it is associated with increased complications. This was a non-concurrent, prospective observational cohort study of adult patients who presented with DKA in a 12-month period. Charts were divided into two groups depending on whether they received an initial bolus dose of insulin. Data on glucose levels, anion gap (AG), intravenous fluid administration (IVF), and length of stay (LOS) were collected. Primary outcome was hypoglycemia (need for administration of 50% dextrose). Of 157 charts, 78 received a bolus of insulin and were designated the treatment group, the remaining 79 formed the control group. Groups were similar at baseline and received equivalent IVF and insulin drips. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of hypoglycemia (6% vs. 1%, respectively, p = 0.12), rate of change of glucose (60 vs. 56 mg/dL/h, respectively, p = 0.54) or AG (1.9 vs. 1.9 mEq/L/h, respectively, p = 0.66), LOS in the Emergency Department (8 vs. 7 h, respectively, p = 0.37) or hospital (5.6 vs. 5.9 days, p = 0.81). Equivalence testing revealed no clinically relevant differences in IVF change, rate of change of glucose, or AG. Administration of an initial bolus dose of insulin was not associated with significant benefit to patients with DKA and demonstrated equivalent changes in clinically relevant endpoints when compared to patients not administered the bolus.

### Evaluation of outcomes following hospital-wide implementation of a subcutaneous insulin protocol for diabetic ketoacidosis [^116DNLPT]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Although SQ regular insulin has not been accepted as a therapy for DKA given its pharmacokineticsand slower attainment of effective plasma insulin concentrations, rapid-acting SQ insulin lispro has a substantially earlier and greater peak serum insulin concentration. Prior studies, have reported large IV insulin doses in DKA treatment, with 1 study showing an average administration of 216 units within the first 3 hours of treatment. Our protocol included a dose of long-acting insulin glargine administered up front along with SQ insulin lispro at every 4 hours, which is an approach used in United Kingdom DKA guidelines. We found that the protocol was effective with a similar time needed to reach a glucose less than 250 mg/dL and, more importantly, to anion gap closure without evidence of increased adverse outcomes. More recently, another studyhas found that short-acting insulin given SQ up to every 2 hours was safe and effective in treatment of DKA.

Given that the insulin is administered SQ, factors that affect absorption into the bloodstream, including obesity, the use of vasoconstricting drugs, and blood pressure, are important to consider in identifying the right patients for SQ insulin treatment. Typically, 100-unit insulin volumes of no greater than 0.5 mL are injected into a discrete area because a larger volume of insulin may impede absorption. Although the protocol used in this study did not have a specific weight limitation, we have recently revised our protocol to exclude patients whose weight is 166 kg or more out of concerns related to insulin absorption.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111QEBUp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most serious hyperglycemic emergency in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DKA is the most common cause of death in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and accounts for half of all deaths in diabetic patients aged < 24 years. Recent series in adult patients with DKA have reported a mortality rate of < 5%. DKA is responsible for > 100,000 hospital admissions in the U.S. and substantial spending related to direct and indirect costs. It has been estimated that treatment of DKA episodes represent more than one of every four health care dollars spent on direct medical care for adult patients with type 1 diabetes.

The mainstay in the treatment of DKA involves the administration of regular insulin via continuous intravenous infusion or by frequent subcutaneous or intramuscular injections of regular insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogs. Although several controlled studies have shown that low-dose insulin therapy is effective regardless of the route of administration, most patients are treated with intravenous regular insulin until resolution of DKA. When this occurs, subcutaneous insulin therapy can be started. The American Diabetes Association recommends the transition to NPH and regular insulin twice daily or to a multidose regimen of short- or rapid-acting and intermediate- or long-acting insulins. Several studies have reported hospital rates of hypoglycemic events up to 37% with the use of NPH and regular insulin after discontinuation of intravenous insulin. The inadequate duration of action of NPH insulin and an undesirable peak activity at 4–6 h after injection as well as the high day-to-day variability in absorption partially explains the high rate of hypoglycemic events. In recent years, the use of long-acting basal and rapid-acting insulin analogs has been recommended as a more physiological approach than NPH and regular insulin for glucose control in the hospital; however, no previous studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs in the management of patients with hyperglycemic crises. Accordingly, the aim of this multicenter, randomized, open-label study was 1) to determine differences in treatment response between regular insulin and rapid-acting insulin analogs during the acute intravenous treatment of DKA and 2) to determine differences between treatment with glargine plus glulisine and a split-mixed regimen of NPH plus regular insulin after the transition to subcutaneous insulin following resolution of DKA.

### Effectiveness and safety of early insulin glargine U100 and glargine U300 administration in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: a randomized clinical trial [^115e76ub]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) predominantly affects individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of early use of subcutaneous insulin glargine U100 (iGlar U100) or U300 (iGlar U300) alongside intravenous insulin in managing DKA in adults with T1DM.

Methods

The study included 90 patients with T1DM diagnosed with DKA randomized into 3 groups. In addition to the standard intravenous regular insulin infusion, the iGlar U100 and the iGlar U300 groups received 0.3 units/kg of subcutaneous iGlar U100 and iGlar U300 respectively while the control group received only the standard intravenous insulin infusion.

Results

The mean time to DKA resolution was significantly shorter in the iGlar U100 group (6.78 ± 2.13 hours) and iGlar U300 group (6.33 ± 1.94 hours) compared to the control group (11.12 ± 6.15 hours; p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Both the iGlar U100 and iGlar U300 groups required significantly lower total insulin dose compared to the control group. No significant differences were observed between the iGlar U100 and iGlar U300 groups concerning the duration to DKA resolution (p = 0.693) or the total insulin dose administered (p = 0.908). The incidence rates of hypoglycaemia, hypokalemia, rebound hyperglycaemia and rebound DKA were similar across the three study groups (p = 0.871, 0.657, 0.718 and 1 respectively).

Conclusion

Early combination iGlar U100 or iGlar U300 with intravenous insulin infusion was associated with faster resolution of DKA and reduced total insulin requirements without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia or hypokalemia. Both iGlar U100 and U300 displayed similar safety and efficacy.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^1171A7j8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^11265aVb]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This is the first prospective randomized trial to compare the use of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with DKA. During the initial treatment phase, we observed no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of intravenous insulin administration until resolution of DKA between regular and glulisine insulin. After resolution of ketoacidosis, the transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine insulin resulted in glycemic control similar to that for NPH and regular insulin; however, treatment with glargine and glulisine insulin is safer and is associated with a significantly lower rate of hypoglycemia. A total of 14 patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had one or more episodes of hypoglycemia (P < 0.03).

The comparable response to intravenous glulisine and regular insulin during the acute resolution of DKA in this study is in line with previous reports of generally equal efficacy and in vivo potency of intravenous rapid-acting insulin analogs (glulisine, aspart, and lispro) and regular insulin in animal and human studies. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic studies comparing the intravenous administration of glulisine and regular insulin have shown a similar onset of action within 20 min, a similar distribution and elimination profile, and equivalent glucose utilization and disposal on a molar, unit-per-unit basis. The present study confirms these observations and provides evidence of the equal efficacy and in vivo potency of intravenous rapid-acting insulin analogs and regular insulin in patients with severe hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. Their comparable in vivo potency is attributable to their similar receptor binding affinity and receptor-mediated clearance. Our study and these previous reports indicate that treatments with intravenous glulisine and regular insulin are equally safe and efficacious in the acute management of patients with DKA. However, intravenous regular insulin is more cost-effective and should be preferred over rapid-acting insulin analogs during the acute intravenous treatment phase of DKA.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116CPzLg]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A total of 74 patients with DKA were randomly assigned in this study. Of them, six patients were excluded because four withdrew consent before or shortly after initiation of insulin therapy, one patient received glargine insulin before resolution of DKA, and one patient was treated with intravenous aspart insulin instead of regular insulin. The remaining 68 patients served as the study population. The diagnosis of DKA was established by standard criteria. We excluded patients with systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg after the administration of 1 l of normal saline, patients in a comatose state, and patients with acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal or hepatic failure, dementia, and pregnancy. This study was conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, and at Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and was approved by dual institutional review boards.

Patients with DKA were randomly assigned in the emergency department to receive treatment with regular (n = 34) or glulisine (n = 34) insulin intravenously until resolution of DKA. After resolution of DKA, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to receive subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily. Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to glargine once daily and glulisine before meals.

Treatment protocols

Patients were managed by members of the internal medicine residency programs of the respective institutions, who received copies of the assigned treatment protocol (supplementary Table A in an online appendix, available at). Orders for intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were similar in both groups and followed current American Diabetes Association guidelines. Initial orders for intravenous regular and glulisine insulin included an initial bolus of 0.1 unit/kg, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion calculated to deliver 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 until blood glucose levels decreased to < 250 mg/dl (< 13.8 mmol/l). At that time, intravenous fluids were changed to dextrose-containing solutions, and the insulin infusion rate was decreased to 0.05 unit · kg −1 · h −1 to maintain blood glucose of ∼200 mg/dl (∼11.1 mmol/l) until resolution of DKA. DKA was considered resolved when blood glucose was < 250 mg/dl, the serum bicarbonate level was ≥ 18 mmol/l, and venous pH was > 7.30.

Hospital transition and mild hyperglycemia in T2D: Transition from IV insulin in the ICU to a subcutaneous insulin regimen is typically required when acidosis is resolved and the person is no longer critically ill, with a basal-bolus regimen with scheduled subcutaneous insulin therapy (basal, prandial/nutritional/prandial, and/or correctional doses) recommended for most persons. For hospitalized persons with T2D and mild admission hyperglycemia (glucose < 180 mg/dL), a personalized approach is recommended for the use of basal/noninsulin agents and prandial/correction-dose insulin or noninsulin therapies.

### De-intensification of basal-bolus therapy by replacing prandial insulin with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide in individuals with well-controlled type 2 diabetes: a single-centre, open-label randomised trial (TRANSITION-T2D) [^114Dudzv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical characteristics of the TRANSITION‐T2D participants could be presumed to be representative of potentially good candidates for transitioning from prandial insulin to a GLP‐1RA as described in this study, including HbA 1c ≤ 7.5% (≤ 58 mmol/mol) on MDI (≥ 3 daily injections of insulin analogues, including ≥ 2 injections of prandial insulin) up to a TDD of 120 units and ≤ 0.5 units/kg of prandial insulin, no GAD‐65 antibodies and no end‐stage kidney disease. It should be noted that the study intentionally screened out individuals suspected of having autoimmune diabetes and extra caution is advisable if attempting this approach in persons with a strong family history of autoimmune diabetes, prior autoimmune antibody positivity, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes despite intensive insulin therapy, or leaner BMI. Determination of GAD‐65 antibodies would be prudent before considering this approach if there is any suspicion of possible type 1 diabetes. Lastly, in specific cases, a random assessment of C‐peptide and glucose to assess residual insulin‐producing capacity may be helpful. It is also important to highlight that implementing this intervention in real‐world practice may increase the risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly in patients using background therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors during metabolically stressful events. Therefore, it is crucial to take the necessary precautions by educating patients on recognising symptoms, identifying warning signs and measuring ketones when such events occur.

### Prospective randomized trial of insulin glargine in acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis in the emergency department: a pilot study [^115k7Nk1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to determine the efficacy of coadministration of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin glargine in combination with intravenous (IV) insulin for treating diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing coadministration of insulin glargine and IV insulin (experimental) with IV insulin (standard care control). The setting was emergency departments (EDs) in two hospitals in Houston, Texas. Patients presenting with blood sugar ≥ 200 mg/dL, pH ≤ 7.3, bicarbonate (HCO3) ≤ 18 mg/dL, ketonemia or ketonuria, and anion gap ≥ 16 between November 2012 and April 2013 were enrolled. All patients received IV insulin. Additionally, the experimental group was given SQ insulin glargine within 2 hours of diagnosis. Upon closure of anion gap, patients in the control group were subsequently transitioned to long-acting insulin. In the study group, IV insulin was discontinued and long-acting SQ insulin was reinstituted 24 hours after initial introduction. The primary outcome of time to closure of anion gap (TCAG) was compared between groups using a general linear model (GLM), adjusting for initial anion gap, etiology, and presence of comorbidities. Similarly, the secondary outcome hospital length of stay (LOS) was adjusted for age, etiology, and hospital site in the GLM. Rate of hypoglycemia and intensive care unit (ICU) admission was compared using Fisher's exact test while ICU LOS was compared using Wilcoxon's two-sample test.

Results

A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this pilot trial. The estimated mean TCAG was 10.2 hours (SE ± 6.8 hours) in the experimental group and 11.6 hours (SE ± 6.4 hours) in the control group (p = 0.63). The estimated mean hospital LOS was 3.9 days (SE ± 3.4 days) in the experimental group and 4.8 days (SE ± 3.6 days) in the control group (p = 0.66). Incidents of hypoglycemia, rates of ICU admission, and ICU LOS were similar between the groups.

Conclusions

Coadministration of glargine in combination with an insulin infusion in the acute management of DKA is feasible. Further study is needed to determine the true efficacy in terms of TCAG and hospital LOS.

### Clinical and cost implications of insulin degludec in patients with type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycemia: a quality improvement project [^112jy4dc]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

To assess the real-life clinical benefits and cost implications of switching from another basal insulin to insulin degludec (degludec) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on basal–bolus regimens with recurrent hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness.

Methods

Patients with T1D who were aged ≥ 18 years, were on a basal–bolus regimen, and had switched to degludec plus bolus insulin for at least 6 months were included. Patients had to have switched to degludec as a result of recurrent hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness.

Results

Six months of follow-up data were available for 42 patients. At 6 months, there was a significant reduction in median (interquartile range) HbA 1c, from 8.6 (8.0–9.3)% [70 (64–78) mmol/mol] to 8.4 (7.9–8.9)% [68 (63–74) mmol/mol]; p < 0.05. Median daily basal insulin dose reduced significantly from 30.0 (14.7–45.0) to 25.5 (14.0–30.2) units; p < 0.0001. Data from hospital records showed reductions in the frequency of episodes of severe hypoglycemia from eight in the 6 months preceding degludec initiation to two in the 6 months following initiation. In the same period, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episodes reduced from two before degludec initiation to no episodes after initiation. No patients reported worsening treatment satisfaction after switching to degludec. Considering the reductions in the basal dose required and the frequency of hypoglycemia episodes, we estimate that switching such patients to degludec from other basal insulins could provide significant savings in direct healthcare costs.

Conclusion

In patients with T1D, switching to degludec was associated with an improvement in HbA 1c and reductions in basal insulin dose, severe hypoglycemia, and DKA. When used in appropriate patients, degludec could lead to significant cost savings.

### Subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for diabetic ketoacidosis [^115GLxpD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute, life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes that mainly occurs in individuals with autoimmune type 1 diabetes, but it is not uncommon in some people with type 2 diabetes. The treatment of DKA is traditionally accomplished by the administration of intravenous infusion of regular insulin that is initiated in the emergency department and continued in an intensive care unit or a high-dependency unit environment. It is unclear whether people with DKA should be treated with other treatment modalities such as subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues.

Objectives

To assess the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. We searched the trials registers WHO ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of last search for all databases was 27 October 2015. We also examined reference lists of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included trials if they were RCTs comparing subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus standard intravenous infusion in participants with DKA of any age or sex with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and in pregnant women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed studies for risk of bias, and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument. We assessed the statistical heterogeneity of included studies by visually inspecting forest plots and quantifying the diversity using the I² statistic. We synthesised data using random-effects model meta-analysis or descriptive analysis, as appropriate.

Main Results

Five trials randomised 201 participants (110 participants to subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues and 91 to intravenous regular insulin). The criteria for DKA were consistent with the American Diabetes Association criteria for mild or moderate DKA. The underlying cause of DKA was mostly poor compliance with diabetes therapy. Most trials did not report on type of diabetes. Younger diabetic participants and children were underrepresented in our included trials (one trial only). Four trials evaluated the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue lispro, and one the effects of the rapid-acting insulin analogue aspart. The mean follow-up period as measured by mean hospital stay ranged between two and seven days. Overall, risk of bias of the evaluated trials was unclear in many domains and high for performance bias for the outcome measure time to resolution of DKA. No deaths were reported in the included trials (186 participants; 3 trials; moderate- (insulin lispro) to low-quality evidence (insulin aspart)). There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin lispro versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: mean difference (MD) 0.2 h (95% CI -1.7 to 2.1); P = 0.81; 90 participants; 2 trials. In one trial involving children with DKA, the time to reach a glucose level of 250 mg/dL was similar between insulin lispro and intravenous regular insulin. There was very low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous insulin aspart versus intravenous regular insulin on the time to resolution of DKA: MD -1 h (95% CI -3.2 to 1.2); P = 0.36; 30 participants; 1 trial. There was low-quality evidence to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin on hypoglycaemic episodes: 6 of 80 insulin lispro-treated participants compared with 9 of 76 regular insulin-treated participants reported hypoglycaemic events; risk ratio (RR) 0.59 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.52); P = 0.28; 156 participants; 4 trials. For insulin aspart compared with regular insulin, RR for hypoglycaemic episodes was 1.00 (95% CI 0.07 to 14.55); P = 1.0; 30 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence. Socioeconomic effects as measured by length of mean hospital stay for insulin lispro compared with regular insulin showed a MD of -0.4 days (95% CI -1 to 0.2); P = 0.22; 90 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence and for insulin aspart compared with regular insulin 1.1 days (95% CI -3.3 to 1.1); P = 0.32; low-quality evidence. Data on morbidity were limited, but no specific events were reported for the comparison of insulin lispro with regular insulin. No trial reported on adverse events other than hypoglycaemic episodes, and no trial investigated patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review, which provided mainly data on adults, suggests on the basis of mostly low- to very low-quality evidence that there are neither advantages nor disadvantages when comparing the effects of subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogues versus intravenous regular insulin for treating mild or moderate DKA.

### Does management of diabetic ketoacidosis with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin reduce the need for intensive care unit admission? [^114X6xHz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In the last 20 years, rapid-acting insulin analogs have emerged on the market, including aspart and lispro, which may be efficacious in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) when administered by non-intravenous (i.v.) routes.

Clinical Question

In patients with mild-to-moderate DKA without another reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, is the administration of a subcutaneous (s.c.) rapid-acting insulin analog a safe and effective alternative to a continuous infusion of i.v. regular insulin, and would such a strategy eliminate the need for ICU admission?

Evidence Review

Five randomized controlled trials were identified and critically appraised.

Results

The outcomes suggest that there is no difference in the duration of therapy required to resolve DKA with either strategy.

Conclusion

Current evidence supports DKA management with s.c. rapid-acting insulin analogs in a non-ICU setting in carefully selected patients.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^115SDHC2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Insulin degludec, an ultralong‐acting insulin analogue, provides up to 42 h of peakless basal insulin coverage to control plasma glucose and suppress ketogenesis. Due to these pharmacodynamic properties, the early use of SC degludec alongside IVII for DKA treatment may decrease the requirement for intravenous insulin, facilitate faster DKA resolution, and prevent excessively high glucose levels after transitioning to a SC insulin regimen. Although prior prospective studies of glargine U‐100 have revealed the benefits of early use of SC basal insulin in DKA treatment, no studies on ultralong‐acting degludec were conducted before this one.

Compared to the previous RCT of glargine U‐100, which showed that early use of glargine significantly reduced the time to DKA resolution by 2.87 h, our study of degludec demonstrated a comparable benefit, shortening the time to DKA resolution by 3.25 h. Furthermore, early use of glargine U‐100 showed potential benefits in decreasing the incidence of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12 and 24 h, depending on the study. In our study, the benefit of blood glucose control was observed 72 h after transitioning to the full SC regimen. One possible explanation for this delayed effect, compared to the more rapid response seen in the glargine U‐100 trial, is that insulin degludec reaches steady‐state levels around days 3–4 after initiation. Assessment using CBG rather than venous plasma glucose, along with non‐strict control of dose and timing of full SC insulin initiation after DKA resolution, may have reduced the precision of this secondary outcome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a critical and life‐threatening complication that occurs in people with diabetes, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes (T1D), with an increasing proportion of cases in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The incidence of diabetes is rising globally, contributing to a reported 55% increase in DKA admissions over the past decade. The key to effective management of this condition is prompt diagnosis and the timely administration of appropriate treatment to correct the metabolic derangements in DKA (hyperglycaemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis), which result from a combination of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and elevated levels of counterregulatory hormones (e.g. glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, and growth hormone).

Insulin therapy is one of the cornerstones of DKA management. Most patients are treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of regular insulin until DKA resolves, at which point they are transitioned to subcutaneous (SC) insulin. Early use of basal insulin in combination with intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) is increasingly common in clinical practice, as evidenced by several prospective studies. These studies have reported that coadministration of a low dose (0.15–0.3 units/kg) of glargine U‐100 during IVII reduces the time to DKA resolution, the duration of IVII, and the length of hospital stay (LOS), while also preventing rebound hyperglycaemia without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. In accordance with the UK guideline, long‐acting basal insulin should be continued in patients already receiving it, or initiated at a dose of 0.25 units/kg once daily in newly diagnosed patients. Although insulin degludec has become increasingly utilised as a basal insulin in diabetes management, evidence supporting its effectiveness in the management of DKA remains lacking.

International Guideline Recommendations for the Initiation and Titration of Basal Insulin

Recommendations on the initiation and titration of basal insulin can be found in several international clinical practice guidelines. The 2017 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) comprehensive diabetes management algorithm specifies that basal insulin can be initiated in patients with T2DM with an entry HbA 1c level < 7.5% when either monotherapy with metformin or other OADs, or dual therapy with metformin and other agents, fails to achieve the glycemic target (HbA 1c < 7%). The guidelines also indicate that basal insulin can be initiated as a part of dual therapy with metformin in patients with entry HbA 1c ≥ 7.5%, or when a patient presents with a HbA 1c level > 9.0% (dual or triple therapy with metformin) and symptomatic hyperglycemia at entry. The 2015 diabetes clinical practice guidelines from the AACE/ACE acknowledged that the traditional postponement of insulin therapy after prolonged failure of lifestyle management and OADs to achieve glycemic control has been revised in the past decade, and recommended that basal insulin therapy should be initiated much sooner, and often in combination with OADs. The ADA's updated Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2017 states the importance of dose titration of any insulin regimen once initiated, and that dose adjustments should be based on prevailing BG levels, together with knowledge of the pharmacodynamic profile of the insulin used. The ADA recommends that if the HbA 1c target (< 7%) is not achieved after 3 months of monotherapy with metformin, combination therapy of basal insulin with metformin, amongst other options, should be considered. The 2015 position statement from the ADA/EASD emphasizes that insulin has the advantage of being effective where other agents may not be, and should be considered a part of any combination regimen when hyperglycemia is severe, particularly if the patient is symptomatic. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommends the initiation of basal insulin after the failure of combination therapy with metformin and other OADs, and the titration of insulin using a self-titration regimen, or with at least biweekly contact with a HCP. Table 1 highlights key recommendations regarding the initiation and titration of basal insulin from several international guidelines.

### Which patients will benefit from a switch in therapy from premixed insulin to insulin glargine plus oral antidiabetic drugs? Further analysis of the lantus registry study [^112pf1hp]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients and Study Design

The Lantus Registry Study was a 16-week, open label, prospective, observational multicenter study conducted across China from September 2010 to June 2012.

In brief, patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 18 to 75 years of age, had received premixed insulin with or without OADs for at least 3 months, and had an HbA 1c level ≤ 10.0%. The main exclusion criteria included diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, temporary insulin treatment for gestational diabetes or surgery, allergy to insulin glargine (100 U/ml)/OAD or its excipients, and acute diabetes-related complications such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis. The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the local ethical committees or institutional review boards at each participating institution. All patients or their legally acceptable surrogates gave written informed consent.

Study Treatment

Eligible participants were switched from their previous premixed insulin therapy (with or without OADs) to insulin glargine plus OADs at the discretion of both the physician and the patient, and in accordance with local product labels. Insulin glargine was initiated at a dose equivalent to 60.0% (in patients with baseline HbA 1c ≤ 8.0%) or 80.0% (in patients with baseline HbA 1c > 8.0%) of the total dose of the intermediate insulin component of the patient's previous premixed dose. Insulin glargine was up-titrated every 3 days by 2, 4, 6, and 8 U for a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 5.5–6.6, 6.7–7.7, 7.8–9.9, and ≥ 10.0 mmol/L, respectively, until an FPG level of ≤ 5.6 mmol/L was achieved. This titration algorithm was in line with the Treat-to-Target algorithm. The OAD type and dosage were adjusted at the physicians' discretion according to the label and standard practice.

CI, confidence interval; Gla‐100, insulin glargine 100 U/mL; Gla‐300, insulin glargine 300 U/mL

The basal insulin dose increased in both treatment groups from baseline [LS mean (SE) 0.36 (0.007) U/kg for Gla‐300 and 0.37 (0.007) U/kg for Gla‐100] to week 26 [LS mean (SE) 0.50 (0.006) U/kg for Gla‐300 and 0.43 (0.006) U/kg for Gla‐100 (Figure S3)]. The daily prandial insulin dose remained almost stable across the two groups, from baseline [LS mean (SE) 0.40 (0.009) U/kg for Gla‐300 and 0.39 (0.008) U/kg for Gla‐100] to week 26 [LS mean (SE) 0.41 (0.007) U/kg for Gla‐300 and 0.41 (0.007) U/kg for Gla‐100].

Overall, 395 (62.8%) and 388 participants (62.2%) experienced AEs in the Gla‐300 and Gla‐100 groups. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in two (0.3%) and five participants (0.8%), and SAEs were experienced by 37 (5.9%) and 46 participants (7.4%) in the Gla‐300 and Gla‐100 groups, respectively. Two deaths occurred in the Gla‐300 group: one from suicide, the other from a cardiac event; neither was considered related to study drug. The number of participants who discontinued treatment owing to AEs was 6 (1.0%) with Gla‐300 and 5 (0.8%) with Gla‐100.

Treatment for Non-critically Ill Patients

Insulin is the preferred treatment for glycemic control in critically ill patients. For non-critically ill patients with good nutritional intake basal, meal-related, and correction insulin dose are preferred. Subcutaneous rapid- or short-acting insulin before meals or every 4–6 h may be used in patients not on regular meals or in patients receiving continuous enteral/parenteral nutrition to correct hyperglycemia. For non-critically ill patients with poor oral intake or those who are taking nothing by mouth (NPO), basal insulin or a basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen is preferred. Basal-bolus is preferred over sliding scale insulin (SSI) owing to improved glycemic control and reduced hospital complications. Premixed insulin is preferred in the outpatient setting and basal-bolus therapy in the inpatient setting.

Recommendations

Consider using basal plus bolus correction insulin regimen, with the addition of meal-related insulin in patients who have good nutritional intake, in non-critically ill patients (Grade A, EL I)
Avoid sliding scale insulin in the inpatient hospital setting (Grade A, EL I)

Treatment for Critically Ill Patients

In the critically ill patients, continuous IV insulin is preferred. When the patient is able to take regular meals, basal and correction insulin doses are administered. When transitioning T1DM or T2DM patients to outpatient, SC insulin, SC basal insulin should be started 2–4 h before the IV insulin is discontinued.

Surgery

Perioperative Management

Perioperative management of blood glucose levels is based on the following objectives: (1) reduction in morbidity and mortality, (2) prevention of severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, (3) maintenance of physiological electrolyte and fluid balance, (4) prevention of ketoacidosis, and (5) achieving the target glycemic levels less than 10 mmol/L in critical patients and less than 7.7 mmol/L in stable patients. Long-acting insulin (insulin glargine) should be discontinued 2–3 days prior to surgery and combination of intermediate-acting insulin (NPH) with short- or rapid-acting insulin twice daily or Regular insulin before meals and intermediate-acting insulin at bedtime used for glycemic control. Figure 6 shows the perioperative management in T1DM and T2DM patients.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^114E498g]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations in our study, including a relatively small number of patients and the fact that the large majority of patients were African Americans with poor adherence to therapy as the primary precipitating cause of DKA. We also excluded patients with hypovolemic shock, patients in a comatose state, and patients who had acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal or hepatic failure, or pregnancy. A large prospective, randomized clinical trial of strict glycemic control is certainly needed to address these important issues.

In summary, our study indicates that intravenous treatments with regular insulin and glulisine insulin are equally effective with no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA. After resolution of DKA, transition to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemic events than treatment with NPH and regular insulin twice daily. These findings indicate that a basal bolus insulin regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

Monitoring

Successful management and early intervention for complications requires close monitoring. A flow chart should be maintained to document all relevant incidents regarding the patient's condition. Minimal monitoring frequency recommendations include vital signs and neurologic checks hourly; blood glucose hourly; venous blood gases every 2 hours for 6 hours, then every 4 hours; Na, K, and ionized calcium every 2 hours for 6 hours, then every 4 hours; magnesium and phosphorus every 4 hours; basic metabolic profile at admission and then every morning. These minimum requirements should be adapted to the situation; for example, more frequent (hourly) K measurements may be indicated, along with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring depending on the initial K value, or more frequent neurologic and vital sign checks (20–30 minutes) if there is a concern about the patient's mental status.

Ketonuria should not be used as a measure of improvement. The dip sticks used to measure ketones react with acetoacetate. Concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate are much higher than those of acetoacetate and will be converted to acetoacetate during successful treatment of the DKA, resulting in sustenance or increase of urinary ketone concentration. Laboratory measurement or the use of a bedside fingerstick sample monitor for beta-hydroxybutyrate will avoid this problem.

Transition

IV fluids can be stopped 1–2 hours after substantial consumption of oral fluids without vomiting.
Subcutaneous insulin injection can be started when IV fluids are no longer needed. Presupper or prebreakfast time is most convenient for starting or restarting intermediate- or long-acting insulin. Before then, rapid-acting or regular insulin 0.25 U/kg subcutaneously can be given every ∼6 hours, and the insulin infusion stopped 60–120 minutes after the first subcutaneous dose of regular insulin or 60 minutes after a rapid-acting insulin analog.
Patients should not be kept in the hospital simply to adjust insulin dosage because food, activity, and psychosocial environment are not normal in the hospital setting. Therefore, insulin requirements will not be particularly informative for home management.
Established patients with DKA can resume their usual home dose of insulin.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116yT14n]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination therapy with insulin degludec and intravenous insulin infusion (IVII) compared with IVII alone in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) management.

Materials and Methods

This prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial included 80 adults (≥ 18years) with DKA. Participants were randomised to either the intervention group, which received early subcutaneous (SC) insulin degludec (0.3units/kg SC within 3h of diagnosis) plus standard IVII, or the control group, which received standard IVII alone. The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Eighty patients were enrolled; 67.5% of participants had type 2 diabetes. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. DKA resolution was significantly faster in the early degludec group by 3.25h (7.75h, IQR 6.00–9.00h vs. 11.00h, IQR 6.25–15.00; p = 0.039). At 72h after transition to SC insulin, mean capillary blood glucose (CBG) was significantly lower with early degludec (213.9 ± 25.8mg/dL vs. 240.1 ± 42.0mg/dL; p = 0.012). Rates of rebound hyperglycaemia at 12h after bridging, mean CBG levels at 12, 24, and 48h among those with rebound hyperglycaemia, as well as rates of rebound DKA, hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, LOS, and in-hospital mortality, were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Early administration of SC insulin degludec in combination with IVII accelerated DKA resolution and improved blood glucose levels at 72h in patients with rebound hyperglycaemia after discontinuation of IVII, without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia or hypokalaemia.

### Subcutaneous administration of glargine to diabetic patients receiving insulin infusion prevents rebound hyperglycemia [^115c2X14]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Transition of diabetic patients from iv insulin infusion to s.c. insulin frequently results in rebound hyperglycemia.

Objectives

We hypothesized that initiation of a long-acting insulin therapy concurrently with i.v. insulin infusion would decrease the rate of rebound hyperglycemia after discontinuation of the insulin infusion.

Design and Intervention

Sixty-one diabetic patients receiving i.v. insulin therapy participated in this prospective randomized study. Subjects in the intervention group received daily injections of glargine s.c. (0.25 U/kg body weight) starting within 12 h of initiation of i.v. insulin infusion. Capillary blood glucose measurements were obtained up to 12 h after discontinuation of insulin infusion. Rebound hyperglycemia was defined as a blood glucose level greater than 180 mg/dl.

Setting

The study was conducted at the University of Colorado Hospital.

Patients

Sixty-one hospitalized patients with known type 1 or type 2 diabetes receiving i.v. insulin infusion participated in the study.

Main Outcome

The primary outcome of this study was to compare the rates of rebound hyperglycemia between the control and the intervention groups after i.v. insulin infusion is discontinued.

Results

Overall, 29 subjects in the control group (93.5%) had at least one glucose value above 180 mg/dl during the 12-h follow-up period. This was significantly greater than the rate of rebound hyperglycemia in the intervention group (10 subjects or 33.3%, P < 0.001). The effect of the intervention was apparent in subjects who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, after solid organ transplantation, and in patients with other surgical and medical diagnoses. There were three hypoglycemic measurements in two control subjects (68, 62, and 58 mg/dl) and none in the intervention group.

Conclusions

Once-daily s.c. insulin glargine administered during i.v. insulin infusion is a safe method for preventing future rebound hyperglycemia, without increased risk of hypoglycemia.

After transition to subcutaneous insulin therapy, cross-sectional analyses based on two-sample Wilcoxon tests showed that there were no significant differences in the mean daily glucose concentration between treatment groups. However, fitting of a repeated-measures linear model with or without adjustment for age, sex, race, and BMI indicated a greater decline rate of blood glucose in the glargine and glulisine group than that in the NPH and regular insulin group (P < 0.01).

Patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemic events than those treated with a basal bolus regimen (Table 2). Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and five patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P < 0.01). Three of these episodes in the NPH and regular insulin group and one in the glargine/glulisine group were < 40 mg/dl. None of the episodes of hypoglycemia in either group were associated with loss of consciousness or seizure.

The TDD of subcutaneous insulin was similar between groups (Table 3). The mean total daily insulin dose including supplemental insulin was 60 ± 30 units in the glargine and glulisine group and 58 ± 24 units in the NPH and regular insulin group (NS). In addition, there were no differences in the amount of supplements of insulin glulisine (13 ± 10 units) and regular insulin (12 ± 6 units) (NS).

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^115FdarW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to glargine U‐100, degludec has been shown to result in lower glycaemic variability, less hypoglycaemia (especially nocturnal hypoglycaemia), and greater flexibility, while providing an equivalent potential for glycaemic control. Furthermore, trials of degludec in hospitalised T2D patients have demonstrated that it is equally effective and safe compared with glargine U‐100. However, the evaluation of the hypothesis that early administration of degludec following a DKA diagnosis may accelerate DKA resolution, prevent rebound hyperglycaemia, and reduce LOS presents significant challenges. This is particularly due to its pharmacokinetic profile, as steady‐state concentrations are typically achieved only after 3–4 days of therapy. Addressing this knowledge gap serves as the primary aim of the present study.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^112MEhEp]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^1112CQPQ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE To investigate if long-acting insulin analogs decrease the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in young individuals with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Of 48,110 type 1 diabetic patients prospectively studied between 2001 and 2008, the incidence of DKA requiring hospitalization was analyzed in 10,682 individuals aged ≤ 20 years with a diabetes duration of ≥ 2 years. RESULTS The overall rate of DKA was 5.1 (SE ± 0.2)/100 patient-years. Patients using insulin glargine or detemir (n = 5,317) had a higher DKA incidence than individuals using NPH insulin (n = 5,365, 6.6 ± 0.4 vs. 3.6 ± 0.3, P < 0.001). The risk for DKA remained significantly different after adjustment for age at diabetes onset, diabetes duration, A1C, insulin dose, sex, and migration background (P = 0.015, odds ratio 1.357 [1.062–1.734]). CONCLUSIONS Despite their long-acting pharmacokinetics, the use of insulin glargine or detemir is not associated with a lower incidence of DKA compared with NPH insulin.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^1143hAvE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Procedures

After exclusions (Figure 1), 80 patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a computer‐generated sequence with variable block sizes of 2–8. Allocation was concealed using sealed, opaque envelopes, and participants were assigned to either the early degludec or control group. The early degludec group received SC degludec at a dose of 0.3 units/kg within 3 h of DKA diagnosis, with a dose reduction to 0.15 units/kg for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft–Gault equation), in addition to the standard IVII protocol. The selected dose was based on prior prospective studies of glargine U‐100, which reported doses ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 units/kg, as well as the 2022 UK guideline, which recommends a basal insulin dose of approximately 0.25 units/kg. Together, these findings provide both pharmacologic and clinical rationale for selecting 0.3 units/kg of degludec. The control group was administered only the standard IVII for DKA and did not receive placebo injections. Orders for intravenous insulin bolus, fixed‐dose IVII regimen, intravenous fluids, potassium, and bicarbonate administration were consistent in both groups and followed the 2009 ADA recommendations, with the full protocol detailed in Appendix S1. A fixed IVII regimen of 0.1 units/kg/h was used until the capillary blood glucose (CBG) dropped below 200 mg/dL. Once CBG fell below 200 mg/dL, the insulin infusion rate was adjusted to 0.02–0.05 units/kg/h according to the patient's CBG level, aiming to maintain CBG between 150 and 200 mg/dL until DKA resolution. CBG was measured hourly, and serum electrolyte levels were monitored every 4 h in both groups. DKA resolution was defined as CBG of less than 200 mg/dL, in combination with a normalised serum anion gap (≤ 12 mEq/L), a venous pH above 7.30, or a serum bicarbonate greater than 15.0 mEq/L. After resolution, patients were transitioned to a SC insulin regimen as soon as they could tolerate oral or enteral intake, using a newly calculated weight‐based total daily dose of approximately 0.6 units/kg/day in both groups. SC insulin aspart was injected 5 to 15 min before meals in both groups as prandial insulin. For basal insulin, the control group received insulin glargine U‐100 SC with the first dose of insulin aspart, while the intervention group received a second dose of insulin degludec approximately 24 h after the first dose. IVII was discontinued 1 h after transitioning to full SC insulin. Following DKA resolution, while patients remained hospitalised, the internal medicine and endocrinology teams primarily adjusted multiple daily injections of basal‐bolus SC insulin as part of standard inpatient care, and CBG was routinely monitored four times daily (before meals and at bedtime). In the event of hypoglycaemia, patients received 15 g of oral glucose or 25 g of intravenous glucose, depending on their level of consciousness and ability to tolerate oral intake. CBG was rechecked 15 min later, and treatment was repeated as necessary until levels exceeded 70 mg/dL. A meal or snack was subsequently provided to prevent recurrence. Insulin doses were individually adjusted based on CBG trends and the patient's clinical status. Continuous glucose monitoring was not included in the study protocol.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^1159y2Lx]. Diabetes Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Insulin

Insulin should be started after initial fluid expansion. This provides a more realistic starting glucose level.
0.1 U/kg/hour is given as a continuous infusion, using a pump. Fifty units of regular insulin are diluted in 50 mL normal saline to provide 1 unit/mL.
A bolus dose of insulin is not indicated and may increase the risk of CE.
In some settings it may be necessary to administer insulin subcutaneously. Studies in adults have indicated no significant difference in recovery time whether insulin was administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously after the first couple of hours of treatment. A study of subcutaneous insulin in children with DKA using a rapid-acting insulin analog (lispro) provided a dose of 0.15 units/kg every 2 hours; there were no significant differences from children randomized to receive 0.1 unit/kg per hour intravenously. The administration of 0.1 unit/kg subcutaneously every hour may be preferable and can be adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at ∼180–200 mg/dL (10–11 mmol/L).
Fluid expansion alone will have a dilutional effect, lowering high blood glucose levels by as much as 180–270 mg/dL (10–15 mmol/L). With insulin infusion the rate of glucose decline should be 50–150 mg/dL (2.8–8.3 mmol/L/hour), but not > 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L/hour). If serum glucose values are not dropping adequately, the insulin dose should be increased; this is rarely necessary.
If the blood glucose concentration falls below 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) 10% dextrose solution should be given and the insulin dose reduced to 0.05 U/kg/hour if glucose concentration is not sustained by the 10% dextrose solution.
Insulin should not be stopped; a continuous supply of insulin is needed to prevent ketosis and permit continued anabolism. If the patient demonstrates marked sensitivity to insulin, the dose may be decreased to 0.05 units/kg/hour, or less, provided that metabolic acidosis continues to resolve.
Persistent acidosis, defined as bicarbonate value < 10 mmol/L after 8–10 hours of treatment, is usually caused by inadequate insulin effect. Insulin dilution and rate of administration should be checked, and a fresh preparation made. Too dilute a solution may enhance insulin adherence to the tubing. If insulin is being given by subcutaneous injection, inadequate absorption may be occurring. Rare causes of persistent acidosis include lactic acidosis due to an episode of hypotension or apnea or inadequate renal handling of hydrogen ion as a result of an episode of renal hypoperfusion.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116Ux9sA]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

In a controlled multicenter and open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with DKA to receive intravenous treatment with regular or glulisine insulin until resolution of DKA. After resolution of ketoacidosis, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily (n = 34). Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 34).

RESULTS

There were no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA between intravenous treatment with regular and glulisine insulin. After transition to subcutaneous insulin, there were no differences in mean daily blood glucose levels, but patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl). Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P = 0.03).

CONCLUSIONS

Regular and glulisine insulin are equally effective during the acute treatment of DKA. A transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine after resolution of DKA resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than with NPH and regular insulin. Thus, a basal bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^111hoP3f]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Lipolysis and ketogenesis leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be suppressed by the continuous provision of small doses of insulin. DKA is frequently caused by omission of insulin injections, observed in 28–65% of young patients with type 1 diabetes. In young children, the use of insulin glargine and detemir was associated with a trend to less DKA episodes compared with NPH/zinc insulin, potentially related to the prolonged action of these insulin analogs. We hypothesized that long-acting insulin analogs may confer greater protection from DKA in young patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^113RToUA]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with poor metabolic control (A1C ≥ 9.0%, n = 2,652), DKA incidence was 13.7 ± 0.72/100 patient-years. In these patients, 63% used basal insulin analogs. Treatment with long-acting insulin analogs was associated with higher DKA risk compared with NPH insulin (P = 0.003, OR 1.639 [95% CI 1.180–2.277]) in this subgroup of patients.

When DKA risk was separately analyzed for insulin glargine or detemir versus NPH, the association with higher DKA risk was confirmed for both long-acting insulin analogs (P = 0.035, OR 1.268 [95% CI 0.978–1.643] and 1.526 [1.092–2.133]). In patients with poor metabolic control, even higher DKA incidences associated with insulin glargine or detemir compared with NPH were found (P = 0.011, OR 1.470 [1.046–2.065] and 1.906 [1.226–2.963]).

### Comparing a daily versus weekly titration algorithm in people with type 2 diabetes switching from basal insulin to iGlarLixi in the lixiLan ONE CAN randomized trial [^114P4vX5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and participants

LixiLan ONE CAN was an open‐label, randomized, two treatment arms, parallel‐group, 26‐week, multicentre phase 3b study conducted in Canada (registered with: NCT03767543). The study was conducted in accordance with consensus ethics principles derived from international ethics guidelines, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Informed consent was obtained prior to conducting any study‐related procedures.

Study participants were aged 18 years or older with T2D having an HbA1c of ≥ 7.5% to ≤ 10.5% (≥ 58 to ≤ 91 mmol/mol) and a body mass index of 20 to 40 kg/m 2 (Figure S1). Participants had been treated for at least 6 months on 40 units or less per day basal insulin (including insulin glargine, degludec and others) with or without OADs. The OADs allowed at inclusion were metformin, insulin secretagogues, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP‐4is) and sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), with no change in OAD dose for at least 2 months prior to randomization. Participants were excluded if they had a history of severe hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia unawareness; a history of metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis within 1 year prior to screening; or were on current treatment with a GLP‐1 RA or previous treatment with known intolerance to GLP‐1 RAs.

2.2 Randomization and study treatment

Study participants were randomly assigned to self‐titrate iGlarLixi using either a once daily or once weekly regimen targeting a fasting self‐monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) level of 4.4‐5.6 mmol/L (79‐101 mg/dl). For all participants, basal insulin taken at inclusion was replaced by iGlarLixi, injected once a day 1 hour prior to the first meal of the day. For those transferring from once daily basal insulin, the iGlarLixi starting dose was 15 or 30 units if the basal insulin dose was less than 30 units or 30 or more units, respectively. For those transferring from twice daily basal insulin, the same starting dose rationale was applied after calculating 80% of the pretrial total daily basal insulin dose.

### Insulin glargine supplementation during early management phase of diabetic ketoacidosis in children [^114B3dKx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the effect of subcutaneous administration of insulin glargine on the rate of resolution of acidosis and intravenous insulin infusion requirement in children with moderate and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit of a university-based children's hospital.

Patients

Children with moderate to severe DKA admitted between March 2001 and February 2003.

Results

The outcomes of children who received 0.3 units/kg of subcutaneous insulin glargine in the first 6 h of management in addition to the standard treatment (n = 12) were compared with those of children who received standard treatment alone (n = 59). Measured outcomes included dose of intravenous insulin required, duration of insulin infusion and acidosis correction time. The two groups were similar in demographics and severity of illness. The mean time for acidosis correction (venous pH ≥ 7.3) in the insulin glargine group was shorter than the standard therapy group (12.4 ± 2.9 h and 17.1 ± 6.2 h respectively, p < 0.001). The insulin infusion time was shorter in the insulin glargine group (14.8 ± 6.0 h vs 24.4 ± 9.0 h, p < 0.001). There was a trend towards shorter total hospital stay in the glargine group (3.2 ± 1.0 days vs 3.72 ± 1.06 days).

Conclusions

In our small series of children with moderate and severe DKA, supplementing with subcutaneous insulin glargine led to a faster resolution of acidosis without any adverse effects. This could potentially lead to a shorter need for insulin infusion and a shorter ICU length of stay.

### Thirty years of personal experience in hyperglycemic crises: diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state [^116kkeVh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) cause major morbidity and significant mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. For more than 30 yr, our group, in a series of prospective, randomized clinical studies, has investigated the pathogenesis and evolving strategies of the treatment of hyperglycemic crises. This paper summarizes the results of these prospective studies on the management and pathophysiology of DKA.

Setting

Our earliest studies evaluated the comparative efficacy of low-dose vs. pharmacological amounts of insulin and the use of low-dose therapy by various routes in adults and later in children. Subsequent studies evaluated phosphate and bicarbonate therapy, lipid metabolism, ketosis-prone type 2 patients, and use of rapid-acting insulin analogs as well as leptin status, cardiac risk factors, proinflammatory cytokines, and the mechanism of activation of T lymphocytes in hyperglycemic crises.

Main Outcome

The information garnered from these studies resulted in the creation of the 2001 American Diabetes Association (ADA) technical review on DKA and HHS as well as the ADA Position and Consensus Paper on the therapy for hyperglycemic crises.

Conclusions

Areas of future research include prospective randomized studies to do the following: 1) establish the efficacy of bicarbonate therapy in DKA for a pH less than 6.9; 2) establish the need for a bolus insulin dose in the initial therapy of DKA; 3) determine the pathophysiological mechanisms for the absence of ketosis in HHS; 4) investigate the reasons for elevated proinflammatory cytokines and cardiovascular risk factors; and 5) evaluate the efficacy and cost benefit of using sc regular insulin vs. more expensive insulin analogs on the general ward for the treatment of DKA.

### Expert opinion: a call for basal insulin titration in patients with type 2 diabetes in daily practice: southeast European perspective [^1176UkWD]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Principles That Should Be Followed When Physicians Initiate and Titrate BIA

The experts defined six steps from patient selection to stopping titration that physicians should consider when initiating and titrating a BIA.

STEP I — Preparing for initiation

A. Selecting the right patients for (BIA) treatment

When deciding whether a patient should initiate basal insulin treatment, several general and diabetes-specific medical history data and patient characteristics should be evaluated. These are the most important characteristics of patients who may need BIA treatment:
Newly diagnosed T2D that is symptomatic with HbA1c ≥ 9%
T2D that cannot be controlled (i.e. target HbA1c is not reached) with maximally tolerated doses of non-insulin agents
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and/or hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state
End-stage organ failure (e.g. kidney failure, hepatic illness)
Acute illness (e.g. COVID-19 disease)
Gestational diabetes
Intolerance to oral medications
Patient preference
When the physician considers BIA the most appropriate approach

However, the following characteristics indicate that a patient should not be treated with insulin:
In those of advanced age when patients may not be able to manage self-injection and/or perform blood glucose self-monitoring
In those with short life expectancy
In those at high risk for hypoglycaemia

B. Individualized HbA1c targets

HbA1c targets should be determined individually on the basis of guidelines, recommendations and individual clinical data, such as duration of diabetes, existing complications and comorbidities, frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic events, and patient life expectancy.

C. Helping the patient cope with challenges

To cope with challenges related to BI-based treatment, the physician, in collaboration with a diabetes educator or nurse, has to inform the patient why he/she needs BIA, what the metabolic aims are with the newly initiated BI and the expected benefits of an insulin analogue compared to human insulin. The physician should educate the patient on how to perform self-injection, to monitor blood glucose levels, to self-titrate insulin doses and to integrate these steps into his/her daily life. As part of these preparatory steps, the physician should provide the patient with written (web-based) informational material, demonstrate a positive attitude and obtain patients' consent for cooperation.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^113V2hAx]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of an insulin priming dose with a continuous insulin infusion versus two continuous infusions without a priming dose.

Research Design and Methods

This prospective randomized protocol used three insulin therapy methods: 1) load group using a priming dose of 0.07 units of regular insulin per kg body weight followed by a dose of 0.07 unit x kg(-1) x h(-1) i.v. in 12 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); 2) no load group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0.07 unit. kg body weight(-1) x h(-1) without a loading dose in 12 patients with DKA, and 3) twice no load group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0.14 x kg(-1) x h(-1) without a loading dose in 13 patients with DKA. Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA.

Results

The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 microU/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 microU/ml in 60 min. The twice no load group reached a peak (200 microU/ml) at 45 min. The no load group reached a peak (60 microU/ml) in 60–120 min. Five patients in the no load group required supplemental insulin doses to decrease initial glucose levels by 10%; patients in the twice no load and load groups did not. Except for these differences, times to reach glucose ≤ 250 mg/dl, pH ≥ 7.3, and HCO(3)(-) ≥ 15 mEq/l did not differ significantly among the three groups.

Conclusions

A priming dose in low-dose insulin therapy in patients with DKA is unnecessary if an adequate dose of regular insulin of 0.14 unit x kg body weight(-1) x h(-1) (about 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is given.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^1112c5FL]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes‐related ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life‐threatening yet preventable complication of predominantly type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, it may also occur in ketosis‐prone type 2 diabetes (T2D) and with the use of novel agents such as sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.DKA is characterised by a triad of blood glucose concentration > 11.0 mmol/L or known diagnosis of diabetes, capillary of blood ketone concentration > 3.0 mmol/L or significant ketonuria and bicarbonate concentration of < 15.0 mmol/L and/or venous pH < 7.3.DKA may occur in states of absolute or relative insulin deficiency or as a consequence of a rise in counter‐regulatory hormones including cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon and catecholamines. The alteration in hormone levels contributes to elevated blood glucose, lipolysis, ketone body production and electrolyte imbalances. Mismanagement of DKA may result in increased length of hospital admission and high readmission rates. Previous studies have demonstrated that protocol‐driven management of DKA is a safe approach — decreasing the duration of DKA and length of hospital admission with no difference in hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia.

Though the diagnostic criteria for DKA remain unambiguous in the United Kingdom, there remains a variation in DKA management guidelines between hospital sites. To reduce errors and improve the standard of care, the Joint British Diabetes Society‐Inpatient (JBDS‐IP) published national guidelines for DKA management, which have been regularly revised. Initial surveys have demonstrated a high uptake of guidelines. Management within the emergency department or acute medical unit is initiated in a timely manner, presumably due to a higher nursing staff‐to‐patient ratio and familiarisation with guidelines. However, prompt monitoring and review are often overlooked when patients are transferred to general medical wards. Rates of continued guideline adherence in clinical practice and, thus, the impact of guideline revisions on outcomes remains less well explored. A national survey of DKA management demonstrated a high burden of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia episodes, with the use of insulin recognised as the primary driver for these biochemical abnormalities. Therefore, based upon expert consensus, the 2021 revision recommends reducing the fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion (FRIII) rate to 0.05 units/kg/h. when blood glucose reduces to less than 14 mmol/L to avoid complications, including hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia. However, whether this guideline change has resulted in the expected improvement in DKA care is unknown.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between using subcutaneous insulin and continuous insulin infusion in managing adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^116VkWxP]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the current literature to determine the safety and efficacy of using subcutaneous insulin compared to an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion in managing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

We searched Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, BIOSIS and CENTRAL from inception to April 26, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that assessed the use of subcutaneous compared to intravenous insulin for the treatment of mild to moderate DKA were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent reviewers and disagreements were resolved through further discussion or by a third reviewer. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.0 was used to evaluate the RCTs and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS)-I tool was used to evaluate the observational studies. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models. We followed the PRISMA guidelines for reporting our findings.

Results

Six RCTs (245 participants) and four observational studies (8444 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Some studies showed a decreased length of stay (Mean Difference [MD] in days: -0.39; 95% CI: -2.83 to 2.08; I 2: 0%) among individuals treated with subcutaneous insulin compared to intravenous insulin. There was no difference in the risk of all-cause mortality, time to resolution of DKA (MD in hours: 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.45 to 3.79; I 2: 0%) and hypoglycemia (Risk Ratio [RR]: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.19; I 2: 0%) between the two groups.

Conclusion

Treatment of DKA with subcutaneous insulin may be a safe and effective alternative to IV insulin in selected patients. The limited available evidence underscores the need for further studies to explore optimal dosing, patient selection criteria and long-term outcomes.

### Review of subcutaneous insulin regimens in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults and pediatrics [^117BGft5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Summarize the studies evaluating the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in adults and pediatrics.

Data Sources

A PubMed literature search was conducted for articles published between 2000 and the end of May 2024 which contained the following terms in their title: (1) subcutaneous, glargine, or basal and (2) ketoa*.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, guidelines, meta-analysis, commentaries, studies not related to the acute management of DKA, studies evaluating continuous SQ insulin, animal studies, if the time to DKA resolution was not clearly defined, and studies where basal insulin was administered greater than 6 hours after the insulin infusion was started were excluded.

Data Synthesis

The electronic search identified 58 articles. Following the initial screening 38 articles were excluded and 3 were added after bibliography review. Of the 23 articles assessed for eligibility, 7 were excluded. Sixteen articles were included. Five studies compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and intravenous (IV) insulin infusions in adults, 4 compared SQ rapid/short-acting insulin and IV insulin infusions in pediatrics, 4 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in adults, and 3 evaluated IV insulin infusions with or without SQ basal insulin in pediatrics.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

In comparison with IV insulin infusions, rapid/short-acting SQ insulin regimens were associated with reduced ICU admission rates, hospital length of stay, and hospitalization costs. IV insulin infusion regimens that included a single SQ basal insulin dose upon therapy initiation were associated with reduced concurrent IV insulin infusion durations.

Conclusion

Studies reviewed suggest that SQ insulin regimens may be as effective and safe as IV insulin infusions in the management of DKA and are associated with the conservation of resources. Providers may refer to this review when establishing or modifying their DKA management protocols.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^112MoB7x]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In the management of DKA, patients with ESRD are generally treated with the same IVII doses as those without renal disease. Expert recommendations suggest that initiating a lower insulin infusion rate (e.g. 0.05 units/kg/h) may be considered. Subcutaneous insulin doses are also typically reduced in advanced CKD (CrCl < 30 mL/min) due to impaired insulin clearance and an increased risk of hypoglycemia. In our study, three patients in the early degludec group with CrCl < 30 mL/min received a reduced degludec dose (0.15 units/kg/day) in addition to IVII. One patient with ESRD developed hypoglycaemia despite dose reduction, whereas two patients with acute kidney injury experienced rebound hyperglycaemia, highlighting the challenge of appropriate dosing. Evidence to guide early SC basal insulin use in this population is limited, warranting further research to optimise safety and efficacy.

The total IVII dose from initiation to DKA resolution was slightly lower in the early degludec group, but this difference was not statistically significant. This may be explained by the pharmacokinetics of degludec, which is peakless and requires time to reach steady state, as well as the fact that the study was powered for the primary outcome rather than for comparing total insulin dose.

Our study also found an interesting point: the control group had four cases of rebound DKA after DKA resolution, compared to zero cases in the early degludec group. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance due to the relatively low event rate. A larger study may be needed to establish the correlation between early use of basal insulin and rebound DKA events.

One prior trial of glargine U‐100 demonstrated a reduction in LOS; however, this benefit was not observed in other prospective studies, including our own (Table 4). The absence of an effect on LOS may be attributed to hospital discharge decisions being primarily influenced by the resolution of underlying precipitating factors — as such as infection — rather than by DKA resolution alone.

TABLE 4
Description of incidence of rebound hyperglycaemia, safety outcome, and other secondary outcomes.

Three participants in the early degludec group received an initial dose of 0.15 units/kg due to CrCl < 30 mL/min. One had end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and was prescribed a total daily SC insulin dose of 0.3 units/kg/day after DKA resolution, with an average CBG of 182 mg/dL during the rebound hyperglycaemic episode 72 h after transition from IVII. The other two participants had acute kidney injury with CrCl recovering to > 30 mL/min the following day after fluid replacement; both were transitioned to SC insulin at 0.6 units/kg/day after DKA resolution, with average CBGs of 264.5 and 205 mg/dL at 72 h post‐IVII. Additional clinical outcomes are presented in Table S1.

Regarding safety outcomes, the incidence of hypoglycaemia (CBG < 70 mg/dL) and level 2 hypoglycaemia (CBG < 54 mg/dL) was comparable between groups (12.5% vs. 10.0%; p = 1.0 and 2.5% vs. 2.5%; p = 1.0, respectively). One patient with ESRD in the early degludec group who received a reduced dose of insulin degludec developed hypoglycaemia (CBG 58 mg/dL) within 24 h after transition to the full SC insulin regimen (Table S1). The incidence of hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was common in this study and showed no significant difference between the groups (50.0% vs. 40.0%; p = 0.369). The serum potassium levels during hypokalaemic events were mild and comparable between groups (3.22 ± 0.19 mEq/L vs. 3.24 ± 0.18 mEq/L; p = 0.715) (Table 4). Additional information on hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia is provided in Table S2. None of the participants developed symptomatic cerebral oedema.

LOS and in‐hospital mortality were also not significantly different between groups (5.23 days [3.65–8.04] vs. 6.63 days [4.04–13.32]; p = 0.218, and 0% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.241, respectively).

Regarding the use of insulin glargine SC (also known as Lantus, Toujeo, Toujeo MAX) in patients with intermittent hemodialysis:

- Reduce dose.
- Reduce dose by 50%.
- Dose adjustments should generally follow the indication-specific recommendations as described in the adult dosing section but titrated more gradually; in patients experiencing hypoglycemia, consider more aggressive dose reductions (eg, by 25% to 40%) depending on severity.

### Insulin analogs versus human insulin in the treatment of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111wL2rY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of insulin analogs and human insulins both during acute intravenous treatment and during the transition to subcutaneous insulin in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Research Design and Methods

In a controlled multicenter and open-label trial, we randomly assigned patients with DKA to receive intravenous treatment with regular or glulisine insulin until resolution of DKA. After resolution of ketoacidosis, patients treated with intravenous regular insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous NPH and regular insulin twice daily (n = 34). Patients treated with intravenous glulisine insulin were transitioned to subcutaneous glargine once daily and glulisine before meals (n = 34).

Results

There were no differences in the mean duration of treatment or in the amount of insulin infusion until resolution of DKA between intravenous treatment with regular and glulisine insulin. After transition to subcutaneous insulin, there were no differences in mean daily blood glucose levels, but patients treated with NPH and regular insulin had a higher rate of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dl). Fourteen patients (41%) treated with NPH and regular insulin had 26 episodes of hypoglycemia and 5 patients (15%) in the glargine and glulisine group had 8 episodes of hypoglycemia (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Regular and glulisine insulin are equally effective during the acute treatment of DKA. A transition to subcutaneous glargine and glulisine after resolution of DKA resulted in similar glycemic control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than with NPH and regular insulin. Thus, a basal bolus regimen with glargine and glulisine is safer and should be preferred over NPH and regular insulin after the resolution of DKA.

### Impact of switching youth with diabetes to insulin degludec in clinical practice [^115uNQpD]. Endocrine Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Many youth with diabetes struggle to meet glycemic targets. The new ultralong duration of action of insulin degludec (iDeg) holds potential to ameliorate missed doses of basal insulin and improve glycemic control in youth with diabetes.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken of youth age 13 to < 24 years in our practice with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had been switched from glargine or detemir to iDeg to evaluate the impact of this transition on glycemic control.

Results

Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in youth with T1D (n = 82) remained stable during 6 months of treatment with iDeg (10.1 ± 2.11% [87 ± 23 mmol/mol] at start of iDeg compared to 10.1 ± 2.12% [87 ± 23 mmol/mol] at 6 months of treatment), whereas in youth with T2D (n = 16), HbA1c significantly declined from 10.6 ± 2.3% (92 ± 25 mmol/mol) to 8.3 ± 2.2% (67 ± 24 mmol/mol) (P = 0.0024).

Conclusion

In youth switched to iDeg, which in our practice is commonly due to ineffectiveness of the patient's current regimen, the outcome differences we saw may be due to preserved beta-cell function in youth with T2D. It remains to be seen whether there are benefits of transition to iDeg in youth with T1D beyond glycemic outcomes, such as reduction in ketosis and episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^116CUN9G]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study is the first known trial to provide data on the early co‐administration of degludec with IVII in the management of DKA. This study is also larger compared to other early basal insulin trials in DKA management, with an adequate sample size that includes participants with both T1D and T2D. The open‐label design is considered a study limitation, as awareness of treatment allocation by both clinicians and patients may have subtly influenced decisions regarding laboratory monitoring, the timing of intravenous insulin discontinuation, and discharge planning. However, all treating clinicians followed the current ADA guidelines recommendations. A second limitation is that ketone concentrations were not routinely monitored or used to define DKA resolution, due to cost considerations, longer turnaround times compared with standard laboratory tests, and the study being conducted prior to the ADA 2024 consensus statement. Another limitation is the exclusion of participants with plasma glucose levels below 250 mg/dL at diagnosis, such as patients with euglycemic DKA. In this population, early use of combination basal insulin is particularly challenging due to concerns about hypoglycaemia, as baseline plasma glucose levels are lower than those typically seen in classic DKA cases. However, in our study, which did not include euglycemic DKA, no increase in hypoglycaemia was observed, attributable to frequent CBG monitoring and a careful follow‐up protocol. Additionally, the comparison of early degludec with late conventional glargine U‐100 administration after DKA resolution in this study may not fully demonstrate the benefit of early degludec use, due to the different pharmacokinetic properties of the two insulins. Larger, blinded studies across broader DKA populations, including euglycemic patients, with direct comparison of early versus late degludec administration should be considered to confirm the effectiveness and safety of early degludec use.

### A multicentre, UK, retrospective, observational study to assess the effectiveness of insulin glargine 300 units / mL in treating people with type 1 diabetes mellitus in routine clinical practice (SPARTA) [^115DQt6K]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To conduct an open‐label study to providereal‐world evidence regarding the use of insulin glargine 300 units/ml (U300) in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Methods

People with Type 1 diabetes who had been prescribed U300 ≥ 6 months before data collection and had HbA 1c levels recorded within 3 months prior to U300 (baseline) were included. The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to month 6 after U300 initiation. Other endpoints included number of documented hypoglycaemic and diabetic ketoacidosis episodes, and change in daily basal insulin dose.

Results

A total of 298 people with Type 1 diabetes were included [mean age 42.1 years, mean HbA 1c 79 mmol/mol (9.4%)]. After U300 initiation, the mean reduction in HbA 1c from baseline to month 6 was –4 mmol/mol (–0.4%; P < 0.001; n = 188). The total daily basal insulin dose at 6 months was 1.3 units higher than at the time of U300 initiation (P < 0.001; n = 275) but was not significantly different from the prior basal insulin dose. There was no clinically significant difference in weight between baseline and month 6 [mean difference +0.7 kg, 95%–0.1, 1.5; P = 0.084; n = 115). During the 6 months before and after U300 initiation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes were documented for 6/298 and 4/298 participants. Diabetic ketoacidosis episodes requiring Accident and Emergency department visits or hospitalization were documented for 4/298 and 6/298 participants, before and after U300 initiation, respectively.

Conclusions

In people with Type 1 diabetes, a change in basal insulin to U300 was associated with clinically and statistically significant HbA 1c improvements, without significant changes in basal insulin dose and weight. Documented severe hypoglycaemia episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis requiring Accident and Emergency department visits or hospitalization were low and similar before and after U300 initiation.

### Effectiveness and safety of early insulin glargine administration in combination with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^111wB5z5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To determine the effectiveness and safety of early combination of insulin glargine with intravenous (IV) insulin infusion compared with IV insulin infusion alone in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Methods

This was a single-centre, open-label, randomized controlled trial of adults aged 18years or older diagnosed with DKA. The 'early glargine' group was given subcutaneous insulin glargine 0.3units/kg within the first 3hours of DKA diagnosis, in addition to the standard IV insulin infusion. The control group received standard IV insulin treatment only. The primary outcome was the time to DKA resolution. The other outcomes included rebound hyperglycaemia, mortality, hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, as well as the length of hospital stay (LOS).

Results

A total of 60 patients (30 patients per group) were enrolled. Most patients (76.7%) had type 2 diabetes. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics, except for higher serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and lower pH levels in the early glargine group. The mean ± standard deviation time to DKA resolution in the early glargine group was significantly faster than the control group (9.89 ± 3.81 vs. 12.73 ± 5.37hours; p = 0.022). The median (interquartile range) LOS was significantly shorter in the early glargine group than in the control group (4.75 [3.53–8.96] vs. 15.25 [5.71–26.38] days; p = 0.024). The incidence of rebound hyperglycaemia, all-cause mortality, hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia was similar between the groups.

Conclusions

Early combination of insulin glargine with IV insulin infusion led to a faster DKA resolution and a shorter LOS, without increasing hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia.

### Insulin glargine supplementation during early management phase in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: a double-blinded randomised controlled trial [^1121Gf6J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early supplementation with insulin glargine (GI) during the acute management of paediatric diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Design

Double-blinded randomised controlled trial conducted from July 2022 to June 2023.

Setting

Emergency department and paediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India.

Participants

Children between > 1month and ≤ 12 years presenting with DKA.

Intervention

Participants were randomised to receive a single subcutaneous dose of GI (0.3U/kg) or volume-matched placebo within 1hour of initiating intravenous regular insulin infusion.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included the rate of blood glucose decline, incidence of hypoglycaemia, hypokalaemia, rebound hyperglycaemia, treatment failure and total regular insulin dose received.

Results

82 children were enrolled (glargine: n = 42; control: n = 40). The mean (SD) time to DKA resolution was 11 (6.4) hours in the glargine group versus 13.9 (7.4) hours in the control group (adjusted HR 1.05, 95%CI 0.65 to 1.69, p = 0.84). Rebound hyperglycaemia (adjusted risk ratio (ARR) 0.57, 95%CI 0.35 to 0.92, p = 0.02) and treatment failure (ARR 0.14, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.56, p = 0.005) were significantly lower with glargine. Other secondary outcomes were similar across groups.

Conclusions

While early glargine supplementation did not accelerate DKA resolution, it was associated with reduced treatment failure and improved glycaemic stability post resolution. Its use was safe, feasible and not linked to increased adverse events.

### Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in the era of SGLT-2 inhibitors [^111wh8sf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2023). High credibility.

Treatment

Treatment for EDKA parallels that of DKA except that the risk of relapse into DKA is high in the setting of SGLT-2 inhibitor use (figure 2). Insulin should be delivered at a fixed rate of intravenous infusion until the anion gap corrects and the patient can transition to oral intake. For patients with insulin resistance (ie, body mass index > 35 kg/m 2), insulin infusion at a fixed rate of 2–3 units/hour is often necessary to correct the acidosis. Dextrose infusion, preferably 10% dextrose water (D10W) is typically necessary in EDKA to prevent hypoglycemia (author experience). DKA is considered resolved when the patient can eat, pH is > 7.3 units, bicarbonate is > 15.0 mmol/L, and serum ketones are < 0.6 mmol/L, and we recommend the same criteria for resolution of EDKA. Subcutaneous basal insulin should be initiated 2–3 hours before stopping the intravenous insulin infusion. The dose of basal insulin can be based on the patient's body weight (ie, 0.3 units per kilogram per day in both T1DM and T2DM) or based on the rate of intravenous insulin required in the last 6–8 hours before switching to subcutaneous insulin. If the two calculations are discrepant, we suggest the clinician use their best judgment or split the difference between the two calculations. Prandial insulin should be added when the patient starts eating, with the dose calculated as 0.1 units/kg for each meal (for both T1DM and T2DM). Doses of basal and prandial insulin will be adjusted depending on BG levels in subsequent hours and days.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults-an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes society for inpatient care [^112T3Cze]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de-escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end-stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

### Long-acting insulin analogs and the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a prospective study of 10, 682 patients from 271 institutions [^112zFcBc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To investigate if long-acting insulin analogs decrease the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in young individuals with type 1 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Of 48,110 type 1 diabetic patients prospectively studied between 2001 and 2008, the incidence of DKA requiring hospitalization was analyzed in 10,682 individuals aged ≤ 20 years with a diabetes duration of ≥ 2 years.

RESULTS

The overall rate of DKA was 5.1 (SE ± 0.2)/100 patient-years. Patients using insulin glargine or detemir (n = 5,317) had a higher DKA incidence than individuals using NPH insulin (n = 5,365, 6.6 ± 0.4 vs. 3.6 ± 0.3, P < 0.001). The risk for DKA remained significantly different after adjustment for age at diabetes onset, diabetes duration, A1C, insulin dose, sex, and migration background (P = 0.015, odds ratio 1.357 [1.062–1.734]).

CONCLUSIONS

Despite their long-acting pharmacokinetics, the use of insulin glargine or detemir is not associated with a lower incidence of DKA compared with NPH insulin.

### Successful management of severe diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with type 2 diabetes with insulin allergy: a case report [^116G2yTW]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

On day 5 of follow-up, ketonaemia, metabolic acidosis (arterial blood pH of 7.465, bicarbonate of 18.4 mmol/litre and AG of 12.73 mmol/litre), and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine of 108 μmol/litre) had almost resolved, and CVVHDF was withdrawn. He did not require vasoconstrictors. Continuous IV infusion of recombinant human insulin continued and was adjusted according to blood glucose levels measured with a portable blood glucose meter. He was extubated on day 7 and transitioned from continuous IV insulin infusion to subcutaneous insulin (combined regular human insulin with insulin glargine) administration on day 14. He was discharged on day 21 with SIA (combined regular human insulin with insulin glargine) in combination with an oral antidiabetic drug (sitagliptin and metformin). Three months later, glycaemic control was gradually restored (HbA1c: 8.3% [67 mmol/mol]; total daily insulin dose was up to 44 UI); he still appeared to have mild allergic symptoms, such as local erythaema and swelling, especially distinct at the injection site of insulin glargine (Fig. 1 b).

### Glargine co-administration with intravenous insulin in pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis is safe and facilitates transition to a subcutaneous regimen [^1117tKpq]. Pediatric Diabetes (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common presentation and complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D). While intravenous insulin is typically used to treat acute metabolic abnormalities, the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous treatment can present a challenge. We hypothesize that co-administration of glargine, a subcutaneous long-acting insulin analog, during insulin infusion may facilitate a flexible and safe transition from intravenous to subcutaneous therapy.

Objective

To determine if the practice of administering subcutaneous glargine during intravenous insulin is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, or other complications in children with DKA.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients aged 2 to 21 years, presenting to our center with DKA between April 2012 and June 2014. Patients were divided into two groups: those co-administered subcutaneous glargine with intravenous insulin for over 4 hours (G+); and patients with less than 2hours of overlap (G-).

Results

We reviewed 149 DKA admissions (55G+, 94G-) from 129 unique patients. There was a similar incidence of hypoglycemia between groups (25% G+ vs 20% G-, P = 0.46). Hypokalemia (< 3.5mmol/L) occurred more frequently in the G+ group (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.7–7.0, P = 0.001). Cerebral edema occurred in 2/55 (3.6%) of the G- group and none of the G+ subjects.

Conclusion

Co-administration of glargine early in the course of DKA treatment is well tolerated and convenient for discharge planning; however, this approach is associated with an increased risk of hypokalemia.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^111Xg7Co]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although positive therapeutic responses to low-dose insulin therapy have been established in adult patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), none of these studies and guidelines for the treatment of DKA, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Consensus and Position Statements, has ever assessed or addressed the use of a continuous insulin infusion without a loading dose of insulin. In the current study, we used a dose of 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose instead of the recommended 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 with a loading dose. This insulin regimen was chosen because one study in a pediatric population used a dosing regimen of 0.1 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a loading dose that resulted in a total plasma insulin level of 50–60 μU/ml. This level proved to be too low for optimal suppression of hepatic glucose output and optimal glucose uptake. In addition, bolus doses of insulin may result in hypokalemia as well as other undesirable effects, especially when used in a routine hospital setting.

The efficacy of low-dose insulin without a priming dose has not been established in a prospective randomized study. Thus, the following questions have remained unanswered in the treatment of DKA: 1) Is an insulin bolus needed before a continuous insulin infusion? 2) What is the optimal insulin infusion rate if a bolus dose is not used? and 3) What is the dose response of continuous insulin infusion used alone in regard to decremental changes in glucose, metabolic parameters, cortisol, and free fatty acids (FFAs)? Therefore, we evaluated responses to three low-dose insulin regimens in 37 consecutive patients with DKA in a prospective randomized fashion to address these issues. Changes in plasma free insulin, serum potassium levels, and outcome recovery measures were assessed using a higher infusion dose (0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without a bolus dose) compared with a lower infusion dose (0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1) with and without a loading dose (0.07 unit/kg) of insulin.

### Clinical and cost implications of insulin degludec in patients with type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycemia: a quality improvement project [^111uAyZ8]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

To assess the real-life clinical benefits and cost implications of switching from another basal insulin to insulin degludec (degludec) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on basal-bolus regimens with recurrent hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness.

Methods

Patients with T1D who were aged ≥ 18 years, were on a basal-bolus regimen, and had switched to degludec plus bolus insulin for at least 6 months were included. Patients had to have switched to degludec as a result of recurrent hypoglycemia and/or hypoglycemia unawareness.

Results

Six months of follow-up data were available for 42 patients. At 6 months, there was a significant reduction in median (interquartile range) HbA 1c, from 8.6 (8.0–9.3)% [70 (64–78) mmol/mol] to 8.4 (7.9–8.9)% [68 (63–74) mmol/mol]; p < 0.05. Median daily basal insulin dose reduced significantly from 30.0 (14.7–45.0) to 25.5 (14.0–30.2) units; p < 0.0001. Data from hospital records showed reductions in the frequency of episodes of severe hypoglycemia from eight in the 6 months preceding degludec initiation to two in the 6 months following initiation. In the same period, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episodes reduced from two before degludec initiation to no episodes after initiation. No patients reported worsening treatment satisfaction after switching to degludec. Considering the reductions in the basal dose required and the frequency of hypoglycemia episodes, we estimate that switching such patients to degludec from other basal insulins could provide significant savings in direct healthcare costs.

Conclusion

In patients with T1D, switching to degludec was associated with an improvement in HbA 1c and reductions in basal insulin dose, severe hypoglycemia, and DKA. When used in appropriate patients, degludec could lead to significant cost savings.

### Clinical use of insulin glargine 300 U / mL in adults with type 2 diabetes: hypothetical case studies [^117UdEMR]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Possible Clinical Considerations for Christina

Since glycaemic control is essential to avoid the progression of kidney disease and Christina is already using metformin, a DPP4 inhibitor, and an SGLT2 inhibitor, a next step to intensify treatment could be a BI. Additionally, she may benefit from education on self-management of her diabetes, managing hypoglycaemia risk and dealing with hypoglycaemic events. Christina should be given clear 'sick day rules' regarding the use of metformin, SGLT2, and hypertension medication on days she feels unwell. This is particularly important as an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been reported in people prescribed both SGLT2 and insulin, with potential triggering factors including illness, reduced food or liquid intake, and a reduction in insulin doses. On such days, she might benefit from continued insulin treatment but increasing the frequency of blood glucose monitoring. If required, Christina's insulin dose could be adjusted. Because Gla-300 has been shown to provide similar glycaemic control and a lower risk of hypoglycaemia compared with the first-generation BI Gla-100, and potentially greater HbA 1c reductions without an increase in hypoglycaemia compared with IDeg-100, in individuals with renal impairment, initiating Gla-300 (at a dose of 0.2 unit/kg and titrated once weekly up to the target of fasting glycaemia) may be considered. Pragmatic fasting glucose (6–8 mmol/L [106–145 mg/dL]) and HbA 1c (7–7.5% [53–58 mmol/mol]) targets may be most appropriate, with an appropriate follow-up schedule.

† The primary endpoint subpopulation included participants with ongoing U300 therapy at month 6 with HbA 1c available both within 3 months pre‐initiation and at month 6 post‐initiation if they remained on U300 at month 6.

The primary endpoint was change in HbA 1c from baseline to month 6 after U300 initiation. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in HbA 1c from baseline to month 3 after U300 initiation, change in basal, prandial and total (basal and prandial combined) daily insulin doses from previous insulin therapy (baseline) to month 6 and from U300 initiation to month 6, and change in weight from baseline to month 6. Secondary safety endpoints, including the number of hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetic ketoacidosis episodes requiring Accident and Emergency department visits or hospitalization during the 6 months before and after initiation of U300, were analysed where documented. The following additional secondary endpoints were also extracted: reasons for switching or discontinuing previous diabetes therapy, and, where appropriate, for discontinuing treatment with U300; the proportion of participants meeting the optimal titration dose of U300 (defined as the dose when the titration process was halted when adequate HbA 1c or fasting plasma glucose levels were achieved) and the proportion meeting individualized HbA 1c targets during the observation period; diabetes education attendance; and change in insulin‐to‐carbohydrate ratio.

### Is a priming dose of insulin necessary in a low-dose insulin protocol for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis? [^114DnzPQ]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Although numerous studies have effectively used low-dose insulin in the treatment of DKA, there are no data from a prospective randomized study evaluating an insulin bolus (0.07 U/kg) compared with no bolus in conjunction with an infusion of low-dose insulin (0.07 vs. 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1). Previous studies have demonstrated that although 0.1 unit/h of insulin in patients with DKA can effectively inhibit lipolysis, this dose will only suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis by 50%.

We had previously shown that an intermediate dose of insulin of 0.1 unit · kg body weight −1 · h −1 (equivalent of 7 units/h of insulin in a 70-kg patient) by intravenous infusion was much more effective than a dose by the subcutaneous or intramuscular route. In these studies we used a priming dose. In addition, in a selected case report we have used as little as 6 units/h for a patient with modest DKA with further maintenance of euglycemia by 1–2 units/h. However, a bolus dose of insulin preceded the low-dose infusion. Furthermore, a priming dose has not been used for pediatric patients with DKA and has not been recommended in the pediatric age-group in the latest ADA consensus report. Deleterious outcomes with the use of bolus insulin in this group may include hypokalemia as well as possible cerebral edema.

In summary, our study suggests that the use of a bolus or priming dose of insulin is not necessary when an adequate continuous insulin infusion such as 0.14 unit · kg −1 · h −1 (or 10 units/h in a 70-kg patient) is used. However, a dose of 0.07 unit · kg −1 · h −1 without priming is not adequate to obtain desired changes in glucose without supplemental doses of insulin.

### Insulin glargin (Lantus) [^1161fQhk]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

2.3 Converting to LANTUS from other insulin therapies

If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate- or
long-acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS, the amount and timing of
shorter-acting insulins and doses of any oral anti-diabetic drugs may need to be
adjusted.

If transferring patients from once-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being
discontinued.
If transferring patients from twice-daily NPH insulin to once-daily LANTUS,
the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80% of the total NPH dose that is being
discontinued. This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Evaluation of an alternative approach to managing diabetic ketoacidosis: combination rapid-acting and basal subcutaneous insulin (CRABI-DKA) [^1117pEGW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although guidelines recognize the utility of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin regimens in the management of mild to moderate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the need to administer SQ insulin every 1–2 hours may discourage their use due to frequent lab testing and admission to higher level of care units.

Objective

The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the proportion of patients whose mild to moderate DKA resolved within 12 hours after receiving the new SQ insulin order set and the institution's intravenous (IV) insulin infusion order set.

Methods

The SQ order set included single doses of glargine (0.2 units/kg) and lispro (0.2 units/kg) upon therapy initiation, followed by lispro (0.1–0.2 units/kg) given every 3 hours until DKA resolution. The IV order set included a nurse-managed titratable infusion. Glucose and labs were checked every 3 hours in the SQ group, whereas glucose was checked hourly and labs were checked every 2 hours in the IV group. Patients were managed on units with a RN to patient ratio of 1:4–5 and 1:2–3 in the SQ and IV groups, respectively.

Results

The percentage of patients whose DKA resolved within 12 hours was 78% in the IV group and 90% in the SQ group (P = 0.1). The time to DKA resolution and rates of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia were comparable between the groups.

Conclusion and Relevance

Our study highlights the utility of combining rapid-acting and basal SQ insulin in the management of DKA and adds to the limited literature evaluating this approach.
